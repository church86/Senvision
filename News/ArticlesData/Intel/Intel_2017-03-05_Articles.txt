Paul Dillien, Principal, High Tech Marketing 3/6/2017 06:00 PM EST  1 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet From these numbers, it appears that FPGAs outgrew the overall semiconductor market (6% vs. 1.5%). I don't need the assistance of a firm of accountants to work out that Xilinx topped the rankings for FPGA billings during 2016. This is no surprise as Xilinx has been at the top for well over a decade now. As I discussed in my previous column (see Who Would Have Predicted So Much Programmability?), 2016 was a difficult year to call for semiconductor revenue, with the final consensus being that the market managed a modest increase. Having said this, the year saw lots of changes in FPGA-land. Most obvious is that Intel completed its acquisition of Altera at the end of 2015, meaning there is now a full year of numbers under the new ownership. Meanwhile, Microsemi was also on a buying spree. It absorbed PMC-Sierra with the deal completing in 2015, while later divesting its Remote Radio Head Business to MaxLinear and board-level products to Mercury System. And then there's Lattice Semiconductor, which had bought Silicon Image in 2015, and is now adding licensing and ASSP revenues to its numbers. (Lattice is currently waiting government agency review on a proposed take-over itself.) All this makes the task of figuring out exactly what billings should be specifically attributed to FPGAs substantially more complicated. With this in mind, my guesstimate of the final numbers is as follows: Guesstimate of final numbers x 1,000,000 (Source: Paul Dillien) In calculating these numbers, I have made adjustments for sales of items such as CPLDs, ASSPs, and power devices, but included software and IP. So, my take is that FPGAs outgrew the overall semiconductor market (6% vs. 1.5%). I didn't find any significant shift in market share, although Brian Krzanich (Intel CEO) claimed that Altera had taken share. In fact, what surprises me more is that Xilinx is not drawing away fast. The headline grabbing "largest-fastest-latest technology" parts are also the highest priced devices. Xilinx has beaten Altera to the last three nodes, with more than a one-year lead to 16/14nm technology. I expected this dominance would drive more design wins and therefore revenue. Admittedly, these high-end devices tend to be reserved for exotic applications in ASIC emulation, communications, or the military, but these are the families that move the needle the most. The design-in time for complex FPGAs is getting longer, but I'd expect ASIC emulation to be early to market. Emulator companies have to build a complex software environment that can partition ASIC design into manageable chunks and then pass the design to the vendor tools. This is no mean feat, but they don't need to verify a design and integrate it with software, as that is down to their end-customers. Communication applications are more involved, and take longer to get to production status, with military applications typically taking longer still. Thus, it may be that added revenue acceleration from Xilinx will begin to appear in the next few quarters. I guess that it is a bit early for Altera to reap many benefits of being part of Intel. Everyone knows that Intel is intent on retaining its supremacy in the Data Center by leveraging FPGAs for acceleration. The flip side could be that Altera has less attention for other markets -- only time will tell. I have a suspicion that my analysis of Microsemi underestimates its FPGA revenue, and the Lattice numbers may be too high. Neither company breaks out their numbers on a regular basis. Microsemi has a sharp focus on the security aspects of FPGAs in defence and aerospace which take a bit longer to design-in, but the projects stay in production for more years. Microsemi would benefit more than most from the proposed boost in the US defence budget. Some of the Lattice products get used in consumer applications, which are characterized by a rapid ramp up to high volume production with an equally steep decline. Lattice also has a strong offering in mid-range families. To round out the numbers, QuickLogic has seen a dramatic fall-off in revenue as its business is so heavily driven by a few projects in Samsung. The CEO still hopes that the company will break even by the end of 2017 to halt a long string of loss-making quarters. My guesstimate of "others" includes Achronix, which is still VC funded and so does not report its results. But wait... what is the winner of "Best FPGA of 2016"? Well everyone will have a different interpretation of what factors make a product "best," but -- for my money -- the most complex FPGA family rolled out last year has got to be the Virtex UltraScale+ family. That said, heaven only knows how long it will take a team to design and verify a device boasting 2.8M logic cells and 96 transceivers or the MPSoC with multiple processor cores supported by 600k Logic cells. What about you? Do you agree with my suggestion, or do you have your own suggestion for Best FPGA of 2016"?

Mac Anytime Soon An analysis of Intel's three-year financial guidance suggests that it expects to stay in Apple's notebook computers over that time frame. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 3:30PM Rumors are swirling that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may be on the verge of losing its spot as the supplier of the processors that power Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products. Hypotheses range from Apple's designing its own chip for the Mac to speculation that Apple will use chips from alternative processor vendors. However, I believe that based on Intel's recent commentary at its Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlikely that the company is going to lose these orders. Image source: Apple. Intel's CCG financial guidance If Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor orders, this would manifest as a reduction in the company's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue and operating profits. If we estimate that Apple pays an average of $200 for Intel processors and related components, then that's $4 billion in revenue that could potentially be at risk. Put another way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop significantly), then Intel could potentially see more than 10% of its CCG revenue vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world, but it's the sort of thing that would sting. At its investor day, Intel said that it expects its revenue in CCG to decline at a "low-single-digits" pace -- or an average of 1%-3% annually over the next three years. If we compound the low and high ends of that range, Intel is planning for between a 3% and a 9% decline in CCG revenue from 2016 levels by the end of 2019. Here's a translation to hard dollar figures: Intel is planning for CCG revenue to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3 billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the midpoint. At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in his investor meeting presentation that he expects the PC processor total addressable market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2 billion down from where the company pegged the total addressable market in 2016. Putting the numbers together If Intel expects the PC processor total addressable market to drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is planning for "low-single-digit" declines in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion decline at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the company is guiding for significant personal-computer processor revenue share loss. Now, it's worth noting that forecasts this long out aren't going to be perfect, but Intel likely has visibility into the personal-computer design win pipelines at its various customers, including Apple. If Apple were preparing to shift away from Intel processors for Macs released over the next couple of years, then Intel would likely be aware of that imminent shift and should have included that expectation in its multi-year forecast. Based on this analysis, I don't think Intel investors ought to worry too much about Apple's switching away from Intel processors anytime soon in its MacBook or iMac products. Over the long term, however, anything is possible, so Intel will have to make sure that it has an increasingly compelling product pipeline to keep Apple interested. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 3:00PM At this point, it's well-known that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is planning to release a fourth wave of products built using its 14-nanometer chip manufacturing technology, as the company's upcoming 10-nanometer technology continues to face yield and, therefore, cost structure challenges. The good news is that this fourth wave of 14-nanometer products is expected to feature both implementation and manufacturing technology improvements that should enable both higher performance and lower power consumption -- something that Intel's major customers (i.e., large personal computer vendors) will certainly appreciate. Intel's Fab 32. Image source: Intel. Here, I'd like to go over one additional way that Intel can improve the power efficiency of its next-generation platforms. Migrating the PCH to 14-nano tech Every Intel Core processor requires a separate support chip, known as a Platform Controller Hub (PCH), to function. Here's how Intel describes a PCH, also known as a chipset, in its most recent form 10-K filing (opens in PDF): A chipset sends data between the microprocessor and input, display, and storage devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drive or solid-state drive, and optical disc drives. Chipsets extend the audio, video, and other capabilities of many systems and perform essential logic functions, such as balancing the performance of the system and removing bottlenecks. The PCH can either be found as a separate chip mounted on the motherboard of the computer or it can reside on the same CPU package as the main processor itself. In applications that are more limited in power and space (e.g., thin and light notebooks and 2-in-1 notebook/tablet hybrids), the PCH is generally located on the CPU package, whereas less power/space sensitive applications (e.g., desktop computers) usually have the PCH as a stand-alone chip on the motherboard. The PCH for Intel platforms is usually built on manufacturing technology that's at least a generation behind what the main processor is using. These older manufacturing technologies are utilized for both cost reasons (older manufacturing technologies tend to be inexpensive) as well as to keep factories tooled to produce older-generation technologies busy (factory underutilization can hurt a company's gross profit margins). CPU generation Westmere (2010) Sandy Bridge (2011) Ivy Bridge (2012) Haswell (2013) Broadwell (2014) Skylake (2015) Kaby Lake (2016) CPU mfg. tech 32nm 32nm 22nm 22nm 14nm 14nm 14nm PCH mfg. tech 65nm 65nm 65nm 32nm 32nm 22nm 22nm Data source: Intel ARK. In the table above, you can see that Intel used its older 65-nanometer technology to build its PCH chips for years. It then skipped its 45-nanometer technology for PCH chips altogether before migrating its PCH chips to 32-nanometer for the Haswell/Broadwell generations. Then in 2015, it moved the PCH to its much more efficient 22-nanometer technology. These migrations to new manufacturing technologies helped the company to both reduce the power that its PCH chips consumed while at the same time allowing it to add more features and functionality. To that end, it could make sense for Intel to migrate the PCH chips for its next-generation processor families from the 22-nanometer technology that it uses today to its 14-nanometer technology. Do the logistics work out? It may seem like a good idea from a product capability perspective for Intel to build its next PCH chips on 14-nanometer technology rather than on 22-nanometer technology, but for this to be feasible, it needs to have planned its manufacturing capacity on various technology generations around such a transition. In particular, for this to be feasible, Intel needs to have significantly reduced the amount of 22-nanometer capacity that it has online right now, as those factories are being used to crank out the PCH chips for Intel's current notebook and desktop personal computer platforms. It also needs to have enough 14-nanometer capacity in place to handle the increased demand for 14-nanometer chips that such a migration would entail. I think that both conditions have been met. For example, Intel's Fab 28 in Israel is expected to be upgraded from being able to manufacture chips on the company's 22-nanometer technology to being its first 10-nanometer technology. This upgrade is likely to mean a significant reduction in its total 22-nanometer chip capacity. At the same time, BlueFin Research Partners recently said that the company's Fab 24 in Ireland has "reached full 14[-nanometer] capacity" and that Intel is "increasing their [sic] 14[-nanometer] product mix another 4-5% in the June quarter" at its Fab 32 in Arizona. (Fab 32 currently produces chips on the company's 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer technologies.) So, by the end of the year, Intel is likely to have significantly less 22-nanometer capacity in place, while it should have more 14-nanometer capacity as well as some 10-nanometer capacity online. Indeed, as it begins to shift its personal computer processors over to 10-nanometer at the end of the year (though the big shift away from 14-nanometer processors toward 10-nanometer processors isn't expected to happen until the second half of 2018), it'll need to keep its significant 14-nanometer capacity busy. Migrating the PCH chips to 14-nanometer in the second half of 2017 seems like a good way to both improve its next-generation products while also keeping its 14-nanometer production lines full.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The New Features Of The Linux 4.11 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Software on 5 March 2017. Page 1 of 1. 20 Comments If all goes according to plan, Linus Torvalds will have announced the first release candidate of the upcoming Linux 4.11 kernel before the day is through. The Linux 4.11-rc1 release also marks the end of the feature merge window for this kernel cycle. So with that said, here is a look at the new features of the Linux 4.11 kernel that I have been covering through closely watching the Git repository and mailing list over the past two weeks. Highlights of the Linux 4.11 from our original coverage of the kernel developments this cycle include: DRM / Graphics: - AMDGPU power management continues to mature with Linux 4.11. Likely due to TTM memory management improvements, Linux 4.11 is faster for RADV Vulkan. - Intel has enabled frame-buffer compression by default for Skylake hardware and newer. - Intel's DRM driver also now handles DisplayPort MST audio. They added multi-stream transport capabilities a few kernels ago while this work is about allowing audio for DP MST displays. - Intel also has initial Geminilake graphics support. Geminilake SoCs will be shipping later this year. - The Nouveau DRM driver went through a Secure Boot code refactoring and based off that work NVIDIA even released the signed Pascal firmware for Pascal consumer cards along with code for bringing up accelerated support for the GeForce GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080. But that accelerated Pascal support isn't landing until Linux 4.12. - TinyDRM was merged for helping to make DRM drivers for small displays/devices. - ASPEED AST2500 display support. - Various other DRM driver and core updates. - Minor work done on FBDEV. Processors: - Intel's Turbo Boost Max 3.0 is better supported and will allow this boosting feature to operate on more systems/motherboards. - Support for a variety of new ARM SoCs and boards like the Banana Pi M64, SolidRun MACCHIATOBin, BCM958712DxXMC NorthStar2 developer board, and HiSilicon Kirin960/Hi3660 and HiKey960.

Technology 1 0 0 March 5, 2017 iMac 2017 Updates: AMD RYZEN 7 Chips To Beat Out Intel’s Kaby Lake Chips? Simon Alvarez There is probably no other product in Apple’s lineup that is in dire need of an update than the iMac. With marginal upgrades being rolled out for years, the time is high for the tech giant to focus its efforts on making its iconic all-in-one desktop computer competitive once more. Considering the rumors about the 2017 iMac, however, it appears that Apple might finally be putting some real effort on improving and updating its excellent, albeit neglected machine. Speculations are high that the iMac 2017 would feature Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors, which would give Apple’s all-in-one enough horsepower to make it extremely competitive in the market. However, AMD’s recent launch of its top-tier RYZEN 7 chips might put a damper on Intel and Apple’s partnership, according to a report from Architosh. This is due to the AMD RYZEN 7 series’ formidable performance per watt, with the chipmaker’s RYZEN 7 1800X setting a new record in benchmark tests. What was particularly remarkable, however, was how powerful AMD’s chip was per watt, which means that the RYZEN 7 was not only a capable processor, it was highly efficient as well. This particular combination of power and efficiency, in turn, makes the RYZEN 7 chips perfect for Apple’s computers. https://t.co/ZMcF2n9ErK : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017 Definitely On Apple's Cards; Here's Why It Should Be Worth….. pic.twitter.com/BWySGScbKg — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 27, 2017 The RYZEN 7 1800X chip that AMD tested was compared to Intel’s top-tier Core i7 processor, which is a formidable chip in its own right. While Intel’s Core i7 chip featured a TDP (thermal design point) of 140W, AMD’s RYZEN 7 1800X consumed a measly 95W. Compared to Intel’s chip, AMD’s processor was more than 30 percent more power-efficient while delivering even slightly better performance. This is not all, however, as the AMD RYZEN 7 1800X processor that was tested was only being sold by the chipmaker for a very reasonable price of $499, far less than the $1,089 demanded by Intel’s Core i7 chip. With its lower price, better performance and far better power efficiency in mind, there is a pretty good chance that Apple would break away from tradition and partner up with AMD for the iMac 2017’s processors instead. After all, being an all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac 2017 would benefit from low power consumption. Of course, these are but speculations for now, especially since Apple is yet to announce which processor it would utilize in the iMac 2017. Thus, it is best to take these speculations with a grain of salt. For now, however, it appears than AMD’s RYZEN 7 series is the best bet for the Cupertino-based tech giant. https://t.co/iOu7lgdAXp : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017: Apple Hard At Work To Deliver Unparalleled Desktop With Performance; Q1 2017 … pic.twitter.com/EYpmP4w3yL — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 12, 2017 Overall, rumors about the iMac 2017 are abounding, with speculations stating that the upcoming all-in-one would feature powerful internals that could rival the best in the industry. A PC Advisor report even stated that a Best Buy leak from last year has teased the specs of the iMac 2017 through a mistaken listing. Though the information displayed by Best Buy might have just been an honest mistake from the retailer, there is a good chance that some of the information featured in the listing are accurate. The Best Buy iMac leak listed the next-generation device as a powerhouse machine with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive. Coupled with a 27-inch 5K display, the iMac that was teased in the leak was pretty much a monster. The price of the device, listed at $3,199, also seemed to be in line with previous pricing conventions followed by the Cupertino-based tech giant. Official details about the iMac 2017 remain scarce, with Apple being highly secretive about the updated all-in-one’s progress. Nevertheless, expectations are high for the next iteration of the iconic machine. After all, with Apple seemingly preparing to retire its ubiquitous Mac Pro, there is a need for a powerful iMac 2017 to take its place. If rumors prove true about the upcoming all-in-one, the iMac 2017 might just be this year’s desktop computer to beat.

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook for 2017, and cover its likely design, tech specs, new features and UK pricing by Lewis Painter | 06 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the new 12-inch MacBook for 2017 be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? Apple released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, and almost a year on, we're looking to the future and what we could expect from this year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple didn't update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, which saw the launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Following that event Apple discontinued the 11in MacBook Air, a move that suggests that the 12-inch MacBook may soon replace the Air line-up as Apple's consumer-oriented Mac laptops, although the models are likely to see a price cut before that would happen. Read more: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals UK New MacBook 2017 release date UK: When is the new 12in MacBook coming out? When will Apple release the next-generation 12in MacBook for 2017? Will it launch at a spring Apple event? Apple launched the 2015 version of the 12in MacBook at a spring event that year, but that is no indication that Apple will do the same in 2017. The 2016 MacBook wasn't unveiled at Apple's 2016 spring event (which saw Apple reveal the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps). Instead, Apple quietly introduced the new MacBook a few weeks later in April 2016. We anticipate that the 2017 MacBook will see a similarly quiet launch. Nor do we expect to see a refreshed range in April to mark the current model's one year anniversary. We don't expect to see a 12-inch MacBook until the summer (June, or maybe July to coincide with WWDC). If Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is correct (as reported by MacRumors in January 2017) in his prediction that a new 12in MacBook is set to go into production in early Q2 2017 - April or thereabouts, a June or July launch could be feasible.  New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? It certainly looks like the MacBook Air's days are numbered. After its October 2016 event Apple removed the 11in MacBook Air from sale along with the legacy MacBook Pro with SuperDrive, which had been lurking in the Apple Store for some years. While the 13in MacBook Air remains, it hasn't been significantly updated since March 2015, apart from Apple's decision to offer as standard, 8GB RAM for all MacBook Air models (given that the range was so hampered by its 4GB RAM that we recommended anyone purchasing the computer to upgrade the RAM at point of purchase, this update was rightfully celebrated and long overdue). Another reason we may soon see the demise of the MacBook Air is that Apple's MacBook Air design is not as groundbreaking now as it was eight years ago when it launched. When the MacBook Air first arrived, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name, but the MacBook and MacBook Pro now outshine it in those areas. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. In terms of weight the MacBook Air weighs 1.35kg while the MacBook Pro now weighs only a fraction more at 1.37kg and the MacBook weighs just 0.92kg. If Apple continues to sell the MacBook Air maybe it should drop Air from it's name. It's not all bad though. The MacBook Air is both more powerful and £300 cheaper than the MacBook. It is the only Mac laptop that is available for less than £1000. For that reason we do still recommend it, although you might do better buying a refurbished MacBook Pro if you need a Mac that costs less than £1000. Given that the MacBook Air is Apple's lowest cost Mac laptop you'd think it would be its most popular model, and yet, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (back in 2015), the 12in MacBook is Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro. See more MacBook Air rumours here. So we think that the 13in MacBook Air will be replaced, but we don't think that will happen before the price of the MacBook and potentially the entry-level MacBook Pro, is reduced. History indicates that this will be the case: the last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was when the MacBook Air launched alongside the old white and black MacBooks. Those models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. We hope that the same will happen, with new 12in MacBook models being priced lower than they are currently and replacing the 13in MacBook Air as the entry level MacBook, while the more advanced specs will be provided by the 13in MacBook Pro. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive and underpowered. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Price While we're still some way ahead of the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it's a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. However, there is a possibility that Apple will reduce the price of the MacBook in 2017, especially if it discontinues the MacBook Air. With the demise of the 11in MacBook Air came a hike to the point of entry for consumers wishing to buy a Mac laptop. The entry price of Apple's MacBook Air laptop is now £949 (thanks in part to Apple's post-Brexit £100 increase, the model had previously cost £849). Before Apple discontinued it, an 11in MacBook Air had been priced at £749. In comparison, the entry-level MacBook Pro, with 2.0GHz dual-core processor and 256GB SSD costs £1,449, while the entry-level 12in MacBook with 1.1GHz m3 chip is £1,249. There is certainly a place for a lower cost Mac laptop and it would seem that for now the MacBook Air will fulfil that role. However, a reduction in price for the MacBook is possible, bringing it into line with the price of the MacBook Air currently. It's interesting to note here that the US prices, less influenced by currency fluctuations, are as follows:  12in MacBook - from $1,299 (£1,249) 13in MacBook Air - from $999 (£949) 13in MacBook Pro - from $1,499  (£1,449) If you ignore the somewhat confusing currently translations (it's not entirely fair to convert dollars to pounds as there is also VAT to add to the US prices, and there are other 'costs of doing business' to take account of - at least that's Apple's excuse) the price differences are roughly the same, with the MacBook being £300/$300 more than the Air, and the Pro being £200/$200 more than the MacBook. Reduce the MacBook price by £300/$300 and you have a new entry-level price that's below the magic £1000/$1000 mark. We don't expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air from the line up until it is willing to shave this much off the price of the MacBook. If it was to do so expect the entry-level MacBook to offer much slower processors and probably less storage than it does currently. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Processors The new MacBooks are likely to have Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Kaby Lake is the generation of chips after Skylake, and it offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. There is another interesting possibility with regards to processors. Back in September 2016 Dutch-language site Techtastic spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. The discovery was thought to indicate that Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its MacBooks. As it happens that's exactly what it did a month later with the launch of the MacBook Pro. In that case the chip powers the Touch Bar, but future ARM chips are being developed to look after other functions. The rumours continue: a Bloomberg report from February 2017 claims that Apple is working on a chip, codenamed T310, that will handle the "Power Nap"  functionality and improve the battery life of MacBooks. Whether this chip will end up in the MacBook remains to be seen. We think it's unlikely to make its debut on the next model as Apple is likely to save it for the next model of MacBook Pro. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook 2017 release date UK: RAM Currently the MacBook ships with 8GB RAM as standard. There is no option to increase RAM at point of sale, and the Mac is not user upgradable. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the new MacBooks will offer a 16GB of RAM option, up from 8GB of RAM in the 2016 models. Apple could upgrade the two current models to 16GB RAM and keep a 8GB option as a lower-priced model. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Design Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won't be seeing huge physical changes in 2017. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to sit alongside the Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Apple seems intent on marketing the MacBook alongside the iPhone and iPad, given the matching colour choices. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don't expect that to change dramatically in future. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Bigger Screen One possible change that we might see concerns the screen size. At present the MacBook is available in one size: 12 inches, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that a 15-inch model will be unveiled later this year. In a research note Kuo mentions a 15in MacBook that he believes will go into production in quarter four of 2017. However, this model is likely to be a MacBook Pro as it is said to feature 32GB RAM, so is definitely not the MacBook. Nevertheless, adding a bigger model to the range would make sense if Apple is planning to phase out the MacBook Air. Then Apple would offer 13in and 15in MacBook Pro models as well as 12in and 15in MacBook models (or perhaps 12in and 14in MacBook models as it used to do). New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Ports Will the new MacBook support Thunderbolt? When the MacBook launched in 2015 it featured USB Type-C and little else. While USB Type-C now supports Thunderbolt type 3 (which as exactly the same port), this early port didn't. Described by many as the one port to rule them all, the USB Type-C port and the Thunderbolt 3 port is identical, so any device using either standard can be plugged into it. Rather than suggesting that USB-C means death to Thunderbolt, it rather suggests that the standard has been given new life, indeed, now in addition to the MacBook Pro, many PCs support Thunderbolt too. There's good reason to support Thunderbolt 3. The standard allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of Thunderbolt 2 (and it's backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 2). Whether a MacBook user really needs Thunderbolt is another question though, with it being a standard utilised in video production and other high power applications.  Nevertheless, we expect that the new MacBook will feature the new USB Type-C port and therefore it will support Thunderbolt 3. Given Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since Thunderbolt's introduction in 2011 it is unlikely to fall out of favour with the company. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. Another reason Apple could turn it's back on Thunderbolt is if it stopped using Intel processors in its Macs. Intel is the company behind Thunderbolt and it requires an Intel processor to work... It's not a completely crazy idea, there have been rumours that Apple could ditch Intel in favour of its own chip production. Indeed, the company is already said to be working on its own chips with ARM, these chips would take care of certain functions, just like the Apple T1 chip in the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: LTE Will the 2017 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if this patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satellite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it would tie the user down to a particular carrier.  New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Keyboard Will the 2017 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? According to a 9to5Mac report in October 2016, Apple has been in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Trackpad Will the 2017 MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if another patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was approved in May 2016, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad. Thinking of buying a Mac? Read our Which Mac? Best Mac buyers guide.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge. Host: Larissa Shapiro Questions: In advance submit questions here During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #mozSS Transcript November 16: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation, with Ashley Good, Fail Forward Location: Mozilla SF + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, November 16 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Failure: The Hard Part about Innovation When you start a new job or project, you envision exciting things you and your team will accomplish together. When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 8:45AM At Mobile World Congress, China-based mobile chip vendor Spreadtrum announced a new chip dubbed the SC9861G-IA, targeted at the "global mid-level and premium smartphone market." The chip is unique for a couple of reasons. The first is that it uses eight of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Atom-based processor cores codenamed Airmont. The second is that it is built by Intel using its 14-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Spreadtrum says that the chip "is scheduled to go into mass production in the second quarter of 2017," which suggests availability in shipping devices at some point in the second half of 2017.  Image source: Spreadtrum via PCQuest. Interestingly, this product isn't being pitched as a co-branded/co-developed chip from both Spreadtrum and Intel; instead, it is pitched as a Spreadtrum product that is manufactured by Intel's contract chip manufacturing division, known as Intel Custom Foundry (ICF). In this column, I'd like to do two things: what this chip could mean for Intel and what the potential long-term implications of this announcement could be for both companies. Near term? Don't expect significant success In the near term, I doubt that this chip will find significant success in either the mid-range or premium smartphone markets. The processor cores are quite slow currently for a mid-range smartphone, let alone a premium product. To put this into perspective, the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 652 achieves a single-core score of 1467 in the popular Geekbench 4 performance test. Spreadtrum says that the Airmont CPU core inside the SC9861G-IA runs at 2GHz. Based on how other Airmont-based chips perform in Geekbench 4, the Spreadtrum chip is likely to be way behind the competing Snapdragon 652 in per-core performance. From a user-experience perspective, the Spreadtrum chip looks as though it'll be markedly inferior to the competing Snapdragon 652 chip. In addition to being slower than the competition, at least in CPU tasks, I'd expect that this Spreadtrum chip will be less desirable to potential customers because it runs Intel Architecture (a.k.a. x86) rather than the ARM architecture. Although Intel invested significantly in bringing up the software ecosystem around Intel Architecture, it still doesn't appear to be as robust as the incumbent ARM ecosystem, which could lead to app compatibility and/or performance issues. I just don't know why a smartphone vendor would pick this chip over something from Qualcomm, MediaTek, or even from elsewhere in Spreadtrum's portfolio. Taking a longer-term view At the Intel Developer Forum last year, Intel announced that it had inked a deal with ARM Holdings to make its intellectual property available for customers designing chips to be manufactured by ICF. I suspect that Spreadtrum will cease using Intel's Atom processor cores for future ICF-built chips going forward. Instead, I expect Spreadtrum to use ARM cores optimized for Intel's manufacturing technology. If Spreadtrum can, using ARM technology, fully leverage Intel's manufacturing technology to build great mobile processors, then that could ultimately prove to be a long-term "win" for both Spreadtrum and Intel. Intel would win because Spreadtrum is a reasonably successful mobile processor vendor, and if it can get Spreadtrum to move significant volumes of its products into Intel's manufacturing plants, then that's revenue and profit upside for Intel. Spreadtrum could win if Intel's claims that its manufacturing technology is superior to competing technologies hold up and ultimately allow Spreadtrum to build better and more cost-effective chips than it could have using alternative technologies.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Matthew Jones, 49, experienced high altitude sickness close to Base Camp and died on Friday. A post-mortem has been conducted and his body will be returned to Australia once the required paperwork is complete with the help of embassy staff and friends who were trekking with him, Pardip Karki, manager of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal, told Reuters. The father of two from Melbourne has been fondly remembered by colleagues at tech company Intel. Managing director Kate Burleigh said in a statement that Mr Jones had worked at Intel for 16 years and tributes from customers and colleagues he knew around the world were flowing in. "Matt was truly one of a kind who will be greatly missed. The Intel team is mourning the loss of our friend and colleague," she said. Mr Jones was travelling in a group of 18 people heading for Khumjung when he became sick on Thursday night and decided to stay behind in a hotel, a spokesman for Eastern Region Police in Nepal said on Monday. "He was having problems due to the altitude, that's why he didn't go on," the spokesman told AAP. "Early in the morning he was found dead in his room." Ms Burleigh said Mr Jones had a highly successful career at Intel where he was a leader across many sectors of the business, most recently in telecommunications. "He was a unique character and will be remembered for not only his great work ethic and leadership but also his sharp wit and passion for good wine, fancy dress parties, history, travel and 'vexillology' (the study of flags)," she said. Intel said it was providing support to the wife and children of Mr Jones. "We ask that you respect the family's wishes and let them mourn in private at this time." The Everest base camp is more than 5km above sea level and climbers rest there for several days to acclimatise before tackling the mountain, but Mr Jones had not been planning to go higher. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular advice over the Australian man's death.

Here's our AMD Ryzen 1800X review. For value, the Ryzen 7 1800X cannot be beaten right now By Jim Martin | 06 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Specifications 14nm x86 processor Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base clock 4.0GHz boost clock (4.1GHz with XFR) 95W TDP See full specs Expert's Rating Price when reviewed £499, US$499 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review Although AMD never stopped selling processors for desktop PCs, it has felt an awful lot like it did for the last few years. Intel has so dominated the market at all levels, from budget machines right up to the most expensive enthusiast rigs, that there was really no point in choosing a PC with an AMD processor. We won't go into it here, but you can read more about AMD's history. But with the launch of Ryzen, that has all changed. We’re reviewing the range-topping 1800X here, but there are two other Ryzen 7 chips on sale now, and two Ryzen 5 chips which are launching in a couple of months. See also: Ryzen release date, price and specifications AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Price Here’s how the range looks at the moment, but AMD will add more models over time. You can buy the three Ryzen 7 chips from Overclockers UK. Most come with one of AMD's three new CPU coolers, but not the top two models. It's assumed you will have your own already, or want to use a high-end liquid-cooling system. It's worth noting, too, that AM3 and FM2+ "clip style" coolers are compatible with Socket AM4. Product Line Model Cores / Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) TDP (Watts) Included Cooler Price Ryzen 7 1800X 8 / 16 3.6 4.0 95 N/A £499 / $499 Ryzen 7 1700X 8 / 16 3.4 3.8 95 N/A £399 / $399 Ryzen 7 1700 8 / 16 3.0 3.7 65 Wraith Spire £329 / $329 Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 3.6 4.0 TBC Wraith Spire TBC Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 3.5 3.7 TBC Wraith Spire TBC Note: These chips are not APUs like AMD’s other A-series CPUs. This means that they do not have built-in graphics chips. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Features and design Four years ago AMD realised it needed to completely redesign its CPU in order to compete with Intel, and began developing what we now know as the ‘Zen’ architecture. The Ryzen 7 1800X is the current flagship consumer CPU based on Zen, and is an eight-core processor that runs at 3.6GHz (up to 4.1GHz with a suitable cooler – more on this later). AMD has gone down the same route as Intel and now uses Simultaneous MultiThreading (SMT) rather than the Clustered MultiThreading (CMT) that its older processors used. We’re not going to go into the deep technical details here because what really matters is whether the Ryzen 1800X is good value, and whether you should buy one. But before we do that, we need to explain a few other things about the new features AMD has put into Ryzen. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Socket AM4 First, Ryzen is not going to fit into any existing AMD motherboard. That’s hardly surprising, given that this is truly a “clean-sheet” design. So you’ll need a new motherboard which has an AM4 socket with 1331 pins. AMD says you’ll be able to upgrade processors with an AM4 socket until 2020, barring any technology advances which require a physical change to the pinouts, such as PCI Express 4 or DDR5 RAM. Ryzen is more of a system-on-a-chip (SoC) like smartphone processors, which means the actual chipset on an AM4 motherboard is relatively basic. There are eight to choose between, but the most common are likely to be the B350 and X370. The former is the more mainstream offering which allows overclocking, while the latter is aimed at enthusiasts who want the maximum number of features on their board. These new boards, such as the Asus Crosshair VI Hero X370 that we used for testing the 1800X, have the latest features such as PCIe gen 3, an M.2 slot for the latest NVMe SSDs, USB 3.1 gen 2 ports and support for DDR4 RAM. Ryzen CPUs have a total of 24 PCIe lanes. This isn’t as many as Intel’s top chipsets offer, but it’s enough. 16 lanes are dedicated to the graphics card, and the rest are for the motherboard maker to use for I/O and things such as NVMe SSDs. If you do go for an X370 motherboard and want to run dual graphics cards, note that each will have to use 8 PCIe lanes. Similarly, if you must use multiple NVMe drives simultaneously, you may be better off with Intel’s Broadwell-E and the X99 chipset. But you’d better have deep pockets, as such as setup does not come cheap. This, ultimately, is where Ryzen delivers its knock-out blow: for the vast majority of PC enthusiasts, the Ryzen 7 chips offer plenty of performance, along with great efficiency, at a much lower price. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: SenseMI One of Ryzen’s really clever features is a grid of super-accurate sensors across the silicon which act much like the telemetry on an F1 car. They feed back power and temperature data so that the chip can adjust its speed based on conditions. SenseMI is the name for a group of five technologies which AMD says ultimately give Ryzen the edge. Precision Boost: Using the sensors, the chip can finely adjust its speed on the fly in 25MHz increments. It will increase or decrease speed based on temperature, load and current. Pure Power: Similar to the boosting, the same sensors are used to adjust the CPU’s power consumption for a given task. Since each chip is very slightly different from every other at the silion level, the data from the sensors means each chip can optimise its power usage individually. Extended Frequency Range (XFR): Only Ryzen chips with model numbers ending in ‘X’ support XFR. This is basically automatic overclocking and allows the chip to boost beyond the usual top frequency if the data from the sensors show that there is ‘headroom’ to run faster. Essentially, if you have a good cooling system which keeps temperatures down, you’ll see an extra 100MHz, so 4.1GHz instead of 4GHz with a Ryzen 1800X. Neural Net Prediction: This is an artificial intelligence neural network that learns to predict what an application will do based on past runs, and queues up instructions so they can be executed quicker. Smart Prefetch: Pretty much the same as neural net prediction, but for data rather than CPU instructions. Sophisticated learning algorithms track software behaviour to anticipate what data will be needed, and load it into the Ryzen’s caches so it’s ready when called for. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X review: Performance But enough about features and technology. The bottom line is: how fast does it go? The short answer is fast, and certainly in line with AMD’s claims. Intel hasn’t released an eight-core Kaby Lake processor yet, which is why the main comparison is with the Core i7-6900K. The i7-7700K is the top Kaby Lake chip right now, and that’s a quad-core, eight-thread chip. It’s also the same price as the Ryzen 7 1700, which has the full complement of eight cores, 16 threads. The 1800X isn’t always faster than the i7-6900K, so in pure performance terms, AMD hasn’t conclusively stolen the crown from Intel. But if you look not at absolute speed, but bang-per-buck, you’re getting what amounts to basically the same performance in most scenarios for half the cash. This fact will undoubtedly force Intel to make big price cuts to its six- and eight-core CPUs, and we’re already hearing rumours that it has already done so. We’ll have to wait a bit until we see retailers passing on the savings, though. Single-core performance isn’t where Ryzen’s strength lies: it’s roughly on a par with Intel Haswell chips, but as soon as you use an application or game which can use Ryzen’s large number of cores, it accelerates away from any same-price chip from Intel (and matches those costing a lot more). You can see this illustrated in the Geekbench results below - an overclocked Core i5-7600K is faster than a stock Ryzen 1800X in the single-core test, but the Ryzen kills it in multi-core. Also, note the massive lead that Ryzen holds in the Cinebench rendering test. The graphs below show how the Ryzen 1800X stacks up against the most recent Kaby Lake PC we've reviewed, the Overclockers UK Titan Bayonet. This uses an i5-7600K overclocked to 4.7GHz on air and a GTX 1070. Overall, it's a similar price (around £1600) to our Ryzen test rig, hence the comparison. Note that our rig had a GTX 1080, but the results below focus on CPU, not GPU performance, of course. Our colleagues at our sister title PC World benchmarked two Ryzen chips against Intel's top chips (the systems here are fitted with 32GB of RAM and GTX 1080 graphics cards - read more and see more test results here). Most of the results above are self-explanatory, and are what we would expect. However, in many games right now it seems that you will get better performance if you have a high-end Intel chip. AMD says this is down to the fact that games are currently optimised for Intel processors, but developers are working to optimise for Ryzen as quickly as they can to take full advantage of the extra cores and threads on offer.  But, you have to bear in mind that the Ashes of the Singularity test was run at 1080p at low quality settings in order to look at CPU performance and take the GPU out of the equation. In the real world, you're not going to do that, and the Tomb Raider results - at Ultimate quality - show that all you'll get very similar results regardless of which of these four CPUs you have. Overclocking In theory you should be able to get even more performance for free by overclocking a Ryzen chip. This is something AMD has been keen to point out at every opportunity: all Ryzen chips are unlocked and, when paired with the right motherboard, can be overclocked at will. There’s even a new tool, Ryzen Master, which you can download and use to set up four different overclocking profiles. Of course, you’ll have to agree to the big disclaimer that you’ll void your warranty if you do overclock as there is potential to damage the chip and other hardware if you don’t know what you’re doing (or if you push frequencies or voltages too high). We couldn’t do much with our air-cooled system, being supplied with a Noctua NH-U12S by AMD for testing. Still, we did see XFR in action on occasion, with the frequency jumping to 4.1GHz in CPU-Z while temperatures were low enough. However, the chip was reluctant to go much beyond this and we suspect you’ll need a liquid cooling system to get the most from Ryzen. It runs fairly hot even when idling, sitting around 60 degrees C with the Noctua, and an additional 120mm fan extracting hot air from the case. Intel chips – in PCs we’ve reviewed recently – appear to be more accommodating to overclocking on air cooling. AMD Ryzen 1800X: Specs 14nm x86 processor Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base clock 4.0GHz boost clock (4.1GHz with XFR) 95W TDP 14nm x86 processor Eight cores, 16 threads 3.6GHz base clock 4.0GHz boost clock (4.1GHz with XFR) 95W TDP OUR VERDICT Right now, the Ryzen 7 1800X is proof that AMD is back on form. Although it hasn’t knocked Intel off the top spot for outright performance – and certainly not for single-core applications - it has set new standards for value and efficiency. It will surely prompt game and app developers to optimise their software for eight-core chips, and there is certainly more performance to come from Ryzen. If you’re thinking of buying or building a high-end PC right now, a Ryzen 7 chip is the obvious choice.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print OBAMACARE REPEAL BILL COMING THIS WEEK – GOP struggles with Trump’s wiretapping tweets – MONTANA DEMS PICK CANDIDATE IN ZINKE SPECIAL – Progressives ping Senate Dems on Gorsuch fight 03/06/17 07:57 AM EST By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) With assists from Kevin Robillard and Daniel Lippman Story Continued Below WORKIN’ 9 TO 5 (AND THEN SOME) — House Republicans are expected to release the text of their Obamacare repeal bill early this week, moving quickly after weeks of conservative backlash over plans to include refundable tax credits that GOP hardliners have panned as entitlements by another name. GOP leaders are hoping to get the bill through committee and to the House floor before the end of this month, giving the Senate enough time to take up the proposal before the Easter recess in mid-April. House Republican leadership aides are presenting a unified front with the White House, citing weekend work to smooth out differences, including a Friday staff meeting at the White House led by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney and a Saturday call with House Speaker Paul Ryan, E&C Chairman Greg Walden, Mulvaney, HHS Secretary Tom Price and others. Go-to guy: Mulvaney, a founding House Freedom Caucus member, is being described by some as the White House’s point man on the Obamacare repeal, supplanting HHS Secretary Price (See this Trump deep dive from the Washington Post’s Philip Rucker, Robert Costa and Ashley Parker: http://wapo.st/2mtX1Dn.) Giving Mulvaney a lead role could help placate angry conservatives who have promised to vote against the bill in recent weeks. Outside noise: Conservative groups including Heritage Action, the Club for Growth and Freedom Partners are “pushing lawmakers to buck House Speaker Paul Ryan and oppose the Republican blueprint.” Michelle Hackman for the Wall Street Journal: http://on.wsj.com/2lO0l7S The big question remains: Will conservatives go along with the final proposal? GOP hardliners have panned the refundable tax credits as “Obamacare lite.” But the most recent draft, leaked late last week, still included individual tax credits based on age, Paul Demko reports. More: http://politi.co/2lMBi5d IT’S ABOUT TO GO DOWN — Republicans know that getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed without a nasty filibuster fight means they need to win over at least eight Democrats like Sen. Angus King, the Maine independent who caucuses with Dems. King held a marathon town hall fielding questions about Gorsuch Sunday night in Portland. And although he didn’t tip his hand on how he feels about the SCOTUS nominee, King did drop hints about how he could eventually get to “yes” on Gorsuch, Seung Min reports from Portland. “Whatever else you can say about him, my sense from his record is, he’s exceedingly independent,” King said at the end of a nearly four-hour listening session in a packed University of Southern Maine auditorium. "He’s a real stickler for limits on executive power,” King added, calling that a particularly important trait in the Trump-era. Gorsuch’s confirmation hearings begin March 20, and Republicans hope to have a final floor vote by mid-April. SMK from the Pine Tree State: http://politi.co/2lNStTW SCOOP: You better step it up: Nearly a dozen progressive groups are putting Senate Democrats on notice today, saying they better do more to fight Gorsuch’s confirmation. “Democrats have failed to demonstrate a strong, unified resistance,” the 11 progressive groups write in a letter to be delivered today. Elana with the exclusive: http://politi.co/2lNRuTv YOUR MOVE, CONGRESS — Republicans were struggling Sunday to defend a weekend series of tweets from President Trump demanding a congressional investigation —without proof— into his claims former President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the election. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Senate Intel Committee member who flew down to Florida with Trump on Air Force One Friday, said he’d seen “no evidence” to back up Trump’s claims. Democrats went further, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying “the president is in trouble” for making the wiretapping accusations. Coming attractions: House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, a Trump ally, said his committee will look into Trump’s claims as part of its larger Russia probe. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intel panel, will be meeting with officials this week for an “unprecedented look” at intelligence related to the probe into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 7:30AM Analysts with BlueFin Research Partners recently warned that Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) next-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, which is scheduled to go into mass production in the second half of 2017, could be delayed by several months because of yield-rate issues. According to statements that Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala made to PC World, even Intel's top brass aren't completely confident in the public launch schedule of its first 10-nanometer product, code-named Cannonlake. Image source: Intel. The word "if" Intel has previously said that it intends to begin shipping Cannonlake chips for low-power notebooks and notebook/tablet hybrid devices by the "end of this year and really ramp into 2018." Renduchintala made the following statement to PC World: "If Cannonlake comes out at the end of the year, it'll be interesting what we actually market it as. We haven't decided yet." Notice that Renduchintala didn't use the word "when" but "if," signaling doubt that the company will manage to launch the product as expected. This jibes with BlueFin's commentary, in which the analysts say that Intel is both facing poor manufacturing yields and that it hasn't "locked down the complete process of records (PORs) to date." What BlueFin is saying with respect to PORs is this: Intel has yet to lock down the final manufacturing recipe for its 10-nanometer technology -- it's still making potentially significant changes to the manufacturing technology itself. The development of Intel's 10-nanometer technology appears to be quite troubled, and Renduchintala's apparent lack of confidence that the company will even launch the Cannonlake chip this year is yet more evidence of this.  Intel dodged a bullet by doing a fourth wave on 14-nanometer Intel's 10-nanometer process appears to be in extremely poor shape. The good news, though, is that Intel wisely decided to build a "fourth wave" of products based on its current 14-nanometer technology to service the market between late 2017 through either late 2018 or early 2019. The Cannonlake chips that Renduchintala is referring to aren't designed to address the entire personal computer market -- just a subset of it. Chips based on the company's proven 14-nanometer technology should address the bulk of the market and allow Intel to meet its customer commitments.  Indeed, Renduchintala told PC World that Intel's goal is to deliver "a yearly cadence of platform upgrade that actually gives meaningful performance improvements from the generation that preceded it." Had Intel not begun cooking up a new generation of parts on its 14-nanometer technology, it would have likely been stuck selling its current seventh-generation Core processors with no significant performance and/or feature improvements generation-on-generation. That would be bad for Intel's customers who rely on Intel to put out new processors so that they can sell updated systems with those new processors as key marketing points -- and bad for Intel itself. Renduchintala's mentality vis-a-vis products and manufacturing is now one of pragmatism. He told PC World that the company will "be focused more on the generation by the amount of performance increment that it will give [Intel]" and even said that he doesn't believe that "[product] generations will be tagged to [manufacturing] node transition." Now, to make all this work, Intel's manufacturing group will still need to improve the performance and efficiency of its manufacturing technologies each year. However, it is generally easier to improve the performance/power characteristics of a pre-existing manufacturing technology than it is to try to move to an all-new technology that brings a significant chip-area reduction compared to the prior generation.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque - RTS110BK Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email WASHINGTON -- The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: -Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. -Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. -An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. -A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. -A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. -His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly - the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 - after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working.

But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example.

Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. © 2017 The Associated Press.

Home Congress FUBAR News Opinion Politics Reader Rant White House Trump takes credit he doesn’t deserve March 6, 2017 7:34 am | by CALVIN WOODWARD and JIM DRINKARD President Donald Trump speaks to Navy and shipyard personnel aboard nuclear aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford in Newport News, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: —Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. —Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. —A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War.

The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday March 7, 2017 News National Larger / SmallerNight Mode Tributes for 'one of a kind' Melbourne father who died climbing Everest Aisha Dow 6 Mar 2017, 11:12 p.m. A Melbourne father-of-two and tech professional who died on Mount Everest last week has been remembered as "truly one of a kind". A Melbourne father-of-two and tech professional who died on Mount Everest last week has been remembered as "truly one of a kind". Matthew Jones passed away while trekking in Nepal. Fairfax Media has been told he was not attempting to reach the summit, but was among the tens of thousands of tourists who every year trek to Everest base camp, mostly without incident. Mr Jones had a successful career at multinational tech company, Intel, and on Monday tributes were flowing in from around the world. Intel Australia's managing director Kate Burleigh said no words could express the void Mr Jones would leave behind. "He was a unique character and will be remembered for not only his great work ethic and leadership but also his sharp wit and passion for good wine, fancy dress parties, history, travel and 'vexillology' [the study of flags] ," she said. "Matt was truly one of a kind who will be greatly missed. The Intel team is mourning the loss of our friend and colleague." It is understood Mr Jones reached base camp on Friday, but started experiencing breathing difficulties upon his descent. He reportedly died the next day. Local media have said a 49-year-old Australian man died at Lobuche village, located just below base camp, at 4940 metres above sea level, after likely falling ill with altitude sickness. They reported he had been staying at the Madan Hotel in Pheruche of Khumjung-7, in the Solukhumbu district. In a statement, Intel said it was providing "support in this difficult time to Matthew's wife and family". "We ask that you respect the family's wishes and let them mourn in private at this time. " A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would only say the department was aware of the death of an Australian man in Nepal. "We stand ready to offer consular assistance in accordance with the consular services charter," DFAT said in a statement.

Surface Book vs. Porsche Design Book One: A specs comparison We take a close look at what the specs say about these shiny, premium PCs. Melissa Riofrio (PC World (US online)) on 06 March, 2017 22:30 0 - - - - print email Ooh. Shiny. When Porsche Design unveiled its Book One at Mobile World Congress, Microsoft’s premium Surface Book finally had a rival for Best Trophy Laptop—the one you buy not because you need it, but because you can afford the best. We haven’t tested the Book One yet—it doesn’t ship until April—but we can compare its specs to those of the Surface Book closest in price and specs. Run through the list with us and see if you agree on which device is most drool-worthy. Price Both models come in at the high end for a mainstream laptop: Book One: $2,495 Surface Book: $2,699 Case material, dimensions, and weight Melissa Riofrio With all the PC parts in the display, the Porsche Design Book One naturally has vents along the screen’s sides. Higher-end laptops eschew plastic for lighter, tougher, and more prestigious materials. The Book One is thinner overall, but not lighter, and not without further compromise. Book One: Anodized aluminum in a matte, silvery finish. It measures 12.26 x 8.9 x 0.63 inches and weighs 3.77 pounds. Surface Book: Magnesium in a matte, silvery finish. It measures 12.3 x 9.14 x 0.51-0.9 inches (because of the hinge—more on that later) and weighs 3.63 pounds. The hinge and display mechanisms Melissa Riofrio Automotive gears inspired the 360-degree hinge between the display and keyboard on the Porsche Design Book One Laptop hinges are a challenge. Most designs have the top half roll a bit behind the bottom half when opened. A piano hinge keeps the display half above the keyboard half. Both the Book One and the Surface Book offer innovative hinges to accommodate their detachable displays—and add to their cachet as premium laptops. Melissa Riofrio When you separate the Porsche Design Book One’s keyboard from its display, a slender top slice with small tabs remains. The Book One is the only laptop available with both a 360-degree hinge and a detachable display. Its two VarioGear hinges consist of two stainless steel, gear-like cogs inspired by automotive mechanics. They roll over each other and also tilt to keep the laptop’s two halves in smooth contact. A small, plastic part called the "intelligent distance ring" manages the tilt, though aesthetically it seems out of place among these shiny gears. A small button on the laptop’s right side detaches the display, leaving behind a slender bar with insertion tabs. Gordon Mah Ung Microsoft calls this a Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge. The Surface Book’s Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge is even more complicated, with an articulated structure and a Muscle Wire Lock mechanism to release the display (which Microsoft calls the Clipboard). What some people don’t like is the hinge’s broad bend, which makes the Surface Book nearly an inch thick on that side. Operating system Both offer Windows 10 Pro, which is a good thing, as you get more control over system settings. CPU, RAM, and storage The Book One has an advantage here. It comes with Intel’s 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Core i7-7500U, a dual-core chip that runs at 2.7GHz up to 3.5GHz. It has 16GB of LPDDR3 memory running at 1,866MHz, and a 512GB PCIe SSD. The Surface Book line is still on Intel’s 6th-generation Skylake CPUs. This model has a dual-core Core i7-6600U that runs at 2.6GHz to 3.4GHz. It comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Graphics This is the one place where the Book One made a hard choice, going with Intel’s integrated HD Graphics 620—a solid performer for mainstream use, and probably the only viable choice given how thin the Book One is. It’s just that when the Porsche name is attached to something, it’s natural to expect speedier discrete graphics to be part of the package. The Surface Book in this comparison is a fall 2016 refresh using Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 965M, which alternates with integrated Intel HD 520 graphics. Of course, including this discrete GPU in the keyboard base (the Intel HD 520 is in the Clipboard) means the Surface Book is thicker and probably runs hotter than the Book One. Gordon Mah Ung Microsoft’s Surface Book has a high-resolution PixelSense display. Display Both of these laptops offer top-notch screens. Just remember that high-resolution displays demand more processing power and battery life. The Book One has a 13.3-inch QHD+ (3200x1800) IPS display with an LED backlight and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The 10-point multitouch display uses Gorilla Glass 4. The Surface Book has a 13.5-inch PixelSense IPS display with a 3000x2000 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio, plus 10-point multitouch. Keyboard, touchpad, and pen Melissa Riofrio Of course the pen that comes with the Porsche Design Book One is also a high-end design, made of aluminum. These are the parts you’ll use most often. On laptops this expensive, they’d better be good. The Surface Book’s Chiclet-style keyboard features 19mm pitch and 1.6mm of travel, which delivered a pleasant typing experience during our review. We have no specs on the Book One’s keyboard. At the press briefing, I typed briefly on one of the demo models and it felt fine, but we’d obviously need to use it more to make a fuller determination.  Both models use Microsoft’s Precision Touchpad. Not surprisingly, it’s designed to work well with Windows 10 and offers multigesture controls that expand what traditional touchpads can do. Both models come with aluminum pens that attach magnetically to the side of the display and have one flat side so they won't roll away. The Book One Pen, which is made by Wacom, has 2,048 levels of pressure sensitivity. It weighs 0.67 ounce (19 grams) with its AAAA battery installed. Porsche Design says the battery should last about 7.5 months, assuming about three hours of use per day. Peter Ruecktenwald The new Surface Pen has interchangeable nibs for a choice of writing or drawing feel. The Surface Book’s Surface Pen has been through a few iterations and now offers four different colors, but just 1,024 levels of pressure. It weighs 0.7 ounce (20 grams) with its AAAA battery. It comes with a Pen Tip Kit, making it more customizable than the Book One Pen, and its pen clip also makes it a little more practical. Camera and audio Both laptops have dual microphones to optimize voice interaction with Windows 10’s Cortana, plus dual speakers. Both have front 5MP cameras and infrared cameras for Windows Hello. The Surface Book also has an 8MP rear-facing camera. Ports The Book One has one USB 3.1 Type C port and two USB 3.0 Type A ports in the keyboard dock, plus a microSD card reader. The display has a USB 3.1 Type C Thunderbolt port. The Surface Book could use an update. Its current model has no USB-C, just two USB 3.0 Type A ports and an SD card slot, plus mini DisplayPort. Battery The Book One offers a generous 70Wh total of battery capacity, split between 25Wh in the display and 45Wh in the keyboard dock. The total runtime is up to 14 hours per Porsche Design (your mileage will vary), and it can charge to full in less than two hours. The Surface Book’s battery is even huger, and similarly split: 62Wh in the keyboard base and 18Wh in the Clipboard. It lasts up to 12 hours by Microsoft’s account, factoring in, of course, greater battery use by the discrete GPU. What the specs say Specs can take us only so far in judging one laptop over another. What we can say is that while the Surface Book’s discrete GPU is a compelling part, it’s surrounded by an older CPU and a few other aging components. The Book One’s integrated graphics is nothing exciting, but it’s a fresher build that would probably work fine except for gaming or workstation applications. We’ll be able to say for sure once we’ve tested it. We’re Hooked on Our Devices, But Can We Handle the Eye Strain? More from Essilor Australia Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. Related Coverage Pence jokes with 'enemy of the people' at Gridiron Dinner White House aides defend Trump's wiretapping claim Afghan family detained in Los Angeles are asking for release You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama's time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: -Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. -Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. -An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. -A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama's presidency. -A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. -His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly - the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission "was started before I got here," Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." THE FACTS: That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services." The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants' children "are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population." This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the "long-run fiscal impact" of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive "if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account." ___ TRUMP: "We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price" of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 - after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company's CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "I don't see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this." ___ TRUMP: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump's term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer "one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn't come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: "Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force." THE FACTS: That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation's unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: "Our Navy is now the smallest it's been since, believe or not, World War I. Don't worry. It's going to soon be the largest it's been." THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it's been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I - bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a "peace dividend" from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump's military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching - much less exceeding - the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It's unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home - from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center." THE FACTS: It's unclear what Justice Department data he's citing, but the most recent government information doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It's true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that's no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world." THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world's best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy's top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world's finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson's main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. "We will not be able to 'buy' our way out of the challenges that we face," he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It's true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that's no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world." THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world's best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy's top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world's finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson's main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. "We will not be able to 'buy' our way out of the challenges that we face," he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

I'm not going to talk about Intel as an investment. However, as the largest semiconductor company, with 98% market share in datacenter processors and a leader in process technology, there is plenty to take a look at. Anything in "quotes" means that it is a verbatim quote from either the presenter or the presentation during the morning. Client Computing and Datacenter Historically, Intel has used the chips for its highest-volume PC products to drive its process technology. These days, that means what Intel calls all-in-one devices. These basically compress all the functionality of a desktop PC into a very compact form factor. There were two reasons for doing this. The first is that these were the highest-volume products. It is one of the truisms of semiconductor manufacturing that if you want to get a high yield, then you have to run a lot of wafers. The second reason is that the chips were not excessively large (with regard to area). Very large chips yield poorly for defect density reasons, so running very large chips on an immature process is expensive. Click here to read more ...

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. —Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. Advertisement —Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. —A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

I’m not going to talk about Intel as an investment. However, as the largest semiconductor company, with 98% market share in datacenter processors and a leader in process technology, there is plenty to take a look at. Anything in “quotes” means that it is a verbatim quote from either the presenter or the presentation during the morning. Client Computing and Datacenter Historically, Intel has used the chips for its highest-volume PC products to drive its process technology. These days, that means what Intel calls all-in-one devices. These basically compress all the functionality of a desktop PC into a very compact form factor. There were two reasons for doing this. The first is that these were the highest-volume products.

As promised, we're back to follow up on our initial 1080p testing with a more in-depth look at Ryzen's gaming performance across a 16 titles played at 1080p and 1440p resolutions. In addition to including more games, we're also adding results for the 1800X and 1700X with SMT disabled as Anandtech forum-goers have discovered a problem with the Windows 10 scheduler that can cause Ryzen to perform worse in lightly-threaded applications with SMT enabled. Apparently Windows 10 treats all Ryzen threads the same (not identifying SMT from physical cores) and thus the operating system thinks all threads have access to their own L2 and L3 cache when in fact they don't. To start with a clean slate for this test, I built a brand new test system using the Gigabyte X370 Gaming 5 motherboard and EK XLC Predator 240 all-in-one liquid cooler for good measure. The Gaming 5 was updated with the latest F3 BIOS revision and my Corsair DDR4 memory was running at 1.5GHz for a double data rate of 3000 mega transfers per second. With all of that being the case, we should be showing Ryzen in the best possible light as it exists today and this is indeed the performance you can expect to see if you invest in one of AMD's new processors. Ahead are the results from 16 games tested at two resolutions on 11 different processors (plus the two configurations sans SMT), making for a total of 416 results from at least 1,250 individual benchmark runs. Gathering all this data took around four full days of work and let's just say I'm thankful I had the foresight to test Intel's processors before Ryzen arrived... Ryzen System Specs AMD Ryzen 7 1800X (3.6 - 4.0 GHz) AMD Ryzen 7 1700X (3.4 - 3.8 GHz) Gigabyte X370 Gaming 5 16GB DDR4-3000 RAM Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Vishera System Specs AMD FX-8370 (4.0 - 4.3 GHz) Asrock Fatal1ty 990FX Professional 32GB DDR3-2400 RAM Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Haswell-E & Broadwell-E System Specs Intel Core i7-6900K (3.2 - 3.7 GHz) Intel Core i7-5960X (3.0 - 3.5 GHz) Asrock X99 Taichi 32GB DDR4-2666 RAM Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Kaby Lake & Skylake System Specs Intel Core i7-7700K (4.2 - 4.5 GHz) Intel Core i5-7600K (3.8 - 4.0 GHz) Intel Core i7-6700K (4.0 - 4.2 GHz) Intel Core i5-6600K (3.5 - 3.9 GHz) Intel Core i3-7350K (4.2 GHz) Asrock Z270 Gaming K6 32GB DDR4-3000 RAM Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Let the Benchmarks Begin! The Division, Hitman, Civ VI, Overwatch Starting with Tom Clancy's: The Division, we find a rather severe GPU bottleneck (even at 1080p) when using the ultra quality settings. Of course it's not until we look at the dual-core Intel chips or the AMD FX-8370 that we start to see performance fall away ever so slightly. As you would expect, the 1440p results look much the same: the dual-core Intel chips catch up for the average frame rate, but are still lacking slightly when looking at the minimum. Needless to say, the Ryzen CPUs all do well here. Using DirectX11 for testing, the Ryzen CPUs are similar to the Core i7-5960X which makes them a good bit slower than the 6900K, 6700K and 7700K, though AMD's new chips still did slightly better than the unlocked Core i5 Skylake and Kaby Lake CPUs. Disabling SMT support doesn't have much of an impact on performance here though it did afford us an extra frame or two. Moving to 1440p shows some interesting changes in the results, though they are mostly expected. As the system's GPU becomes the performance-limiting factor, the margins between CPUs narrows. The 1800X for example is now just 11% slower than the 6900K where as it was 19% slower at 1080p. Overall, strong performance from Ryzen CPUs here as they roughly match the 5960X. The Civilization VI numbers might seem surprising but AMD's own review guide showed Ryzen to be quite a bit down on performance here in relation to the Intel CPUs. Still the performance was far from poor as the 1800X was just 10% slower than the 6900K at 1080p and just 7% slower for the minimum result. Jumping to 1440p, the results don't change much: the 1800X is still 10% slower than the 6900K which is obviously a commendable effort and a solid result for AMD. I changed my methodology a bit for testing Overwatch. I now run a 12-player bot match while spectating. The bots are set to easy and I only used the "Zarya" hero and the "Ilios" map. When the bots begin battling I start the test which runs for 5 minutes and as always the average results from three runs are reported. This is an in-depth test which I have found to produce accurate results. The only other change here has been the upgrade from ultra to epic quality settings which helps to knock the frame rates down from that 300 fps cap. At 1080p we see that like my previous test, the Ryzen processors don't seem particularly impressive when looking at the average frame rate, though they are plenty fast enough to drive a 144Hz display in this title and what's important to note here is their minimum frame rate results. Out of the box the 1800X isn't much slower than the 5960X, but with SMT disabled it actually pulls ahead. So we have here a good example of why the Windows scheduler needs to be updated for Ryzen. Ryzen becomes rather competitive at 1440p. The 1800X pulls ahead of the 5960X out of the box and this time disabling SMT doesn't lead to the same minimum frame rate gains. I have to say that both the 1800X and 1700X look great here.

We talk about games, the lack of AAA content, and how the technology can change... everything. Everyone’s bullish about virtual reality. Developers are continuing to develop new titles, and are starting to design games that take advantage of the unique opportunities of the medium. The makers of the HMDs themselves are starting to see sales increase, and with that increased market, we're seeing the first round of price drops, with Oculus now cutting about a hundred dollars from the Rift's starting price. And, at the Intel Extreme Masters in Katowice, Intel is pushing the technology hard - after all, you need high end PC hardware to make the most of VR, so anything which drives CPU sales is definitely a good thing. The one sticking point, though, remains the lack of truly killer titles and applications. Even Intel's own Frank Soqui, the General Manager of the company's VR division, admits that we're still waiting for the content that's really going to make VR sing. "We need those triple AAA titles," he told me. "The games that will drive VR take up." Essentially, VR needs its Crysis moment, when a game is so good that people will invest not for the novelty of the hardware, but for what can be done on it. Which kind of begs the question - is VR actually... ready? Is it, as many vendors continue to promise, here to stay? "Well, for me 'here' has a specific meaning," Soqui says when I ask him, after pointing out that it is a kind of nebulous thing right now. "But I look at the level of industry investment; I'm looking at the hardware capabilities that are there. I'm looking at the cross-sector investments that are being made, not just in gaming, but they're getting made commercially, in the enterprise. I look at price points coming down, at the quality of the experience - I think that's here." "What's not here," he says, "is the compelling content." We're really, really close, though.  At Intel's hardware demo area at IEM, VR featured heavily alongside high-end gaming PCs pushing out 4K gaming content, and sleek laptops with all the power of a desktop themselves.  There was the inevitable high-end driving simulator, complete with hydraulic shocks to rock a racing chair around as your tackle your racing line. There was a Virtuix Omni - if you were at the last Upgrade Australia event in Sydney, you may have already tried one! - where you could run about on the spot shooting zombies, and an impressive sail-boarding simulator that was a tonne of fun - if somewhat impractical for the home. There were two really great demos that really stuck out for me, however, and both showed what VR can do without needing to invest in even more tech, like racing-sim chairs or full-motion harnesses. The first was an upcoming game, one that I've been excited about for a while - Star Trek: Bridge Crew. The game pretty much does what it says on the tin, placing you on a starship bridge, as either Captain, Helm, Tactical, or Engineer. It can be played solo, with AI in each position apart from yours, but it's ideally a co-op experience, with a live player in each position. The demo shuffled you through each of them, showing off how each role plays, and it was pretty amazing. I'm a Star Trek fan, so may be biased, but the sense of presence was stunning. Using controllers, I could look down at my virtual hands as they manipulated various ship functions, and it really was just like in the movies.  I may have gotten a little quietly emotional. For me, it's the first true killer app of VR. When I pointed this out to Frank, he predictably called me a big nerd, and I'm not going to deny it.  "For me," Soqui went on, talking about the game that was his 'ah ha!' moment, "it was playing a game where my avatar was a woman, and I looked down, and... Wow! I'm in someone else's body!" "I've talked to film makers about this," he says, warming up to the topic, "about empathy. How does it feel to be in someone else's shoes?" The second impressive use of VR was in eSports broadcasting. Watching a stream of a game online is nothing new, but what Intel's aiming for is letting viewers get inside these matches - virtually. There's something very compelling about the chance to be virtually present in the arena for a big eSports match, and even more compelling about then being able to actually get inside the game, to watch it from any angle. In fact, finding new ways to present eSports to wider, more diverse crowds is one of Intel's big challenges in growing competitive gaming. They're both heavily gaming-focused though, and Intel's looking well beyond play for where VR can have the most impact. "Let's look at a collaborative work space, for instance," Soqui posits. "Say I'm trying to show you a 3D model, and I want to show it, and collaborate with someone over it. I've got to use Skype to talk to, you and spin this thing around with a mouse... Is this how want to work together?" "But with VR goggles and a shared space, I can spin that model with my hands, and so can you, we're going to look at it from different angles - whatever that object is. It could be art, it could be a building... We work that way naturally, and VR let's us do that." Which goes back to Frank's earlier point about empathy, and VR's ability to let us see the world from new angles. "What is it like to be in... Sarajevo," he says. "How does it feel to be a person of a certain ethnicity... How does it feel to be someone in a wheelchair? You don't know that point of view until you see it; and VR can do that." Another challenge that's facing VR at the moment is the hardware-based silo mentality that tends to be the norm when in comes to technology and software development. Games that are only on one platform, for instance. Developer Ubisoft has already promised that all its VR titles will be hardware agnostic - they'll run on PSVR, Rift, and Vive. But more needs to be done keep VR open. "I wouldn't say we're pushing for open standards, but we're certainly trying to influence people about the value of interoperability. It serves both consumer and business interests to have more content on more platforms. There's often a tension between business interests, as well as providing the best experience possible, as well as open standards - a lot of times those conflict with each other until the market matures." "I know that if I lock something down, I can create the best experience. But is that what the end user wants? Yeah, they want to the best experience, but they expect interoperability." "You just can't lock people into one platform," Soqui adds. "I wouldn't say we're pushing for open standards, but we're certainly trying to influence people about the value of interoperability." Of course, there's more to VR than just games and hardware. It always comes back to that unique experience of being there that really separates it out from any other form of media we've known. So how do you combine old media, like films, and traditional film-making techniques, with the startlingly young field of VR. Flat media, whether it's a film, a TV show, a documentary, even news broadcasts, all work based on similar principles, base around cuts, editing, and camera angles. When I point this out, and quiz Frank about his work with film-makers, his response was almost philosophical. "Why," he asked me, "is the cut used as a narrative device?" "Because," I replied, "it's something we're watching, not something we're in." Which was as dumb answer, but hey I'm no film student. And it was also what Frank wanted me to be say. "Yes, exactly! And here's the other thing - most of those of those movies or stories are based around something the author was in, around an experience, and it had to be translated from that experience into a flat space... I would argue that creators don't have to translate anymore. With VR, what they create, or write about, is what you experience. No cuts, no edits. You can just be there." As Frank's talking about film, and narrative, and a new way to explore these things, he's getting more animated. This is his last interview of a long day, so his passion and excitement is all the more astonishing. But then so is this still relatively new technology, and that helps keep things fresh, and capable of still surprising a veteran and evangalist like Frank. "You know what still gets me," Soqui says, sitting back and looking up at the ceiling. "What surprises me is how people react to it, that first time. When I see people's physical reaction, when they shout out, or when they duck..."  "And we're just at the tip of the iceberg for how your senses can be fooled."  Which makes me wonder, if a game like Bridge Crew can get me excited now... Maybe Frank's right - we ain't seen nothing yet.

SWR Software Rasterizer Now Supports Geometry Shaders Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 5 March 2017 at 01:43 PM EST. 7 Comments Intel's "SWR" software rasterizer living within Mesa now has support for OpenGL geometry shaders. Thanks to work that landed today by Intel's Tim Rowley, there is now support for OpenGL geometry shaders in this software rasterizer. The code amounts to over 700 lines of new code to implement GL GS support. Geometry shaders are mandated by the OpenGL ES 3.2 specification and this was the last extension SWR had to implement for GL 3.2 and 3.3 The other software rasterizers in Mesa -- Softpipe and LLVMpipe -- have already implemented geometry shaders and the other extensions through OpenGL 3.3. But we haven't seen any Mesa software rasterizers yet have working OpenGL 4.0+ support. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It didn’t take long for the glow of the president’s address to Congress to turn cold after reports surfaced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had not been accurate about his contact with the Russians during the 2016 campaign. President Trump found himself once again on the defensive against damaging leaks and intensified the focus on the Russia story, launching an unsubstantiated claim on Twitter that the former president had wiretapped his campaign headquarters to investigate Trump’s Russia ties. We will explore all of this today with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, and fellow Republican committee member Susan Collins. Former CIA and Defense Chief Leon Panetta will also be here. And we will go in-depth into a blockbuster “New York Times” report that the U.S. has been involved in cyber-warfare against North Korean missile launches. As the president and Republican leaders begin a coordinated push to replace Obamacare, we will get a progress report from Health and Human Services head Dr. Tom Price. And we will have plenty of political analysis -- all straight ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning , and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson. The Senate Intelligence Committee was already investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 election, but yesterday the president opened a whole new set of questions by accusing his predecessor, President Obama, of wiretapping Trump’s campaign headquarters. And this morning, the president has asked congressional committees to investigate. We are going to try and sort through all of this today. And we begin with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia’s Mark Warner. Senator, let’s start with the claims by the president. He tweeted that he -- on Saturday that he had just found out Obama had “my” -- quote -- “wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found.” He called it McCarthyism. What do you make of this? SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA: Well, John, let’s step back for a moment and look at what we do know. We know that we have seen an unprecedented attack by a foreign adversary, Russia, in terms of meddling in our election. We saw before the election a thousand Internet trolls trying to use and place false information. We saw manipulation of certain algorithms, so that if you Googled certain items, you got Russia news, R.T. News, other false news. We saw the selective hacking into DNC and individuals that then tried to leak that information to benefit Mr. Trump. We also saw before the election an unusual change in the Republican platform in favor of Russia. We saw Mr. Trump himself encourage the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton. And we saw this just unusual affection that the president seems to have, where he won’t say anything bad about Vladimir Putin. And since the inaugural, we have seen the resignation of the national security adviser and recusal of the attorney general because of contacts with Russians. Now we have this unsubstantiated claim made by the president, which shows in a certain way that the president doesn’t understand how you obtain a wiretap. You have to go before a judge and show either probable cause or, if it is in terms of foreign intelligence, a FISA court and show that there is evidence of some type of contact with a foreign adversary. And so what I find so strange -- and I thought the president’s comments could no longer surprise me, but, boy, this one yesterday surprised me. To make that type of claim without any evidence is, I think, very reckless. DICKERSON: Do you think there is a -- let’s stick to the president’s claim first and then go back to the other list you made. Do you think there is any FISA court order? This morning on “Meet the Press,” former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said there was no FISA court order. WARNER: I am not aware of any FISA court order regarding the Trump Tower. DICKERSON: But there have been ones of -- other kinds of FISA court orders? WARNER: Listen , I’m not going to get into what ongoing investigations the FBI might be taking. But I think it doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to realize, with this litany of events and this drip, drip, drip of activities, our investigation -- I have to tell you, I have been in public life a long time. There is nothing I have done in my life in public that is as important as trying to get this investigation done right and bipartisan and get the facts out to the American people. DICKERSON: The president’s claim, is it -- could he just be going off of something in a Breitbart report, or do you think he has access to -- he has access to the best possible intelligence. WARNER: He has access to the best possible intelligence. DICKERSON: So, which is this, do you think? WARNER: I think time will tell. But I am not aware, as General Clapper has said, of any kind of FISA order that was somehow, you know, in effect bugging Trump Tower. But I feel like this -- again, feels like an attempt where the president is trying to distract us by filling out -- and he is distracting with unsubstantiated information, which, again, if the president is correct, and he says there is nothing here, then he should welcome this investigation, because what we will do... DICKERSON: Have you seen any connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians? WARNER: We are early into this investigation. We have our staff out looking at information at Langley. I’m going to go out this week. We are going to have unprecedented access to all of the intelligence. DICKERSON: Meaning the FBI intelligence as well? Because... (CROSSTALK) DICKERSON: ... says the FBI is holding back. (CROSSTALK) WARNER: All of the intelligence that is appropriate, we’re going to get to all of that. I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look at this. And one of the things that gives me pride that this is happening, I have seen colleagues on the committee, Republican colleagues, like Susan Collins and Roy Blunt, Marco Rubio, all make public statements saying they are committed to not having this being interfered by politics and us getting to the bottom of it and getting the facts. DICKERSON: And quickly on the FBI, though, House Intel -- ranking member on the House, Adam Schiff, has said that the FBI is withholding significant issues from top members of Congress. Is that true? WARNER: I believe I have a good working relationship with Director Comey. DICKERSON: Are you getting what you need? WARNER: There’s plenty of time. You know, we are at the beginnings of this. We’re going to get the information we need to get to the bottom of this. DICKERSON: Who are you going to call? Is Michael Flynn going to testify? WARNER: Listen, I think that we will be -- we are looking at when we will hold public hearings. We’re also starting to prepare lists of individuals that I think need to come testify. I believe, considering General Flynn’s series of contacts and the fact that he had to resign, I want to hear from General Flynn. DICKERSON: And are you working hand in hand with Senator Burr, who is the chairman of the committee? WARNER: Listen, Senator Burr and I are friends. We have the ability to have kind of frank conversations. We have had conversations like that. I can tell you, as recently as Thursday, Chairman Burr and I -- and he was very, very strong with the intel community that we need to get all the facts. We need to get access, unprecedented access. And we got that access. DICKERSON: You say you have frank conversations. Senator Burr was one those the White House called and asked to act as a kind of character witness against these news reports that there were connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. You talked to Senator Burr after that. Do you have any doubts that he can carry out his role as chairman? WARNER: Listen, I have confidence that we are going to get to the bottom of this. DICKERSON: You have confidence he is going to do his job? WARNER: I’m -- Chairman Burr, Richard Burr, and I are going to get this done. And if at any point -- and I made this very clear from the outset -- if at any point, I feel like we are not getting access to all the information, or if there are barriers to getting this done, then I will say so, and look for a different venue. But what gives me faith is that this is a committee -- the Intelligence Committee, for a lot of reasons, works in a more bipartisan way than virtually any other committee. And the fact that we have got so many Republican members on the committee who I think are as equally committed to getting to the bottom of this, this is as serious as anything I have ever been involved in. DICKERSON: Final question. It is serious. And there is obviously an attempt by some people in the bureaucracy somewhere to put forward leaks that hurt the president. Do those leaks, which some in your party cheer like crazy, undermine what you are trying to do and undermine getting to the bottom of this? WARNER: Listen, any kind of leaks of intelligence is serious and needs to be investigated, because you put people’s lives in jeopardy potentially. I have great trust and respect for the intelligence community. I wish the president would show that same level of trust and respect for the intelligence community, because they do a good job for us. And they need to have -- and we got to have their back. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Warner, thanks so much for being with us. WARNER: Thank you. DICKERSON: And we now turn to a Republican colleague of Senator Warner’s on the Intelligence Committee, Maine Senator Susan Collins. Senator, what do you make of what President Trump has said about these wiretaps? Should he be talking about this on Twitter? Is this helpful? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: It would be more helpful if he turned over to the Intelligence Committee any evidence that he has. What we need to deal with is evidence, not just statements. At this point, I have seen no evidence of what he has alleged, but I have also not seen collaboration, as Director, DNI Clapper also said today, that he had seen evidence of collaboration. But we are at the very early stages of our investigation. And this is why it is so important that we do an in-depth, exhaustive, bipartisan, independent investigation, because the American people deserves answers to all of these allegations and counterallegations, so that we can get on with the business of this country. DICKERSON: The president has said and the White House has said they are not going to talk any more about his accusations over the weekend. But now that he has put that out there, he is the president of the United States. He has access to this information, even if he might have been going off of a news report. He has access to all of this information. Do you think it is important for him now to put forward this evidence in some form to back up his claims, because it is now out there, and people might think, because he is the president, he has some special understanding, in other words, not wait until the committee is done with its work, but that he -- does he have an obligation to present some kind of evidence now, now that he has put this charge out there about President Obama? COLLINS: The president has called for congressional investigations into the allegations that he made starting yesterday morning. So I would expect that he is going to want to provide our committee with any evidence that he has. My own theory is that the Russians are determined to sow the seeds of discontent and doubt about the legitimacy of our democracy and other Western democracies, and that they were going to do that regardless of who was elected president. So, it is really important, so that we know what happened and what the facts are, that we get to the bottom of this. DICKERSON: When you say he will provide the committee with information, but do you think he owes something to the public, now that he has kind of thrown this out there, and now isn’t going to say anything more about it? But now it is out there. It’s live. Does he owe the public something more than what he owes the committee, just as a matter of what Senator Sasse said, it was a matter of public trust? Do you agree with that? COLLINS: It would probably be helpful if he gave more information, but it also might be helpful if he just didn’t comment further and allowed us to do our work. The committee’s work is under way. I am convinced that we are going to do the kind of exhaustive, in-depth and prompt investigation that will help put these allegations to rest, one way or the other. DICKERSON: You mentioned going through everything. And I want to ask you about President Trump’s tax returns, because some people believe, in order to really figure out whether there was any influence on the president, you have to know whether there were any ties to Russia. You have said that the committee will perhaps subpoena the tax returns, if necessary. Do you think a committee investigation that ends without looking at the tax returns has fulfilled its duty, that the committee will have fulfilled its duty? COLLINS: It is premature for me to reach that conclusion right now. What I am convinced of, because I know this committee well, and I know how seriously we take this charge, is that we will go wherever the evidence leads us, and that we will get all of the information that we need. If that includes President Trump’s tax returns, then I have confidence that we will ask for them. If we don’t need them in order to reach our conclusions, then we won’t. But it is too soon to tell. DICKERSON: But will you come up with sort of a hunting list in terms of all the places you would want inquiry? And wouldn’t the tax returns be a pretty -- pretty high up on the list in terms of that? COLLINS: Well, let’s see where the evidence leads us. We are just now beginning to have access, as Senator Warner mentioned, to the information that the intelligence community has. Like Senator Warner, I will be going over to review that information. It is many binders-thick. So, let’s see where the evidence leads us. DICKERSON: Let me ask you a question quickly on the Affordable Care Act. You have put forward an alternative, or a bill. Where do things stand in the Republican ranks in terms of a replacement for the Affordable Care Act? COLLINS: There is not a consensus. This is very difficult to achieve the president’s goals and the goals that many of us have of wanting to expand access to coverage and have a damper on the prices. We have seen a lot of problems with the individual markets, in a death spiral in many states under the ACA. So, the irony here is , regardless of who was elected president, we were going to have to do major repairs on the ACA. I have put forth a plan with Senator Cassidy, who is a physician, that is a comprehensive plan that gives states the options of doing what is best for their citizens, and which we believe would actually expand access to health insurance. That is our goal. But there is not a consensus at this point. DICKERSON: Very quickly, how long do you think it will take to get to consensus? It’s a few little minor details, or are we still talking about the big, complicated business of something that takes up 18 percent of the economy? COLLINS: It is very complicated. And we shouldn’t rush it. We need to get this right. DICKERSON: All right, Senator Collins, thanks so much for being with us. And we will be back in one minute to talk to the former head of the CIA, former secretary of defense, and former chief of staff. It is all one person. That is Leon Panetta, coming up when we’re back in one minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Joining us now is former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director Leon Panetta. Secretary Panetta, let’s start with these new revelations or new claims by the president. Who do Americans look to be the adult who says, here is what is happening? LEON PANETTA, FMR. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Well, you know, what I see here is that this president is making the same mistake past presidents made when they faced scandals, that he is trying to divert attention. They are trying to obfuscate. They’re trying to cover up. They are trying to somehow raise other issues. And, in the end, it is going to be the truth that will determine what is involved here, and not tweets, but the truth. DICKERSON: We had an instance where, this week, the attorney general has had to recuse himself from investigations into campaign events. We have got -- now you have got investigative -- intelligence committees investigating. I mean, is -- do you think people just need to wait for the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate to do their work, or is there some better route, you think, to trying to get at what are now several sets of issues? There is the Russian meddling and now the claims that the president has made, quite extraordinary claims -- and maybe you can, given your experience, put them into some kind of context, for the president to claim that his predecessor was wiretapping him, and comparing him to Nixon and McCarthy. PANETTA: You know, the best advice I could give the president and this administration is to get ahead of this, don’t get behind it. Get ahead of it. Present the facts as they know it, and commit themselves to cooperating with the investigations that are going on. This issue is not going away. It is not going away. There is too much here. We have found the Russians to have tried to interfere in our election process. We have a situation now where the administration has denied contacts with the Russians. And we are finding out that that is not true, that there have been contacts with the Russians. And, lastly, the president himself has raised this issue. His whole national security team has condemned the Russians and Putin. And he still winds up defending Putin. So, you put all of that together, it may not lead you to some kind of collaboration or collusion, but it raises issues that have to be investigated. That’s why you need a bipartisan, an independent, a thorough and a credible investigation. DICKERSON: When you say independent, but that can still be within the Congress? PANETTA: Yes. No, I think, as you have seen, these are responsible members of Congress who want to look into this issue. I think they deserve the opportunity to do that. I would hope they don’t run into problems, because, if they do run into political problems in the course of this investigation, then we may very well have to turn to a special prosecutor. DICKERSON: What do you think foreign, other countries think about when they look at this? Does this have a -- we have got the president accusing his predecessor. You have got investigations into the president. How does this affect our standing as other countries look at America? PANETTA: It is sending a terrible message out there. I can tell you, based on my own conversations with people abroad, that they are very concerned about the administration, about the president. They are concerned about whether he truly is going to be committed to the kind of world leadership that we have seen the United States provide. But every time these things happen, every time he tweets, every time these issues come up that indicate that -- you know, there’s obviously something to this Russian issue, and the administration is not cooperating, when that happens, when he accuses a past president of wiretapping, without any evidence of that being the case, it makes us vulnerable. It weakens the United States, and it makes us vulnerable to our enemies. That is the danger. DICKERSON: Speaking of enemies of the United States, North Korea, “The New York Times” has a piece today about U.S. efforts using cyber-warfare to basically hurt the North Korean missile system. Are we -- is this -- should Americans be in fear of a cyber- retaliation by the North Koreans? PANETTA: I have always felt that cyber is -- it’s here to stay. It is one of the weapons that we have to deal with. And we have to be smart enough to use it, not only defensively, but offensively as well. And I think, you know, the stories you are seeing indicate that the United States is on the cutting edge of that kind of technology. DICKERSON: President Trump is most concerned about North Korea. Does he have it right? In terms of all of the global threats, he seems to be most concerned about North Korea. Do you share that concern? PANETTA: Well, there are a number of threats that are out there that -- we are dealing with a very dangerous world. I think the Pentagon feels that Russia is at the top of the list because of the nuclear threat, and I understand that. But we also have to worry about North Korea and the unpredictability of that leader. We have to worry about the Middle East and the chaos there. There are a number of crisis points that the United States has to consider. And the problem is, when we are diverted, when the president is diverted from paying attention to those crises, we pay a price. DICKERSON: All right. Stay right there, Secretary. We will be right back. We are going to take a short break, but we will be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we are back with Leon Panetta. President Trump has suggested that he wants $54 billion in defense spending next year. What does the Defense Department need? Is that a good idea, and what would they spend it on? PANETTA: You know, the worst thing that they could do is to go through a roller-coaster ride on defense spending, where we are down, increase it dramatically, then, next year, take it back down. We have gone through the sequester process , which has literally impacted on our readiness. So, yes, we need an increase to try to deal with the readiness issue, but what we really need is a gradual increase and certainty in the budget. And if you are not providing certainty as to where the defense budget is going, you can talk about increasing it all you want. You are going to create chaos in terms of the Defense Department. DICKERSON: And how do you get -- you mentioned the sequester. That was the draconian budget cuts as a result of not reaching budget agreements. How do you get that certainty in budgeting for the Defense Department or anywhere else, for that matter? PANETTA: Well, John, what has to happen in this town -- and it hasn’t happened for a long time -- is that the president and the Congress have to come to a budget agreement that really deals with this $20 trillion debt that we face. And the problem now is that they are all trying to do this by going after discretionary spending, which only constitutes a small part of the overall budget. What you have got to do is put everything on the table. You have got to put entitlements, you have to put taxes, and you have to put discretionary. That’s what we did in the past. That’s how we got a balanced budget. We are not going to be able to deal with the budget unless there is that kind of agreement. And that is essential, not only for purposes of the budget, but for the American people to understand what our priorities are for the future. DICKERSON: The president has said he won’t touch Medicare. PANETTA: Well, I think it is dangerous. Any time you put something off -- you know, off the table, you are just asking for trouble. Entitlements make up two-thirds of the federal budget, for goodness’ sakes. You are not going to look at how you can develop cost controls on those programs? You will never be able to deal with a budget crisis if you just eliminate that whole area. DICKERSON: You were brought into the White House as chief of staff during a rocky period in the Clinton years. What do you make of the current White House operation, as you viewed it? PANETTA: Well, I worry about it, because, when the president goes off and does what he did within the last few days of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there is something wrong. There is something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate. I mean, you cannot have this kind of situation, where the president is not properly briefed, that you think out what the president is going to say. And that you have somebody in charge of the White House staff, that, I think, still hasn’t taken place. And I think the White House is paying a price for that failure. DICKERSON: All right, Secretary Panetta, thanks so much. And we will be right back. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I’m John Dickerson. “The New York Times” chief Washington correspondent is David Sanger, and he detailed a U.S. covert cyberattacks against the North Korean missile program under the Obama administration in the paper and he joins us now to discuss this latest reporting. Welcome, David. Before we get to your specific reporting, President Trump is very focused on North Korea. Give us your sense about why you think -- why he should be. DAVID SANGER, “THE NEW YORK TIMES”: Well, when President Obama leftovers office, he made it pretty clear, as President Trump has said, there’s one big military problem out there. President Trump has never quite said what that is, but clearly it’s North Korea. And it’s North Korea because in the last year and a half of the Obama era, the North Koreans made huge progress in both their nuclear tests and in bringing in a new generation of missile technology that eventually, maybe two years from now, maybe three, maybe four, but not that long, is going to be able to reach at least the West Coast of the United States. So that timeframe for dealing with this problem, which has been kicked down the road by president after president after president is really narrow. DICKERSON: And you detailed the cyberattacks used to -- to try and keep that time frame really long. SANGER: That’s right. So the -- the key to this right now is keeping the North Koreans from learning how to get that ICBM across the Pacific. And the Pentagon, with the help of the intelligence agencies, worked for many years to come up with ways to do this using cyber technology to actually interfere with the way that the North Koreans would send those launches. And, in fact, the origin of the story, John, was that my colleague, Bill Broad and I, who worked on nuclear issues for a long time, were sitting around one day last spring saying, these things are just falling into the ocean too fast. And Bill went back and discovered that the design on which this missile is -- is based, which is an old Russian design, had a failure rate of about 13 percent -- DICKERSON: When the Russians were shooting them off. SANGER: When the Russians were doing them. DICKERSON: Yes. SANGER: And the North Koreans were running a failure rate of about 88 percent. Now, a lot of things could explain that. The North Koreans are not the best manufacture in the world, you know. They are not the best welders in the world. But clearly something else was making this worse. And -- and that was it. And then there’s President Obama, who looked across the spectrum of our defenses and said, this missile defense that we have spent $300 billion building since the Eisenhower era, the stuff that’s up in Alaska and California -- DICKERSON: Right, that shoots it out of the air? SANGER: Shoots it out of the air -- DICKERSON: Right. SANGER: Has a failure rate of about 56 percent under ideal conditions. So he said, this is not going to defend us against the problem. DICKERSON: So have the North Koreans figured out these cyberattacks and have they gotten better? And what does that mean for U.S. venerability? SANGER: Well, one of the reasons we ran the story now is it became pretty clear that the North Koreans will have an investigation underway, figured out that somebody was messing in their system. And so we went ahead and wrote a story carefully in a way that we thought would not provide the technical details that would allow the North Koreans to defeat what the United States is doing. But it’s clear that we’ve got a big issue, several big issues here. One is, is this enough? And that’s a big issue that Mr. Trump is going to have to go deal with. Second big issue is, are there other alternatives? Do you negotiate with the North Koreans? Which a lot of people say we should. President Obama decided not to. Do you take more decisive action? Do you try to attack these launch sites kinetically? You can do that -- DICKERSON: Meaning militarily? Blow them up? SANGER: Militarily, right. You blow them up. If you do that, you -- and you miss some, you run the risk of starting off another war in the Korean peninsula, and no one wants to go do that. So, you know, the Russia story is a fascinating one. The tweets are a fascinating diversion. But in the end, at some point, President Trump is going to have to sit down and actually focus on a few threats like this one. DICKERSON: All right, David Sanger, thanks so much. A fascinating piece of reporting. SANGER: Great to be with you, John. DICKERSON: And we’ll be right back with our panel. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: One of the top items on the president’s legislative agenda is the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. Health & Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price joins us from Atlanta to give us an update. Secretary Price, the president said that he would have a replacement for the Affordable Care Act on day one, and then more recently he said it was more complicated an issue, health care, than anyone would have guessed. Where does -- where does the president’s plan stand at this point? DR. TOM PRICE, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: John, thanks so much. Good to be with you today. Before I -- I answer that, let me just say that -- that it is an incredible privilege for me to serve as the Health & Human Services secretary. And the mission of HHS is -- is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And right now, across the country, there are many individuals who have a challenge from healthcare access and -- and cost of insurance in the individual and small group market. And that’s what we want to focus on. And there are literally millions of folks who have either -- aren’t unable to afford their insurance or paying premiums, the premiums are up 25 percent over the last year, almost 100 percent over the last three to four years. So what we want to make certain is that we’re being true to the principles of health care, which is a system that’s accessible for everybody and affordable for everybody and of the highest quality, making sure we incentivized innovation and empowering patients through both transparency and accountability. So that’s the plan we’re been working on and we look forward to moving it very, very soon. DICKERSON: The president has -- has said the following about what the plan will -- will do. He said it will offer better care for more people at lesser cost. He said people will have access to the doctor that they want and the plan that they want. And it will be paid for without touching Medicare. Is all of that still true? PRICE: Absolutely. And I think it’s important for the American people to appreciate. And the speech that the president gave this past Tuesday night, what he did was outline the priorities for the American people. They want a system where the states have the flexibility and authority is returned to the states for the regulation of -- of health coverage. They want to make certain they can buy across state lines. They want to make certain that preexisting illness and -- and injury is not -- makes certain it’s covered from -- from an insurance standpoint. They want drug prices to come down. He said something also very important about lawsuit abuse. He said that we ought to address the issue of lawsuit abuse and the practice of defensive medicine where we’re wasting hundreds of billions of dollars every single year. And so these are the priorities that the president has outlined. They’re consistent with the priorities that we’re moving forward with at Health & Human Services. And we’re very, very excited about the opportunity to once again respond to the needs and the concerns and -- and -- and the fears, frankly, of the American people about the health care system that they currently find themselves in. DICKERSON: One of the fears that people currently on the Affordable Care Act have is that they will not have it after these reforms are put in place. And there seems to have been kind of different claims about whether the 20 million or so who are on it will be able to continue their coverage. Some -- people in the administration have said absolutely yes they will be covered. Others have said that’s a goal. Those are two different things. Which is it? PRICE: Yes. Well, I think what -- our -- our goal is to make certain that every single American has access to affordable coverage that’s of the highest quality. You know what’s oftentimes missed, John, is -- is that there are 20 million Americans across this land who -- who are exposed to the penalty, have either chosen to take the penalty, not purchasing insurance, or taken a -- a waiver. And the reason is because the federal government has dictated to individuals what they must buy, what kind of health coverage they must purchase. So what our goal is, what the president’s goal is, is to give people choices, to let them purchase the kind of insurance that they want for themselves and for their family, not what Washington forces them to buy. This is a real important distinction between where we are right now in that individual and small group market and where we want to go. DICKERSON: So if I’m on the Affordable Care Act now, I don’t have to worry about losing coverage? It’s not going to become so expensive that I won’t be able to afford it? PRICE: Well, it is becoming expensive right now. As I mentioned, the premiums are going up, the deductibles. If you’re a -- if you’re a guy or a gal out there, you’re making $50,000, $60,000, you got a couple kids, you know, your premium, by and large, is somewhere between $8,000 and $12,000 a year. You don’t have that kind of money. So you may have a card, you may have an insurance card, but you don’t have care because you can’t afford the deductible in order to -- to get the kind of care that you need. DICKERSON: But -- PRICE: So our goal is to bring those costs down. And the way that you do that, again, is through flexibility, though allowing states to have the flexibility to care for their vulnerable populations as they see fit, choices for patients all across this land, making certain that they can purchase what they want, not what Washington says they must buy, making certain that the doctors are able to provide the kind of care that they believe to be most important, not, again, responding to what Washington tells them they must do. So we’ve got a lot of wonderful opportunities to make certain, again, that the American people are able to afford the kind of care that they want. DICKERSON: Final quick question on Medicare, Mr. Secretary. Speaker Paul Ryan said it may still be an open question about whether President Trump really doesn’t want to touch Medicare. Is it an open question? Might there be a back door way that the president will go back on his campaign promise not to touch it either for current retirees or for anybody in the future? What’s the final bottom line here? PRICE: I’ll tell you what -- I’ll tell you what’s not an open question, is that -- is that we believe in the guarantee of Medicare for our -- for our seniors. The challenge that we have, as you well know and your viewers know, is that Medicare is -- is -- as some folks have said going insolvent or going broke. Within a ten year period of time, we won’t have the money in the Medicare program to be able to pay the benefits to seniors in this country that has been promised to them. We don’t think that’s appropriate. So we believe in -- strongly in the guarantee of Medicare and make certain that it’s a viable, financially secure program going forward so that seniors now, and in the future, know that it will be there for them. DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Secretary, sounds like a guarantee with perhaps some -- some changes maybe, maybe not, but we’re out of time. I really appreciate you being with us. And we’ll be right back. PRICE: Thanks, John. It’s good to be with you. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Panel. Julie Pace is the White House correspondent for the Associated Press. Ed O’Keefe covers politics for “The Washington Post.” We’re also joined by CBS News political analyst and Slate’s Jamelle Bouie, and Ramesh Ponnuru, senior editor of “The National Review.” Julie, I want to start with you. This week saw Donald Trump give his most sustained public comments that were restrained. The word presidential was used a lot. Then, Saturday, a series of tweets that seemed the opposite of that. Where are we now going into Monday with the Trump presidency? JULIE PACE, ASSOCIATED PRESS: It was incredible whiplash this week. I think we have to give the president credit for the speech that he gave on Tuesday night. It was a side of him we don’t often see. It was restrained. It was traditional. He got into some of the agenda that he wants to see going forward. But it just quickly gets overtaken in some cases because of actions by people with Jeff Session, who didn’t totally be up front with the congressional committee when he was doing his confirmation hearing, but then it’s the president himself who goes out on Saturday and distracts with these series of tweets. And the overarching problem for him is, he is going into a week that is going to be policy heavy. A new rollout of the vetting EO and then a rollout of healthcare. And the success or failure of healthcare is going to be one of the -- one of the measures by which his swear presidency is judged on. And -- and to distract from that, to not go into this week with a sense of focus, I think, really hampers his administration. DICKERSON: Ramesh, on that point, one of the things that made Republicans happy about this speech was that it was focused. RAMESH PONNURU, “NATIONAL REVIEW”: Right. DICKERSON: The president hit the marks of a speech like that, which is important when you’ve got to sell a piece of legislation. Now the -- the worry is back to distraction. PONNURU: I think there was a very short lived (ph) sigh of relief that came from Capitol Hill Republicans about the president. But I think there’s a connection between what we saw on Tuesday night with the president’s speech and what we saw on Saturday morning with these tweets, which was, the president thought he had hit a home run with the speech. He was getting great positive reviews. And then reportedly he was furious that the story moved on to Attorney General Sessions misleading testimony in Congress, and that’s what I -- apparently set him in this mood where he sets these tweets. Now, one other thing about these tweets that I think really is remarkable is, he’s alleging explicitly a Nixon Watergate level conspiracy on the part of the previous administration against his own presidency, and then he starts commenting about “The Apprentice” within the same hour. I mean, this is -- this is a -- this is just a remarkable set of things, and it makes you wonder how certainly you can take the things that he’s saying. DICKERSON: And it was also after a speech in which on Tuesday night he said, there’s no more time for trivial fights and “The Apprentice” would be probably in the trivial category. Jamelle, a question for you is, when the president takes to Twitter, it’s often as a strategic move to distract from one thing and move to another. Do you see strategy in -- in what was happening yesterday? JAMELLE BOUIE, CBS NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: I see some strategy in that he does want to kind of regain the -- the attention of the media, the attention of everyone from the Sessions controversy. I -- I think -- I think it’s -- we should not overstate the degree of strategy here. It’s -- we’ve -- we’ve seen over the years, over the last 24 months, that Trump is impulsive, that Trump is very self-involved, you might say. And so this could also just well be Trump lashing out as Trump does. I want to say one quick thing about last Tuesday’s speech that while it was relatively more calm and serious and mature than most of Trump’s addresses to the public, it -- it should be said that some of the policy content there is just -- was just as extreme and just as aggressive as we’ve seen in his less stable moments. Stable might be the wrong word, but in his less -- in those moments. So, for example, in that speech he announced the creation of an office dedicated to publicizing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, which has two problems. The first that it resumes that undocumented immigrants are responsible for a huge number of crimes, and the second is that it is stigmatizing and contributes to an atmosphere of people arguing harm to immigrants. And Trump’s tone shouldn’t distract from that. DICKERSON: Ed, picking up on what Jamelle said, the president talked about unity, but if you’re trying to unify with Democrats and yet doing things of what Jamelle just described, they’re not going to be in a mood to unify. ED O’KEEFE, “THE WASHINGTON POST”: Not at all and they weren’t -- I mean they fled the chamber as fast as they could Tuesday night, having essentially held their nose throughout the whole thing. And they -- they have said, look, we see no reason to work with him. He has made no real attempt to -- to make any, you know, overtures to us, why -- why should we bother? And I think the fact now, even today, we’re seeing the Senate minority leader on another program raise doubts about the Republican leader of the Intelligence Committee. It now shows you to what extent this really spreads. It spreads all the way now into the even -- even into the investigation into Russia. There is no appetite up there among Democrats to cooperate with this president because they’re convinced that he’s just so tarnished and they see no political benefit. Whether that works for them ultimately remains to be seen, but I think it’s -- it’s a real testament to the poisonous nature and the fact that he has done nothing so far, at least in their view, to fix things. DICKERSON: Mark Warner working very hard to -- O’KEEFE: Right. DICKERSON: To keep support there for -- for his chairman, Richard Burr, and in his comments. Julie, I want to ask you about the substance of President Trump’s Russia policy, because there’s a lot of talk about Russia and connections and all of that. But what’s happening with respect to actual U.S. policy towards Russia and the president’s position on that. PACE: So this is really an interesting conversation that’s happening in the White House against the backdrop of all of these revelations about people meeting with the Russian ambassador. The president came into office talking about striking a deal with Russia. It hasn’t quite been defined. But the broad buckets include cooperation on the Islamic State, Ukraine, some kind of negotiations over arms control. And I’m told that he’s been sending signals, both to his advisors and to allies, that this may not be the right moment for that kind of deal. There are a couple of reasons why. One is that the White House is very concerned, legitimately, about some treaty violations that Russia has had involving a cruise missile launch a few weeks ago. But there are other factors. You have some new voices in the room with the president who are tougher on Russia than he has been and some of his previous advisors have been. You have European allies that are learning to speak the language of Trump, talking to him about a deal. You don’t want to make a bad deal with Russia. You don’t want to make a weak deal with Russia. So they’re -- it’s interesting that they’re picking up on those cues. And, frankly, it just underscores the political climate right now for him to have a president moving forward on a robust deal with Russia against all of these questions about his relationship I think even he, and his advisors, are realizing that that would be pretty difficult to -- to strike that kind of deal in this climate. DICKERSON: Ramesh, let me switch to Obamacare here from Russia and ask, where do you think things are, as the House leaders begin their process, and as the White House sort of comes along with them, what’s the state of play with respect to replacing Obamacare in the -- in Congress and the White House? PONNURU: I think there’s considerable confusion and disagreement still among Republicans. I think that the congressional Republican leadership has its own basic sense of where it wants to go. It wants to have a tax credit driven strategy that provides coverage to a lot of people, even in a post Obamacare world. But there’s a significant number of conservatives in Congress who don’t want any part of that. And the administration is not being entirely clear about where it stands on this basic divide among Republicans. Normally, congressional Republicans, in charge of Congress, with a Republican president, would be looking to the administration to set their direction on this kind of issue. This time, they’re not, or at least that direction is not being provided. O’KEEFE: I -- a fascinating piece of context today by our friend Paul Kaine (ph) in the post. He said more than 160 House Republicans have never worked before with a Republican president. They’re used to blocking and tackling. They’re not used to running with the ball. And we are seeing this every day up there. I mean all the other noise about Russia and whatever the president is tweeting about or doing and saying, they do not know how to deal with this issue and they’re going to have real trouble. To hear the secretary here now dodging your questions about the specifics of what this outline will look like, they’re allegedly working off of his blueprint that he wrote as a congressman. And even that isn’t able to generate enough agreement. If you have as many as 40 House Republicans, and they’re out there concerned about this, wanting to stand in its way because they don’t think it’s conservative enough or costs too much money, that’s the end of the game. There will not be healthcare reform if they can’t get it out of the House and if they can’t find Democrats to work with them, and they don’t want to. DICKERSON: Well, the Democrats definitely don’t want to work with them. BOUIE: Well, absolutely. Yes. It’s almost a perfect storm of dysfunction for the effort to get -- to repeal the Affordable Care Act because you have Congress people who have not worked with a Republican president, have very little experience with this kind of legislation. You have a White House that is arguably in disarray, or at least is not -- does not have the kind of experience that you need to shepherd major pieces of legislation through Congress. You have a president whose stated goals for reform are count run -- run kind of counter to what congressional Republicans say they want. And the, of course, you have Democrats who have just decided largely to say, hey, we’ll let you take care of this and we not really going to help out. There is a timer here too, right, that as time goes on this just becomes more and more difficult. And so -- DICKERSON: It’s a political matter. BOUIE: Right, it’s a political matter. And so we may actually already be approaching the point politically where there isn’t that much to do because it’s just -- opposition is building, voters are speaking out in the opposition and Democrats are really rallying their side against it. DICKERSON: Julie, one thing I heard from Secretary Price when I asked him about Medicare, is he said the promise of Medicare will be there. PACE: Right. DICKERSON: When -- when Donald Trump was a candidate, he, no tinkering, no how. PACE: Absolutely. DICKERSON: Promise is different. Promise is you can get a whole different kind of thing. The promise is there but the form of it is different. PACE: And the president, in the campaign, said that over and over and over again. That will come back to haunt him if an eventual package does -- does make changes there. I mean I think what’s so interesting about this -- about this moment that we’re entering is, Trump is now going to have to really be a president who gets involved in legislation if he wants to get this through. You have people -- lawmakers on The Hill who want to hear from him. They want him to pick up the phone and give him a call. We don’t know if he’s capable of doing that. This is going to be a big test for him as a president. DICKERSON: Ramesh, and the president -- the reason Paul Ryan wants flexibility on Medicare is to find some money to pay for all the other things that President Trump wants to do. PONNURU: That’s right. I do -- I think that this point Julie made about the president’s involvement and its possible effect on The Hill is a really important one because it’s -- it’s right saying that 40 conservative Republicans are holdouts, you can’t pass anything, but will they stay holdouts if at some point President Trump is saying -- O’KEEFE: Right. PONNURU: I need you to replace Obamacare. I understand you’ve got some -- some problem you’ve got with this legislation, but it’s decision time. Are you going to be responsible for defying me, hurting my presidency and keeping Obamacare on the books? I don’t think that those 40 stay 40. DICKERSON: Right, he’s still got political power. Ed, I want to ask you quickly about the president -- or the White House had a little faint towards immigration reform. The day of the speech, there was a little notion that the president might support permanent legal status, have a job, pay your taxes, you won’t have to worry about getting deported. What did you make of that? O’KEEFE: Twice in February he had private lunches with people where he raised this issue. Repeatedly in public he hasn’t brought it up. So one wonders really what is his stated goal here? You know, all he really talked about was that immigration victims -- crime victims office -- DICKERSON: Right. O’KEEFE: Which is not going to be a very busy office, frankly, because there are isolated and very high-profile examples of this, but it’s not widespread. What is widespread and what’s causing a lot of trouble and concern for people right now is the really uneven enforcement of the immigration laws. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, to their credit, has done a good job tracking this. And, you know, the examples of, you know, a 22-year-old who was arrested by ICE after speaking out at a press conference about them is being sent back to Mexico. A mother who was checking in with ICE for years being sent back to Mexico for the same reason. DICKERSON: In other words, it’s not just the -- the bad dudes. O’KEEFE: And it’s happening all over the country. It’s not the bad hombres. DICKERSON: Right. O’KEEFE: These are good hombres, in many cases. No criminal record at all. And the confusion that this is causing with very little congressional oversight, while the president’s talking about the idea of doing it and people are waiting for him to signal what they want to do, is just incredible and causing great confusion. DICKERSON: All right, we’re going to have to leave it there. Thanks to all of you. And we’ll be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) DICKERSON: Thanks for watching FACE THE NATION.

Robots glide along the ceiling, moving silicon wafers the size of dinner plates between hulking machines that deposit and etch microscopic layers of material to build the most advanced memory chips in the world. For the 1,700 technicians and scientists who tend to the robots and troubleshoot problems in the delicate manufacturing process, the jobs offer generous pay and benefits and easy access to Utah’s many outdoor attractions. For Intel and Micron Technology, the two US companies that jointly own and operate IM Flash, the venture allows both of them to sell cutting-edge, three-dimensional memory chips while sharing the multibillion-dollar costs of a modern semiconductor factory. The memory chips produced at the plant are “probably one of the biggest advances of technology in the last 20 years,” said Jon Carter, who oversees Micron’s strategy for new memory products. And, as he was quick to point out, all of the work was done in the United States. “Micron has done a really good job of having a good footprint on the home front,” he said. In many ways, however, the IM Flash plant is an outlier. While companies based in the US still dominate chip sales worldwide, only about 13% of the world’s chip manufacturing capacity was in this country in 2015, down from 30% in 1990, according to government data. Chipmakers attribute the decline to a variety of forces, including high US tax rates and the hefty subsidies offered by foreign governments for new semiconductor plants, which can cost as much as $10 billion. “It’s quite a bit more expensive to build a factory in the US,” said Stacy J Smith, the executive at Intel overseeing manufacturing, operations and sales. Intel — which predominantly manufactures in Oregon and Arizona but also has factories in Ireland, Israel and China — estimates that the extra cost for a US plant is more than $2 billion. Chipmakers are hopeful that President Donald Trump, who has promised large corporate tax cuts and a tougher approach to trade with China, will help them. Intel’s chief executive, Brian M Krzanich, made a public display of his faith in the administration this month when he stood by Trump in the Oval Office to announce that the company would spend $7 billion to complete a leading-edge chip factory in Chandler, Arizona, creating 3,000 full-time jobs. Intel said it was talking with the Trump administration and Congress about a broad corporate tax cut as well as other ways to improve the financial incentives for chipmakers to locate new projects here. Although the United States has 76 semiconductor plants, many of them are older, and few new ones are being built. Intel, whose workforce relies heavily on highly skilled immigrants, is also pressing the administration to continue allowing such immigrants to enter the country. “We benefit from being able to hire the best talent from around the world,” Smith said. The chip industry spends about one-fifth of its revenue on research and development, but it wants more federal funding for basic research into fundamental problems, like how to pack transistors closer together and whether materials other than silicon could form the basis of future chips. “We would like this administration to double down on investments in basic research in universities,” said John Neuffer, chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that represents US chipmakers. “Help us pedal faster.” Foreign countries have become more appealing for chip manufacturers, in part, because of the rise of contract chip foundries owned by Samsung of South Korea and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. They have made it easy for US tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple to design cutting-edge chips in the US but outsource production to Asia. Looming in the background is China, which is a bit player in the industry but has committed to spend upward of $100 billion to create a world-class chip industry. “Today, it’s a modest threat, but two, three, four years out, if China plays out as it plans, it could be very significant to subsectors of our industry,” Neuffer said. The IM Flash plant in Lehi was built in 1994 and was Micron’s first factory outside Boise. In 2005, Intel and Micron struck a partnership to expand the plant and make flash memory there, sharing costs and output. The two companies have spent the past 11 years developing the newest type of memory, which they call 3-D XPoint. The design combines the functions of a computer’s ultrafast working memory and its slower, longer-term storage to create a hybrid aimed at companies like Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil, which need to process vast amounts of data reliably and at the highest speeds. David Kanter, principal analyst at the research firm Real World Technologies, said the technology, which is still being tested by the first round of customers, was very promising. “It could the change the way that computing operates,” he said. Foreign factories However, as with all new chip technologies, the initial products are likely to be expensive. The Lehi plant will continue to make traditional, cheap 2-D memory chips while gradually expanding production of the newer chips. Both companies have turned to foreign facto­ries to hedge their bets with other products — less expensive, less capable 3-D flash memory designs aimed at the broad slice of the market that wants better performance but is unwilling to pay top dollar for best technology available. Micron committed $4 billion to expand a plant it owns in Singapore to make the 3-D flash memory chips, which it began selling last year. Intel converted an ageing factory it built a decade ago in Dalian, China, into one that produces state-of-the-art 3-D memory chips. “China is the largest market for us on the planet,” said Smith of Intel. “It made sense to locate some production in China.” Given China’s position as the biggest buyer of US chips, the industry is concerned about Trump’s talk of a trade battle with China. At the same time, chipmakers believe that China has sometimes treated US companies unfairly and relish the idea of help from Washington on that front. In any case, Intel and Micron, which rejected a $23 billion acquisition bid by a Chinese company in 2015, say they intend to keep the bulk of their chip manufacturing in the US. Rob Magness, an IM Flash employee who works with the equipment that etches and polishes the silicon wafers, is optimistic, but said he knew just how fragile the industry was. During his 25 years making chips, he has seen employer after employer downsize and move factories offshore as they coped with the brutal economics of chip making. “All the places I came from are dying,” he said. “The other two memory companies I worked for actually went under. The prices just got too cheap.”   Tweet Go to Top Videos Congress, SP, BSP have different culture of...

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming.

That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 17:16 Chorltonwheelie says: “I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen” Noooooo, enthusiasts will fork out for the best thing on the market. This isn’t that, not by a long chalk. I get the desperate need to provide Intel with some meaningful compatition but why hype a cheap so so mid range chip? Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 17:38 Jeremy Laird says: Incorrect. Most enthusiasts cannot afford the best thing on the market. It is that simple. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 22:28 Jabberslops says: Ryzen still isn’t compelling enough to me to upgrade my gaming computer when what I have is still able to get 100+fps in most games I play. I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Availability: 4-5 years by Russ Juskalian One of the labs at QuTech, a Dutch research institute, is responsible for some of the world’s most advanced work on quantum computing, but it looks like an HVAC testing facility. Tucked away in a quiet corner of the applied sciences building at Delft University of Technology, the space is devoid of people. Buzzing with resonant waves as if occupied by a swarm of electric katydids, it is cluttered by tangles of insulated tubes, wires, and control hardware erupting from big blue cylinders on three and four legs. Inside the blue cylinders—essentially supercharged refrigerators—spooky quantum-mechanical things are happening where nanowires, semiconductors, and superconductors meet at just a hair above absolute zero. It’s here, down at the limits of physics, that solid materials give rise to so-called quasiparticles, whose unusual behavior gives them the potential to serve as the key components of quantum computers. And this lab in particular has taken big steps toward finally bringing those computers to fruition. In a few years they could rewrite encryption, materials science, pharmaceutical research, and artificial intelligence. This story is part of our March/April 2017 Issue See the rest of the issue Subscribe Every year quantum computing comes up as a candidate for this Breakthrough Technologies list, and every year we reach the same conclusion: not yet. Indeed, for years qubits and quantum computers existed mainly on paper, or in fragile experiments to determine their feasibility. (The Canadian company D-Wave Systems has been selling machines it calls quantum computers for a while, using a specialized technology called quantum annealing. The approach, skeptics say, is at best applicable to a very constrained set of computations and might offer no speed advantage over classical systems.) This year, however, a raft of previously theoretical designs are actually being built. Also new this year is the increased availability of corporate funding—from Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft, among others—for both research and the development of assorted technologies needed to actually build a working machine: microelectronics, complex circuits, and control software. The project at Delft, led by Leo Kouwenhoven, a professor who was recently hired by Microsoft, aims to overcome one of the most long-standing obstacles to building quantum computers: the fact that qubits, the basic units of quantum information, are extremely susceptible to noise and therefore error. For qubits to be useful, they must achieve both quantum superposition (a property something like being in two physical states simultaneously) and entanglement (a phenomenon where pairs of qubits are linked so that what happens to one can instantly affect the other, even when they’re physically separated). These delicate conditions are easily upset by the slightest disturbance, like vibrations or fluctuating electric fields. This blue refrigerator gets down to just above absolute zero, making quantum experiments possible on tiny chips deep inside it. In subsequent photos are scenes from the Delft lab where the experiments are prepared. People have long wrestled with this problem in efforts to build quantum computers, which could make it possible to solve problems so complex they exceed the reach of today’s best computers. But now Kouwenhoven and his colleagues believe the qubits they are creating could eventually be inherently protected—as stable as knots in a rope. “Despite deforming the rope, pulling on it, whatever,” says Kouwenhoven, the knots remain and “you don’t change the information.” Such stability would allow researchers to scale up quantum computers by substantially reducing the computational power required for error correction. Kouwenhoven’s work relies on manipulating unique quasiparticles that weren’t even discovered until 2012. And it’s just one of several impressive steps being taken. In the same lab, Lieven Vandersypen, backed by Intel, is showing how quantum circuits can be manufactured on traditional silicon wafers. What Is a Quantum Computer? At the heart of quantum computing is the quantum bit, or qubit, a basic unit of information analogous to the 0s and 1s represented by transistors in your computer. Qubits have much more power than classical bits because of two unique properties: they can represent both 1 and 0 at the same time, and they can affect other qubits via a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. That lets quantum computers take shortcuts to the right answers in certain types of calculations. Quantum computers will be particularly suited to factoring large numbers (making it easy to crack many of today’s encryption techniques and probably providing uncrackable replacements), solving complex optimization problems, and executing machine-learning algorithms. And there will be applications nobody has yet envisioned. Practical Quantum Computers Breakthrough The fabrication of stable qubits, the basic unit of quantum computers. Why it Matters Quantum computers could be exponentially faster at running artificial-intelligence programs and handling complex simulations and scheduling problems. They could even create uncrackable encryption. Key Players - QuTech - Intel - Microsoft - Google - IBM Availability 4-5 years Soon, however, we might have a better idea of what they can do. Until now, researchers have built fully programmable five-qubit computers and more fragile 10- to 20-qubit test systems. Neither kind of machine is capable of much. But the head of Google’s quantum computing effort, Harmut Neven, says his team is on target to build a 49-qubit system by as soon as a year from now. The target of around 50 qubits isn’t an arbitrary one. It’s a threshold, known as quantum supremacy, beyond which no classical supercomputer would be capable of handling the exponential growth in memory and communications bandwidth needed to simulate its quantum counterpart. In other words, the top supercomputer systems can currently do all the same things that five- to 20-qubit quantum computers can, but at around 50 qubits this becomes physically impossible. All the academic and corporate quantum researchers I spoke with agreed that somewhere between 30 and 100 qubits—particularly qubits stable enough to perform a wide range of computations for longer durations—is where quantum computers start to have commercial value. And as soon as two to five years from now, such systems are likely to be for sale. Eventually, expect 100,000-qubit systems, which will disrupt the materials, chemistry, and drug industries by making accurate molecular-scale models possible for the discovery of new materials and drugs. And a million-physical-qubit system, whose general computing applications are still difficult to even fathom? It’s conceivable, says Neven, “on the inside of 10 years.” Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.

Photo: Jose Luis Magana / Associated Press WASHINGTON — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: – Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. – Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. – An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. – A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. – A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. – His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly – the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: Trump: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” The facts: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money.   Trump: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” The facts: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.”   Trump: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. The facts: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 – after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.”   Trump: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” The facts: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10.   Trump: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” The facts: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the USD $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by USD $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by USD $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by USD $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   Trump: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” The facts: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade.   Trump: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” The facts: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I – bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching – much less exceeding – the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level.   Trump: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home – from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” The facts: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens.   Trump on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” The facts: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.

The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. Comey disputed the allegation and reportedly asked the Justice Department to publicly denounce the claim, according to media reports. When asked by ABC if Trump accepted Comey’s denial, Huckabee said, "I don't think he does. I think he firmly believes that this is a storyline that has been reported pretty widely by quite a few outlets." Numerous lawmakers, including House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz said there was so far no evidence to support Trump’s claim. The House Intelligence Committee will investigate the allegations, chairman Devin Nunes announced Sunday. ...

Ryzen is undoubtedly going to be massively popular, which is why TweakTown is planning to do several Ryzen builds for testing various categories of hardware performance. We have decided that Ryzen will be a part of our solid state storage reviews going forward; so, if you want to know what level of SSD performance you can expect from your Ryzen build, TweakTown will have the answers you are looking for.     We were able to get some limited hands-on time with Ryzen at GDC (Game Developers Conference) 2017 courtesy of XtremeSystems owner and world class overclocker Charles Wirth, or "Fugger" as he is known to most of the world.   Like all of you reading this, we wanted to see how Ryzen stacks up against Intel in terms of SSD storage performance.     We only had a few hours to test a couple of SSDs on the Ryzen platform so we couldn't run our usual testing suite, but we did get enough that we can get an accurate idea of what you can expect from Ryzen-based SSD storage performance.     Testing Platform   We tested utilizing AMD's top of the line Ryzen R7 1800X running on the AM4 X370 Enthusiast Chipset.     Click here for TweakTown's extensive review of the Ryzen 1800X CPU.     The motherboard we had access to was GIGABYTE's top of the line AORUS AX370-Gaming 5.     The DRAM supplied was Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR 4 3000MHz.     Altogether a top-end Ryzen testing platform. We ran everything at stock speeds and air-cooled. It is important to keep in mind that motherboard was not running on a finalized BIOS so there may be some future improvements that could positively affect performance.

They often fail to see that with such cpus pushed to the mainstream users game developers will be able to design games to work with more cores. There is also another thing , up to now , coding with multiple cpus is a nightmare ;thus, the need for more optimized game engines is required. All in all , the new AMd cpus simply are gamer changer. Despite the fact that I love intel product , this to me means cpus will be a lot cheaper and 2018 will bring interesting changes No it won't. All these chips have done is bring more cores at a cheaper price but end of the day that doesn't change the fact that 4 core 8 thread 6 core 12 thread and 8 core core 16 thread CPUs from Intel have been around for 3 maybe 4 years now and some at a price that isn't that much more than the current top end Ryzen. Has THAT changed games? No not really the best you'll find from any game of the last 5 years is 6 threads, though I am lead to believe that Doom uses whatever it can get it's hands on. So if game developers haven't bothered to change up their game development to take advantage of a CPU that has been readily available for the last 5 years why are they suddenly going to change up their game just because a 'cheaper' CPU with extra cores has appeared on the market? Even worse you have to also take in to account that this new CPU has to establish a market that has been long held by Intel. I suspect that a lot of folk are clutching at straws, that everyone wanted this chip to appear on the scene and just blow what Intel has away and it really hasn't done that. It's good in some areas and worse in others and the best case scenario is everyone agrees that depending on what you want to do with your PC you now have a viable alternative to Intel that you can choose, but some folk just don't want to accept that, they're clutching at developers suddenly making their game engines better, developing the engines for better multi threading, develop their games so that they will work better with the new chip and given that game developers haven't done this so far with an established CPU market why on th earth would they suddenly funnel huge amounts of time and money in to doing it for a CPU that has to establish its place in the market?     The Laughing Ma View Public Profile Find all posts by The Laughing Ma     (#27) Prince Valiant Master Guru     Videocard: GB GTX980 G1 Processor: i5 4670k Mainboard: ASRock Z87 Ex.4 Memory: 8GB Corsair Veng. Soundcard: Essence ST/HD800S PSU: Corsair HX650 Yesterday, 17:15 | posts: 355 Quote: Originally Posted by yasamoka There was no talk of the framerate required for CS:GO to perform smoothly. That sentence revolved around the huge difference when high framerates were involved, indicating a bottleneck of sorts (that I hope would be sorted out very soon). As for that game engine you speak badly of, CS:GO is one of the games with the lowest input latency at equivalent framerates to other games. 300FPS is more in line with keeping that latency as low as possible since it can run so easily on any gaming machine. Higher FPS always makes more sense, even if it's much higher than your refresh rate - frametimes go down, variance goes down, input latency goes down, and the game becomes more fluid than simply running at your refresh rate (e.g. 60 / 144 / 165 / 240FPS). High framerates are what Fast Sync leverages. The more frames you're rendering, the less jitter introduced by Fast Sync (there are so many frames the deltas are much smaller). Also, if your minimum framerate is slightly higher than your refresh rate, with VSync off you get jitter (try playing with 61-62FPS at 60Hz for example) and tearing and with Fast Sync you get (somewhat worse) jitter and no tearing. If you're leaving your framerate go over your refresh rate, it better be a lot higher (ideally a multiple of your refresh rate). Higher framerate and lower latency are always good. I don't quite understand why some people are dismissive of either. I figure they don't know or they've forgotten what it was like to play with CRTs at high refresh rate and PS/2 keyboard and mouse .     Prince Valiant View Public Profile Find all posts by Prince Valiant   (#28) BlueRay Member Guru     Videocard: GTX970 Processor: i5 2500k Mainboard: Gigabyte Memory: 8GB Soundcard: PSU: Corsair AX750 Yesterday, 17:32 | posts: 109 Even though Ryzen is not topping the max fps an i7 7700k can top it's not fr behind nor the gaming performance is terrible. This is far from the Buldozer fail. This is a competitive CPU with some child decease every new platform has. I believe that Ryzen will mature way better into the future than any 4 core Intel is offering. Also we must take account that Ryzen is way more useful in other things except gaming. And even in gaming is useful when you multitask along side with the game like streaming for example or running something in the background. Unfortunately today we test and judge something only by the max fps number forgetting everything else. All these days I spent them watching and reading reviews from every possible source. Be it big and well known reviewers but also lesser known ones. Ryzen is a competitive product and offers great value. If AMD did something wrong this time is that they released the product without waiting for some basic patching and more stable bios. They should have waited a bit more and release a bit later with better Bios and the Windows patch. It's bad when you release something and then promise fixes via patching. It doesn't sound good to the average potential buyer plus the product is not getting the reviews scores it can get.     BlueRay View Public Profile Find all posts by BlueRay   (#29) TheDeeGee Ancient Guru     Videocard: MSI GTX 1070 AERO OC Processor: Intel Core 4770K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z87X-UD5H Memory: Crucial Ballistix LP 16GB Soundcard: SoundBlaster ZxR PSU: Seasonic Platinum 760 Yesterday, 17:57 | posts: 4,881 Quote: Originally Posted by fantaskarsef LN2 overclocking.

This is due to its frequency relations with other interfaces, such as the PCIe. Unlike with Intel's more recent CPUs, there is no asynchronous mode (straps / gears) available, which would allow stepping down the PCIe frequency at certain intervals. The PCIe frequency relation is fixed and therefore it increases at the same rate with the BCLK. Gen. 3 operation can generally be sustained up to ~107MHz frequency and higher speeds will usually require forcing the links to either Gen. 2 or to Gen. 1 modes. Unstable PCIe can cause various issues, such as system crashes, data corruption (M.2 SSDs), graphical artifacts and various kinds of other undefined behavior."

I hope you're right, because this would really kick up the CPU market into another gear & Intel would have to fight to compete. Thing is, only time will tell if this turns out to be the truth. In truth I think any gamer with a 60Hz monitor of any resolution can rest easy that a Ryzen CPU is a good buy, it's just for the folks who want say 90 or 100fps plus on 144Hz monitors where they're better off sticking with Intel for now. In fact, if I was building a new rig with a 60 or 75Hz monitor I'd for sure use a Ryzen CPU - cheaper & more future proof because of all those 8 cores, plus it would be awesome for non-gaming stuff too.     Robbo9999 View Public Profile Find all posts by Robbo9999 Page 2 of 2 < 1 2 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Sarah Tew/CNET Laptops by David Carnoy March 6, 2017 9:00 AM PST @DavidCarnoy Best Buy frequently offers discounts on Apple products, but its "Deal of the Day" for March 6 caught my attention because it's the first time I've seen the latest MacBook Pros on sale. The caveat here is that the $175 discount is for Apple's entry-level $1,500 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is missing the step-up models' Touch Bar. It also has a slower processor (2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5) and integrated Intel Graphics chip (Intel Iris Graphics 540). That $1,325 price tag is still pretty expensive -- Best Buy's open box deals are better -- but if you're in the market for a MacBook Pro, it's worth a look. The deal is for today only but I suspect we'll see this model on sale again in the coming months. It's also worth mentioning that Apple will price match up to 10 percent in its own stores, so you should be able to get that same notebook for $150 off in an Apple Store if you show the Apple sales people the Best Buy ad.

Ford at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va. Steve Helber — The Associated Press file By Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard, The Associated Press Posted: 03/06/17, 9:01 AM EST | Updated: 19 secs ago # Comments WASHINGTON >> The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for:  Big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. Advertisement  Corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making.  An infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities.  A tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency.  A $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president.  His plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.

But a few weeks ago, the Microsoft Store began selling its entry-level Pro 4 without the Pen in the US for the first time. It followed various other retailers who had been offering the same 'no pen' SKU - with the Intel Core m3 model of the Pro 4 tablet - for several weeks before that. Now, though, Microsoft has completely dropped the SKU of that model that includes the Pen in the box. In recent weeks, the Microsoft Store has listed both the standard (with Pen) and 'no pen' SKUs on its Surface Pro 4 page: But the option to buy the Intel Core m3 model with a Pen in the box has now disappeared from the main store listing... ...and the option to buy that model with a Pen is also absent from the 'Configure your device' page on which all of the available product configurations are shown: While the Microsoft Store has dropped the Pen-inclusive Core m3 SKU, you may still be able to find one at other US retailers. But even if you purchase the 'no pen' SKU from the Microsoft Store, the Surface Pen is still available to purchase separately there, priced at $59.99. As with other Surface Pro 4 models, the Type Cover keyboard accessory is also sold separately, priced from $129.99. The Intel Core m3 SKU with the Surface Pen is still listed on the Microsoft Store in other markets, including the United Kingdom, although the SKU that includes the Pen is currently out of stock there, showing an 'Email me when available' button. Oddly, whether you choose to buy the Pro 4 with or without the Pen in the UK, you'll pay the same price of £749. This latest revision to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 line-up comes amid growing rumors that the company is planning to launch a new version of the tablet in the next few months. While the Pro 4 remains popular, it's now 18 months old - and with other devices recently launching with Intel's latest Kaby Lake chips, USB Type-C ports, 4G LTE connectivity, and other features lacking on the Pro 4, many potential buyers are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Pro 5.

Intel Pushes Out More Early DRM Testing Code For Linux 4.12 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 6 March 2017 at 06:06 AM EST. Add A Comment Intel's Daniel Vetter has updated their drm-intel-testing tree with early code to begin testing that should end up being queued for the Linux 4.12 kernel. Now that Linux 4.11-rc1 is out, Intel developers have already turned their sights to Linux 4.12 with beginning to stage the work they hope to see for this next big kernel cycle. Among the work staged right now for Intel DRM testing are atomic improvements, GPU reset improvements, a lot of code improvements, atomic mode-setting being enabled by default, Broxton fixes, color manager support for Geminilake, a lot of early fixes to the Geminilake code delivered in Linux 4.11, and a variety of other internal code improvements.

When it was first released around four years ago, reception was not that great. However, Microsoft made a big leap in terms of features on the Surface Pro. And while everything went silent regarding the upcoming tablet, a new rumor just kept it alive and back in the limelight. Back in October 2016, Microsoft has announced the upcoming Windows 10 update, the Windows 10 Creators. This new version of the OS will centre heavily on user content creations like 3D, virtual reality, and mixed reality. According to PC Advisor, the update will come as early as April this year. Because of this, many believe that Microsoft will also unveil the new Surface Pro 5. Late last year, many Surface Pro fans were a bit disappointed that Microsoft held on to the laptop update. Instead of hearing about it during the previous Microsoft event, they saw other products instead. Windows 10 Creators Update (via microsoft.com) Rumor has it that at the time of the said event, Microsoft is still waiting for Intel to release the Kaby Lake processors to go with the tablet. Furthermore, the software giant is still in the process of ironing out the upcoming Windows 10 update. Now Intel has officially released the Kaby Lake, and since the Windows 10 Creators is already penned for an April release, the Surface Pro 5 could be coming really soon. There is absolutely no reason for Microsoft to delay on the release unless there are major technical issues. And so far, there has been none. Just like in previous iterations, the Surface Pro 5 will sport the i-series processors from Intel. The mid-range version of the product will have an i5 while the high-end will sport the i7 mobile processor. However, many are hoping that Microsoft will expand the system memory to 32GB on the high-end version of the tablet. Furthermore, another thing on the wish list of consumers is a 4K PixelSense display to complement the tablet’s discrete graphics card. It has been more than a year since the last Surface Pro tablet was released. Fans are already getting impatient with the waiting game that Microsoft is playing.

Woodvine on March 4th, 2017 at 5:29 PM 1 of 1 2 of 1 At least 147 U.S. tech companies now publicly oppose President Trump’s so-called Muslim travel ban, including some of the most capitalized and influential corporations in the world, such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel. The backlash from the tech sector began within days of January 26, when President Trump signed his executive order banning certain immigrants from entering the United States, including all Syrian refugees and anyone from seven predominantly Muslim nations. Most recently, Yahoo and Tumblr filed an amicus brief on Friday (February 17), in support of Darweesh v. Trump—one of nearly 50 court challenges to the travel ban. Seemingly, all the other 145-plus tech companies publicly opposed to the travel ban have associated themselves with the well-publicized lawsuit State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump. It is this latter legal action, commonly called Washington v. Trump, which has been blocking implementation of the travel ban since February 3 and which a U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to quash in a unanimous ruling on February 9. In their amicus brief, Yahoo and Tumblr neatly sum up the pro-immigration attitude of all the tech companies opposed to the Trump travel ban: “Immigrants to the U.S. bring with them immense talent and entrepreneurship that help drive the innovation economy. Yahoo was founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo—two Stanford grad students, one from Taiwan and one from Louisiana—so we know firsthand that great things can happen when America welcomes the world’s best and brightest.” However, the tech companies’ arguments against the travel ban are rooted less in warm humanist virtue than in hard economic necessity. The U.S. education system, the companies say, does not produce anywhere near enough Americans with the requisite computer science skills to fill more than a fraction of U.S. tech jobs; therefore it is absolutely necessary to attract a constant influx of the world’s “best and brightest” in order for the tech sector in the United States just to survive, let alone thrive. Keep in mind that opposing a newly-elected president who is carrying out a campaign promise is not—strictly speaking—a good business move; rather it is a sure way to piss off millions of voters/consumers. I take the fact that so many tech companies (almost all of them dependent on consumer sales) have been willing to come out against Trump’s travel ban as proof of two things. That the companies see the travel ban and similar anti-immigration policies as truly threatening their survival and that they can count well enough to know that more U.S. consumers voted for Hillary Clinton (65,844,954, or 48.2 percent) than for Donald Trump (62,979,879, or 46.1 percent). President Trump keeps a divisive campaign promise In brief, U.S president Donald Trump’s travel ban–properly titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States”, which Trump signed on January 26 as Executive Order 13769, does the following: Permanently closes the U.S. borders to all Syrian refugees. Closes the U.S. borders for 90 days to immigrants and travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries (Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen)—including immigrants with valid U.S. visas. After 90 days the list of banned countries will be revised and perhaps even expanded. Suspends for 120 days the troubled U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Caps to 50,000 the total number of refugees allowed in the U.S in 2017. Instant legal challenges On January 30—only four days after the Executive Order was signed—Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson (later joined by the attorney general of Minnesota) was in a Seattle U.S. District Court seeking to have the executive order declared “illegal and unconstitutional”. Ferguson argued that the Muslim travel ban was both discriminatory and directly harmed the interests of the state’s residents as well as the foreign students and lecturers attending state educational institutions. On February 3, U.S. District Judge James L. Robart sided with Washington State and granted a temporary restraining order against key elements of Trump’s executive order. On February 9, a three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, California, unanimously denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the temporary restraining order stopping the U.S. government from enforcing much of the travel ban. This effectively threw the matter back to the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington, where it began. On February 27, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to put a hold on the Washington v. Trump suit seeking to overturn the current travel ban, despite claims by the Trump administration that it is readying a differently formulated travel ban, intended to be immune from judicial challenge. On February 28 it was widely reported that the newly revised travel ban would drop Iraq from the list of banned countries of origin. The U.S. tech sector stands for immigration The U.S. information technology sector only needed to look at itself in a mirror to see why it had to oppose the Trump administration’s specifically Islamophobic and generally xenophobic immigration travel ban: Current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was born in Hyderabad, India. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was a refugee from the former Soviet Union. Current Google CEO Sundar Pichai was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. Twitter’s executive chairman Omid Kordestani was born in Iran. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos‘s step-dad immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was a refugee fleeing the 1978 Iranian Revolution. California entrepreneur Safi Qureshey—a practicing Muslim born in Pakistan—cofounded the (now defunct) U.S. personal computer company AST Research in 1980. And on and on. Besides the gifted foreign-born entrepreneurs and executives mentioned above (some of whom have slowly risen up through the corporate ranks), U.S. tech companies appear to be very dependent on attracting very large numbers of foreign-born computer science graduates, in order to fill positions in middle management and below. It's all thanks to a massive ongoing shortfall in skilled American computer graduates. According to several sources, including the Atlantic, there are  currently about half a million computer jobs to be filled in the U.S. tech sector. But only about 43,000 Americans graduate college annually with the required computer science degrees to fill these jobs. Meanwhile, considerably more than one million  IT engineers graduate in China and India every year, according to Newsweek. The U.S. government has been trying, in fits and starts, to grow the number of American science graduates for decades. Most recently the Obama administration tried hard but was largely unable to convince a Republican-held Congress to approve a package of programs designed to produce more college graduates in the so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. Simply put, the U.S. technology companies which are opposed to Trump’s travel ban say that in lieu of a large-enough pool of sufficiently skilled Americans, they must hire skilled foreign workers. And insofar as the travel ban makes it difficult for U.S. tech companies to attract and keep the best-qualified foreign-born workers, it does real harm to the long-term prospects of the U.S. tech sector, which is a significant segment of the U.S. economy, accounting for millions of good domestic jobs and trillions of dollars of domestic spending. How the tech opposition to Trump’s travel ban evolved First off, on January 31, Amazon and Expedia (both based in Washington state) each filed declarations joining the Washington lawsuit against the travel ban. Amazon’s motion cites the travel ban’s adverse affects on both employees and prospective employees, including a Libyan-born Amazon lawyer with British citizenship, as well as 49 employees born in the seven Muslim-majority countries included in the ban. Expedia’s motion says that the ban could damage its international travel business, considering that at least 1,000 of its customers hold passports from the seven restricted countries. On February 6, 96 U.S. companies filed an amicus brief in support of the suit against the ban, including many of the heaviest hitters in tech: AdRoll • Aeris Communications • Airbnb • AltSchool • Ancestry.com • Appboy • Apple • AppNexus Inc. • Asana, Inc. • Atlassian Corp Plc • Autodesk • Automattic • Box • Brightcove • Brit + Co • CareZone • Castlight Health • Checkr • Chobani • Citrix Systems • Cloudera • Cloudflare • Copia Institute • DocuSign • DoorDash • Dropbox • Dynatrace • eBay • Engine Advocacy • Etsy • Facebook • Fastly • Flipboard • Foursquare Labs • Fuze • General Assembly • GitHub • Glassdoor • Google • GoPro • Harmonic • Hipmunk • Indiegogo • Intel Corporation • JAND, Inc. d/b/a Warby Parker • Kargo Global • Kickstarter • KIND • Knotel • Levi Strauss & Co. • LinkedIn Corporation • Lithium Technologies, Inc. • Lyft • Mapbox • Maplebear Inc. d/b/a Instacart • Marin Software Incorporated • Medallia, Inc. • A Medium Corporation • Meetup, Inc. • Microsoft Corporation • Motivate International • Mozilla Corporation • Netflix • NETGEAR • NewsCred • Patreon • PayPal Holdings, Inc. • Pinterest • Quora • Reddit • Rocket Fuel • SaaStr • Salesforce.com, Inc. • Scopely • Shutterstock • Snap • Spokeo • Spotify USA • Square • Squarespace • Strava • Stripe • SurveyMonkey • TaskRabbit • Tech:NYC • Thumbtack • Turn Inc. • Twilio • Twitter • Uber Technologies, Inc. • Via • Wikimedia Foundation, Inc. • Workday • Y Combinator Management, LLC • Yelp • Zynga.   By the evening of February 6, another 31 companies had reportedly joined the brief, including Adobe Systems, Tesla, and Space X, bringing the total to 129: Adobe Systems Incorporated • Affirm, Inc. • Ampush • Brocade Communications Systems • Bungie • Casper Sleep • Cavium • Chegg • ClassPass • Coursera • EquityZen Inc. • Evernote • Gusto • Handy Technologies • HP • IAC/InterActiveCorp • Linden Lab • Managed By Q • MobileIron • New Relic • Pandora Media • Planet Labs • RPX Corporation • Shift Technologies • Slack Technologies • SpaceX • Tesla • TripAdvisor • Udacity • Zendesk • Zenefits.   Between February 7 and 9 a minimum of 16 more companies joined the Technology Companies amicus brief, bringing the total to at least 145: Akamai Technologies, Inc. • CREDO Mobile, Inc. • DiCentral • Fitbit, Inc. • Groupon • Medidata Solutions • Molecule Software, Inc. • MongoDB, Inc. • Pivotal Software • Postmates • Redfin • Quantcast Corp. • SoundCloud, Inc. • Skycatch, Inc. • SpotHero • WHOmentors.com, Inc.   The late addition of Yahoo and Tumbler on February 17 brings the total to at least 147. The tech companies in Trump’s corner Donald Trump does have his supporters in the tech sector. Notable U.S. technology companies that have not voiced opposition to the travel ban include: AT&T • Cisco • General Electric • IBM • Oracle • Palantir Technologies • Sprint • T-Mobile • Verizon • WeWork. Notably, AT&T, Cisco, IBM, and Palantir do very little or none of their business with the general public. AT&T, in particular, dares not anger Donald Trump because it needs his administration’s approval of its huge merger with Time Warner, the owner of CNN. IBM’s CEO Ginni Rometty is a member of Trump’s business advisory council and in November 2016 wrote an open letter to president-elect Trump on the subject of creating “new collar” jobs, wherein she promised that IBM would bring 25,000 more jobs to the U.S. Oracle’s CEO Israeli-born Safra Catz was part of Trump’s transition team and Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins has gone on record as supporting Trump’s tax reform policies. Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp attended Trump’s tech summit but more to the point, the data mining software company is firmly in the Trump administration’s pocket. Palantir was cofounded by Trump supporter Peter Thiel with backing from Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm and counts the FBI, Pentagon, and IRS among its largest clients. And to paraphrase Intercept, Palantir is providing the engine for Donald Trump’s deportation machine. Is Trump trying to prevent terrorism or cause it? The majority of mass killing incidents in the United States have been committed by citizens born in the United States and the common thread that connects all the terrorists—domestic and foreign—from the Unabomber to Timothy McVeigh to Omar Mir Seddique Mateen to Osama Bin Laden—isn’t nationality or religion, it is the nihilistic surrender to extremism, hate, and murder. Between 1975 and 2015, nationals from five of the banned countries (two Iraqis, six Iranians, two Somalis, six Sudanese, and one Yemeni) were convicted of attempting or executing terrorist attacks on U.S. but all the same, no one from the seven banned countries killed anyone in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil during that period. None of the perpetrators of terrorist attacks in the U.S. claiming 10 or more victims were from one of the seven banned countries. The majority of attacks were committed by people born in the U.S. Over the last four decades, only 20 of 3.25 million refugees have been convicted of attempting or committing terrorism on U.S. soil. Only three Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees—all by Cubans in the 1970s. None of the birth countries of people who have killed people in U.S. (Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia) are affected by Trump’s travel ban. No Muslim-majority countries where the Trump Organization holds business interests, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the U.A.E., and Azerbaijan are affected by the ban. Arguably, only someone ignorant of the actual history of terrorism in the United States could imagine that Trump’s Muslim-centric travel ban could do anything to reduce the threat of such acts on U.S. soil. However, I do not consider Trump to be unintelligent, just uncaring of the larger consequences of his self-centred actions; I see him as someone who would burn down a forest just to warm his little hands. Trump also looks to me like a man in a hurry to start something. His March 2 speech aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier wearing a flight jacket and an admiral’s cap suggests how badly he wants an excuse to dress up as the warrior—Il Duce-style; to clothe himself and his actions in the wardrobe of scoundrels and by that I mean jingoistic “love it or leave it” patriotism. I admit that it’s a terrible thing to suggest, that Trump’s travel ban may be coldly calculated to provoke the very terrorism that it speaks of thwarting; likely it’s just the simpler sort of pandering bigotry that one associates with a populist demagogue of Trump’s stripe. Either way I’m sure that its purpose doesn’t extend much beyond selfish political considerations on Trump’s part. And I agree wholeheartedly with the technology companies opposed to the travel ban that whatever comes of it will be to the expense and detriment of the United States. And you know that something’s really rotten when you find yourself in perfect accord with a bunch of avaricious corporate entities such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Intel.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 6 March 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Wearable computing market grows as gadgets evolve Increasing demand: An athlete demonstrates the New Balance RunIQ fitness tracker watch at an exhibit of wearables by Intel during the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show (CES). — AFP The global market for "wearable" computing such as fitness-trackers, smartwatches, and software-infused ear pieces is growing strong, according to figures release Thursday by International Data Corporation. Shipments of such gadgets hit a new quarterly high of 33.9 million units in the final three months of last year, and were up 25% to 102.4 million for the entire year, according to an IDC Worldwide Wearable Device Tracker report. The market is growing strong as devices evolve from serving singular purposes such as tracking how far a wearer walks to gathering more detailed health data and even having telecommunications service connections instead of relying on being synched to smartphones, the report indicated. Staff of Taiwanese company Viseeo demonstrate Doctor V's alcohol breathalyser function during its demonstration at Wearable Expo in Tokyo — Reuters "Health and fitness remains a major focus, but once these devices become connected to a cellular network, expect unique applications and communications capabilities to becomeavailable," IDC wearables research manger Ramon Llama said in the report. "This will also solve another key issue: freeing the device from the smartphone, creating a standalone experience." New contenders, including companies known for fashion or with specialities such as baby monitoring, are entering a market with established major players such as Apple and Google, according to the reports. "With the entrance of multiple new vendors with strengths in different industries, the wearables market is expected to maintain a positive outlook, though much of this growth is coming from vendor push rather than consumer demand," sais IDC senior research manager Jitesh Ubrani. Improving shipments of ear-worn devices, referred to in the report as "hearables," and clothing with sensors woven in, while still relatively tiny, showed promise that the market is becoming about more than just wrist-worn devices, according to IDC. Fitbit continued to dominate, losing ground but holding on to 19.2% of the market in the final quarter of last year, while Xiaomi's "relentless growth" nearly doubled its share to 15.2%. Apple was in third place with its smart watch, which "proved to be a magnificent success for the company" and accounted for 13.6% of the market during the quarter, according to IDC. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Malaysian shuttlers safe after an eventful flight to Birmingham Pyongyang bans Malaysians from leaving N.

The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. "I'm not sure what it is he is talking about… Perhaps the President has information that is not yet available to us or to the public. And if it's true, obviously we're going to find out very quickly. And if it isn't, then obviously he'll have to explain what he meant by it," Rubio told the CNN. The committee will certainly learn more about the allegations in the coming days, he added, urging for calm and stressing that a report will be written up on the matter and made available to the public. © AP Photo/ Louis Lanzano Prosecutors Suspend DEA’s Unconstitutional Wiretap ProgramRubio took part in the 2016 election but lost the Republican primaries to Trump. The two had a tense relationship during the race but have already met following Trump's January inauguration. The comments come after Trump asked congressional intelligence committees to look into "politically motivated" investigations conducted by the previous administration in the run up to last year's election. The White House statement said this should be carried out as part of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election. The Trump administration has been dogged by accusations of having links to the Russian government, which was accused last year of organizing damning leaks of Democratic Party emails that marred Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. ...

U-blox just completed the US$52.5 million acquisition of Shanghai-based SIMCom’s cellular modem product line, its research and development team, and its customer base. It was U-blox’s biggest-ever takeover. The Swiss company creates wireless semiconductors and modules for consumer, automotive and industrial markets, including GPS technology, GPS chipsets and smart antennas. It is betting on high growth demand in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Seiler calls it a “step-forward” industry in progress toward “smart driving,” or Internet-based driving. U-blox isn’t the only company investing heavily in the sector, which enables people, vehicles and machines to locate exact positions and communicate wirelessly over cellular and other networks. Such systems are regarded as a basic and necessary step in the development of the more ambitious target of “self-driving” cars. Industry giants like Intel, Qualcomm, China Mobile, Baidu, Huawei and start-ups like Mobike and Ofo are entering the sector, which comprises an industry chain from chip design, telecommunications networks and satellite positioning to chip-making and Internet services. The market is no doubt worthy the heavy interest. By 2020, more than 152 million cars are expected to feature Internet-connection functions in location positioning, communications and entertainment. Cars capable of autonomous driving will begin appearing on highways by 2020, according to US-based research firm IHS Automotive. The Internet of Things market in China, which relies on the technology of machine-to-machine communications, is forecast to grow at an average 13 percent annually, topping US$361 billion by 2020, analysts said. China Mobile, the world’s biggest mobile carrier, has partnered with Ericsson Inc and Mobike to adapt the latest location application technology to track bike-sharing in Shanghai. New narrow-band Internet of Things technology can help Mobike users easily locate shared bikes and can assist Mobike in finding lost bikes faster. It also helps China Mobile to improve its network coverage ability by five to seven times, the firms said. Huawei, China Telecom and bike-sharing service provider Ofo also launched similar services last month. The technology used in bike-sharing is seen as a prelude for technologies that will soon be installed in cars. Such technology can be used in parking lots, industrial plants, rural regions and other places without mobile network coverage, said Sweden’s Ericsson, which plans to set up a new Internet of Things research center in Shanghai. Chip giants like Intel and Qualcomm expect new 5G technologies, scheduled to be in commercial use between 2018 and 2020, to become a key catalyst in developing the smart driving industry. Intel has allocated a US$100 million fund for smart driving. It has said it expects more than 100 million Internet-connected cars on the road by 2025, creating a market valued at US$42 billion. The 5G network, offering high-speed connection and improved bandwidth capacity, will push the development of smart driving. By 2025, the average data-transmission capacity of a smart car is forecast at about 750 megabytes per second, creating a “powerful smartphone” on wheels, according to Intel, the world’s biggest computer chipmaker. U-box, which supports various satellite communications systems including GPS and China’s Beidou system, is able to offer location positioning systems on vehicles with an accuracy rate of within one meter. Its more advanced positioning system has a rate within one centimeter, but so far it is available only in some professional sectors, like architecture, at a high cost, the company said. But such location technology is expected to be widely adopted within one or two years, especially in tandem with the advent of 5G technology. That will be a big step forward for smart driving and even self-driving, industry officials said.

Digital Trends Home > Home > Intel patents a 3D camera baby monitor that could… Intel patents a 3D camera baby monitor that could detect breathing patterns By Lulu Chang — March 2, 2017 3:47 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Keeping a watchful eye on a newborn is of the utmost importance to new parents, which could make this 3D camera baby monitor a hit. Even the most watchful parents can’t have their eyes on their newborn at all times, but luckily, they may be getting some help from Intel. A new patent filed on Thursday for a 3D camera system for infant monitoring explains how a proposed device could use a “depth-sensing camera to detect abdomen rise and fall during an infant sleep period, or lack thereof, due to respiratory arrest.” The 3D camera would be able to ascertain some surprisingly minute details, including the “distance between an infant’s abdominal cavity and a camera baseline over time.” Should the baby stop breathing, the device would trigger an alarm to notify parents via smartphone, laptops, tablets, or another device. Moreover, the patent suggests that this futuristic camera would be able to detect when an infant shifts sleeping positions from sleeping on his or her back to the belly, again alerting parents if there is cause for concern. The camera, the Intel team hopes, could help to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which occurs most frequently during sleep and seems to be linked to respiratory issues. More: This non-contact baby monitor gives new parents some peace of mind “Conventional approaches to detecting an infant respiratory problem in real time require physical attachment of devices to the infant,” the patent reads. “A more robust system for infant respiratory monitoring is therefore needed.” While digital cameras certainly already exist in most modern infant monitoring systems, many of these are unable to provide the level of detail that may be required in life-or-death situations. With little image analysis capacities, many of these cameras allow parents a broad overview of the goings-on with their child, but not much by way of specifics like their breathing patterns. The 3D camera, however, could be a solution. It’s unclear as of yet exactly what form this 3D camera will take, but if it does come to fruition, it could come as a huge relief to parents everywhere.

The grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation， established by Intel Corporation co-founder Gordon E. Moore and his wife Betty I. Moore in September 2000， to the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) project will help build 110 new telescopes， so as to creat a much more sensitive array able to detect faint radio signals at a wavelength of 21 centimeters. The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded the team 10 million dollars last year to boost the number of telescopes to 240， a project being built in South Africa that should be completed in 2018， when the Moore-funded expansion will begin. "Expanding HERA will help us map bubbles of ionization around early galaxies in our universe and will extend our ability to find the earliest signs of star formation in our universe，" said HERA lead investigator Aaron Parsons， an associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. The radio waves to be explored by the array can potentially provide a history of the so-called "epoch of reionization，" a period beginning about 400 million years after the Big Bang when the first stars started to form and emitted copious high-energy light that eventually ionized about 90 percent of the hydrogen atoms in the universe. That event allowed starlight to travel uninterrupted through the universe， into telescopes today. The Big Bang， theorized as the beginning of the expansion of the universe， took place approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Using next-generation instrumentation for 21-centimeter cosmology， HERA will probe the 3-D structure of the universe during the very first appearance of stars， galaxies and black holes. The first generation of hot massive stars and black-hole binaries filled the intergalactic medium with X-rays. "These X-rays would have heated up the hydrogen surrounding galaxies and should produce detectable fluctuations in the 21-centimeter line，" Jacqueline Hewitt， lead investigator on the Moore Foundation grant and director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research， was quoted as saying in a news release from UC Berkeley on Monday. "Measurements of the 'epoch of X-rays' power spectrum could， in principle， distinguish between different scenarios for the very first generation of stars." The grant from the Moore Foundation was awarded through the MIT， a member of the HERA collaboration that also includes other U.S. universities and research institutes and two institutes in Italy and South Africa. | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen last Friday also signalled a potentially steeper pace of further rate hikes this year. A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2 percent in January, beating economists’ expectations. US Treasuries fell, pushing yields on the 10-year note three basis points higher to 2.51 percent, while the greenback strengthened. Wall Street weakened. In 1.16pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.01pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4 percent. The Dow fell, led by declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Intel, recently down 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in commercial poultry in the US this year, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement. “Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers’ needs,” Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson, told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

Courtesy Hussein Chalayan Standing out at Paris Fashion Week, the city where the world’s fashion elite have always congregated, is no easy feat. Hussein Chalayan, more a theater director and artist than a mere mortal designer, has been mesmerizing audiences there for the past sixteen years. Chalayan is known for his symbolic runway performances where he draws inspiration from anthropology, architecture and technology (he’s even collaborated with Intel) and translates them into his collections and story-telling presentations. If you haven’t seen a video of his Google Earth cityscape frocks and laser emitting dresses, you haven’t lived. Kim Jakobsen To for Chalayan Courtesy Hussein Chalayan So how does a designer, one who seems to be hard wired for avant-garde creations, tackle an everyday fabric like denim? He makes it his own, which isn’t to say these pieces won’t be hanging alongside the Levi’s in your closet. While the Cyprus-blooded Brit showed his signature Fall/Winter ’17 collection at London Fashion Week, Chalayan brought his sophisticated, tailored denim in various dark shades to Paris. There were jackets, capes and trousers of varying thickness. Never basic, the designer incorporated tear-off labels on garments that allow fashionistas to choose the level of distress they’re after. We were able to briefly catch up with Chalayan during his busy Paris schedule and find out more about his denim approach: You’ve incorporated denim into your collections for many years. How does an avant-garde designer like yourself approach the dressed-down concept of denim? The new collection has the same language that I use in my main line collection, but there are so many ideas that I can represent in denim and I looked forward to reconnecting with certain pieces from my archive for inspiration….. so we referenced our archive denim pieces, remade classics in denim versions and then I mixed some signature pieces in knit and jersey into the collection. The tear-off tag. Courtesy Hussein Chalayan What are the newer details in this collection that we won’t find in previous pieces? The denim collection distincts itself by the signature paper label. The paper is stitched to every garment onto openings or pockets and it can be left intact or torn …it just depends on the look the customer wants. In this way, the paper label makes every piece unique. The white paper label plays a bit with my packaging theme of previous collections and the idea of the “virgin” garment, giving the collection its own identity. Which elements will we see from your archive? The focus of the denim line, as well as my main collection, is timeless styles and silhouettes. For the denim range I’ve revisited iconic archive pieces, like the extended sleeve lengths and a silhouette first seen in my F/W ‘98 show, Panoramic. My favourite pieces from the collection are the classic, oversized jacket, deformed biker trousers and the knitwear. I also love the cropped, simple trousers and the classic shirt without a tail. Simple back pockets leave space for experimental shapes. Courtesy Hussein Chalayan You’ve often said that you pull energy from the world around you. Where did you draw inspiration from for this collection? My inspiration is drawn from a modern reincarnation of ancient values, specifically those endorsed and encouraged by corporate forces. I wanted to convey a sense of protest and celebration …and create empowering forms and styles of dressing simply for the purpose of “self-entitlement.” For both my collections I explored the idea of new, isolated individuals that the current world is generating. I have been thinking a lot about individuality…and erosion in a digital, corporatized age. Denim can be considered a universal fabric. Who is the person wearing your denim line, in your mind? The denim line is younger than the main line, although anyone can wear certain pieces in the collection. It’s just a different thing….you can play with the pieces and mix and match to fit your own personality. Most of the garments in my collection are androgynous…and I was inspired by the metropolitan woman.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen last Friday also signalled a potentially steeper pace of further rate hikes this year. A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2 percent in January, beating economists' expectations. US Treasuries fell, pushing yields on the 10-year note three basis points higher to 2.51 percent, while the greenback strengthened. Wall Street weakened. In 1.16pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent. In 1.01pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4 percent. The Dow fell, led by declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Intel, recently down 1.3 percent and 1.1 percent respectively. Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in commercial poultry in the US this year, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement. “Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don’t expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers’ needs,” Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson, told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system. Shares of Tyson Foods traded 3.4 percent weaker as of 12.07pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a decline of 0.5 percent from the previous close.The UK’s FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.3 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index gave up 0.5 percent, and Germany’s DAX Index dropped 0.6 percent.

Cavium-owned MontaVista Software has advanced its Carrier Grade eXpress (CGX) Linux development platform to version 2.2 with features aimed at 5G, NFV, and IoT. The two-year old CGX is a somewhat scaled down, easier to use version of Carrier Grade Edition Linux, and it’s similarly registered for the Linux Foundation’s Carrier Grade Linux 5.0. However, it has a broader audience than CGE’s high-end networking focus, and offers an option for a minimal build aimed at the Internet of Things. Simplified architecture diagram for Carrier Grade eXpress (click image to enlarge) Like the earlier CGX and CGE distributions, as well as commercial embedded Linux distros, including Wind River Linux and Mentor Embedded Linux, CGX 2.2 is based on Yocto Project code. CGX 2.2 advances to a foundation of Linux 4.9 LTS with Yocto 2.2 and GCC 6.2. As before, GX supports ARM, x86, MIPS, and PowerPC SoCs. It offers BSPs for evaluation boards from AMD (GX-410), Atmel (SAMA5D4), Cavium (ThunderX/X2 and Octeon), and Intel, including Xeon and Atom (up through Apollo Lake) and Quark (Galileo board). BSPs are also provided for Marvell Armada and NXP i.MX6 (via a Variscite DVK-MX6-V2 board), as well as the Xilinx Zynq 7000. CGX 2.2 supports emerging 5G cellular technology in its Data Plane profile, offering low latency and bandwidth optimization, plus capabilities for content caching, heterogeneous network convergence, RAN virtualization, and network slicing. New Network Function Virtualization (NFV) features showcased in the Virtualization profile are said to include improved support for containers, Docker, and KVM, as well as optimized DPDK and ODP data plane support. The IoT profile has been enhanced with “extensive wired and wireless connectivity features, advanced security capabilities and device management features for connecting to the cloud,” says MontaVista. Two other optional profiles are also available. First, there’s a next generation build engine based on MontaVista Integration Platform (MVIP) with virtualized build nodes to scale out automatic builds on GIT commits, and “split build deliverables for higher scalability and effectiveness.” The final profile is a next generation test tool based on MontaVista Test Automation Framework (MVTAF). It offers a self-contained test framework with automatic test cycles on virtual hardware, as well as Real-Time Quality reports. In addition to offering CGL functions like High Availability (HA), field diagnostics, and resiliency, the CGX 2.2 BSPs provide a variety of security features. These include secure boot, update, root of trust, identification, and vulnerability automation.   Further information MontaVista is currently rolling out MontaVista CGX Linux 2.2 to “strategic customers” via an early access program. More information may be found at MontaVista’s CGX product page.   Related posts: MontaVista spins IoT version of its Carrier Grade Linux Wind River Linux profiles step up to Yocto Project 1.7 Commercial embedded Linux distro boosts virtualization Cavium adds OpenWRT support to Octeon III Wind River Linux 8 supports Yocto Project 2.0, Intel Skylake Heterogeneous multicore dev platform targets Linux Mentor Embedded Linux adds SMACK security and IoT support Wind blows Helix Cloud, Pulsar Linux, Rocket RTOS toward IoT Wind River Linux taps Yocto Project 1.7, adds binary option Real-Time Linux shacks up with the Linux Foundation (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

LEAD What Monica Lewinsky's TED Talk Teaches Us About Conquering Stage Fright Scared of speaking in public? You're not alone. Learn how three TED speakers overcame their stage fright and turned fear into excitement. By Fia Fasbinder Fia Fasbinder, CEO of The MOXiE Institute, arms speakers with the tools to deliver killer presentations. With over 15 years of experience in public speaking, classroom instruction, and presentation skill development, Fia teaches speakers to communicate with confidence, clarity and credibility. With a theater degree from NYU and a Masters in Education, Fia is uniquely positioned to render and teach dramatic arts concepts to adult learners. Her unique approach to keynoting utilizes theatrical techniques and performing arts skills in addition to practical, real world knowledge culled from coaching clients at TEDX, UCSD, Qualcomm, Intel and numerous Fortune 500 companies. @moxiespeaker CEO, The MOXiE Institute@moxiespeaker WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement "According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking," comedian Jerry Seinfeld once mused. "Number two is death. Death is number two. This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy." There are plenty of suggestions to overcome general fear, but the fear of public speaking, or glossophobia, is a bit trickier. 75 percent of the U.S. suffers from speech anxiety. That means three out of every four people would rather not talk in front of the other four. As Mark Twain famously said, "There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars." Statistically speaking, he's definitely right. Not even the professionals get off easy when it comes to public speaking. Presenters from TED may look cool, calm and collected. But, it's not that easy. In his book, TED curator Chris Anderson discusses the many nervous speakers that have passed through TED's wings. Let's take a look at how three notable TED speakers overcame their speech anxiety on that little red circle. Their techniques will help shed light on speaking techniques that you can use the next time you have pre-presentation jitters. Monica Lewinsky: Know What You Say Matters Chris Anderson's book talks about the great fear Monica Lewinsky felt before and during her TED Talk. After years of public ridicule and shame, Monica Lewinsky decided to come forward. "'The shame sticks to you like tar,' she told The Guardian." This was her chance to set the record straight about her shame. But would everyone's preconceived thoughts drown out her words? But Monica Lewinsky knew that what she had to say mattered. In fact, she wrote it at the top of the notes she brought on stage. Every time Lewinsky glanced at the music stand that held her papers, she saw, "THIS MATTERS." Realizing the importance of your message minimizes your fear. You shouldn't be nervous--your audience wants and needs to hear what you have to say. Your message is more important than your fear. Write down your specific message and why it is important. This will be your fuel to power through fear. Write down your specific message and why it is important. This will be your fuel to power through fear. Daniel Hardman: The Funny Side of Fear What is the opposite of fear? Humor? Laughter? Both? Daniel Hardman's struggle with anxiety taught him to laugh at fear. A stand up comedian and neuroscience student, Hardman took a step back and found humor in the situation at hand. Hardman rationalizes the irrational. You can do the same. Humor is the great unifier. Besides humanizing a speaker, humor also creates perspective. Laughing reduces anxiety, but also allows a speaker to step back and say, "I'm so worked up...over what?" "Control is an illusion," Hardman says. Knowing this lets a speaker throw caution to the wind. Try finding the humor in your situation. We're all in this together--let's laugh about it. Right now, take a moment to step back from your speech and find the angle that makes it all funny. Humor comes from oppositions and contradictions: what aspects of your speech push against each other? This is the breeding ground for comedy. Joe Kowan: "I Have Never Been More Terrified...Until Now" Joe Kowan, a graphic designer and musician, had a problem. He craved connecting with an audience through his music--not an unusual goal for an artist or speaker. His issue: his intense fear of public speaking. In his TED Talk, Kowan talks about his "flight or fight" response to performing for crowds. How did he overcome it? He didn't. Instead, Kowan incorporated his fear into his act. "By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening," Kowan explains, "that gave the audience permission to think about it. They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous--they could experience that with me." Embracing his stage fright allowed Kowan to perform his set. To overcome your own speech anxiety, use your fear. Turn that nervousness into excitement. Doing this will stop your fear from inhibiting you. Make it an asset. How do you turn fear into excitement? It comes back to your message. Be excited to deliver it because of its importance. Know the significance of your message. Find humor in your situation. Embrace fear. By doing all three, you'll not only overcome your stage fright, you'll rise above it. Talk like TED: don't let anxiety get the best of you--let fear make you better. Enjoy the experience and benefit from that enjoyment on stage. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Mar 6, 2017 Advertisement

Page 1 of 6. 39 Comments Our latest Ryzen Linux benchmarks are looking at the impact of the CPUFreq scaling driver's governors have on the performance of the Ryzen 7 1800X, including a look at the power consumption and performance-per-Watt when changing the governors. ACPI CPUFreq is what takes care of the CPU frequency scaling for AMD Ryzen processors on Linux to switch between the high and low-power states depending upon load (there isn't any AMD-specific driver for modern AMD CPUs, unlike Intel's P-State driver). On most Linux distributions like Ubuntu, ondemand is the default CPUFreq governor. For this article I tested the Linux 4.10 kernel with CPUFreq's ondemand, performance, schedutil, powersave, and conservative governors. Some basic/quick information about the each of them: Ondemand - Commonly the default, it scales the the driver based on current load and will usually go to the highest state then dropping back as deemed appropriate. Performance - Aiming for running the CPU at its maximum frequency. Schedutil - Schedutil is the newest governor and it's about making use of information from the Linux kernel's scheduler to try to better change the CPU frequency in a timely manner based on the scheduler utilization metrics. Powersave - Powersave is a common governor for those looking to extend their battery life or reduce power consumption by running at the lowest frequency state for longer periods of time. Conservative - This is similar to powersave in its approach and prefers running at lower frequencies for longer periods of time. These tests happened on the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X system while using the Linux 4.10 kernel with Ubuntu 17.04 x86_64. During the testing process, the Phoronix Test Suite was monitoring the AC system power consumption using a WattsUp Pro power meter and also auto-generating performance-per-Watt data points.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / PC / Zotac’s new Nano mini-PC now sports Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of RAM Zotac’s new Nano mini-PC now sports Kaby Lake CPUs and up to 32GB of RAM Matthew Wilson 13 hours ago PC Zotac’s Kaby Lake powered gaming series of Zbox mini-PCs from earlier this year were certainly impressive on paper but not everyone requires a GTX 1070 inside their palm-sized system. So to cater to those who perhaps don’t need the gaming horsepower, this week Zotac is introducing the ZBox Nano, featuring Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs, up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM and more all inside of Zotac’s smallest chassis yet.   If you’re wondering just how small the ZBox Nano is, then here are the exact dimensions: 5.76 (H) x 4.98 (W) x 2.36 inches (D). For IO, the system carries dual ethernet ports, four USB 3.0 ports, DisplayPort and HDMI. In terms of under the hood specifications, there are configurations with an Intel Core i5 7200U and an Intel Core i3 7100U depending on how much power you need. In both cases, Intel HD 620 graphics are used which is good enough for 4K resolution support but won’t get you very far with GPU intensive workloads. Aside from that, there are two SODIMM DDR4 slots supporting up to 32GB of RAM at 2133MHz. KitGuru Says: This system isn’t quite as impressive as the ZBOX Magnus, which is just a tad bigger but packs a powerful graphics card. However, not everyone will need that sort of gaming horsepower, so it makes sense to offer something a little dialled back at a lower price.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags news ZBOX Nano Zotac Previous G2A is now partnered with more than 100 developers for G2A Direct Next Nvidia GTX 1080Ti benchmark results leak out ahead of reviews Check Also This month’s Humble Bundle is all about benchmarking The Humble Bundle is often a great place to get some deals on games and … NicoleBrooks11 <- I profited $104k in last 12 months by freelancing from my house a­­n­­d I did that by wor­king part time f­o­r 3 or sometimes more hours /daily.

A Commerce Department report showed US factory goods orders rose 1.2% in January, beating economists' expectations. US Treasuries fell, pushing yields on the 10-year note three basis points higher to 2.494% from 2.492 on Friday, while the greenback strengthened. Wall Street weakened. At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 51.37 points, or 0.2%, to 20,854.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 5849.17 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slid 0.3% to 2375.31. The Dow fell, led by declines in JPMorgan Chase and Intel shares, down 1.0% and 1.1% respectively. Tyson drops on bird flu report Tyson Foods shares declined as a deadly form of bird flu was found in a Tennessee operation that supplies the largest US chicken producer. This is the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza in US commercial poultry this year, the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said. "Based on the limited scope known to us at this time, we don't expect disruptions to our chicken business and plan to meet our customers' needs," Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman told Bloomberg. State officials quarantined the affected premises and birds on the property will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease, the USDA said, adding that birds from the flock will not enter the food system. Tyson Foods shares traded 3.4% weaker. GM sells Opel General Motors shares declined 0.8% after it said it would take a charge of at least $US4 billion in connection with the sale of its European operations. Shares of France’s Peugeot gained 2.7% after it said it would pay €1.3 billion for GM’s Opel and Vauxhall brands. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a decline of 0.5% from the previous close. The UK's FTSE 100 Index retreated 0.3%, while France's CAC 40 Index gave up 0.5%, and Germany's DAX Index dropped 0.6%. Shares of Deutsche Bank dropped 3.2% after the Germany's biggest lender announced it is seeking to raise about €8 billion by issuing new shares as part of a plan to overhaul its business. "The question is ... whether the bank will need more yet again in a few years," Stefan de Schutter, a trader at Frankfurt-based Alpha, told Reuters. "Until now, none of the restructuring measures have borne fruit." Bucking the trend, Standard Life shares rose 5.7 % after it agreed to acquire Aberdeen Asset Management to form one of Europe's biggest fund managers.

Bernstein, Getty Images) 9115 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 244 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Democrats blasted President Trump's revised immigrant travel restrictions Monday, charging that they remain essentially a "Muslim ban" despite the president's decision to remove Iraq from the list of six countries covered by his executive order. "A watered down ban is still a ban," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who predicted the latest order would face "the same uphill climb" in court. "Despite the Administration’s changes, this dangerous executive order makes us less safe, not more. It is mean-spirited and un-American. It must be repealed." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believes Trump's revised order is better and will "pass legal muster." "I congratulate the Administration for modifying the original order to ensure that it is prospective in application, protective of those with valid visas and legal status, and exempts Iraqis, as five thousand Americans are currently fighting alongside them against (the Islamic State)," Graham said. "I believe the new order will withstand legal challenges as it’s drafted in a fashion as to not be a religious ban, but a ban on individuals coming from compromised governments and failed states." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., dismissed the changes as nothing more than "repackaging." "The Trump Administration’s repackaging has done nothing to change the immoral, unconstitutional and dangerous goals of their Muslim and refugee ban," she said. "This is the same ban, with the same purpose, driven by the same dangerous discrimination that weakens our ability to fight terror." Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who is Muslim, declared on Twitter that "Trump's Muslim Ban is still a Muslim Ban." Trump's Muslim Ban is still a Muslim Ban. https://t.co/WtL7B8eg75— Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) March 6, 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the revised order "advances our shared goal of protecting the homeland." "I commend the administration and (Homeland Security) Secretary (John) Kelly in particular for their hard work on this measure to improve our vetting standards," Ryan said. "We will continue to work with President Trump to keep our country safe." House Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who criticized the Trump administration's abrupt, confusing rollout of its original order, said his committee will be overseeing the president's latest effort to ensure it is handled better. "I have long supported taking bold steps to keep terrorists from entering America," McCaul said. "I look forward to reading the details of the President’s new executive order and conducting oversight to ensure it is implemented smoothly. This month, I am also launching a bipartisan congressional task force focused on closing security gaps that might be exploited by jihadists to sneak into our country, and I hope the Administration will work closely with us to put in place new security checks to protect our people from the threat of terror."

Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted that the new travel order still targets Muslims and is "still illegal." Version 2 of the ban still targets Muslims, still inspires more terrorism, still violates our founding principles. Oh, and still illegal. https://t.co/b80kX16G2D— Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) March 6, 2017 Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Trump's action will "strengthen our immigration and refugee screening process." "It’s refreshing to see an administration that isn’t ashamed to uphold the most important Constitutional responsibility of the federal government: to protect the American people," Gosar said. "We can no longer ignore the facts that leaders from the FBI, National Counterterrorism Center and the Department of Homeland Security have testified before Congress that they do not have the necessary resources to thoroughly vet immigrants and refugees from terrorist strongholds. There is no question that the Constitution and federal law grant the president the authority to take these necessary actions, which will not only protect the homeland but also safeguard refugees and legal immigrants."

The company has steadily increased its open source involvement through Linux Foundation projects such as ONAP, Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Cloud Foundry, Open vSwitch and others. And it has just increased its commitment to open source and The Linux Foundation by becoming a Gold member. dirk_hohndel_vmware_feb_2017.jpeg Dirk Hohndel is Chief Open Source Officer at VMware. Used with permission Open source software helps VMware accelerate its development processes and deliver even better solutions to its customers, said Dirk Hohndel, Chief Open Source Officer at VMware, in the Q&A below. “We see open source components as vital ingredients to our products and are actively engaged in many upstream projects,” Hohndel said. “We also continue to create new and interesting open source projects of our own.” Hohndel leads VMware’s Open Source Program Office, directing the efforts and strategy around use of and contribution to open source projects and driving common values and processes across the company for VMware’s interaction with the open source communities. Before joining VMware, he spent almost 15 years as Intel’s Chief Linux and Open Source Technologist and he’s been an active developer and contributor in Linux and open source since the early 1990s. Here, Hohndel tells us more about VMware; how Linux and open source have become integral to their business; and how they participate in the open source community. Linux.com: What does VMware do? Dirk Hohndel: VMware is a global leader in cloud infrastructure and digital workspace technology. We help our customers to build and evolve scalable production IT environments delivered as an on-prem or hybrid cloud solution that meets their needs. Additionally, we provide customers with modern end-user computing solutions that enable users to access their critical applications, desktops and services using any device or platform. Linux.com:  How and why do you use Linux and open source? Hohndel: VMware uses many open source components as part of the solutions we deliver to our customers. Linux is a key guest (and host) OS that we support and the basis of many customer solutions that run on top of our infrastructure. We see open source components as vital ingredients to our products and are actively engaged in many upstream projects. We also continue to create new and interesting open source projects of our own such as the Project Clarity design system or the Project Harbor container image registry. Linux.com: Why did you increase your commitment to The Linux Foundation? Hohndel: We see The Linux Foundation as one of the key consortia in the broader open source ecosystem. In parallel, we steadily increased our engagements with the various projects and foundations such as ONAP, CNCF, Cloud Foundry, and others under the LF in the past few years. It only made sense to increase our engagement in and support for The Linux Foundation, given the role its projects play in our business. Linux.com: What interesting or innovative trends in technology are you witnessing and what role do Linux and open source play in them?  How is VMware participating in that innovation? Hohndel: The IT infrastructure industry is constantly evolving. More and more of the relevant solutions stacks are built around open source components, and many companies are collaborating on accelerating the transformation of entire industry verticals. The recently launched ONAP Project is an excellent example of this trend and VMware was one of the founding Platinum sponsors of this project. Linux.com: How has participating in the Linux and open source communities changed your company? Hohndel: At its roots, VMware is an engineering driven company. Our engagement with the Linux and open source communities has helped us accelerate our development processes and allowed us to collaborate with other partners and customers in this space to deliver even better solutions. Linux.com: Is there anything else important or upcoming that you'd like to share? Hohndel: For VMware, the upgrade to a Gold sponsorship of the Linux Foundation is an integral part of our open source strategy and a key step on our journey to a more open and collaborative future. We look forward to working across many LF projects in order to create solutions that delight our customers.

The primary aim of TIP is to bring mobile operators, infrastructure providers, system integrators, and other technology companies together to collaborate on the development of new technologies and reimagine traditional approaches to building and deploying telecom network infrastructure. Operators and the broader telecom industry need to collaborate, be more flexible, innovative and efficient, and TIP looks to help achieve this goal. As a pioneer in telecommunications in the Middle East and Africa, Zain brings vast expertise and resources to the initiative as it will leverage its regional footprint and experience in network deployments across challenging territories to support TIP. TIP is exploring new approaches and technologies across these initial focus areas: access, backhaul, and core and management. The projects within these areas utilize the unique engineering and operational expertise of each member, focusing on developing new technologies and exploring new approaches to deployment in both developed and emerging markets. Each member contributes to the area of its expertise, while learning from others so that together all parties can collaborate and build better, faster, more efficient systems. Commenting on becoming a part of the TIP initiative, Scott Gegenheimer, Zain Group CEO said, “It could be argued that scaling traditional telecom infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband data is not moving as fast as it needs to ensure customers receive the mobile experience they demand and deserve. Zain recognizes there isn’t a single solution for this, and that no one company can tackle the problem alone. We firmly believe collaboration in innovation will drive efficiencies in our business and we are keen to be part of such prime opportunities wherever they may arise.” Gegenheimer continued, “Being a staunch advocate of the expansion of connectivity for all, Zain fully appreciates the power the internet has to enhance and empower the communities it serves. There are 4 billion people in the world who still don’t have a data connection and we commend Facebook and the other founding companies for kick-starting TIP. We have high expectations that this initiative will result in bridging the digital divide by greater inclusion, and call on for more of our regional and industry peers to join us in this initiative.” Since the launch of TIP in February 2016, the initiative has achieved numerous milestones including the creation of ‘TIP Ecosystem Acceleration Centers’ that incubate local talent around the world and accelerate product development through support from leading global and local investors. A ‘People and Process Project Group’ was also created in order to develop and share cultural and process transformation best practices that can improve operators’ key metrics. In addition, Facebook contributed Voyager, the industry’s first white-box transponder and IP/MPLS routing solution that was successfully tested. Furthermore, Facebook’s OpenCellular designs and schematics are now fully open source within TIP to accelerate the industry’s ability to provide wireless access in remote areas of the world. Driving a faster pace of innovation in telecom infrastructure is necessary to meet new technology challenges and to unlock new opportunities for everyone in the ecosystem. Flexibility will be key in everything TIP does though and the goal is to allow mobile network systems to evolve without having to start over. Zain, together with other leading industry entities across the globe, are committed to exploring new technologies and approaches that will positively impact mobile users of today and the future.

Earlier, they were of opinion that the technology, which is 10-100 times faster than 4G, would debut only by 2021. Many countries across the world is working for the technology’s faster rollout and its India debut would not be far behind. “Experiments have started, I was thinking of 2021, but it looks like 2019 now. Lots of things are getting ready and 5G is going to come in much faster. We will see commercial rollouts in 2019, while 2020 will see a lot of action. In India, 5G application is more of an Internet of Things (IoT),” Bharti Airtel Chairman and Managing Director Sunil Bharti Mittal said.Wireless tech Apart from the high-speed broadband speeds, 5G is the latest wireless technology that promises connections without drops nor latency and facilitates complex mobile internet applications. The high-end applications that the technology, which is still under in development, would range from remote driving to advanced healthcare and agriculture among others. “India is also ready for the technology, with all the policies in place,” Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma said, adding that a lot of operators and vendors are conducting experiments and use cases. The biggest bottleneck for the industry – operators, chip-makers and device manufacturers – is the need of a standard technology and protocol. Sensing the urgency, a number of industry players under the aegis of the specifications group 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is slated to meet in a couple of weeks to thrash out a common standard. The companies that have promised to reach a standard for 5G included a mix of wireless carriers, chip providers and device makers — such as Intel, Qualcomm, Intel, AT&T, Sprint and Deutsche Telekom – all of them part of the 3GPP standards group. Qualcomm is readying for 5G rollout, with its earlier launch of Snapdragon X50 5G modem. It has also collaborated with Ericsson and Vodafone for 5G trials, while device-makers such as ZTE and Ericsson and operators such as Telstra and DoCoMo are also ready for the challenge.Seamless transformation “We will be completely ready by 2019. However, the success of 5G would depend upon the seamless transformation from 4G to 5G, while countries such as Germany, Japan and America are moving much faster on this line,” Cristiano Amon, Executive Vice- President at Qualcomm, said. Spectrum for the technology is also not finalised. Operators are experimenting with various frequencies such as 600-700 MHz (Europe), 3.4-3.6 GHz (China) and 4.4-4.9 GHz (Japan) among others. “It’s not an overnight emergence of 5G, as there is a 10-year research cycle leading up to its culmination,” Magnus Ewerbring, chief technology officer-APAC region at Ericsson, said. “We wouldn’t be seeing massive deployments in 2019, as there is a lot of complexity to the technology. However, this is a good start,” Julie Coppernoll, vice-president, client computing at Intel, which has several chairs on 3GPP, said.

But if it today's consumers won't bring it into their homes, tomorrow's might find it already there. By Ross Rubin | March 6, 2017 -- 17:46 GMT (09:46 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things Apple's Home app. (Image: Apple) Following mixed results in turning watches and TV into platforms, and statements from Tim Cook that the smartphone-sized opportunity of augmented reality is more of a core technology than a product, and rumors that its self-driving car efforts have been stalled, does Apple have a next killer product? And if there isn't one per se, does Apple have a strategy for the Internet of Things? Read this IoT security under scrutiny as Apple looks at smart home system Internet of Things security is under scrutiny as Apple moves to introduce its smart home system and Google works to expand its suite of web-enabled home devices. Read More It does not, at least in the vein of a communication platform from ambitious cross-industry bodies such as the Open Connectivity Forum, which hatched from two rival industry standards groups driven by chip giants Intel and Qualcomm, or an operating system such as Android Things, the latest IoT evolution from its main ecosystem competitor. But what Apple does have is HomeKit. It's here. It works. It's well thought-out. And as far as consumers go, it may be enough. The software developer kit, which lets developers of objects communicate with Apple products, received a consumer face with the launch of the Apple Home app. And Apple recently launched a new website to make it easier for consumers to learn more about it and navigate what can be a complex functionality. With its supported devices, HomeKit delivers just about everything a digitally controlled and communicating home might want -- from the basics of door locks and thermostats to blinds that react to motion sensors and other triggers. For example, one can have the lights come on and the temperature rise when the door lock is opened, and we can expect to see all kinds of standalone buttons and gesture detectors that plug into the technology. A recent addition is support for cameras such as those from D-Link. HomeKit has also woven other elements of its technology platform into the picture. Chief among these is Siri, which is vying with Amazon's Alexa to be the premiere voice interface for object control. Apple here is staying true to its reputation for detail and security. Siri will not ask you to blurt out a password to authenticate, and it's using radio-free, camera-based code scanning to avoid "man in the middle" attacks. The company also works closely with vendors of products such as the Philips Hue to best interpret a wide range of spoken options for its bulbs that can display millions of colors. Of course, the Home app on iOS brings the iPad and iPhone into the mix. And Apple TV can act as a scheduling agent when those devices aren't within range to turn products on and off. And really any product hosting Siri becomes a complement for CarPlay and Apple Watch, Siri's homes in the car and on the wrist. One recently opened Apple technology that isn't get playing into HomeKit is iMessage. It promises to be a key play for Apple should we begin having conversations with inanimate objects even if the bloom is starting to fade from the chatbot rose. However, much like extended Siri conversations, these would likely be limited to a follow-up question or two for clarification rather than having to feign empathy for your refrigerator emotionally blubbering out its latest bout with frost build-up. Another critical part of the Apple success formula that hasn't been fully leveraged for HomeKit is the Apple stores. Sure, they sell a number of HomeKit-compatible products, but it's difficult to demonstrate them live without, say, the lights in the store flashing on and off as they might under the fingers of a curious five year old The dream of home automation is an old one. Former PC Magazine editor and now Ziff Brothers investment analyst Mark Miller once told me that the first article he ever published was on home automation. That was in 1979. The upending of home automation from holistic security-derived systems to app-enabled smartphone accessories on open standards has surely allowed more people to experiment with elements of home control. This has encouraged traditional security vendors such as ADT and Vivint to begin supporting products like the Echo. But Apple may not even need to sell to customers directly. Much as it has worked with automakers to preinstall CarPlay support, it is now working with home builders to install a stub of HomeKit-enabled devices, say, a door lock, thermostat, and lights, into new homes so that future homeowners will find a series of companion products waiting for them to control when they are given the keys. Or, rather, the Wi-Fi passcode that will let them remotely control the door locks. HomeKit represents an Apple in transition. It is a company that is still focusing on its own products and their attendant operating systems to be sure. But it is also looking at opportunities to become a platform provider beyond its own app store. That may not make Apple an infrastructure company, but it continues to serve its customer and build loyalty while competitors are still at the starting gate.

Trump’s Immigration Policy Threatens Asians Working in Silicon Valley Asians in Silicon Valley, whether CEOs or undocumented workers, will be impacted by the new policies. In Silicon Valley, where 60 percent of foreign-born individuals hail from India, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other Asian countries, the outcry against President Trump's anti-immigration stance has been especially high-profile. And the latest immigration rules, rolled out in the last few days, have many communities on edge. On Friday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency announced that it would suspend the H-1B visa program, one of the main routes to employment for immigrants sponsored by tech companies. Then Trump signed a new executive order on Monday banning entry from six countries: Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. These new rules will weaken the Asian community in the US, and its powerful contribution to the technology industry in the US. Throughout 2015, Asians made up 27 percent of the workforce at Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn, and Yahoo (though they were underrepresented in managerial and executive-level positions). In recent years, they've also made gains in the C suite with Google's Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, and Microsoft's Indian-born CEO, Satya Nadella. Microsoft, Google and Amazon were in the top 20 companies that sponsor immigrant workers through H-1B visas, according to My Visa Jobs. But less visibly, thousands of low-paid foreign workers on H-1B visa programs also work to keep Silicon Valley running. Many work as janitors, security guards, maintenance employees, or cooks to support their families. And often for a less-than-livable wage. When the first wave of travel ban and immigration rules was announced under the Trump administration, more than 100 tech companies, included Apple and Facebook, joined together to sign an amicus brief opposing the executive order. These companies are likely to speak out again since the latest rules are just slightly scaled-back versions of those announced earlier, though several of them also seek to benefit from the Trump administration. "The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees," it read. "It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States." Meanwhile, the administration's crackdown on undocumented workers will also upend the communities in and around Silicon Valley. There are an estimated 1.6 million undocumented Asian immigrants in the valley—a number that may be surprising to some—according to AAPI Data. They account for roughly 14 percent of the entire undocumented population, and have remained largely invisible compared to other minority diaspora. "Undocumented immigration is clearly not just a Latinx issue, but also a deep AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islanders] one too," Gregory Cendana, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA), told Motherboard. Trump's newest immigration rules, which seek to deport anyone in violation of immigration laws, not just those with criminal records, will impact almost all immigrant communities. The measures detailed in two Department of Homeland Security memos introduced in February outline a policy that looks similar to President Obama's, but with greater and more severe law enforcement mandates. Together, first and second-generation Asian Americans (in many cases, children and their immigrant parents) amounted to 37 percent of their racial demographic in 2012, a Pew Research Center census found. The combination of stripped-down visa programs and law enforcement will undoubtedly alter the communities that comprise Silicon Valley, and weaken some economic sectors supported by Asian immigrants.  But maybe that's what Steve Bannon wants.

The original Microsoft Surface Book was quite a stunner. Being a rather unexpected device from the tech giant, the first-generation Surface Book boasted impressive specs and a unique design that is both innovative and attractive. Fast forward to October, 2016, and the Surface Book i7 with Performance Base was unveiled, which made the hybrid device even more powerful. With the successful run of its first homegrown flagship laptop, it is pretty much certain that Microsoft would be releasing a follow-up to the powerful machine in the near future, in the form of the Surface Book 2. While details about the Surface Book 2 are pretty scarce, for now, speculations are high that the next flagship laptop from the tech giant would be a formidable device. With this in mind, here are three things that Microsoft must do in order to ensure the Surface Book 2 becomes a success among consumers. Give The Surface Book 2 More Power While the current iteration of the Surface Book already has ample power to stand toe-to-toe with the best that the industry has to offer, it would be beneficial to Microsoft to release the Surface Book 2 with the latest 7th-generation Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processors, according to a T3 report. By doing so, Microsoft would be able to ensure that the Surface Book 2 is capable of delivering flagship-grade performance to its users. After all, the main draw of the device itself is unparalleled power. https://t.co/iZL3Ba93GM : #SurfaceBook2 #Laptop – Surface Book 2 Release Date: #Microsoft Surface Book Discount Hints Upcoming Launch pic.twitter.com/9xkpX6wNRV — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) February 11, 2017 The original Surface Book wowed users and critics alike with its performance, and while the device in itself had a few notable quirks, it was nonetheless one of the best devices released for its generation. In order to continue the series’ momentum and live up to the reputation of the Surface brand, the Surface Book 2 must be the most powerful portable device that Microsoft would release to date. Equip The Surface Book 2 With Bigger Batteries The first-generation Surface Book was a stunning machine that offered performance beyond what is offered by its biggest rivals. Despite this, however, one of the things that users of the device complained about was the fact that the Surface Book simply did not have enough juice for real portable productivity. The Surface Book was capable of detaching its screen as a tablet, and while the feature was useful, the display’s measly four hours of battery life severely limited the flagship’s real-world usefulness, according to a TechRadar report. Thus, for the Surface Book 2, Microsoft must make it a point to release a device that performs well and could last a good amount of time. After all, endurance is something that tech users are very particular about. The continued existence of long-lasting, but otherwise outdated machines such as the Apple MacBook Air, which boasts as much as 13 hours of battery life, is proof of this. Thus, for the Surface Book 2, Microsoft should aim for about nine- to 10-hours of battery life at the very least. https://t.co/jeinIGaAJb : #SurfaceBook2 #SurfacePro5 – #Microsoft Surface Book 2 Coming With Surface Pro 5 In March? Predecessor's $200 … pic.twitter.com/aXiMg5mkDZ — SndyAaron (@SndyAaron) January 27, 2017 Feature A More Solid Design In a lot of ways, the first-generation Surface Book was a prototype device that was created largely to test the market’s response to the hybrid’s concept. This is quite evident in the machine’s quirks and imperfections, such as its poor battery life and the distracting, rather annoying gap created by the device’s Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge when the hybrid is closed. Thus, for the Surface Book 2, it would be best if Microsoft ensures that the design of the upcoming device is solid, sleek, and attractive at the same time. The Surface line of devices have always been beautifully built and designed, and nothing less would be acceptable for the Surface Book 2. Microsoft should at least ensure that the Surface Book 2 would close like a normal laptop, without any noticeable gaps. The Surface Book 2 is rumored for release sometime during the first half of the year. Pricing for the upcoming flagship has not been revealed, though speculations are high that just like its predecessor, the Surface Book 2 would be offered at a premium price, worthy of its specs and features.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 06, 2017 12:00pm   Comments Share: LOUISVILLE, Colo., March 06, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The 2017 Design and Verification Conference and Exhibition U.S. (DVCon U.S.), sponsored by Accellera Systems Initiative, concluded last week with attendees inspired by the many in-depth technical tutorials, panels, poster sessions and keynote address offered during the four-day program.  The sold-out DVCon Exposition was a gathering place for many attendees in the afternoon to share ideas and connect with colleagues.  Overall attendance, including exhibit-only and technical conference attendees, was 775.  Attendance was further enhanced by 276 exhibitor personnel that also had access to the panel sessions and keynote address, for a total of 1,051 participants.  "In its 29th year, DVCon U.S. 2017 concludes another successful conference," said Dennis Brophy, DVCon U.S. General Chair.  "DVCon's popularity to the practicing design and verification engineer has led to a global expansion of the conference to four venues around the world with more than 2,000 attendees this past year.  As we share best practices on electronic system design and verification, and foster discussion on current and emerging standards and technology, the DVCon conferences have become the must-attend events to learn about state-of-the-art methods." The Award for Best Paper Presentation, as voted by conference attendees, went to Stan Sokorac, ARM, Inc. for his presentation titled, "Optimizing Random Test Constraints Using Machine Learning Algorithms."  Second place was awarded to Eldon Nelson, Intel Corp. for his presentation, "Improving Constrained Random Testing by Achieving Simulation Verification Goals through Objective Functions, Rewinding and Dynamic Seed Manipulation," and third place was awarded to Honghuang Lin, Zhipeng Ye and Asad Khan, Texas Instruments, Inc. for their presentation, "Machine Learning based PVT Space Coverage and Worst Case Exploration In Analog and Mixed-Signal Design Verification." Top honors for Best Poster went to Johannes Schreiner, Felix Willgerodt and Wolfgang Ecker, Infineon Technologies for their poster, "A New Approach for Generating View Generators."  Second place was awarded to Daniel Hansson and Patrik Granath, Verifyter AB for their poster, "Automatic Debug Down to the Line of Code," and third place was awarded to Jacob Maas, Nirabh Regmi, Ashish Kulkarni and Krishnan Palaniswami, Microsoft Corp. for their poster, "End to End Formal Verification Strategies for IP Verification." "We congratulate our Best Paper and Best Poster Winners for 2017," stated Tom Fitzpatrick, DVCon U.S. Program Chair.  "When you consider the high quality of the papers and posters accepted for the DVCon U.S. technical program, being judged one of the ‘best of the best' is quite an accomplishment. We are very proud of the breadth and depth of the papers and posters submitted on such a broad range of leading-edge topics to create such an exciting conference for our attendees. I would also like to thank my colleagues on our Technical Program Committee for their untiring efforts in working with our authors to ensure that all papers and presentations provide the level of technical information that our attendees have come to expect when they come to DVCon."  Highlights of the Week: Accellera Day opened the conference on Monday morning to a packed audience eager to learn more about the emerging Portable Stimulus standard.  Tom Alsop, a Principal Engineer at Intel, was recognized during the Accellera-sponsored luncheon as the recipient of the sixth annual Accellera Technical Excellence Award.  He served as co-chair of the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) Working Group for eight years and is currently chair of the IEEE P1800.2 UVM Working Group. On Tuesday Dr. Anirudh Devgan, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Digital & Signoff Group and System & Verification Group at Cadence, delivered the keynote, "Tomorrows Verification Today," and Harry Foster, Chief Scientist for Mentor Graphics, presented a special session, "Trends in Functional Verification: A 2016 Study" that provided some invaluable insight into the state of today's electronics industry. For a copy of either presentation, visit the DVCon U.S. homepage.  There were two panels on Wednesday.  The first panel, "Users Talk Back on Portable Stimulus" provided some lively discussion regarding how to shape and get involved in the development of the emerging standard.   The second panel, "SystemVerilog Jinxed Half My Career: Where Do We Go from Here?" was well-attended and offered interesting perspectives on the impact of the standard. Thursday provided attendees with a full day of sponsored technical tutorials to choose from. The DVCon Steering Committee values all feedback regarding the conference.  Attendees have been given a survey and are asked to provide input on how to make DVCon U.S. 2018 even better. Save the date:  DVCon U.S. 2018 will be held February 26-March 1 at the DoubleTree Hotel in San Jose, California.  DVCon China 2017 will be held April 19 in Shanghai, China; DVCon India 2017 will be held September 14-15 in Bangalore, India; and DVCon Europe 2017 will be held October 16-17 in Munich, Germany.

They are advancing the cause by investing in new technologies. Amazon is the latest to do so, saying that it will install rooftop solar systems at 15 locations in five different states this year and that it is planning to deploy solar systems on 50 fulfillment and sortation centers globally by 2020. The combined capacity of the initial solar projects that will go up this year will be 41 megawatts. The facilities where the solar systems will go will be in California, Delaware, Maryland, Nevada and New Jersey, it says. Amazon adds that the projects could produce as much as 80% of a location’s annual electricity. “As our fulfillment network continues to expand, we want to help generate more renewable energy at both existing and new facilities around the world in partnership with community and business leaders,” said Dave Clark, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, in a formal statement. “We are putting our scale and inventive culture to work on sustainability—this is good for the environment, our business and our customers. By diversifying our energy portfolio, we can keep business costs low and pass along further savings to customers. It’s a win-win.” The company has invested in wind energy as well in locations around the country: Ohio, Indiana and Texas, to name three. Altogether, it said that it will generate 3.6 million MWh of renewable energy. Internet giants are voracious consumers of energy, not just to keep the lights on but to power their data centers as well. Last December, Google said it would be using carbon offsets this year to pay for the renewable energy programs it plans to implement at its data centers. Intel is doing the same. “We are involved up and down the value chain,” says Mike Bates, global energy director for Intel, whose company’s data centers are starved for energy. It’s about helping the United States reduce its carbon emissions. And it’s also about creating goodwill in the communities where Intel operates as well as among the customers who buy its products. America’s Internet dynamos have pledged to consume nearly all of their electricity from sustainable sources. Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft filed a brief favoring the Clean Power Plan, which aims to cut carbon emissions by 32% by 2030. The four own more than 50 data centers in 12 states.  The high-tech companies “have committed to consuming energy in an environmentally responsible way and, specifically, to reducing the carbon footprint associated with their operations,” says their brief. “Because the Clean Power Plan reflects reasonable expectations about the operations of the electricity market and the increasing use of renewable energy,” the group supports the plan.

(AMD) Stock Is Still a Buy on Any GOOD Dip New hardware from Advanced Micro Devices fell short of the hype, but don't jump to conclusions yet By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Mar 6, 2017, 10:20 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy in March 8 of the Most Overrated Stocks on Wall Street Right Now Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Is Even Worse Than Q4 Earnings Suggest Recent Posts: Why Snap Inc (SNAP), Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (DB) and American Airlines Group Inc (AAL) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Did General Motors Company (GM) Discount Too Deeply? 3 Reasons T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS) NEEDS to Merge With Sprint Corp (S) View All Posts To say last week was a tough one for owners of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) would be a considerable understatement. It was an awful week, with AMD stock giving up nearly 15% of its value since the prior Monday’s close. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr The setback was spurred by news that the company’s new ballyhooed Ryzen processor wasn’t all it was supposed to be. That is to say, it didn’t operate as well as it was expected to, particularly for gamers, who make up a key piece of the struggling PC market. Is this a much-deserved selloff, or does the market just not understand what the Ryzen was supposed to be for AMD? It’s a little of both. At the end of the day though, the future for Advanced Micro Devices still looks much better than its past. Advanced Micro Devices’ Ryzen Disappoints, But … Although it wasn’t alone in its disappointment, it was largely all-things-computer website Ars Technica that did the bulk of the damage to AMD stock last week, when reviewer Mark Walton opined “The [Ryzen] 1800X lags behind its Intel counterparts in gaming, regardless of whether it’s running at the same clock speed or higher.” PCWorld and PC Gamer were also unenthused, saying games didn’t play as well on the hardware as had been hoped. Those tests, however, weren’t entirely fair. Chief among the important footnotes is that the games being used to perform those trials weren’t likely optimized to operate on the new Ryzen CPU. It’s an overlooked nuance of the PC gaming market, but that software is designed to run on a specific set of hardware (or several different configurations of hardware). As AMD CEO Lisa Su recently explained, “What we’re doing with the high-end is putting an 8-core processor out there, where today most games use only 4 cores. So, there’s some software tuning that needs to be done.” Even then, though, owners of AMD stock may not be correctly assessing the situation. The Rest of the AMD Story While Ryzen may have missed the mark, it was a tainted trial. Aside from the lack of games being written specifically with the Ryzen’s new architecture in mind, the new CPU is only one part of a one-two punch combination Advanced Micro Devices has been developing for quite some time now. The second half of that combination is the new graphics-processing unit called Vega. As I explained back on Jan. 12: “The Vega platform employs a whole new kind of thinking about the way a machine handles all the video-based demands put on it. Its second-generation high bandwidth memory (or HBM2) is a stacked memory architecture that performs significantly better than the more common GDDR5 (double data rate type-five) utilized by most graphics-processing units today. This arrangement allows for a so-called High Bandwidth Cache and High Bandwidth Controller, which effectively offloads the memory work usually performed by a graphics card to that computer’s — the motherboard’s — memory. This means a practically infinite amount of memory can be dedicated to handling the display. The maximum virtualization is capped at a ridiculous 512 terabytes.” It matters, because Vega and Ryzen work very well together. It’s also worth noting that not all of the recent tests of Ryzen were done using a motherboard that favors Ryzen. Future boards will be built from the ground up for both the new CPU and the new GPU.

Howard Fast 06 March 2017 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments Ask just about any IT company about their workforce diversity programs and many, albeit with some notable exceptions, are likely to say something like "yes, we have that", whether they do or not. Are they peddling falsehoods? Probably not intentionally, but the actual landscape is something quite complex. With few exceptions, almost every IT heavyweight in Silicon Valley and elsewhere still can't claim to have a workforce that even comes close to mirroring the diversity of the minority U.S. population at large. Related articles The Dream of ‘Channel Esperanto' Does VAR Mean ‘Value at Risk'? Many may not fully understand the task at hand. A new report from Open MIC, an organization that works on issues ranging from workforce diversity to internet access to privacy, sheds some light on the diversity chasm many IT companies face. The report, entitled Breaking the Mold: Investing in Racial Diversity in Tech, released on 13 February and directed at investors, contends that achieving minority diversity in IT goes well beyond what's socially right. It makes the case that it's financially counterproductive for companies not to change the composition of their workforces. "Diversity is not simply about filling seats at the table, it's also about the decisions that get made at the table," the study's authors wrote. According to Open MIC's report, based on vendor data filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, among prominent IT companies, excluding Amazon and Apple, the percentage of African American staffers ranges from two percent to seven percent, while those of Hispanic heritage represent about three percent to eight percent. Think about that for a minute. For an industry that prides itself on not only its innovation in technology, but also on being forward looking and finding new ways to work, engage and collaborate with one another, taken as a group it can't conquer a perpetual and glaring disparity in hiring minorities. Even high profile chip maker Intel, which has made a number of public commitments to diversity, has openly admitted its continuing struggle in that regard, perhaps fully understanding the implications of not doing so. Last June, Intel collaborated with Dalberg Global Development Advisors to survey 167 U.S. technology companies in an eye-opening study entitled Decoding Diversity: The Financial and Economic Returns to Diversity in Tech. While the report made the point that African American, Hispanic, Native American and female workers are underrepresented at technology companies - ethnic and racial minorities by 16 to 18 percent and women by about 19 percent, it also observed how little their representation has changed in the past 15 years. In that decade and a half, the racial and ethnic staffing numbers have risen by only one to two percentage points and the female workforce has slid by one percentage point, the report points out. Those results, despite the $1.2 billion allocated to diversity programs in the past five years by technology companies, are startling. And beyond that the study finds compelling, financial claims as well that may resonate well with investors and, correspondingly, with the C-suite. The resulting data produced something every business can understand: It established a direct correlation between workforce racial/ethnic diversity and financial performance, finding that for every incremental percentage point in African-American and Hispanic representation at tech companies, a three-percentage point increase in revenue resulted. What this means is that the technology industry could realize as much as a 22 percent increase in revenue, amounting to upwards of $370 billion annually if its workforces more accurately reflected the racial and ethnic diversity available specifically in today's engineering talent pool.

Talk John Gibson Mar 6, 2017 (Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool Image via AP) by John Gibson Follow on Twitter, Facebook, listen free/live on foxnewsradio app The media had a meltdown over the weekend when Donald Trump tweeted that Obama wire tapped him. The headlines were marching in lockstep: Trump Makes Accusation Without Providing Evidence. The New York Times’ Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman are a good example. Their story today is headlined: “A Conspiracy Theory’s Journey From Talk Radio to Trump’s Twitter”, which is NYT-speak for saying Trump was relying on unreliable sources. (Why the President would be assumed to go to sketchy sources when he has the Intel Community at his disposal seems odd.) But at the bottom of the story, Baker and Haberman felt obligated to link to several stories in the New York Times over the last few weeks which had to come from wire taps and other forms of U.S. government surveillance during the waning days of the Obama administration. Like this, and this, and this. Even before Trump’s Saturday tweets one would have not been far off base categorizing these stories as the results of Obama spying on Trump associates and, presumably, Trump himself. So why the outrage that Trump made the charge himself? Because outrage is the reflexive response to Trump from the media and the left. Also because a President is supposed to be in a box: He has access to any information the U.S. government possesses, but he is also supposed to observe classification restrictions. So unless he uses his unilateral power to declassify the information, he is not supposed to reveal his spy agencies spied on him under the previous administration of President Obama. Obviously, this President doesn’t feel bound by those niceties. If Dems don’t like it, they can impeach him. Oh wait. They would need the Congress, and they don’t have either the House or the Senate.  So they are left with the media, where they can make a lot of ominous sounding noises. Politico, in a story buried deep on its page, went over some legal possibilities the Trump team could have been under surveillance,  and noted this: “While it’s unknown whether any of these scenarios occurred, it’s ‘very likely that the people in the Obama administration had access to the communication of senior Trump officials in the run-up to the election, because they have very, very broad authority,’ said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has advocated for revising surveillance laws.” OK, so the previous President could have had access to wiretaps on Russian officials that swept up conversations with Trump people. The previous President could have suggested or ordered further investigation which would have led to more electronic surveillance. Sure he could have. So is it really such an offense that Trump said it? Obama and his people can squeal all they want trying to make Trump look like the buffoon. But their trail of leaks of surveilled conversations seems to indicate Trump is on the right trail.       John Gibson You May Be Interested In...

It warns people not to trust their mapping apps.

Smartphone apps like Waze, a godsend for some road warriors because they shave minutes and even hours off their commutes with their creative detours off main highways, are causing headaches for city planners. Using crosswalks, wider sidewalks and traffic lights, these transportation engineers aim to make neighborhood traffic slow, safe, and friendly for pedestrians — not send frustrated commuters barreling down side roads. But the GPS-enabled computer programs often don't know that, or care. Their creators, such as Waze (owned by Google), are sympathetic, to a degree. They may give cities tips on how to effectively game the program so a neighborhood detour doesn't seem that appealing. But at the end of the day, the purpose of the bots is to make use of all available road space, main thoroughfare or country lane. The upshot is mounting frustration from cities, which are trying to thwart computer systems that are savvier than ever. "Don't trust your apps!" reads one road sign in Fremont, a city of 225,000 people just north of San Jose. Located off the heavily congested 880 and 680 freeways, it's situated between major San Jose-area employers like Intel, Cisco Systems and eBay, and the more affordable housing suburbs in California's Central Valley. More coverage: Love Waze? You could use it to carpool soon NBC's Keith Morrison is the new voice of Waze Waze's growth chief: Even driverless cars need a better route With highways frequently congested, navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze started telling drivers to hop off the freeway at Fremont's Mission Boulevard, cut through residential streets and then hop back on the highway where things were clearer — much to the distress of the people who lived there. “The commuters didn’t live or work in Fremont and didn’t care about our residential neighborhoods,” said Noe Veloso, Fremont’s principal transportation engineer. When he contacted the navigation apps, he was told the apps attempt to prevent congestion by distributing traffic on all public streets, even to quiet residential roadways. The only way to stop the drivers was to change the street routing so these shortcuts were no longer that. So Fremont instituted commute-hour turn restrictions on the most heavily used residential cut-through routes. The city also partnered with Waze through its Connected Citizens Program in order to share data and information, such as the turn restrictions, so that the app takes them into account. The result has been effective, but Veloso is worried the changes may simply reroute commuters into other neighborhoods. "We’re just trying to find a balance, to eliminate some of the time savings that's sending people into our streets," Veloso said. Fremont's situation is playing out in towns and cities across the U.S., with municipal planners just starting to grasp the scope of the challenge. “Waze and Uber hit transportation planners so fast that we didn’t know what to do,” says Sam Schwartz, a former traffic coordinator for New York City. His 1992 book New York Shortcuts and Traffic Tips was a popular precursor to the systems and apps that have been downloaded by hundreds of millions of users. A sign warning drivers in Fremont, Calif. that they can no longer turn left between 3:00 - 7:00 pm, part of an effort to keep commuters from using the town as a freeway shortcut.  (Photo: Noe Veloso) At a conference of transportation engineers this summer, Schwartz said the topic was being discussed in the hallways but not yet in plenaries. “We need to get ahead of this, but we don’t know what to do,” he said. Cities are struggling to get their arms around the issues the apps raise. Boston's winding streets, some of which date back to cow paths from the 17th century, make the city especially prone to drivers taking shortcuts and back routes to get around congestion. Jascha Franklin-Hodge, the city’s chief information officer, thinks most drivers are only using traffic apps for longer trips at this point. But once they start using them in their own neighborhoods, or if cars start to integrate mapping technology into their systems, or when self-driving cars come into play in the future, then the anecdotal issues he’s hearing about today “will just be the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We can’t force an app maker to embed communal goals into their app,” he said. Waze's goal: Use all streets There is some communication between cities and the major apps. Boston, for example, uses Waze traffic jam data to help it time traffic lights in the downtown harbor area. That information helped reduce congestion by 18% month over month, according to the company. But in the end, as Fremont found, Waze believes that public roads are intended to be used by all citizens, including to alleviate gridlock. “We use the streets within reason. We find the open road and spread cars across the grid, which lowers the risk of unsafe driving behavior,” said Julie Mossler, Waze’s head of brand and global marketing. Neither Google Maps nor Apple Maps responded to requests for comment. Mapping software does have the power to slow a route down. It sets what’s known as the free flow traffic value, the time it takes to traverse a given roadway based on the physical conditions, and it's generally set to the legal speed limit. But getting those programs to lower the upper limit isn’t easy. There are too many neighborhoods, too many roads and it’s all too site-specific. Even getting a single area changed would be cost prohibitive to the app makers because it could potentially require staffers to make on-going micro updates. Waze says it hasn’t gotten any such requests. The intersection of Bosworth and Diamond Streets in San Francisco, where city planners have worked to calm traffic by removing car lanes.  (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) There’s also an inherent conflict of interest between the mapping software and the cities. “In the conflict between getting you there fast versus the neighbors who are upset about drive-through traffic, Waze’ business is with the drivers — because if you’re not getting value you’ll go use Apple Maps or TomTom,” said Mark Hallenbeck of the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the Washington State Transportation Center Today, many planners say the only alternative cities have is by physically changing street layouts. After spending decades building streets that let drivers get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible, they’re beginning to rethink the whole thing. "If you have residential streets where drivers feel comfortable doing 40 miles per hour, you didn’t do a very good job of designing them in the first place,” said Jennifer Dill, director of the National Institute for Transportation and Communities and a professor of urban planning at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. On top of that, many of the things that used to slow people down don’t anymore. “In 1953, your Chevy made a lot of noise and it gave you physical cues to tell you you were driving fast. Now in a modern car, there’s good sound deadening and you get no auditory or physical sense of how fast you’re going,” said Washington's Hallenbeck. To deal with this, city planners are contemplating redesigning roads that eliminate shortcuts or use one-way streets that prevent computers from using them as an alternative to a main thoroughfare. Seattle’s already begun this process. Its traffic engineers have spent years remaking streets so that it’s impossible to speed. They've rebuilt residential intersections as roundabouts and allowed parking on both sides of the street side to cut the useable driving space down from 36 feet to 12 feet. But sometimes these plans backfire. And municipal authorities are aware that the bots are always one or even 10 steps ahead.

The city spent 16 months and $3.1 million to reconfigure the intersection of Bosworth and Diamond streets in the Glen Park neighborhood. The heavily-used intersection includes bike lanes, lots of pedestrians, children and parents walking to an elementary school a block away, a stop for tech buses heading to Silicon Valley workplaces, a BART subway stop and multiple bus routes. The work was part of a Vision Zero plan to reduce the number of traffic fatalities to zero. It cut the number of lanes in each direction from three to two, widened the sidewalks, took out bus stops so buses now stop in the roadway and added a planted median and turn lanes. The new design is meant to be safer for pedestrians, better for transit and to discourage speeding by drivers. An unintended consequence has been an increase in drivers using mapping software that sends them down the narrow streets that traverse the neighborhood’s steep hillsides, said resident Katherine Murphy. She’s angry at the city for presuming everyone would play nice and only use the main intersection. “Do they just have their heads in the sand that people are using technology?” she said. Hallenbeck likens it to efforts to dam small streams. “The water often finds a new route around the dam. And that's what is happening in San Francisco. People are finding a new path of least resistance.” Neighbor Lexi Olian isn’t enjoying being part of that downstream effect. She’s now seeing cars on side streets that used to be empty except for people who actually lived on those blocks. “Everybody’s talking about how great walkable communities are,” she says. “ But they won’t be walkable if traffic is zooming through.” The intersection of Bosworth and Diamond Streets in San Francisco, where City planners have worked to calm traffic by removing car lanes.

San Francisco is one of America’s great walking cities. With a good pair of shoes and a Muni ticket (see Getting around, below), you can see almost everything in the city. Nature is a great part of the draw. San Francisco sits at the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, with lots of walking and cycling trails all along the waterfront from the Embarcadero to Golden Gate Park. A short hop across the Golden Gate Bridge are Sausalito, Point Reyes National Seashore and Muir Woods. The city is also renowned for its radical thinking and activism. It spawned the hippie movement, the Sixties’ ‘Summer of Love’ and the gay rights movement, while nearby Berkeley in the East Bay was the birthplace of the Free Speech and “locavore” (local food/sustainability) movements.

To many Americans, San Francisco is the nation’s food and wine capital. Berkeley chef Alice Waters of Chez Panisse fame started the farm-to-table obsession here in the 1970s. The city is now awash with excellent restaurants, while its proximity to the Sonoma and Napa Valleys means that, in less than two hours, travellers can enjoy tastings at some of the best wine estates in the country. Those who dine out in the city also can sip some of California’s finest vintages, many of which are not exported across state lines. When to go As the apocryphal Mark Twain saying goes, “The coldest winter I ever spent was a summer in San Francisco.” It is a common tourist faux pas to think June, July and August are going to be warm in San Francisco. It is usually the season of fog, strong winds, unexpected chills and tourists shivering in shorts and T-shirts.

Winter temperatures are only 15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than summer (although it can be considerably rainier). Where to go Everyone who visits San Francisco should play outdoors along the waterfront: walk the Embarcadero, drop by the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market, and board a boat to Alcatraz (aka ‘The Rock’). Get lost for a few hours in Golden Gate Park, where top-notch art and science museums await. Hop on one of the city’s iconic cable cars, then keep going to the Mission District, packed with trendy restaurants, boutique shops, and bars.

Local laws and etiquette Always have your passport and driver’s license with you when driving in the US, in case you get stopped by police. You can turn right at a red traffic light (provided you come to a complete stop first, and there is no oncoming traffic and no contradictory sign saying “no turn on red”). In most American cities, you have to park with your car pointing in the direction of the traffic on the correct side of the road; otherwise you will be ticketed and fined. Also, avoid parking within 15ft of a fire hydrant.

What is going to happen with Dont'a Hightower and his contract negotiations with the Patriots. Will the Patriots trade Jimmy G this off season and will the Patriots trade for Brandin Cooks. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. For a lot I'll get back to your phone calls keep coming 617. 77979837. I mentioned the Mexico championship. Spots got a little boy then Dustin Johnson. McIlroy Mickelson gets beat trying to get back get it. Could be an interesting in that. Sunday in the final round match. A championship and I'm not here to talk golf all afternoon and neither is. My Giuliani from Comcast sports net new laying on the joins me over the phone right now to talk some football. What's up Mike I don't there. Are not much. At the report that. You probably just heard remain in the trending now. Which I did not expect to be talking about it I did not expect to be talking about the patriots trying to trade for Brandon cooks. Have you heard any thing on this interest. But the patriots reportedly have in trying to acquire the lawless saints wide receiver Brandon Cox. Not Lebanon with a partner alternate obviously it duplicated. The report strong new earlier reduce the Austin community. Patriots and offered in Holland when their shopping calendar round. The Texans are hot in the they looked engagement that are wide receiver corps. And I wanted to make somewhat of an impact air. And we were well. And ignited. That telecheck and seen up close and personal a couple of years now. In him in the summertime you know the joint practices. Golden West Virginia and the Europeans in Foxboro. Then you read about the accident and I planned. Two times a year like tomatoes and it is so I needed depth and situations where. I'm not been done to brought it to the right candidate beat someone do one of those teams that would be inquired about. Well I guess maybe I should every phrase that the fact of the patriots would be interested in courts. I mean if all the patriots I would be too I get to my surprise com is why we're talking about this is that it does seem like. No lawns is willing to move coach I would in his contract they have money control. I think for two more years right given next year and then is. It is a club option on him I just eat what did three years old why would this say it's even been questioned. Well you are hard to get your other audio receivers down there and that they like each arm and took him a little bit. Post number one receiver touched it and. Can be difficult to handle at times in these claims about people little bit bled about number it'd. So. Don't eat and how the other and chomping at the he didn't help elsewhere that's him he could not sensibly. I'm probably committed begun its there's somebody out there and the city written. Order form ten. Don't feel like we're in a situation where our are gonna suck all that much even though he has. Very talented receiver. Yeah you know what are you mentioned the stock split with coach and his frustration at times with his role the offense and and you look at the numbers that he puts up you would think that. You know did additionally no frustration with his early offense and ended the numbers jump jump off the page and anybody who watches the kid play is all to tell the world. And his speed jumps off the screen so I was a little shocked somebody called in earlier while I was wondering why would know wall in its. Even be listening for deal for caught somebody called up. With this story this past season which the saints won they beat the rams. And cooks was frustrated with his role in the offense he didn't have any receptions the saints scored 49 points and I have the this story in front I mean not all I read so much data I was I was not aware of this from Brandon Cox and maybe that's just a fantasy football sodomy speak up what I mean. I feel like I'd pay enough attention to the NFL with something like this would would jump out of the and it didn't really I hadn't heard of this. I mean is this some of the mill if this is a thing wouldn't that mean that he isn't a patriots I. You know what are you how many times have been made and where we sit our nose. How are our community and even though mark how I obtained this past year you know he didn't seem like he's their kind of guy. I don't want to roll the dice on on players like death because they had the talent level and be because like pretty much every other program may feel like. Oh yeah here. It'll be different noted our rock Wheaton control and that's why. Whatever he needs. Feel like you know even as much a part of the yacht certainly won't would be yeah I think that. Don't ever shot at doing that stuff never shadow went from being. Unconventional incumbent who approaches in this kind of fallout after. Yeah and I guess if you wanted to point it's a coach and his frustrations and. And people say well it's it's asked to do with his nominees and all that but I mean since he's been and then the saints have finished I think seven and nine. The last three years and he meant it is some frustration. Which is not being a very good football team till right. I don't think there's any question about that I think commitment program and. From a college that they're so. You know obviously knowing my. I thought it was coming into it to prison where. This team was going to be ultra competitive every year. We are you know it's seven and 7979. And. I've seen other other teens how certain certainly there to the student Summers where he's gone into patriots. A look at talk and thought that a market to football and I got over there. And now digital Alter that held them but knowing that you are consistently and the other 1213 fourteen when it. Spiegel by GI from Comcast sports net new Englander I joins me over the phone right now we're talking some patriots in Mike when I see this report to the patriots. Have tried to. Trade for Brandon collection it will to give up the number 32 overall pick. And the saints decline. It did report also says the pictures wanted to pick in return from the saints they wanted to saints begin on coach and pick the 32 overall maybe it is more to that. I just have from the saints in a debt are stuck they do crazy Mike has I stuck they can while. Maybe the saints believe the patriots are gonna. Debt number twelve overall from Cleveland and then they'll have the conversation he said he gonna give us a first round pick will take twelve instead of 320. I stuck bagel maybe that's why the patriots maybe leaks upmanship that it cannot penetrate a drop off. Maybe that's up to do it negotiations on another trip on a crazy right now Mike does not think about the patriots are gonna trick grapple. And I think they're gonna get a first round pick from regardless of what's been reported. Should this interest in coach and you know ice not ice I think and you know maybe there's something bigger than just trading grapple maybe there's another another piece yet all this mean holly you peace in all this together. This offseason with the grapple stop now. Added to the to the coach report. Well. Look mighty. My Intel on Mayan calendar lol. And the patriots remain the same and I don't you know I'm not acting seated on. Abductor because there is nobody more like penalties and then he. But you know same got to upload ordered on the Monday after an injury and adults and that it was. It's interviewed in older adults can't play that aren't again. Protections and that was it's never gonna happen and you know I want to talk about widgets you trading commission and its lead in. Does it. Work dungy can get burned and so did not about. Tony didn't. I haven't been used by the patriotism and having that that app and Yemen. Buddhists. I don't think they've gotten all that they wanna do it for there to make it sound like well where I won't nominate such maturity and I think that is more or less. What you got thrown our way. Doesn't come close or absence or and to meet that price line and went you know we are. War tension and to on the roster and on the team. Because. Without control of the year anyway. And mutual too if you want to idled plant. You know mob money following next year well. Story you know this is not on stare and I don't think that they didn't want it back capital. Albeit a little bit different situation because Brady. Had to you know most mean infection and all that but. Note that a quarterback export your soul and digital content. And. And shirt absolute. Power I'm prominent member court out there are kind of treatment but I I don't think it. They're big screen let everybody know what you thrown out so ardent but I mean crap and he hit it but you wanna pry it off and. Yes so it's clearly came from the patriots I mean it's that's my opinion sounds like you bleed the same thing. And nick. It's clear that there's a method to the patriots madness when it comes to what day. Had beat a Ben off in all what they want to be offered in the future for grapple Michael nastiness and Spiegel my GI from Comcast sports net New England. In your opinion what would be the best strategy for the patriots would impede. Why do you think. They should move grapple all right I'll. I hear them talk about Mac and I didn't warm and yes content. Because. There is little to control would be the key going to be trading warm. On. So. You clearly going to be a little pride more from now that you wait until next student. Amid franchise. And didn't you know. Franchise and. Everybody else. Brady continues to play at this level considered lucky not keep all those guys and have 4550 million of them now at one position quarterback. Pick when it suddenly a backup quarterback. And. Mean you saw. Talk among the key capital unit cabinet colleague. Gotta check out you also it will not credible and that was kind of adopt it. They wanted to get ready for it to go to this last year contract but that's. I can get root language. If you take one and here you're here next year note that. There's two things but the patriots the first thing is I you got to commit to Brady I think they should. Not and I think. I think they will I just think that seems to be the obvious negative that's gonna happen next question is. Or you know does go raw apple wants to get back up for the Packers quarterback and this is some Walesa. If he can be just got a quarterback for an out of a team right now he would be an end. And what makes this so easy to me. And and then it's you know common sense is that you move on. Is pickle rubble on the opportunity. Accurate it's time to walk because he does wanna be a backup quarterback Mike. So just that fact if you commit to Brady and you know brothel can walk then no brainer trip ever know. Expected to meet this isn't over this is just good common sense you trigger up all right now. Evidently that your wallet you know he is ready export. And while he talked about my own sordid side and log showed no signs of slowing down the last couple years. Left pretty. That's help fight off the decline nearing an end up being a quarterback penalty and are in the conversation over the last three years. The bit he's forty and no one's done before at that level and done it consistently. And you feel like you'd. On Barack little. These. Stunned. Can be your franchise quarterback and. 81012 years. Are you ready to let him walk out the dual war. I'm knowing how difficult it seriously trying to quarterbacks Matt target that would be to double that yeah I'm an argument completely out of there and about why some rational for New England now would be to meet the rationale but got 270 yards or out again that the mine adult and getting hurt. And you'll reduce my number well it. Well number well it's so are you willing. Stated that it's. Aberration and he can walk out door and you can find the next guy and on the road or maybe the next guy on set war used to hang. The party do definitely. This guy's the real deal and are we gonna bet on our data and 41 trend can't start next year or another. To read for odd years maps and yes. If you're gonna make your argument. Keeping them that you are. Iowa the patriots have more to think of engines that and that potential move. On a potential trade of drop below dish ops she's an idea sub telecheck. Is that the Columbine right now although when it comes the guys who are in the league and I could be free agency when the new league year begins its I believe what is march 9. You know they didn't put the franchise tag on Donte' high Tolle I don't I kind of expected them to do that they didn't. What's your reaction then not put the tag on ital and do you think that's just shy and net that he's gone automatically. I think you're trying to do are they also I know where they are Newt's you know. There was not a on the table prior to deceive in there and and I'll think about it it was only a clerical only gone out. Because it was a huge part in piecing together. Mitch just what you're not futurity Collins and obviously. Tell him that he had the Super Bowl media sort of I but he didn't gotten team. Actually it does do it. More relaxed. After city. With the idea. And it went in Milan communication don't gonna continue to talk year over this next few days and we're gonna you can talk what you get into the thrill seekers. And we're we're hopeful that there are gonna. Now I are committed to come back to damage today. The people we got. Can continue match you gave the ball our tax in a totally straight. But I must feel pretty good about and at least human opportunity. Let it get to this point because. It is number Ahmad Ali they have an. Under the cap on. Actual dollar weakened stagnant talk and number they are about sixty million dollars that there for you on create and you. The speech he. Are so I want to say why can't franchise in the sixty million whatever number was 148. Our pro linebacker because Ian and I doubt I'd linebacker in the league shouldn't shouldn't delineate that way. Gone up so much on the look at secret contract because it's RD. A bargain for Carolina beaten term results what you would pay more clarity about it so. I think when you look at adult in the argument that it made that 91. Season because you could afford it ignited once even. And controlled so that must deal at least. So I content that it didn't impact on the table. One also had done at least one more runner. Andre it's easy for immediate notice to sit there and say you know this is what the patriots should do I mean. You know don't worry about other contracts don't warn about the cap but this is the patriots are talking. And and I guess the way I feel about it is if he goes out and gets a big offer from someone which I think he I think he probably will. I mean based on the plays he's made late in the last couple Super Bowls he's been and I guess I look at patent. I have a hard time believing the patriots are well okay not on the ruling matchup would you you know what anymore that I use I I feel like that's not the way this thing is gonna play out. Look I'm I'm I would say you're out immediate. The chain has returned and about 3035%. That I did something obsolete knock him off at bats without walker. That he's gonna. And I are on and no to. Eight and the combatant patent that route and meet and wouldn't you know whatever odd million of that hole number war. You get within four million guaranteed of that. And that's not going to be enough I mean you don't want to dump out. Am. In terms it's. All the things that I've gotten to know about shareholder time and. I reported in the spring last year you want to pay just like Colin did but not awkward. 21 of those situations where so much better here than anywhere outside I'm. I am willing to take less. To date year significantly less. That you're not one of those guys. I'm not all include that at all athletes at all agreed to give you opportunity. To get paid. 99.9. Percent of registered in a decade. I'm also. Grind it seat bin and it kind of telecheck. Collapsed. Nine year I believe it is. It is a lot to ask global player. And you can win elsewhere.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry 2016 Growth, Trends, Analysis and Market Research Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry 2016 Growth, Trends, Analysis and Market Research Posted on March 6, 2017 by ReleaseWire - Latest Press Releases in Press Releases Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 03/06/2017 — The competitive landscape of the global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry is crowded by the presence of a large number of players. The presence of a large number of participants has led to the fragmented nature of the market. Some of the major players operating in the global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry are Cisco Systems Inc., Carestream Health Inc., Carecloud Corp., AGFA Healthcare, IBM Corp., Cleardata Networks, Merge Healthcare Inc., Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., and Oracle Corp. "The high level of customization required by various healthcare organizations has resulted in the emergence of a large number of market players with unique expertise," a TMR analyst points out. This level of customized services prevents any form of standardization across the market. Browse Global Strategic Business Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/healthcare-cloud-computing.html Concerns About Data Leakage is a Major Challenge for Market Players Rapid transformations in the healthcare IT sector, coupled with the growing demand for security of access and data integrity have supported the growth of cloud computing in the healthcare industry. "An increasing number of companies are reducing investments in the creation and maintenance of a physical IT infrastructure and are shifting towards cloud computing for easier management of profiles," states TMR. However, data relocation from established systems is a major hiccup in the market's growth during the forecast horizon. Data integration and consistency is also another challenge faced by the market players. The growing concerns pertaining to data leakage have made a number of healthcare providers apprehensive about the adoption of the cloud computing technology. The market players are focusing on the introduction of wireless technologies in cloud computing solutions to allow remote access of data on a real-time basis. The increasing usage of ACOS for data sharing through mobile devices has created ample opportunities for the growth of the market players. PaaS to be Largely Preferred by the Healthcare Industry Among the major service models, the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model is expected to register the highest demand. "Simple application and high rate of deployment are the primary factors driving the demand for the PaaS model," states TMR. The PaaS model does not rely on hardware and software and offers support within the service's lifecycle. Though the market was dominated by the IaaS model in 2011, PaaS is anticipated to generate more revenue in the years to come. The global cloud computing market in the healthcare industry is projected to expand robustly at a CAGR of 21.30% during the period between 2012 and 2018. The market was valued at US$1.82 bn in 2011 and is anticipated to be worth US$6.79 bn by 2018. Download Exclusive Brochure of This Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=802 The information in this review is based on the statistical findings of a report published by Transparency Market Research, titled, "Cloud Computing Market In Healthcare Industry – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Trends And Forecast 2012 – 2018." Global cloud computing market in healthcare industry has been segmented as: By service models Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) By pricing models Spot pricing or subscription model Pay-as-you-go model By end users Clinical Information systems (CIS) Market EMR PACS RIS Others Non-clinical Information systems (NCIS) Market RCM Claims management APB Others Major geographies analyzed under this research report are: Europe North America Asia-Pacific Rest of the World For more information on this press release visit: http://www.sbwire.com/press-releases/cloud-computing-market-in-healthcare-industry-2016-growth-trends-analysis-and-market-research-775465.htm Media Relations Contact Rohit Bhisey Head Transparency Market Research Telephone: 518-618-1030 Email: Click to Email Rohit Bhisey Web: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com Latest News Cargill Grows Base of Certified Sustainable Independent Oil Palm Smallholders in Malaysia Infusion Pumps Market: Emerging Trends & Upcoming Medical Devices Research Cloud Computing Market in Healthcare Industry 2016 Growth, Trends, Analysis and Market Research Companion Animal Vaccines Market Research Report by Regional Analysis: Forecast 2024 Beverly Hills Group Inc.

In Silicon Valley, where he ran a previous company, he'd be vying for engineers against Google and Facebook. "To compete in that environment for the best talent would be very, very fierce," says Lau. "In a smaller pond we are the bigger fish. That helps us attract the best possible talent." That talent has helped him attract more than $66 million in venture capital and grow his digital community to 45 million users over the last 10 years. With 130 employees and revenue growing 30 percent year-over-year, Lau says, "we are very determined to build this company in Toronto. We have no plan to open up another office elsewhere, except salespeople." Lau is a well-known presence on Toronto's fast-growing start-up scene, where by all accounts excitement about entrepreneurship is percolating as it never has before. There are currently between 2,100 and 4,100 active tech start-ups in Toronto's ecosystem, according to a report by Tech Toronto, a community for entrepreneurs. Toronto and the cities immediately surrounding it had a population of 5.4 million people in 2015. A confluence of factors is shaping the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the fourth-largest city in North America. One driver is the city's engineering talent pool. There are 150,000 full-time students enrolled in universities throughout the Greater Toronto area. In addition, the federal and provincial governments offer strong support for technology innovation and financial assistance. Start-ups are also supported by a robust venture capital community. Getty Images Allen Lau, co-founder and CEO of Wattpad More than $2 billion in venture capital was disbursed in Canada in 2016 — a 15 percent increase over 2016 and the most funding since 2002, when the number hit $2.7 billion, according to the Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association. Toronto has benefited. It was home to Canada's biggest venture deal of 2016. Thalmic Labs, a maker of wearable technologies based in Kitchener, Ontario, near Toronto, corralled $120 million in a series B round in September from investors, including Intel Capital, The Amazon Alexa Fund and Fidelity Investments Canada. With the action showing no signs of slowing and Toronto start-ups standing out in areas such as artificial intelligence, many local players say they're not interested in turning the city into the next Silicon Valley. "I think Toronto at some level really wants to be the first Toronto," says Ameet Shah, a partner at Golden Venture Partners, a seed-stage fund in Toronto whose start-up Five Mobile was acquired by Zynga in July 2011. "We hate being called Silicon Valley North." Paying it forward So why is entrepreneurship percolating in the city now? "It's a convergence of momentum," says Craig Morantz, an angel investor in the Toronto area who previously served as CEO of Kira Talent, a locally based start-up that offers a video admissions platform for colleges. One important catalyst has been the critical mass of successful Canadian tech firms, such as Shopify, Hootsuite, Kik and D2L, with offices in the city, alongside U.S. companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. "You build some anchor-tenant companies, they scale up, and the talent goes on to start other companies," says Mike McDerment, CEO of FreshBooks, an accounting software provider based in Toronto. When this seasoned talent starts companies, a growing number of angels are raring to help them get started. "More money is available at earlier stages — pre-seed, seed and series A," says Shah. With the Silicon Valley market increasingly frothy, deal-hungry venture capitalists, both from within Canada and in the United States, have also cast eyes on Toronto. "Motivated U.S. investors realize there are some really great companies up here — and are coming looking for them," says Mark MacLeod, founder of SurePath Capital Partners, a strategic advisory firm to the global small-business software market based in Toronto. He is often contacted by investors looking to check out interesting companies in the city over a day or two — which he says is easy to arrange. "Motivated U.S. investors realize there are some really great companies up here — and are coming looking for them." -Mark MacLeod, founder of SurePath Capital Partners "Capital doesn't really care about borders," says McDerment. "It's a really good environment to make an investment." His firm raised $30 million in 2014 from Oak Investment Partners, a firm with offices in Palo Alto, California, and Greenwich, Connecticut, with participation from Atlas Ventures in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Georgian Partners, a Toronto firm. And as more area start-ups evolve into scale-ups and get acquired, local entrepreneurs have developed a greater sense of what is possible, say observers. McDerment points to Bump Technologies' acquisition by Google in 2013 and Rypple's acquisition by Salesforce in 2011. "The thing people don't know about Toronto is how many great exits have happened," he says. Fortunately for fast-growing start-ups, engineers are abundant, thanks to the presence of RIM (Blackberry) and schools such as University of Waterloo, known for its prestigious engineering school, and University of Toronto. And it costs less to hire them than comparable professionals from Silicon Valley. "I can hire a very senior Canadian engineer for $70,000 U.S. dollars," says Morantz. "You can't even get someone to return your call in New York or Boston unless it's $100,000 or $200,000." Kevin Van Paassen | Bloomberg | Getty Images Employees of Wattpad Technology meet in their company's kitchen space in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It helps that Toronto's cost of living is lower than that of New York's pricier tech hubs. "Although it's not a cheap city to live, it's still affordable," says Morantz. "It's not San Francisco. It's not New York." Toronto is also very diverse, with 49 percent of the population made up of immigrants, according to Tech Toronto. "Having that kind of diversity helps you build great companies," says Morantz. "When you've got someone who is maybe first or second generation, they are coming to the table with a unique perspective." The city also has a thriving infrastructure to nurture start-ups, with hubs including DMZ, a technology incubator at Ryerson University, and MaRS, which helps connect start-ups in information and communications technology, cleantech and health with funding and advice. "The communities in the last two to three years have really matured," says Kevin Kimsa, general partner at ScaleUP Ventures, a venture fund in Toronto. "It has really acted as a catalyst for more innovation to hit the ground running." More from iCONIC: Baltimore is making a $5 billion bet that entrepreneurs can revive the city Billionaire closer to mining the moon for trillions of dollars in riches CEO who turned $345 into $30 million: Stop drooling over Silicon Valley and get to work Toronto's entrepreneurial ecosystem still has some obstacles to cross. Other than OMERS Ventures, the venture capital arm of Canada's largest pension fund, and Georgian Capital, "there is not a ton of late-stage capital," says MacLeod. "Most of the companies that are really into expansion will need to raise that capital from the U.S." But at the moment, that doesn't seem to be deterring any start-up activity. "Something has really changed the last couple of years," says Ben Baldwin, founder of ScaleDriver, a Toronto management consultancy that advises executives on building innovation, and founder of the Founder City Project, a network of start-up and scale-up founders. "Canadians are kind of rubbing their hands together like evil scientists," he said. "They are going to make a major impact." — By Elaine Pofeldt, special to CNBC.com show chapters This tech start-up lets you try out for your job, before you get an offer    Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 | 10:27 AM ET | 01:09 To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Smartphone apps like Waze, a godsend for some road warriors because they shave minutes and even hours off their commutes with their creative detours off main highways, are causing headaches for city planners. Using crosswalks, wider sidewalks and traffic lights, these transportation engineers aim to make neighborhood traffic slow, safe, and friendly for pedestrians — not send frustrated commuters barreling down side roads. But the GPS-enabled computer programs often don't know that, or care. Their creators, such as Waze (owned by Google), are sympathetic, to a degree. They may give cities tips on how to effectively game the program so a neighborhood detour doesn't seem that appealing. But at the end of the day, the purpose of the bots is to make use of all available road space, main thoroughfare or country lane. The upshot is mounting frustration from cities, which are trying to thwart computer systems that are savvier than ever. "Don't trust your apps!" reads one road sign in Fremont, a city of 225,000 people just north of San Jose. Located off the heavily congested 880 and 680 freeways, it's situated between major San Jose-area employers like Intel, Cisco Systems and eBay, and the more affordable housing suburbs in California's Central Valley. More coverage: Love Waze? You could use it to carpool soon NBC's Keith Morrison is the new voice of Waze Waze's growth chief: Even driverless cars need a better route With highways frequently congested, navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze started telling drivers to hop off the freeway at Fremont's Mission Boulevard, cut through residential streets and then hop back on the highway where things were clearer — much to the distress of the people who lived there. “The commuters didn’t live or work in Fremont and didn’t care about our residential neighborhoods,” said Noe Veloso, Fremont’s principal transportation engineer. When he contacted the navigation apps, he was told the apps attempt to prevent congestion by distributing traffic on all public streets, even to quiet residential roadways. The only way to stop the drivers was to change the street routing so these shortcuts were no longer that. So Fremont instituted commute-hour turn restrictions on the most heavily used residential cut-through routes. The city also partnered with Waze through its Connected Citizens Program in order to share data and information, such as the turn restrictions, so that the app takes them into account. The result has been effective, but Veloso is worried the changes may simply reroute commuters into other neighborhoods. "We’re just trying to find a balance, to eliminate some of the time savings that's sending people into our streets," Veloso said. Fremont's situation is playing out in towns and cities across the U.S., with municipal planners just starting to grasp the scope of the challenge. “Waze and Uber hit transportation planners so fast that we didn’t know what to do,” says Sam Schwartz, a former traffic coordinator for New York City. His 1992 book New York Shortcuts and Traffic Tips was a popular precursor to the systems and apps that have been downloaded by hundreds of millions of users.

Cities are struggling to get their arms around the issues the apps raise. Boston's winding streets, some of which date back to cow paths from the 17th century, make the city especially prone to drivers taking shortcuts and back routes to get around congestion. Jascha Franklin-Hodge, the city’s chief information officer, thinks most drivers are only using traffic apps for longer trips at this point. But once they start using them in their own neighborhoods, or if cars start to integrate mapping technology into their systems, or when self-driving cars come into play in the future, then the anecdotal issues he’s hearing about today “will just be the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We can’t force an app maker to embed communal goals into their app,” he said. Waze's goal: Use all streets There is some communication between cities and the major apps. Boston, for example, uses Waze traffic jam data to help it time traffic lights in the downtown harbor area. That information helped reduce congestion by 18% month over month, according to the company. But in the end, as Fremont found, Waze believes that public roads are intended to be used by all citizens, including to alleviate gridlock. “We use the streets within reason. We find the open road and spread cars across the grid, which lowers the risk of unsafe driving behavior,” said Julie Mossler, Waze’s head of brand and global marketing. Neither Google Maps nor Apple Maps responded to requests for comment. Mapping software does have the power to slow a route down. It sets what’s known as the free flow traffic value, the time it takes to traverse a given roadway based on the physical conditions, and it's generally set to the legal speed limit. But getting those programs to lower the upper limit isn’t easy. There are too many neighborhoods, too many roads and it’s all too site-specific. Even getting a single area changed would be cost prohibitive to the app makers because it could potentially require staffers to make on-going micro updates. Waze says it hasn’t gotten any such requests.

After spending decades building streets that let drivers get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible, they’re beginning to rethink the whole thing. "If you have residential streets where drivers feel comfortable doing 40 miles per hour, you didn’t do a very good job of designing them in the first place,” said Jennifer Dill, director of the National Institute for Transportation and Communities and a professor of urban planning at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. On top of that, many of the things that used to slow people down don’t anymore. “In 1953, your Chevy made a lot of noise and it gave you physical cues to tell you you were driving fast. Now in a modern car, there’s good sound deadening and you get no auditory or physical sense of how fast you’re going,” said Washington's Hallenbeck. To deal with this, city planners are contemplating redesigning roads that eliminate shortcuts or use one-way streets that prevent computers from using them as an alternative to a main thoroughfare. Seattle’s already begun this process. Its traffic engineers have spent years remaking streets so that it’s impossible to speed. They've rebuilt residential intersections as roundabouts and allowed parking on both sides of the street side to cut the useable driving space down from 36 feet to 12 feet. But sometimes these plans backfire. And municipal authorities are aware that the bots are always one or even 10 steps ahead.

The city spent 16 months and $3.1 million to reconfigure the intersection of Bosworth and Diamond streets in the Glen Park neighborhood. The heavily-used intersection includes bike lanes, lots of pedestrians, children and parents walking to an elementary school a block away, a stop for tech buses heading to Silicon Valley workplaces, a BART subway stop and multiple bus routes. The work was part of a Vision Zero plan to reduce the number of traffic fatalities to zero. It cut the number of lanes in each direction from three to two, widened the sidewalks, took out bus stops so buses now stop in the roadway and added a planted median and turn lanes. The new design is meant to be safer for pedestrians, better for transit and to discourage speeding by drivers. An unintended consequence has been an increase in drivers using mapping software that sends them down the narrow streets that traverse the neighborhood’s steep hillsides, said resident Katherine Murphy. She’s angry at the city for presuming everyone would play nice and only use the main intersection. “Do they just have their heads in the sand that people are using technology?” she said. Hallenbeck likens it to efforts to dam small streams. “The water often finds a new route around the dam. And that's what is happening in San Francisco. People are finding a new path of least resistance.” Neighbor Lexi Olian isn’t enjoying being part of that downstream effect. She’s now seeing cars on side streets that used to be empty except for people who actually lived on those blocks. “Everybody’s talking about how great walkable communities are,” she says. “ But they won’t be walkable if traffic is zooming through.” The intersection of Bosworth and Diamond Streets in San Francisco, where City planners have worked to calm traffic by removing car lanes.

However, Windows is expensive – especially when compared to free operating systems such as Valve’s SteamOS. SteamOS is based on Steam’s Big Picture mode and can be installed on most PCs. If you are a gamer who prefers a streamlined experience – similar to gaming consoles – a SteamOS gaming machine is a great option. This approach is only recommended for dedicated gaming systems, as SteamOS does not have as much functionality as Windows or Linux systems. We have outlined everything you need to know about building your own SteamOS gaming console below, including hardware selection, pricing, and available games. Hardware requirements SteamOS requires a 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, and 200GB of storage. The budget build we put together meets the minimum requirements and will be able to handle most games in 1080p. The Intel Pentium G4560 dual-core processor is a great value chip, and its hyper-threading and high clock speeds make it perfect for a budget gaming build. We paired it with a Radeon RX 470 – a powerful graphics card with good overclocking potential and value. Both an SSD and hard disk drive were included, as the performance gained from running your OS on an SSD is worth the extra cost. Steam Console Build Component Pricing Motherboard Gigabyte H110M-HD2 R932 Processor Intel Pentium G4560 3.5GHz R1,096 Memory Corsair ValueSelect 8GB DDR4 2,133MHz R941 Graphics Card HIS Radeon RX 470 IceQ OC 4GB R2,899 Hard Drive Western Digital 1TB 7,200RPM R757 SSD Samsung 750 Evo 120GB SATA6G R872 Power Supply Antec VP500P 500W R637 Case CoolerMaster MasterBox Lite 3 R666 Total Price R8,800 SteamOS and Peripherals Installing SteamOS is straightforward and the operating system is compatible with most modern hardware. Follow the steps below to install the free operating system on your PC. Download SteamOS Unzip the SteamOS file to a formatted FAT32 USB stick. Insert the USB stick into your target machine and boot off the stick. Make sure you select the UEFI entry, it may look something like “UEFI: Patriot Memory PMAP”. Select “Automated install” from the menu. The rest of the installation will automatically repartition the drive and install SteamOS. Once SteamOS is installed, your system will automatically reboot and create a backup of the system partition. Once you have set up your Steam console, you can set up your peripherals – such as controllers and audio devices. Controller options include Valve’s Steam Controller or an Xbox 360/One controller – which are supported by SteamOS. Game Library The library of games available for SteamOS is constantly growing, with triple-A and indie games porting to the system from Windows. There are currently over 2,200 titles which work with SteamOS. If you are an avid game collector and purchase a variety of titles, you might find yourself limited by the smaller collection of games available. For “casual” gamers or those on a budget, the limitations of the platform will not deter you.

Kaby Lake is the latest version of Intel's 14nm microarchitecture, and the last but one before we hopefully see 10nm processors appear. But for now, we have Kaby Lake, offering improved clock speeds over Skylake chips, better performance from faster clock speed changes during use, and an improved graphics core, which is clocked faster and supports 4K streaming. It takes a while for new chips to make their way into products. Typically we get desktop processors first, and in that regard Kaby Lake impresses with a 7GHz overclock. But now Zotac is embracing them, and putting passively cooled Kaby Lake processors inside its tiny ZBOX Nano desktop PC range. The Zotac ZBOX Nano sits inside a case measuring just 5.76-by-4.98 inches and only 2.36 inches deep. It makes for a great media streaming box to hide away, or can happily sit mounted on the back of a monitor. Zotac added four Kaby Lake Nano PCs to its range, carrying the names CI547 Nano and CI527 Nano, with PLUS variants also available. The CI547 uses an Intel Core i5-7200U dual core processor clocked at 2.5GHz with Turbo boosting that to 3.1GHz on demand. The CI527 uses an Intel Core i3-7100U dual core processor clocked at 2.4GHz with no Turbo frequency available. In both cases, Intel HD Graphics 620 is used to allow for up to 4K resolution. Two DDR4 SODIMM slots allow for up to 32GB of RAM running at 2133MHz. Related Zotac GeForce GTX 1050 Mini Zotac GeForce GTX 1050 Mini The PLUS variants simply add 4GB of RAM, which seems rather pointless to me. If they increase that to 8GB then I'm sure the PLUS models would prove more popular when they launch. Other features of note include an impressive five USB 3.0 ports and two USB 3.1 Type-C ports. There's also Display Port and HDMI, a 3-in-1 card reader, Gigabit LAN, 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.0, and a VESA mounting kit included in the box. And don't forget, Microsoft only officially supports Kaby Lake for use with Windows 10. Zotac originally announced these Kaby Lake Nano PCs at CES in January, but as FanlessTech noticed, only now have they made it on to the Zotac website suggesting pricing and availability will be confirmed very soon.

Cook is telling his employees to â€œkeep moving forward.â€ (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: March 6, 2017 at 5:00 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 1:18 pm That shiny new iPhone may say “assembled in China” on the back, but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the U.S. Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple — the world’s most valuable company — in the bull’s eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration’s actions would affect a who’s who of the Bay Area’s big name tech companies — which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow. “It’s a real mess,” said Marcus Noland, senior vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade. Only two months into the Trump administration, it’s difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish U.S. companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued. While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45 percent import tariff on goods from China and 35 percent on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10 percent fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20 percent “border adjustment tax” covering all imports from all countries. The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley’s biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more. Also standing to lose? Consumers who will inevitably have the increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts. “You and I are going to pay for it,” said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate, who studies supply chains. However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits. Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi last week said the proposed 20 percent border adjustment tax would “encourage Americans to buy American products” and “promote good jobs here in the United States” while raising $1 trillion over 10 years. “It will allow us to cut income taxes, which discourage people from working. It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder,” he said Thursday in an op-ed in The Hill. var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the U.S., potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies. “If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it’s not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward,” said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade. Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank. The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia. “Everything that is in our products comes from overseas,” Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. “That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it’s not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies.” HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, according to analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos. Google’s new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Santa Clara’s Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the U.S. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam. It’s not just companies making tangible products that are at risk. Even a software-and-services company like Oracle is vulnerable to tariff-related retaliation, because it has invested heavily in providing IT services in China, where its clients include state-owned enterprises. The Chinese government, on top of potentially responding tit for tat to tariffs or taxes, could bar state-owned companies from doing business with U.S. firms, said the Peterson Institute’s Noland. Companies that make some products in the U.S. won’t escape, either. They too would be vulnerable to an all encompassing import levy, such as the proposed border adjustment tax, because they use materials or parts from other countries. While only Congress can levy across-the-board tariffs, a U.S. president has “limited authority” to impose tariffs in response to “special circumstances involving discrimination against U.S. exports or other unfair trade practices,” said John Veroneau, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who served as deputy U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. Trump has complained that other countries make the U.S. pay high tariffs and taxes on American products shipped overseas. The president’s focus on China and Mexico targets two nations that play critical roles in the supply chains for major U.S. electronics firms, so high import tariffs aimed at those countries would “immediately disturb the supply networks,” Noland said. Retaliatory tariffs would mean American companies could be faced with added costs for shipping high-end, U.S.-made components to China or Mexico for final assembly, before getting hit again when they import the assembled products back into the U.S., Noland said. A full-blown trade battle with China could lead to a “supply chain war” in which the Asian nation bans exports to the U.S. of the metallic elements used in electronics manufacturing, which would “hurt U.S. electronics firms,” a September report from the Peterson Institute said. China could potentially ban the sale of specific American tech products, claiming security issues and saying, for example, “You can’t sell Apple phones in China, because we’re worried about — and then they’d make something up,” Georgia Tech’s Vande Vate said. Conflict between the U.S. and China over trade could spread to other areas, potentially affecting American firms’ access to Chinese talent, Noland said. “A trade war that started with products,” Noland said, “could spill into things like visas and immigration issues, which would disadvantage the entire high tech sector.” ___________________________________________________________ Other threatened companies and their products Tesla has a long-term contract to buy lithium mined in Mexico for the batteries it makes domestically. Cisco announced last year it was expanding manufacturing in Mexico, where it has operated since 1993. HP has production facilities in Mexico, according to market-intelligence firm BNamericas. Bay Area companies SanDisk and Intel are among semiconductor companies make chips domestically that are sent to Asia to be wired up for installation onto circuit boards that are imported back to the U.S., according to Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate.   Tags:  Apple Cisco Donald Trump Google tariff Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

Sci-Tech by Stephen Shankland March 5, 2017 9:00 PM PST @stshank Enlarge Image IBM's quantum computer looks nothing like a classical machine. IBM In a few years, the same quantum computing concepts that gave Albert Einstein the heebie-jeebies could help Amazon deliver your toothpaste faster. That's because IBM, the company that surprised the world in 1989 by spelling its name with 35 xenon atoms, is launching a business built on the weird science of quantum computing. Thirty-five years of research into the physics of the freakishly tiny is about to start paying its first dividends with real-world customers. "We will be providing access to quantum systems for selected industry partners starting this year," said Scott Crowder, who's leading the handoff of the quantum computing work from IBM Research to the IBM Systems product team. A lot is riding on quantum computing. It offers fundamental breakthroughs that could help bring back the good old days of steadier computing progress. Why is today's smartwatch as powerful as last century's refrigerator-size mainframe? Chalk it up to Moore's Law, which describes the reliable pace of chip improvements across the decades. But some computing progress has stalled, which is why a 2017 laptop doesn't get work done much faster than one from 2012. "Moore's Law is struggling," Crowder said. But quantum computers will complement traditional computers, not replace them. "It'll do the pieces of the problem the classical computer can't." Quantum computers, which take advantage of the peculiar behavior and properties of atoms, are notoriously hard for even physicists to comprehend. But quantum computing is bubbling up at university and government labs, startups such as Rigetti and D-Wave, and the research arms of Microsoft, Intel and Google. Enlarge Image Scott Crowder, chief technology officer of IBM's systems group, discusses the exponential advantages of quantum computing. Stephen Shankland/CNET The science is still in its infancy, but even as it matures, you shouldn't expect a quantum-powered iPhone. IBM's quantum computer must be cooled to a fraction of a degree away from absolute zero, a temperature colder than outer space, so its innermost niobium and aluminum components aren't perturbed by outside influences. The cooling alone takes days. That's why IBM customers will tap into quantum computers over the internet, not tuck them under their desks or plug them into the company data center. Cheap fertilizer, better security What kinds of work are quantum computers good for? Early efforts will figure out how to use quantum computers effectively and reliably -- kicking the tires, in effect. After that, though, should come gains like these: quantum chemistry work that could predict how molecules like new medicines interact; logistics projects to figure out the most efficient way to ship packages during the holiday shopping season; and new forms of security that rely on quantum physics instead of today's prevailing approach using math problems too hard to solve in a given period of time. Enlarge Image IBM's quantum computing lab. IBM One specific quantum chemistry example: Factories need lots of expensive energy to make fertilizer, but microscopic bacteria do the same thing much more efficiently somehow. "We don't understand how that reaction occurs," said Jerry Chow, manager of IBM's experimental quantum computing team. A quantum computer helps people understand what's really going on at the molecular level instead of fumbling around with trial-and-error experiments, Chow said. IBM believes quantum computers also will let investors better understand financial data and risks. And the budding field of artificial intelligence could get a boost in situations where computers must make decisions without much information. The common thread for quantum computing tasks is rapid analysis of a huge number of possible scenarios. That strength will, for one thing, be able to crack today's encryption by testing a colossal list of possible numbers to find which ones are mathematical keys that'll unlock private data. Jerry Chow, manager of IBM's experimental quantum computing team Stephen Shankland/CNET Don't hold your breath, though. That ability is still "really far away," Crowder said. Meanwhile, governments and businesses are developing new quantum-proof algorithms. Just plain weird The quantum era will add a thicket of new jargon to computing vocabulary. Brace yourself for cryogenic isolators, Josephson junctions and decoherence. For processing data, "and" and "or" logic gates from classical computing are joined by Hadamard gates and Pauli-X gates from quantum computing. At their core, quantum computers store data with "qubits" -- quantum bits. Classical computers work by manipulating conventional bits, small units of data recorded as either a 0 or 1. A single qubit, by contrast, can store both 0 and 1 overlaid through a quantum peculiarity called superposition. Superposition, combined with another quantum weirdness called entanglement, means that multiple qubits can be ganged together with exponential benefits to how much data they can store and process. A single qubit can store two states of information -- 0 and 1 at the same time -- while two qubits can store four states, three can store eight states, four can store sixteen and so on. All that overlapping data stored in the same qubits lets quantum computers explore many possible solutions to a problem much faster than conventional computers -- finding which two integers multiply together into a huge number in encryption, say, or the fastest way to deliver a lot of packages. But even then there are many practical difficulties. For example, the answer to a computing problem can be tucked away in one particular combination of 1s and 0s among many stored through superposition in entangled qubits. But the act of reading data from qubits "collapses" all the qubit states into a single collection of 1s and 0s -- and not necessarily the right one that holds the answer. So yes, it's complicated. Learning the ropes Enlarge Image A 200mm silicon wafer houses IBM quantum-computing chips with 5 qubits apiece. Stephen Shankland/CNET It'll be a long time before programmers learn the ropes for quantum computing. That's why IBM, Microsoft and Google offer simulated quantum computers. More ambitiously, IBM in 2016 opened access to a website called Quantum Experience that lets outsiders noodle with a real 5-qubit quantum computer. A laptop can't simulate more than about 30 qubits, Crowder said. In the next few years, the IBM Q quantum computers will move to 50 qubits -- each a patch of niobium atoms hooked to its comrades with specialized aluminum wiring. The real business breakthrough comes when companies can build quantum computing into their operations. That'll require about a thousand qubits, Crowder said. Another big threshold could arrive with about a million qubits, enough to overcome problems with errors undermining calculations. Those errors are more of a problem with quantum computing than classical computing. "Fault tolerance is hard in a quantum system. You're going to need a lot of qubits," Crowder said. "That's probably at least a decade-plus away." So maybe your toothpaste will arrive faster. But not anytime soon.

So, what will it take to make sure you’re on next year’s list? With a fight for the very best talent raging on, it has now become more important than ever for companies to be able to showcase that they are a great place to work. An accolade that boasts about what a great workplace it is certainly helps. On 22 February, the Great Place to Work in Ireland 2017 results were announced and Promed, Cisco and Workday took away the top prizes for best small, medium and large places to work respectively. Liberty IT made the list of best small places to work in Ireland, while AOL made it into the top 10 medium places to work. When it came to the large places to work, Salesforce and Vodafone made it into the top five, while Version 1 and Intel made it into the top 10 great places to work. Bristol-Myers Squibb and PayPal weren’t too far behind, making it into the top 20. How are they chosen? Companies that make the list are more likely to attract the best talent as it is based upon what the current employees say, as well as the companies’ own policies. The survey given to employees is a trust index survey. “It’s a survey of 58 statements, it’s been established for the last 30 years or so,” said Joseph Benkanoun-Greene, digital communications manager at Great Place to Work. “It’s the same methodology behind the Fortune 100 list.” Employees are sent an anonymous survey, in which they answer statements about their company using a Likert scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Hiring Now Informing, entertaining and connecting the world Life-changing career opportunities for you 2016 Graduate Employer of the Year Helping the world be well. Work for what matters. Statements include: ‘Management trusts me to do a good job without looking over my shoulder’, ‘When I look at what we accomplish, I feel a sense of pride’ and ‘Management’s actions match their words’. How can my organisation become a great place to work? The survey makes up two-thirds of the overall assessment, with the final third coming from a culture audit. “There are nine practices where we request a submission from the organisation,” said Benkanoun-Greene. “We recommend that the company puts together an internal team to work on compiling that document,” he said. “We ask them to submit supporting documentation with that.” Benkanoun-Greene said if a company is submitting its employee handbook and it suggests certain diversity practices, they could also submit videos to support these. “There were a couple of organisations that won special awards for having specifically innovative practices.” For example, AOL won a special award for hiring due to their cultural ambassador programme, which created a recruitment process that defined ‘culture fit’. “Organisations don’t have to create policies as robust as the award winners,” he said. “A successful policy could be something as simple as a shared charitable initiative, an acknowledgement of small wins throughout the company or taking time out to welcome new members to the team.” Benkanoun-Greene said the key point of the survey process is that companies can’t become a great workplace unless a clear majority of their employees think it is. “While free food and beanbags can make a company a nice place to work, it won’t make it a great place to work. So, the survey measures aspects like credibility, respect, fairness, pride, and camaraderie.” Tweet Share Email Share More Share Pin This Reddit Related: jobs, Intel, PayPal, Version 1, working life, AOL, Salesforce, Vodafone, employers, BMS, Liberty IT By Jenny Darmody Jenny joined Silicon Republic in 2016 as part of the Careers team.

Everyone has a different perception of what an engineer is, depending on their industry. Those working in construction think of civil and structural engineers. Tech workers will think of software. Those with a science background will think of processes. Engineers Week celebrates all of them. As tech, in particular, has grown exponentially over the last number of years, the role of the engineer has earned increased prominence in the zeitgeist. Suddenly engineers, now synonymous with Silicon Valley cool, have a certain celebrity among other tech roles. Of course, tech is far from holding a monopoly on the ‘engineer’ title, and other sectors hire engineers in droves. Given Ireland’s status as a sci-tech hub – with Dublin’s Silicon Docks, Galway’s biotech cluster and the big pharma companies dotted around the island – engineering roles are prevalent within these borders. For Engineers Week, we’ve taken a look at some of the top companies currently hiring engineers in Ireland, and gathered them here in one handy list.

Ericsson drew crowds at its demonstration at Mobile World Congress 2017. Credit: Ericsson via flickr Most Popular The who's who of 5G are an alliance of global powers acting as both friend and foe. They include operators like Verizon, T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom and AT&T; vendors such as Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei, Samsung and ZTE, which build the tech that would deploy 5G; and chipset manufacturers like Intel and Qualcomm, whose processors power things like smartphones and autonomous cars. Big money to be made on new equipment and services provides a big reason for the companies to team up. "Right now, we are in this pre-standard phase which is always a little bit like the wild west," said Helena Norrman, chief marketing officer at Ericsson. "Standards sometimes may not be equally good for companies because some companies can make more money if they make their own, depending on which businesses they're pursuing." Related Stories Why 5G Will Make Smartphones the Least Interesting Thing in Mobile The Magic of 5G: Faster Web, Less Wire and Innovative Plays for Marketers Without an overall standard, 5G could fail to deliver its promise of a truly connected world. When 2G arrived in the 1990s with no definitive standard, some phones worked only in certain countries or with particular carriers. One influential group in determining the development deadlines and ultimate standards is 3GPP, with members from every part of the world. Participating trade associations and their own members collaborate with their counterparts, but that doesn't mean there are no winners or losers. A company that contributes a key element will not only help align 5G with its business model but be compensated as others in the mobile ecosystem use that intellectual property. Everyone else still benefits from the open standard and accelerated development process. "You pay a certain price for it, but it is all there, it is all open for you to use and everyone can use the same technology, which then brings a lot of scale, which brings down prices for consumers," Ms. Norrman said. "That's really, really different than other industries."

The primary aim of TIP is to bring mobile operators, infrastructure providers, system integrators, and other technology companies together to collaborate on the development of new technologies and reimagine traditional approaches to building and deploying telecom network infrastructure. Operators and the broader telecom industry need to collaborate, be more flexible, innovative and efficient, and TIP looks to help achieve this goal. As a pioneer in telecommunications in the Middle East and Africa, Zain brings vast expertise and resources to the initiative as it will leverage its regional footprint and experience in network deployments across challenging territories to support TIP. TIP is exploring new approaches and technologies across these initial focus areas: access, backhaul, and core and management. The projects within these areas utilize the unique engineering and operational expertise of each member, focusing on developing new technologies and exploring new approaches to deployment in both developed and emerging markets. Each member contributes to the area of its expertise, while learning from others so that together all parties can collaborate and build better, faster, more efficient systems. Advertisement Commenting on becoming a part of the TIP initiative, Scott Gegenheimer, Zain Group CEO said, “It could be argued that scaling traditional telecom infrastructure to meet the ever-increasing demand for broadband data is not moving as fast as it needs to ensure customers receive the mobile experience they demand and deserve. Zain recognizes there isn’t a single solution for this, and that no one company can tackle the problem alone. We firmly believe collaboration in innovation will drive efficiencies in our business and we are keen to be part of such prime opportunities wherever they may arise.” Gegenheimer continued, “Being a staunch advocate of the expansion of connectivity for all, Zain fully appreciates the power the internet has to enhance and empower the communities it serves. There are 4 billion people in the world who still don’t have a data connection and we commend Facebook and the other founding companies for kick-starting TIP. We have high expectations that this initiative will result in bridging the digital divide by greater inclusion, and call on for more of our regional and industry peers to join us in this initiative.” Since the launch of TIP in February 2016, the initiative has achieved numerous milestones including the creation of ‘TIP Ecosystem Acceleration Centers’ that incubate local talent around the world and accelerate product development through support from leading global and local investors. A ‘People and Process Project Group’ was also created in order to develop and share cultural and process transformation best practices that can improve operators’ key metrics. In addition, Facebook contributed Voyager, the industry’s first white-box transponder and IP/MPLS routing solution that was successfully tested. Furthermore, Facebook’s OpenCellular designs and schematics are now fully open source within TIP to accelerate the industry’s ability to provide wireless access in remote areas of the world. Driving a faster pace of innovation in telecom infrastructure is necessary to meet new technology challenges and to unlock new opportunities for everyone in the ecosystem. Flexibility will be key in everything TIP does though and the goal is to allow mobile network systems to evolve without having to start over. Zain, together with other leading industry entities across the globe, are committed to exploring new technologies and approaches that will positively impact mobile users of today and the future.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs March 6, 2017 Descent into Fascism: Corporate-Militarist Paradigm by Norman Pollack by Tweet Email Trump’s speech to a joint-session of Congress, 2-28, is a milestone in political-ideological deception. Joseph Goebbels could not have said it better, the “it” being the inversion of American reality as the nation seeks a further leg up on global hegemony and at the same time cheapens if not degrades its labor force. Liberals feel a sense of outrage, focusing their criticism on much benighted Jeff Sessions, rather than on the emasculation of government, near-destruction of the social welfare sector, a monstrous arms build-up, absolute spoliation of water and other resources, and defying other environmental needs and safeguards, not least the effect of fracking and coal mining on climate change. Liberals, i.e., Democrats, are either unable and unwilling to protest on the systemic level (whatever the issue) or have already become, as complicit partners, a hazily leftwing extension of the Trumpian weltanschauung or consensus forming in the United States. From a Left standpoint, they are a disgrace to human identity and humanitarian ideals, like the Republicans corporatist in assumptions (here a modified hierarchical social order) and militaristic in every fiber of their being, a heritage of anticommunism still subscribed to and intended by their patriotism to remove all stigma to disloyalty. The pusillanimous fight they are putting up against Trump tends to confirm the preceding characterization. By descent I don’t mean final destination arrived at, merely, up until now the circumnavigation of fascism (in its early, more corporatist form, as in the activities and approval of the National Association of Manufacturers, rather than—isolationism quite pronounced—militarism in overt form) beginning in the 1920s. In Europe and Japan there are of course stirrings of fascism in that decade, with Italy actualizing the form, and in the 1930s Germany and Japan truly come into their own in that respect. The source for this development is capitalism, with specific ideologies, now incorporating avowed militarism, becoming rationales for both intra-capitalist rivalries and blunt anti-socialism. With and following World War II, militaristic underpinnings have become a necessitous element in the definition of capitalism, nowhere more clearly seen than in the US. Now, with Trump, circumnavigation around, is turning directly into the penetration of the genuine article. We move, under Trump, as in his address to Congress, from “exploitative capitalism,” the traditional form, to “liar capitalism,” which subsumes into itself the former, yet adds a dimension of ulterior disguise and motive that makes one alert to the prospect of permanent change. Fascism can be many-layered, and, as in Nazi Germany, seemingly less bottomless in depravity, but as I’ve noted elsewhere, it doesn’t require the concentration camp or gas chamber, and primarily, in historical form, it is based ultimately on the close alignment (co-partnership) of capitalism and the state, or more concretely, business and government. In that structural context, the impetus of the first to the second (although a reverse influence is also manifest) is the creation and reinforcement of hierarchy as the organizing principle of the social order. The capitalist class system, already in place, is then superimposed on what becomes a class-state, to defend and replenish of which the military factor springs forth as though by necessity. For fascism to operate, the parallel structures require the degree of integration which renders each of them more internally advanced, the better to complement and reinforce the potential war-provoking tendencies of both. And more, social regimentation as well is a long-term product of class and war (or its constant threat as presented by its leaders). Even without their closeness in a formal sense, we see that each, especially starting with the twentieth century, contains, as a separable factor, the same quest for hegemony and self-aggrandizement having the effect of creating a common, synthesized ruling group. Trump, in all his arrogant innocence—innocence in the sense of ignorance of how devastating his role is, for the destruction of a society that still claims to be a democratic polity—is fairly transparent in the deceptions practiced, measured by the policies already charted or enacted compared with statements he is making (the speech to Congress) or has already made. He is adept at locating the discussion of military strengthening, tax favoritism to giant corporations, the near-destruction of public-school education (only one of several options, with no special tax benefits), and the generalized dismantlement of government, in a context with platitudes about citizenship, patriotism, American greatness, in sum, a demagogic mishmash whose function is, beyond promoting concentrated wealth, deregulation, and national power, the obfuscation pure and simple of all policy making because detrimental to societal democratization and the heading off of the threat of fascism (itself subject to all manner of euphemistic expressions). Let’s turn, then, to the speech. (I am drawing on the prepared text, and may have missed slight alterations or verbal asides—as well as his use of repetition.) Trump begins with a celebration of “our Nation’s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains,” and a philo-Semitism addressing the threat to Jewish community centers and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. High-minded and certainly unobjectionable, save that his framework and appointments—a genuinely white man’s party—and his remarks in defense of Judaism which come down to the ironclad support for Israel, purposely lack a (small-“d”) democratic thrust in relating to each. He follows the tribute with, typical throughout the speech, a splurge of sentiment in which his speechwriters (Bannon? etc.) must have taken delight in their craftsmanship: “Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice—in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. This torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.” The American future converges on Trump, a frightening thought when one considers how he is reaching already to become the Leader, his melding with his followers (it is presumed he speaks for the Nation), the toleration hardly expected to be coming applied to dissident views or, in steamroller mode on his part, resistance and opposition. Thus, he states: “A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.” After more of the same, this wondrous state of mind is joined by hints at military superiority and greatness: “Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world—friend or foe—will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.” In his contemplation of the future (America soon will celebrate its 250th year), he then begins to pull out the stops on his fervent nationalism, his ridicule of past presidents, his claims of generosity in foreign policy: “I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries [outsourcing on the part of the very corporations he praises in the speech and as a constant theme]. We’ve financed and built one global project after another [not to say, his own activities in creating international projects], but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit—and so many other places throughout our land.” Concern for the poor is touching, but it seems contrary to his Billionaire Cabinet, plans for military expansion which directly affect the fate of ameliorating conditions in the inner cities, and his active promotion, the whole weight of his administration, on furthering the inequitable distribution of wealth. And the recriminatory spirit continues, this despite his previous disregard for borders where investment is concerned: “We’ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross [open sesame for anti-immigrant policy and feeling]—and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.” That infrastructure, frequently mentioned in the speech, is the province of privatization, not, like the New Deal, testimony to the will of government to stand on behalf of the public function. Here Trump the megalomaniac speaks up, the undisputed leader of a mass movement bursting the seams of government itself, so vast the groundswell for change as he directs it: “Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest [from the Nazi playbook, making “rebellion” the basis for a popular movement of the dispossessed, and not the rich industrialist or banker], spoken by families of all colors and creeds—families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.” It grew, plain folk angry and on the march: “But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus—as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.” (In all fairness to Trump, this was a somewhat accurate description of the 2016 election, in which the fascistic proclivities of a wide swath of the citizenry came out of the woodwork to give him the nomination and election, provided of course it is also recognized that electorate and candidate each reinforced these proclivities of the other.) He completes the description of political inundation, a tidal wave of Reaction: “Finally, the chorus became an earthquake—and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first—because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN [the form in the transcript]. If this is not a good introduction to incipient fascism, I don’t know what is, as if, to go back, Hitler told the workers (another euphemism, “soldiers in industry”) you are first and foremost a German, divorced from class roots or alternative identities. From there to the aforementioned mishmash, militarism and monopoly capital get somehow lost in the deeds putatively to be accomplished. Thus, “Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land…. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.” Here Trump wants “to update the Nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises.” The honor roll of corporate wealth is presented as exemplification of America First, yet in several cases known previously for their overseas investments: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States [that may be true, to be on the good side of Trump] and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” But none with a practical presence in international economic affairs is going to divest and return home, nor attempt to alter the structure of world capitalism (except as it continues to further US prominence and predominance globally), which is already in America’s favor. In Trump’s bag of rhetorical tricks, we see the inveterate boastfulness, he, the near messiah, flattered by the loyalty of a large public in the maw of false consciousness, take credit for the rise of the market simultaneous with, not coincidentally, drastic cutting of the welfare sector, his supporters cheering “U.S.A.” along the way. Only the military benefits from his priorities and framework of government: “The stock market gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. [I think here of Huey Long’s “Every man a king,” except that Trump operates on a gigantic scale—and Long possibly had some redeeming features, such as eschewing race-baiting in the deep South.] We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter [debatable savings given the record thus far, and, when Trump uses “fantastic,” unlikely to upset the apple cart given his admiration of weapons systems], and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.” Behind the theme of budget savings, however, lies the cardinal demand for deregulation, which opens the way for an attack on the environment: “We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations [the use of working people to camouflage staking out a claim for corporate capitalism], creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency: imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.” The 1 for 2 ruling is, in conception, a veiled effort to destroy, given its arbitrary nature, the regulatory effectiveness of the process—cynicism nonpareil. As for the environment, on pending measures, he says: “We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines—thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs—and I’ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.” Quite a first five weeks of activity, this reminds me of a dystopian vision of FDR’s Hundred Days in microcosm, a vicious approach to what should have been a rebuilding effort of renaissance proportions. Stopping the supply of drugs from entering America becomes the whipping boy for unrelated, or seemingly related, aspects of Trump’s program: obviously, the construction of the wall, but also the purification of domestic America, immigration-controls in general, and job creation. Trump’s get-tough policies represent a top-down framing of injecting totalitarian controls on society, using crime as a catch-all for pretext of embellishing the theme of Fortress America, which implicitly suffuses the speech. He states: “We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth—and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” Then the direct jump: “At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.” Hard to know if he here fuses Mexicans and Muslims from the seven proscribed countries as a unified threat, but the speech constantly invokes a genocidal vision of so-called deplorables or undesirables: “We want all Americans to succeed—but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.” Rule of law is problematic, with the much-feared round-up already in progress. Restoring integrity means, “we will soon begin the construction of a great wall [now Trump, Chinese Emperor] along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.” Trump has not forgotten the presumed Muslim threat: “Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.” In fact, he sees that practically lurking under every bed: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country,” and then there are attacks “in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.” And so, “[i]t is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.” Spoken like a true patriot. Trump is on the job, having issued orders for the “Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS,” impose “new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program,” and reaffirm “our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel,” all of this immediately followed by a tribute to the late Antonin Scalia, whose wife sat in the gallery. As he approaches the closing, his speech takes on a current of hyper-nationalism, achieved through criticism of previous, especially Obama’s, administrations. The gloves are off: “Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.” Perversely, these are the very facts which give a lie to what he hopes to accomplish, given his failure to consider any but rightist proposals for societal improvement: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.” To boot, “we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.” Much of which Trump criticizes could be said by a radical, on unemployment and a consequent maldistribution of wealth, except that his premise for constructing and justifying the criticism is the near-irrefragable principle (to him) of privatization, the self-evident goal in displacing the welfare and/or regulatory functions of government. We have no assurance that each problem he cites would not fare still worse under his aegis. He even calls at this point for bipartisan cooperation in advancing his agenda: solving the foregoing, “and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.” With that flourish, we now, but briefly, find the emphasis on antigovernment privatization: “But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy [as though it was in the hands until now of nefarious socialists]—making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.” To sugar the pot, Trump adds: “Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world [a dubious assertion]. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so that they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. [Fortress America is not the abandonment of foreign markets. Autarky here has an expansive dimension of growth.] At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.” Both workers and the middle class provide buffers against the government’s getting too close in the regulation of these companies. Complaining about high tariffs placed on American goods, yet “when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing,” Trump, using Harley Davison (“they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House”) for illustration, he lambastes other countries for their protective tariff, proclaiming: “I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE [caps in the original transcript].” By now his message is clear: the wall to protect against immigrants is analogous to the wall sealing America from global restrictions by its aggressive business and military leaders, this through leaping over economic battlements without fear of retaliation. He wants the adoption of a merit-based system of immigration, infrastructural improvement, citing Eisenhower’s record on the interstate highway system, and, on rebuilding, the observance of two principles: Buy American, and Hire American. This he attaches to what is quite different: “Tonight, I am calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice [privatization], increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. None of these is, or will be, shown for likely adoption. Of course, instead, again privatization: “Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. [That compulsory in practice?] The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do…. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges—leaving America with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken.” Not a word on the public option or sIngle-payer system, which would go a long way to correcting the present high costs and his other complaints, freedom of choice, another barrier, ideological in nature, to prevent direct government involvement. Trump is impatient. On health care, he says: “Obamacare is collapsing—and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice—it is a necessity.” He presents a five-part plan, in scrapping the existing system never mentioning the privatization route by name, and he does this with a plea for bipartisan cooperation, which, for Democrats, surrenders what little there is worth retaining. Hence, he says: “I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.” A private system is the watchword, so that, on point one, the movement to that status is clear from his demand that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage [implying a transfer of coverage], and that we have a stable transition [again implying a transfer from public to private] for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.” Second, more specific, “we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts—but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.” (One might see Trump’s thinking revolving around the fetishism of choice, except that “choice” is coded to indicate the correct direction.) Third, “we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.” That is, sacrifice Medicaid to the states entirely, the likelihood of adequate coverage for all problematic. Fourth, afford the medical profession absolute protection against malpractice and other suits—patients, like workers and the middle class, a barrier to taking effective action, and fifth, provide direct assistance to the health insurance industry, allowing companies to cross state lines—“creating a truly competitive national marketplace [once more sanctioning the private] that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.” Introducing from the gallery another guest, a young woman who at 15 months had contracted “a rare and serious illness,” whose father “founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.” She is now 20. What is interesting is the use made of a purely human interest story—a criticism of the Food and Drug Administration for not hastening the review process in evaluating the safety of drugs: “If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.” This of course applies to regulation in general, a persnickety federal government gumming up the works, inconsistent with—as in coal—the dismantling of government by the new forces in Washington. And in a neat quarter turn to a pressing subject on the regulatory front—the survival of public education—Trump, as in his selection of DeVos as education secretary, throws himself four-square on several alternative possibilities all on the private side of the ledger. On the offering of choice, and using blacks and Latinos as enticement for his plan, he states: “I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.” In politicizing school education—quite a menu of choices—Trump has the chutzpah of wrapping schools in a context of civil rights, perhaps calculated to resonate among liberals (to the sacrifice of public education), for as he says preceding the list: “Education is the civil rights issue of our time.” More guests are recognized, each supporting one of Trump’s talking points. One, Denisha, “failed third grade twice…. [b]ut then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit and scholarship program.” Then came remarks on violence, the murder rate in Chicago, and the need for cooperation with and respect for the police: “We must build bridges of cooperation and trust—not drive the wedge of disunity and division.” This is well put, although he sentimentalizes the topic bringing it into line with the tenor of his law-and-order self-created mandate: “We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.” And to drive home the dangers out there (immigrant scare?) he states, “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE—Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement,” a prejudgment further enflaming the populace when it comes on board. Then, not through, he introduces four more guests from the gallery, victims, themselves or a loved one, of crime. The emphasis on crime and violence suddenly introduces him, as though related, to the virtues of a strong military. Brief and to the point: “Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and—if they must—to fight and win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester [that which sets it apart], and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” There is to be more for veterans in the package: “Our veterans have delivered for this Nation—and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.” He then uses the death of Navy SEAL Ryan Owen, his “legacy etched into history,” although there remains doubt about the efficacy of the raid, to assert: “To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.” Coming from on high, already to dissuade critics of policy, here foreign policy, Trump softens—for home political consumption—his Fortress America idea, first conceding little, “Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security issues that we share with our allies across the globe.” Next, he gives, contrary to his recent record, qualified support to NATO: “We strongly support NATO…. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.” Acknowledging his nationalist (from what just preceded, nationalism itself is code for the corporate-militarist paradigm) deeply-embedded viewpoint, Trump announces: “We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations…. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict—not more.” Let’s leave matters at that; he does not let go of dramatizing the high ground: “Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.” Setting free, liberating, follow from reducing the intervention of government in the people’s lives. Why not proclaim victory, given the moral virtue of America? He outlines the factors in part composing America’s greatness: “This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God.’ Trump wants Americans to Think Big, capitalist in inspiration, a vital private sector buttressed by taking regulation off the table, venerating and appreciating the contribution being made for all of us by successful men of business, and possessing armed might second to none. I see fascism in the spirit and substance of the harmonious relations between capitalism and the state, found in earlier administrations going back, but now reaching a tipping point to seemingly irreversible structural-ideological trends under Trump. Without wishing to sound cryptic, I believe being is becoming, that is, the present context of power is rapidly progressing into a new political reality, a state having the makings of authoritarianism, which foretells the future—its petrification—of democracy. The military neatly tucked into more pacific concerns, I have sought to point out some of the contradictions in Trump’s speech.

Restaurants Editorials Letters to the Editor Endorsements Submission Policies Erik Lukens column Home Opinion Commentary: Entrepreneurship, innovation flourish when immigration welcomed print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Commentary: Entrepreneurship, innovation flourish when immigration welcomed By Stephen Tang / For The Philadelphia Inquirer Published Mar 6, 2017 at 12:02AM As the son of immigrant scientists — and as a scientist myself — I am deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s immigration policy. As the leader of a tech-based economic development organization, I’m even more apprehensive about the policy’s impact on innovation, entrepreneurship and America’s ability to compete on a global scale. I’m saddened to see this blunt-force policy affect the fate of the immigrants who have been stopped at our borders and turned away, as well as the impact on hopeful new visa applicants. Regardless of rumored changes, the policy has already sent a troubling signal to the rest of the world. We cannot forget that America was built on the twin bedrocks of immigration and entrepreneurship. Imagine starting over in a new country and using your wits and grit to launch a company, provide for family, and succeed. That was the experience of many of our grandparents and parents. Today’s immigrant entrepreneurs (often fleeing persecution in their native countries) continue that tradition of bootstrapping as they create new technologies and products. They embody the American Dream. Yet in the clamor of today’s 24/7 cycle of cable and internet news, their contributions are often overlooked and their voices are frequently missing from our nation’s rancorous debate over immigration. Imagine what life would be like without immigrant entrepreneurs such as Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone and founded what is now known as AT&T; or French-born E.I. DuPont, who founded the chemical giant in my home state of Delaware; or Intel founder Andy Grove, who was born in Hungary and revolutionized the semiconductor industry. Or, for that matter, immigrant Alexander Hamilton, who gave our fledgling nation a banking and economic system that still exists today. Today’s immigrant entrepreneurs include Sergey Brin of Google, Elon Musk of Tesla, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani. Together, their companies employ more than 70,000 people. At my organization, the University City Science Center, nearly one-third of the 58 companies in our business incubator were founded by someone born outside of the United States. Entrepreneurs such as Yasmine Mustafa, a Palestinian immigrant, whose startup ROAR for Good is developing wearable technology to prevent attacks on women. And Indian immigrant Mihir Shah, whose company, UE LifeSciences, is disrupting breast-cancer diagnostics around the globe. Yasmine, Mihir, and their fellow immigrant entrepreneurs are creating technologies and products that are transforming the world — and our economy. And they are a force that is moving America — their adopted homeland — forward. Here are some amazing statistics: • Immigrants account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population. Yet they represent more than a quarter of America’s entrepreneurs. • Nearly one-third of venture-backed founders are immigrant entrepreneurs. • More than half of America’s startups valued at $1 billion or more were started by immigrants. These numbers — and the voices and sacrifices behind them — are missing from our national debate on immigration. And that omission is creating a dangerous distortion in the immigration narrative. We need these brilliant people with their bright ideas, the companies they form, and the jobs they create. When immigration and entrepreneurship intersect, magic can — and often does — happen. We cannot afford to see that magic disappear. — Stephen Tang is the president and CEO of the University City Science Center in Philadelphia and co-chairman of the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. 16609233 View next article in Opinion     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Networking | March 6, 2017 -- 01:16 GMT (17:16 PST) | Topic: Networking Microsoft is finally moving its latest Linux Skype client to beta and adding the ability to video-conference with other people using the latest model of Skype. Skype for Linux has finally gotten to beta status with new features. Microsoft has taken its own sweet time with this move. The new version of Skype for Linux went into alpha in July 2016. There were some improvements since then, but they're not that impressive. more MWC 2017 Nokia, BlackBerry, Moto indicate smartphones entering retro era Hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Tab S3 and Windows 10 Galaxy Book LG G6 unveiled: Big screen, water resistance, dual cameras Nokia goes back to the future with three Android smartphones What you need to know about Motorola's Moto G5 Huawei unveils Watch 2, Watch 2 Classic CNET: Latest news from Barcelona This new Skype, though, promises real interoperability between Skype for Linux and the rest of the Skype family. And, you know what? It delivers. I put the Skype beta through its paces on the latest and greatest Linux Mint distribution, Mint 18.1, with the Cinnamon desktop. For the hardware, I used my main desktop, an older Dell XPS 8300. This PC has a 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 8GBs of RAM, and an AMD/ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphic card. I used a Logitech C510 Webcam for audio and video input. The new Skype promises three new features. This starts with calling updates. These enable you to call to mobiles and landlines with Skype credit. It also lets you make one-to-one video calls from Linux to Skype to users running the latest versions of Skype for Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac. The alpha had enabled you to make video calls to other Linux and Chromebook Skype users, but that was it. This new version let me call cell phones and landline phones with no trouble. The video calls were more troublesome. First, as you had in the past on many Linux distributions, to get your webcam and Skype on the same page you must make sure the Video4Linux (V4L2) application programming interface (API) library and drivers are loaded. Once that's done, you need to create the file /usr/local/bin/skype as the root user. In the Debian/Ubuntu Linux family you do this with this command from your shell: sudo vi /usr/local/bin/skype You can replace "vi" with your favorite programming editor. Once opened, if you're running 32-bit Linux you enter the following: #!/bin/bash LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype If you're running a 64-bit Linux you use these lines instead: #!/bin/bash LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libv4l/v4l1compat.so /usr/bin/skype Then exit and save the file. That done, you make your new file executable with the command: sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/skype You can now exit the shell and start Skype. Your webcam should work with Skype now. It did for me. Next, you must find someone running the latest version of Skye on another platform to test video-conferencing out. In my experience, video-conferencing will not work if your colleagues are running an old edition of Skype. Even so, I had glitches when talking with users. In one case, while we were able to talk just fine, we could never make a video connection. Still this is a beta program, so that's not too surprising. Another new feature is that Linux users can now view shared screens from other Skype desktop clients. These users must be running Skype for Windows 7.33 and above or Skype for Mac 7.46 and above. Unlike video-conferencing, this worked without any trouble. However, you can't share your Linux desktop with other users. Finally, Skype's launcher now shows the number of unread conversations. And a long-needed basic feature is now present: You can see when your online contacts are showing Away and Do Not Disturb statuses. That's the good news. The bad news is there's still no group video-conferencing. In addition, Skype for Linux loves memory. After I had it on for a few hours, it was taking up 2GBs of RAM. There are other annoyances. For example, you can't search through your instant messages logs and "Rename Contacts" isn't enabled. All in all, it's better, but I have to say it doesn't look all that much better than the previous generaton of Skype for Linux, which was last refreshed in March 2013. Personally, I'm sticking with Google Hangouts for my video-conferencing needs. It runs flawlessly on Linux. If, however, your office has standardized on Skype, this is still a major step forward. Just keep in mind that it's still very much a work in progress. Want to try it for yourself? Skype for Linux beta is ready for download. Its page, however, still lists it as Skype for Linux alpha. The documentation also hasn't been updated.

The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. “I think he's right in that there was surveillance and that it was conducted at the behest of the attorney — of the Justice Department through the FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] court,” Mukasey told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. At the same time, he said that Trump was “not correct” in saying that the former US President ordered the surveillance. According to Mukasey, the wiretap could mean suspicion that someone in Trump Tower may have been acting as “an agent of Russians.” The US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee will carry out an investigation into Trump's "wiretapping" accusations, committee Chair Devin Nunes said Sunday. ...

Unlike the original executive order from Jan. 27 that now sits in legal limbo, Iraq is the one country excluded from the 90-day ban, the official said, because the Iraqi government has made “firm commitments” to the U.S. to work toward increased cooperation in terms of information-sharing. The revised order will not indefinitely block Syrian refugees from the U.S., as the original ban had directed, and the 120-day halt to the refugee program will apply to all countries. Like the original order, the administration is lowering the previous administration’s cap for refugees admitted to the U.S. from 110,000 to 50,000 for the current fiscal year. House Republicans unveil plan for health care overhaul House Republicans have released their long-awaited bill dismantling much of former President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. The measure would roll back the government’s health care role and is expected to result in fewer people having insurance coverage.         House committees planned votes on the legislation Wednesday. That will launch perhaps the year’s defining battle in Congress, and GOP success is by no means assured because of internal divisions. The plan would repeal the law’s fines on people who don’t purchase health insurance. Instead of the statute’s income-based premium subsidies, people would get tax credits based on age. The subsidies would phase out for higher-earning people. McCain, Graham ask Trump for evidence of wiretapping claims Republican Senators are asking for evidence of President Trump’s assertion that former President Obama had ordered the wiretapping of Trump tower. “I think the President should tell the American people what evidence he has that indicates his predecessor wiretapped Trump Tower,” Senator John McCain (R-AZ) told reporters on Monday evening. “It was a very serious charge and one that needs corroboration,” noted McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “If it’s true it’s earth-shattering,” commented Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). When asked if Mr. Trump’s claims were a distraction, he responded, “it’s not a distraction as much as it is unnerving if it’s true.” DHS says 300 refugees are being investigated by FBI for terror ties During the announcement of the new travel ban executive order, Attorney General Jeff Sessions attempted to make the case for the pause in allowing refugees into the U.S. with a statement warning of the potential national security danger they pose. “[M]ore than 300 people who came here as refugees are under FBI investigation for potential terrorism-related activities,” Sessions said Monday morning. He also said that those who are “seeking to support or commit terrorist attacks here will try to enter through our refugee program.”    The line also appears in the text of the executive order: “The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Trump offers to maintain Planned Parenthood funding if it halts abortions President Donald Trump has offered to maintain federal funding for Planned Parenthood if the group stops providing abortions. Its president spurned the proposal and noted that federal money already is not allowed to be used for abortion.  Trump confirmed Monday there had been discussions after The New York Times inquired about what it described as an informal proposal.  In a statement, Mr. Trump said polling shows most Americans oppose public funding for abortion.  Trump’s new travel ban executive order is unveiled Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled the new travel ban executive order Monday morning. There are a number of things that are different in this version of the travel ban.  Tillerson told reporters that after the signing of the first order, there was an intensive review of Iraq’s vetting policies, and as a result, the two countries would implement “multiple security measures” to help prevent people with “criminal or terroristic intent” from reaching the U.S. Kelly pointed out that nothing in the new executive order affects “existing, lawful permanent residents or persons with current authorization to enter our homeland.” FISA expert breaks down Trump’s wiretap accusation against Obama President Trump on Saturday accused former President Obama of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower during the election. The unsubstantiated and unprecedented claim is raising eyebrows. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), hundreds of warrants are issued each year to allow eavesdropping on a “foreign power or agent of a foreign power.” But according to the Justice Department, the president cannot order a wiretap if the surveillance involves “communication to which a U.S. person is a party.” Poll: Two-thirds of Americans want special prosecutor for Trump-Russia investigation Two-thirds of Americans believe a special prosecutor should be appointed to investigate potential ties between Trump campaign aides and Russia, according to a new poll out Monday. In the poll, from CNN/ORC, 65 percent of those surveyed said they thought an independent special prosecutor should handle the investigation, compared with 32 percent who said Congress is capable of looking into the allegations against the president and his top aides. These numbers come the week after reports that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice with the Russian ambassador during the campaign, a revelation that resulted in Sessions recusing himself from future investigations involving the Trump campaign. DOJ asked by FBI to reject Trump’s wiretapping accusation On Saturday, senior FBI officials called Justice Department officials and asked that they publicly reject President Trump’s assertion that then-President Obama ordered the wiretapping of then-candidate Trump’s phones, CBS News’ Jeff Pegues reported, citing law enforcement sources. The message to the Justice Department came from FBI Director James Comey, who disputed the claim because it falsely suggests that the FBI broke the law. AP: Key lawmakers say they’ll investigate Trump’s wiretapping claim Key members of Congress say they will honor President Donald Trump’s request to investigate his unsubstantiated claim that Barack Obama overstepped his authority as president and had Trump’s telephones tapped during the election campaign. A U.S. official said the FBI has asked the Justice Department to dispute Trump’s allegation, though no such statement has been issued. Obama’s intelligence director also said no such action was ever carried out. AP: Fact-checking what Trump has taken credit for The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over from the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time.  Conservative news chief details call with “p---ed off” Trump Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the long-running conservative website Newsmax, says he talked to President Trump over the weekend and hasn’t “seen him this p---ed off in a long time.” “I spoke with the president twice yesterday about the wiretap story. I haven’t seen him this p---ed off in a long time,” Ruddy wrote in a Sunday column. On Saturday, Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that former President Obama had wiretapped his phones before the election. What you missed yesterday Clapper: No FISA order for Trump’s offices Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated for part of the national security apparatus he oversaw as DNI, that to his knowledge, there was no FISA court order for Trump’s offices. Clapper, who made the comments on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” added that while he can’t speak for other Title 3 entities or local or state law enforcement, he would know if the FBI ordered some sort of surveillance. “I can deny it,” he said definitively. Top Dem on Senate Intel Committee says Trump wiretap tweets “very reckless” President Donald Trump’s explosive accusations about his White House predecessor’s wiretapping activities during the 2016 election have dominated headlines since he first tweeted them Saturday morning -- and two top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee discussed their implications on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), the committee’s vice chair, said Mr. Trump’s Saturday morning tweets -- in which he accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower for political reasons -- were “reckless.” Mr. Trump did not cite any evidence in his tweets, though similar claims had been circulating in the conservative media in recent days. Leon Panetta: White House “paying a price” for lack of discipline After another weekend in which a tweet from President Donald Trump upended the political world, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta said the the White House is “paying a price” for its lack of “discipline.” “When the president goes off and does what he did in the last few days of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there’s something wrong,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “There’s something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate.” Trump calls on Congress to investigate wiretapping accusation President Trump is calling on Congress to investigate whether Obama abused his executive power during the presidential election. The White House issued a statement Sunday morning “requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.” The statement went on to say, “Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.” On Saturday morning, without citing any evidence, the president issued a series of tweets accusing Obama of tapping the phones in Trump Tower.  HHS Sec. Tom Price says “we believe in the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors” As President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans debate the future of Medicare, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said Sunday that Republicans “believe in the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors.” His comments come after President Donald Trump reiterated during his address to a joint session of Congress last week that he doesn’t want to change Medicare benefits. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he still thinks the future of Medicare is an “open question.” “Sunday Morning:” Kellyanne Conway: Counselor and target Last Sunday, Kellyanne Conway wasn’t defending her boss, President Donald J. Trump, on TV. She was at church, attending mass with her husband, attorney George T. Conway, and their four children, along with some friends. Breakfast at a diner came next, followed by some quality family time at their northern New Jersey home -- a brief return to what life used to be like. But these days, her Sunday routine is far from normal. The new normal includes full Secret Service protection. “Why? Have there been threats?” asked O’Donnell. “Yes,” Conway replied. “I have 24/7 Secret Service protection.” “Face the Nation” Vice Chairman of the Sen. Select Committee on Intelligence Mark Warner, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, HHS Secretary Tom Price and former Defense Secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta are the guests on “Face the Nation” this week. AP review: High court nominee Gorsuch inclined to limit environmental groups Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has shown a willingness to limit the participation of environmental groups in lawsuits involving public lands, writing in one case that allowing conservationists to intervene could complicate and slow down the judicial process, according to an Associated Press review of his rulings as a federal appeals court judge. Gorsuch has spent a decade on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears disputes about public lands ranging from energy companies’ drilling rights to the use of off-road vehicles in national forests across six Western states. AP: National Monuments Republican leaders in Maine and Utah are asking President Donald Trump to step into uncharted territory and rescind national monument designations made by his predecessor. The Antiquities Act of 1906 doesn’t give the president power to undo a designation, and no president has ever taken such a step. But Trump isn’t like other presidents. Former President Barack Obama used his power under the act to permanently preserve more land and water using national monument designations than any other president. The land is generally off limits to timber harvesting, mining and pipelines, and commercial development. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Twitter Facebook Fileless Powershell malware uses DNS as covert communication channel DNSMessenger is a multistage threat written in Powershell that uses DNS for two-way communication with attackers Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 04 March, 2017 04:01 - - - - print email Comments Targeted attacks are moving away from traditional malware to stealthier techniques that involve abusing standard system tools and protocols, some of which are not always monitored. The latest example is an attack dubbed DNSMessenger, which was analyzed by researchers from Cisco Systems' Talos team. The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document distributed through an email phishing campaign. When opened, the file masquerades as a "protected document" secured by McAfee, an antivirus brand now owned by Intel Security. The user is asked to click on the enable content button in order to view the document's content, but doing so will actually execute malicious scripting embedded within. The script is written in Powershell, a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks. What's interesting is that until this point, everything is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to disk. The second stage is also done in Powershell and involves checking for several parameters of the envrionment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of Powershell installed on the system. This information is used to determine how to proceed to the next step and how to achieve persistence. Depending on the result of the stage-two checks, yet another Powershell script will either be stored in an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in the NTFS file system or directly inside the registry. The third stage Powershell script contains an additional obfuscated script that establishes a fairly sophisticated two-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is normally used to look up the Internet Protocol addresses associated with domain names, but it has support for different types of records. The TXT record in particular allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response. "All C2 [command-and-control] communications associated with this malware are performed using DNS TXT queries and responses," the Cisco Talos researchers said in a blog post. This covert communication channel allows attackers to send commands to be executed on the system and to receive the output of those commands. Organizations typically go to great lengths to filter HTTP and HTTPS traffic that goes in and out of their networks, but not many of them monitor DNS. Attackers know this and are encapsulating other protocols inside DNS to remain undetected. The use of system tools like Powershell and code that's executed directly in memory are also increasingly common techniques that makes the detection of compromises much harder. "This malware sample is a great example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting," the Cisco Talos researchers said. "It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure." 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Alienware 13 Review: Laptop Size Doesn't Have To Matter Christina Warren Mar 6, 2017, 1:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  alienware alienware 13 dell gaming laptops gaming review review Share When it comes to playing games, I've always preferred consoles to computers. Building (or buying) a custom gaming rig can be fun, but I need a dedicated laptop. And gaming laptops can definitely bring the power, but often with a size and battery-life trade-off that would make it impossible to use in any non-gaming scenario. So it used to be that if I wanted to game, it was easier to for me to spend money on an Xbox One S or PlayStation 4 Pro, rather than messing with PCs. But the new Alienware 13 is changing my mind about gaming laptops.   Honestly, for Alienware, this design is quite understated The configuration I tested is pricey, running nearly $2,100 (which yes, is much more expensive than a console). It has an amazing 2560 x 1440 OLED display. It also includes a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake i7-7700HQ processor, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and Nvidia's GTX 1060 graphics card with 6GB of RAM. That's plenty of power for most gaming. I powered through Civilisation VI, Resident Evil 7, and Forza Horizon 3, and the Alienware 13 managed to keep up without a problem. In Forza, I had to drop down to 1080p for the graphics to work at 60fps, but that was actually impressive given that the PC port of Forza has a reputation for being terrible. With Resident Evil 7, there was sometimes a tiny delay in new areas appearing as I travelled through the game's maps at 60fps at the highest resolution. Dropping some of the textures back totally solved that problem. The computer is fast enough that it should even be able to handle some VR games, though nothing too visually taxing like Elite Dangerous. Battery life while gaming isn't going to be stellar. Not even the lower power requirements of a Kaby Lake processor is going to get the computer past the two and a half hour mark. But when used for everyday tasks, like watching video or doing browsing the internet, I managed to eek out almost seven hours. This kind of battery life is very impressive on a laptop with this much power Also impressive is the 2560 x 1440 OLED touch display. This screen is one of the best I've ever seen on a laptop, with blacks that practically disappear into the bezel, a great view from almost any angle, which is a problem for some other gaming laptops, and wonderfully vivid colours. Even the blue-emblazoned Alienware logo can't keep me from loving this screen. Check out the arse on this thing! But the price to pay this laptop's excellence its hulking size. At 3kg, it's way heavier than any of the best 33cm laptops I've reviewed over the last six months, and even heavier than it's closest competitor the 3.75 pound MSI GS43. This is not a laptop you want to lug around all the time, and people will absolutely mock you for the giant back end of the laptop — though it does give you room for a plethora of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, mini-DisplayPort, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet and that mostly useless Alienware Graphics Amplifier port (I mean, if you want to buy a whole other graphics card and the $US200 ($263) amp to try and soup up your games than be my guest...). The OLED screen is one of the best I've ever seen on a laptop. But you know what, the laptop is so good in all the ways that count, I don't even care! As a person who never considered a gaming laptop, the Alienware 13 has me filled with longing. At $2,099, this configuration is a lot more expensive than my Xbox One S setup, but it's capable of playing PC games, doing VR, and the battery life in on-gaming scenarios is good enough for actually getting shit done. If you're in the market for a good gaming laptop that can also be used as an actual portable computer, the Alienware 13 should be on your list. README This thing gets loud. Playing through Resident Evil 7 or Forza Horizon 3 causes the fans to spin with furor. The machine is hot and loud. But it's a quad-core processor and a very nice mobile GPU shoved inside a 33cm frame, so I guess this is to be expected. I had occasional problems with the wi-fi while playing games. That is, if I was trying to play a game and download another in the background, wi-fi would sometimes shut-off. I'm not sure the laptop or Windows 10 is to blame, but regardless it was frustrating. Again, the OLED screen is just fantastic. The keyboard and trackpad are both very good, not just for gaming, but for typing and getting shit done, too. Other than the trackpad lighting up and the keyboard having some backlight, this thing doesn't even look that much like a gaming laptop. Like, it doesn't scream it like some of Razer's designs do. The power brick is enormous because it is 180 watts. If you are going to travel with this thing, be aware of that added size and weight. You can configure much cheaper options that lack the 1060 graphics and the stunning OLED display and still get a good performing laptop. Comments Archfiend @travisnew87 Mar 6, 2017, 8:22pm Should you really be calling it a mobile GPU when it is not categorised as mobile? It simply runs a lower clock and TDP. Reply 0 nizmo_man @nizmo_man Mar 7, 2017, 10:28am WiFi related issue might be because of the heat. When I had a gaming laptop (MSi GE60), my old Zalman laptop cooler helped quite a bit (even when playing on my lap on the couch). Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Gadgets 8 0 0 March 3, 2017 Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Where Is It? Daryl Deino Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5 was widely expected to be released in March. Now that March is here, no announcement of the Surface Pro 5 appears to be near. There have been several sales and price cuts on the Surface Pro 4, which many thought meant that the Surface Pro 5 will be announced soon. There wasn’t always excitement for a new Surface Pro. When Microsoft released their flagship device in February of 2013, reviews were mixed. CNET gave the device three-and-a-half stars. “Microsoft and the Surface have proven the hardest point of all: that a tablet with a funky keyboard cover can replace a regular laptop, or even a desktop PC. The finer points of needing a dock, finding a better price that includes the Type Cover instead of making it a side purchase, and improving battery life — and, maybe, slimming down a bit — will hopefully come in the next iteration.” The Surface Pro 3 corrected the wrongs of the first two Surface Pro devices. [Image by Daryl Deino] It wasn’t until the Surface Pro 3, released in June of 2014, that Microsoft’s device hit the sweet spot with both great sales and critical acclaim. The newly-designed device earned four-and-a-half stars from Trusted Reviews. “Microsoft has finally nailed its tablet hybrid concept with the Surface Pro 3. It’s powerful, versatile and brilliantly put together. Not all laptop owners need apply, but the Surface Pro 3 is a convincing alternative.” The review especially praised the new flexible kickstand and the battery life. However, the battery life became an issue on the Surface Pro 4, especially before Microsoft release a firmware update. Overall, however, most would agree that the Surface Pro is the perfect laptop-tablet hybrid. Many believe the Surface Pro 4 is the perfect laptop-tablet hybrid. [Image by Daryl Deino] “The Surface Pro 4 is a microcosm of the change Microsoft is trying to spur inside its own walls. Time and time again, it missed the opportunity to leap on a new trend in consumer technology. But not with Surface. This time, Microsoft is a leader. It’s setting the trend. And unlike its new competitors, it’s had a few years to work out the kinks,” claimed Matt Smith of Digital Trends. So, what can we expect on the Surface Pro 5 when it’s released? Digital Trends has the news. “The Surface Pro 4 uses sixth-generation Intel Core processors and offers an excellent 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution, and 267 PPI. Anticipated — and logical — Surface Pro 5 updates, therefore, include a move to seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display option.” The article adds that in order to make the device as thin as possible, USB-3 ports may be replaced with USB-C ports — something Apple has been doing for the past year. Other possibilities listed include a wireless charging pen and a larger capacity battery. The one aspect that most agree on is the availability of a 4K screen on one of the higher-end versions of the Surface Pro 5. Since the success of the Surface Pro 3 and, especially, the Surface Pro 4, many other similar laptop hybrids have been released. HP recently released a pen-enabled 13-inch Spectre x360 hybrid, which has garnered excellent reviews. Then, there is Samsung, who is about to release the Galaxy Book, which will come in both 10-inch and 12-inch versions. According to CNET, the 12-inch version of the Galaxy Book will have a Super AMOLED screen.

Mesa 17.0.1 Adds Better Support for "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth," Other Games GO Several crashes were patched for the Gallium drivers Mar 5, 2017 23:06 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov was proud to announce this weekend the availability of the first point release to the recently released Mesa 17.0 3D Graphics Library stable series. The development cycle of Mesa 17.0.1 was small, and a Release Candidate (RC) build was announced just a few days ago, so we could give you a heads up on what's coming. Looking at the appended shortlog, we can notice that there are a little over 60 improvements implemented in this maintenance update. All sorts of changes are available, starting with better support for various games, including The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a fix for a regression with the EGL/Wayland support, many bug fixes for the Gallium drivers, as well as better eglQuerySurface geometry when using EGL under X11 with DRI3. "In this release we have GLX/GLVND fix for 'The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth' and other games. When using EGL under X11/DRI3 eglQuerySurface now returns correct geometry. A regression in EGL/Wayland where the wrong format was passed is addressed," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora. All GNU/Linux distributions should update to Mesa 17.0.1 The list of changes continues with a patch for an old regression with the r300 driver on BE hardware, Tessellation shader improvements for Stoney and Carrizo AMD GPUs when using the RadeonSI driver, compute shader improvements for the Nouveau driver to make various nvc0 devices work better, and some more fixes for the VC4 and Etnaviv drivers. The Radeon RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan drivers also received various improvements so they should perform better on some systems. These include better handling of Intel graphics cards that lack LLC (Last Level Cache) support, better swizzle clears, as well as CTS fixes for Sandy Bridge. Some of these changes are also present on the Intel i965 OpenGL driver. Other than that, it looks like Mesa 17.0.1 ships with a new script that allows for parsing of bug fixes and possible nominations, and build fixes for the Android platform. We believe that by now all GNU/Linux distributions should use the Mesa 17.0 3D Graphics Library, so updating to Mesa 17.0.1, whose sources are available for download right now from our website, is essential for a better gaming/graphics experience. The full changelog is attached below for more technical details on the fixes.

Buzz60 Intelligence committees add new allegation to their probe James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, says there was no court order to monitor Donald Trump's phones. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) 19059 CONNECTTWEET 12 LINKEDIN 657 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey this weekend sought a public rebuke from the Justice Department of President Trump's claim that former president Barack Obama ordered the surveillance of Trump's phones prior to the election, a U.S. official confirmed Sunday to USA TODAY. FBi Director James Comey  (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) The Justice Department had not responded to the request Sunday after Comey's extraordinary request to discredit claims of a plot to sabotage the president's campaign. The official who confirmed the FBI director's action, first reported by TheNew York Times,  is not authorized to comment publicly. Comey, the official said, wanted Justice to comment, because Trump's claims were not true. The Justice Department and the FBI did not immediately comment on the matter. The revelation of Comey's request capped off a weekend in which Trump made a series of unsubstantiated claims about illegal wiretapping, while Democrats said he was trying to change the subject from the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in last year's election. Through a spokesman Saturday, Obama denied wiretapping Trump, and on Sunday, former director of national intelligence James Clapper said he knew of no effort to seek wiretaps against Trump during his tenure. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, Clapper said “there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, as a candidate or against his campaign.” Pressed on whether he would know whether the FBI had obtained a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order to wiretap the Trump campaign, Clapper said he would have known and that none existed “to my knowledge,” and none was authorized for Trump Tower, the president’s campaign headquarters last year. The statement followed Trump’s claim, in a series of tweets early Saturday, that Obama “had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” and, minutes later, “Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court order. A NEW LOW!” Trump also asked for a congressional investigation of his claims, saying in a statement from White House spokesman Sean Spicer that "reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the 2016 election are very troubling." Trump is "requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016," Spicer said. While Trump repeatedly tweeted about Obama during the weekend, Spicer's statement said "neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted." The Sunday news interview shows focused on the Trump wiretap allegation, the campaign’s alleged contacts with Russian officials and Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ decision last week to recuse himself from any investigation of the 2016 presidential race. The recusal came after news reports established that though Sessions testified under oath during his confirmation hearing that he, being a Trump campaign surrogate, had not met with Russian officials, he had in fact met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Session’s spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said he met with the ambassador in his capacity as a senator. Read more: Sessions recuses himself from Russia probe Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a sometime Trump critic who serves on the Intelligence Committee, said on Meet the Press regarding the wiretap claim that he had “never heard that allegation made before by anybody. … But again, the president put that out there, and now the White House will have to answer to exactly what he was referring to.” Former CIA director and Defense secretary Leon Panetta, on CBS’ Face the Nation, said that Trump is making the same mistake other presidents have during scandals by seeking to “divert attention, trying to obfuscate, trying to cover up,” but that truth will come out. “This issue is not going away,” he said. “There’s too much here.” “Every time he tweets, every time these issues come up that indicate that there’s obviously something to this Russia issue, and the administration is not cooperating when that happens, when he accuses a past president of wiretapping without any evidence of that being the case, it makes us vulnerable…It makes us vulnerable to our enemies,” Panetta said. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican on the Intelligence Committee looking into the Russian influence in last year’s election, said that rather than tweeting accusations, “it would be more helpful if he turned over any evidence he has,” and not comment further. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine  (Photo: T.J. Kirkpatrick, Getty Images) “The president has called for a congressional investigation into the allegations he made starting yesterday morning, so I would expect that he’s going to want to provide our committee with any evidence that he has,” Collins said. “My own theory is that the Russians are determined to sow the seeds of discontent and doubt about the legitimacy of our democracy and other western democracies and that they were going to do that regardless of who was elected president, so it’s really important that we know what happened,” she said. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said he believes the investigation underway will “get the information we need.” He said he expects to hear from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after his contacts with Kislyak during the transition to Trump’s presidency were revealed. Read more: Trump wants congressional probe of evidence-free claims about Obama National security adviser Michael Flynn resigns Georgetown University law professor Paul Rothstein said an attack like Trump’s on a former president is “unprecedented. I am aware of no other one like this.” Rothstein explained that the president himself could not legally order a wiretap but the FBI or the Justice Department could apply for a warrant if they could demonstrate to a judge that there was evidence giving rise to probable cause a crime has been or is being committed or spying is being done by a foreign agent and that a domestic wiretap would reveal it. In the case of a possible foreign agent, the application would be to the FISA court, Rothstein said.

Home India news HP15-BAO21 AX: Priced at Rs 38,690, this is a value for money laptop HP15-BAO21 AX: Priced at Rs 38,690, this is a value for money laptop HP15-BA021AX comes with an AMD processor and seems like a value for money laptop By: Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Published: March 6, 2017 2:17 AM   HP15-BA021AX is one giant laptop, especially given that we are now in 2017. A lot of people still ask me to suggest a good, affordable laptop and I tell them to push their budget to get the cheapest Mac, the MacBook Air. My reasoning for this is simple: ever since Windows 10 has come out, buying an under-spec laptop might not give you a great user experience with the Microsoft operating system. I am speaking more from experience as I had to return my office laptop and move to a workstation instead. Anyway, it is rare to get hold of a laptop to review these days, and so I latched on the opportunity to test an HP laptop that is powered by AMD, and not the ubiquitous Intel. HP15-BA021AX is one giant laptop, especially given that we are now in 2017. This model seems to have been designed by someone, who was under a rock when the world was talking about ultrabooks and ultra-thin laptops. Anyway, this is more a desktop replacement, rather than something you would enjoy lugging around on your back. But most of us will not have a choice as this is what we will be able to afford, or what the IT department of your organisation will choose for you. But let’s look beyond design. My objective with this laptop was to test if the processor is able to take in the rigours of daily (online) life these days. For instance, in my line of work I have scores of tabs open on multiple browsers by the end of the day. This would invariably prompt a medium range Windows laptop to express its displeasure and stall. My IT department came up with a simple solution: open just one tab on Chrome, which is just impossible to follow. So I started with multi-tab browsing and the laptop held up well. Yes, it did slow up a bit as the Firefox browser crossed 12 tabs, still it was not that bad. I am not sure this is better than the experience I have had on similar laptops, but this was certainly not worse off. The other test was with high resolution images. Again with mid range photos, the laptop had no issues. But when I got into the really heavy photos, it takes time to load. Once the initial loading was done there wasn’t any issue doing regular edits and flips of the images. With Full HD video, the laptop performed reasonably well. However, it could not play either 2K or 4K content. I tried different players, but to no avail. You may also like to watch this video Overall, the HP15-BA021AX is powered by the AMD Quad-Core A10-9600P APU and seems like a value for money laptop. But it should also be understood that at this price you are not expecting a device to be able to offer much in terms of high-end performance. If you need a regular laptop that has good processing power and are not very ambitious about what you expect from this device, then this seems like an option you can explore.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | March 5, 2017 -- 17:24 GMT (09:24 PST) | Topic: Mobility Litebook's $249 Linux laptop The market for Linux-equipped laptops continues to expand, whether crowd-funded or DIY or just replacing Windows on an existing notebook on your own. Another entrant has emerged that's more powerful than the Kickstarter-backed Pinebook but less expensive than the KDE Slimbook. what's hot on zdnet Why Raspberry Pi is the future of computing devices Eight obstacles to overcome in your digital transformation journey Ford to trial Stratasys system to use 3D printing of one-piece auto parts IBM, Maersk aim to speed up shipping with blockchain technology A company called Litebook has released a new Linux laptop that is priced to compete with Chromebooks -- if not as cheap as the $89 Pinebook. That's because the Pinebook is bare-boned when it comes to specs, using an ARM CPU, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of built-in storage. The Litebook, on the other hand, uses an Intel Celeron processor (the N3150), twice as much memory, and a 512GB hard drive. (An extra $20 gets you a 32GB SSD in addition to the hard drive to help speed up boot-ups.) It also includes a 14.1-inch display with 1,920x1,080 full HD resolution. It's similarly priced to the assembly-required Teres laptop, though it appears to be much better equipped. The Litebook ships with the Elementary OS flavor of Linux, though you can install an alternate that uses the Linux kernel 4.8. It also comes with WPS Office pre-installed. It comes in a choice of colors (black, red, or white) and provides a $20 discount if you want to order it without a drive installed. Liliputing has done some sleuthing on the Litebook and suggests that it looks like a rebadged older Chinese laptop. This might explain the lack of some of the latest components (no USB Type-C port, no 802.11ac Wi-Fi) as well as the company's confidence that the hardware can handle a Windows installation, if you so choose. Nonetheless, the system offers a 1-year warranty on it and says it does not install any bloatware on the Litebook. Some Linux laptops are priced like mid-tier Windows notebooks, such as the Dell XPS 13 (starting price: $949) or the new Slimbook (starting price: around $770), with specs to match. If you want a Chromebook equivalent, however, the Litebook appears to be a more appealing option.

INNOVATE If You Want To Know How Technology Will Affect Your Work, Look at These 3 Long-Term Trends We now need to hire, manage and train for new skills, such as empathy and social sensitivity By Greg Satell Greg Satell is a popular writer, speaker and innovation advisor. Previously, he served as Senior Vice President – Strategy & Innovation at Moxie Interactive, a division of Publicis Groupe, one of the world’s leading marketing services organizations as well as Co-CEO of KP Media, a leading publisher of magazines and websites in Ukraine, including the news magazine Korrespondent and the web portal, Bigmir. You can find Greg's blog at DigitalTonto.com. His first book, Mapping Innovation, will be published by McGraw-Hill in May. @Digitaltonto Author, Mapping Innovation@Digitaltonto WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Work used to be pretty simple. You got up in the morning, did your job and came home at the end of the day. Most people spent their whole career doing pretty much the same thing for the same employer. They were judged by their skill, diligence and seniority and, at the end of it all, they looked forward to a peaceful retirement. Today, those seem like quaint notions. Nobody spends an entire career doing the same job the same way anymore. In fact, a recent study at Oxford found that as many as almost half of the jobs in the US are at risk of being automated. A report by Deloitte also finds that technology is significantly changing how organizations function. These trends are often attributed solely to artificial intelligence and machine learning, but that misses a large part of the story. The truth is that the real shift has less to do with any particular branch of information technology and much more to do with how three digital forces are beginning to invade everything else. As it turns out, our digital future is all too human. 1. Acceleration In The Second Machine Age, MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee tell a story about the invention of chess. As legend has it, the emperor was so impressed with the game that he invited its creator to name his reward. The inventor's request seemed modest, he simply told the Emperor: 'All I desire is some rice to feed my family.' Since the emperor's largess was spurred by the invention of chess, the inventor suggested they use the chessboard to determine the amount of rice he would be given. 'Place one single grain of rice on the first square of the board, two on the second, four on the third, and so on,' the inventor proposed, 'so that each square receives twice as many grains as the previous.' For the first half of the chessboard, the emperor had to pay 2^32 grains of rice, or about the equivalent of one field, but as the doubling continued, the total amount owed far exceeded all the rice that existed in the world. That, in essence, is the concept of accelerating returns. When growth is exponential, even seemingly insignificant trends can become predominant. This phenomenon is commonly known as Moore's Law, the observation that Intel co-founder Gordon Moore made about the continuous doubling of transistors on a microchip, but it's grown far beyond that. Today, as digital technology pervades everything else, we can see similar trends in everything from solar panels to gene sequencing. 2. Democratization The decades after World War II saw a number of technological revolutions. During the 1950s and 60s, the discovery of the genetic code and nuclear energy, the rise of digital computing and humanity's first forays into space all became realities. These achievements, unimaginable to previous generations, created completely new realms of possibility. It was also an era of increasing scale. Companies mass produced products that were mass marketed toward mass audiences. Corporate strategy focused on wringing ever more efficiency out of the value chain, because lowering your cost basis meant that you could reinvest in assets that would create even more efficiency and unlock a virtuous cycle. Yet those days are over. Competitive advantage in a networked age is no longer the sum of all efficiencies, but the sum of all connections. To take just one example, consider the IBM 360 series of computers which dominated the 60s and 70s. It was vertically integrated and every piece of hardware and software had to come from IBM. Today, however, its Bluemix cloud computing platform is built on top of open source software and offers services from competitors. The reason why is that now even the resources of a massive organization like IBM aren't sufficient to compete anymore. So unless it can tap into the talents of thousands of developers across the world and make its technology accessible enough to allow others to build products on top of it, the company would fall behind its rivals. This trend is constantly reducing the technical knowledge you need to create with technology. Want to build a website? Platforms like Wix will have you up and running in minutes. Want to build a mobile app with artificial intelligence capabilities? Platforms like Mendix are so simple even those with no coding expertise can get in on the action. 3. Convergence The final force shaping technology today is convergence. A computer is no longer something in a room somewhere doing calculations for back office functions like payroll or inventory, or even a smaller machine that sits on a desk to help automate basic office work. Today, computing is more like electricity, an invisible force used to power other machines. Moreover, the ubiquity and abundance of computing is what's enabling the new technologies that are driving the 21st century, such as genomics, nanotechnology and robotics. These, in turn, are driving transformational change in scientific labs, factory floors and marketplaces. IBM's Angel Diaz observes that this convergence has had a profound effect on the computing industry. "To truly change the world today we need more than just clever code. We need computer scientists working with cancer scientists, with climate scientists and with experts in many other fields to tackle grand challenges and make large impacts on the world," he says. But the impact is even larger on other industries. As the bits of computer code pervade the atoms of our workplaces, we're increasingly living in an automated age and the nature of work is becoming less about performing tasks and more about using technology to collaborate with other people. Moving From Disruption To Collaboration Let's return to where we began. Work used to be fairly stable because technology was fairly stable. Products changed with the times, but mostly because of changing tastes and styles. Functionality evolved slowly, which allowed business to maintain their business models for decades and, in some cases, even longer. Yet today, business models no longer last. The twin forces of acceleration and democratization made it possible for a couple of guys in a garage somewhere to compete with the world's most powerful corporations. All of a sudden, the American dream morphed from getting a corner office in an executive suite to building a startup and achieving a billion dollar valuation. The future, however, belongs to the third trend, convergence. As digital technology seeps into every product, service and endeavor, no one organization has all the skills and knowledge it needs to compete and collaboration itself is becoming a competitive advantage. That, in turn, is changing the nature of work. To win in this new marketplace, you no longer need the best people, you need the best teams. Value is shifting from those who can perform tasks efficiently to those who can work well with others to design jobs for machines, which means that we now need to hire, manage and train for new skills, such as empathy and social sensitivity. As automation produces ever greater abundance, humanity itself is becoming the scarce, and therefore most valuable, resource.

"One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is the U.S. government's response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign," said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes in a statement Sunday. "As such, the committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party's campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it." Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an intelligence panel member, told Fox News host Chris Wallace the Senate would investigate too. "As part of our inquiry, we are going to review allegations of any kind of improper contacts between Russian officials and campaign officials or other American citizens, and I'm sure that we will be reviewing any allegations such as this," "I think all these matters will be part of our inquiry.

Cotton said he has "seen no evidence" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year's election, despite intelligence reports alleging that activity. Cotton defended Trump's treatment of Russia, calling it harsher than his predecessor's based on foreign policies that have already implemented. Following Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusing himself from campaign- or election-related probes, Cotton still stood by a previous statement that his former colleague should have to step aside to allow someone else to oversee the investigation. Cotton added that he does not believe any additional investigation into Russia-Trump campaign contacts would be worthwhile because the Senate intelligence committee is looking into the matter. "We've made the decisions — or we've made the agreements with the intelligence community to review the documents," he said. "If you started over with a new commission or new committee, that could take months. I think it's in the best interest of the American people if we conduct our view as quickly as possible and make as much of our conclusions as public as possible."

As part of our inquiry, we are going to review allegations of any kind of improper contacts between Russian officials and campaign officials or other American citizens, and I'm sure that we will be reviewing any allegations such as this, I think all these matters will be part of our inquiry.

Linux 4.11 Doesn't Change The Game For AMD's Ryzen Written by Michael Larabel in AMD on 5 March 2017 at 07:56 AM EST. 23 Comments Linux 4.11 is worthwhile in that it's bringing ALC1220 audio support, the codec used by many Ryzen (and Intel Kabylake) motherboards, but this next kernel version doesn't appear to change Ryzen's performance. I didn't see anything notable this Linux 4.11 merge window with regard to Ryzen for potentially affecting its performance, but I ran some benchmarks this weekend just to confirm. With the Ryzen 7 1700 configuration on the MSI X370 XPOWER GAMING TITANIUM configuration I ran some benchmarks between Linux 4.10 and then Linux 4.11 Git as of yesterday. There are potential gaming performance improvements to find on Linux 4.11, that's when using the AMDGPU DRM driver and in particular AMDGPU changes in 4.11 appear to mostly benefit the RADV Vulkan driver. In most OpenGL games, the performance is the same. Nothing really to see on the Ryzen performance side for Linux 4.11. Those that were hoping for any magical scheduler improvements or other refinements to Ryzen's Linux support will need to wait another couple months. 23 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on March 05, 2017 at 6:45 AM, updated March 06, 2017 at 10:47 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from being truthful while under oath.   President Donald Trump has recused himself from being a stable, sound-minded, responsible president and quelling suspicions about an improper relationship  between his campaign and Russia.   As a result, Sessions should recuse himself from being Attorney General and a 9/11-type independent commission needs to be appointed a.s.a.p. to fully investigate the Russian-Trump connection. Just three days after a Congressional address in which Trump pivoted to acting and sounding like a president, he pivoted back to being a reckless tweeting nit-wit. Early Saturday morning, Trump unleashed a twitter torrent, accusing Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the election, calling him "a bad (or sick)guy."  These are the tweets Trump unleashed from sunny Mar-a-Lago, Florida: "Terrible! just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.  Nothing found.  This is McCarthyism!" "Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an  election?  Turned down by court earlier.  A NEW LOW!" "I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!" How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.  This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Obama's spokesman released the following statement Saturday afternoon refuting Trump's claims:   "A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice.  As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.  Any suggestion otherwise is simply false." Trump offered no proof for his serious allegations against the former president. The key words in Trump's tweet storm are -"just found out."    Where did Trump find out about the alleged wiretaps?    It's speculated the source of Trump's allegations are  comments made Thursday by conservative talk radio host  Mark Levin and a story on Breitbart, Friday.  Trump's tweets echo an argument made by Levin and Breitbart that Obama used "police state" tactics in an attempt to sabotage the Trump campaign.   The Breitbart story was said to be circulating in the White House, where it's former CEO, Steve Bannon appears to be the de facto president. The Department of Justice and U.S. Intel agencies have been reported to be conducting an ongoing investigation into connections between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and Russian operatives.   Three Trump associates that have been named are his former campaign boss Paul Manafort, and former advisers Roger Stone and Carter Page.  It's believed the agencies conducting the investigation have obtained a FISA warrant. Trump tweets mean one of three scenarios could be true, all are bad. 1) President Obama broke the law and ordered wiretaps on Trump. 2) Investigators obtained a FISA warrant to wiretap Trump after showing significant evidence that illegal activity likely occurred. 3) Trump smeared a former president based on nothing more than claims made by dubious far-right media sources. Trump may not fully grasp the seriousness of what he just tweeted.  He may have intended to only vent, or distract, but he may have actually just declassified and confirmed that he and is associates have had  FISA warrants issued against them. Trump furious over Sessions' recusal. The Washington Post reported that Trump left for Florida Friday after fuming at a senior staff  about Sessions' decision to recuse himself. "Trump was angry and told his top aides that he disagreed with the attorney general's decision."   Trump felt his staff  should have done more in Sessions' defense. So, Trump isn't upset that the nation's top lawman gave misleading answers, or perjured himself, under oath, he's ticked off with his staff? Sessions is claiming he didn't think his meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were relevant to Sen. Al Franken's question.  He also claimed he met with Sergey as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In the confirmation hearing, Franken brought up that Trump had been warned by the FBI and intel agencies about the dossier alleging he had been compromised.  Franken cited the news reports of the Trump campaign being in constant contact with Russian operatives.   Franken asked Sessions what he would do if those reports were true. Sessions replied, "I'm not aware of any of those activities,  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians." The question was what would Sessions do? Instead he gave a defensive answer that someone who's guilty would give. Sessions met Kislyak in July, at the Republican convention, and again in September.   At the time of the meetings, U.S. Intel agencies had determined Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC and Clinton campaign.   The Trump campaign was already being viewed suspiciously over Trump's fawning praise of Putin.  Sessions was far more than just a surrogate. At the time he was Trump's top national security and foreign policy adviser, working with  Michael Flynn. The Washington Post checked to see if any other members of the Armed Services committee met with Kislyak.  Twenty of the twenty-six members responded.  None met with Kislyak that year, including Chairman John McCain.  A Committee staffer told the post, "Members of the committee have not been beating a path to Kislyak's door.   There haven't been a ton of members who are looking to meet with Kislyak for their committee duties." Sessions also wrote that he never met with Russians in a confirmation hearing questionnaire from Senator Patrick Leahy.  Sessions doesn't pass the smell test as the nation's leading lawman.  What's being smelled and seen is ever-increasing smoke billowing from the Trump administration when the topic turns to Russia.   Congress needs to appoint an independent commission to find the truth once and for all, and if necessary, a special counsel. If Trump tweets were intended as a diversion, or fed by anger over the Russian story not going away, all he did is turn up the heat on it.

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In IBM Q Launches Next Stage Of Quantum Computing Revolution (IBM) By Rakesh Sharma | March 6, 2017 — 1:31 PM EST Share Get set for the next stage of computing. Research giant IBM Corp. (IBM) announced today that it was enabling access to its quantum bit computers from regular computers. “The IBM Quantum Experience enables anyone to connect to IBM’s quantum processor via the IBM Cloud, to run algorithms and experiments, work with the individual quantum bits, and explore tutorials and simulations around what might be possible with quantum computing,” the company announced in a press release. (See also: Quantum Is Coming). IBM had opened up its 5-qubit (quantum bits) computer as a cloud computing service to select partners last year. The release of today’s API (Application Programming Interface or the program used to access an application or technology) to a wider audience will enable developers to access the processor and perform complex calculations and tasks. In an interview with tech publication TechCrunch, Jerry Chow, manager of the experimental quantum computing group at IBM, said the company wanted to “figure out what quantum computing looks like in the future when we have a larger number of qubits.” IBM also announced the launch of IBM Q, an industry-wide initiative to build commercially-available universal quantum computer systems, today. This represents a first step to make powerful quantum computers, that will be able to crunch massive amounts of data and perform a wide variety of tasks in short times, available to lay people. (See also: Intel Bets Big On Quantum Computing). For the uninitiated, quantum computing is an evolution of computing, which uses 1s and 0s to store and process data. Quantum computing uses intermediate states between the two bits, also known as superposition, to enable complex and faster processing and larger storage. It will become a necessity in the future as the trove of data gathered through online transactions increases exponentially. With Moore’s law coming to an end, quantum computers are an elegant solution to the data deluge problem facing humanity in the future. In its press release today, IBM has pointed out a couple of use cases relating to quantum computing. For example, the company has zeroed in on chemistry as one of the first areas of application for the technology. Commercial IBM Q systems with more than 50 qubits processing capacity will enable IBM to “collaborate with key industry partners to develop applications that exploit the quantum speedup of such systems.” Drug development and discovery is one of the areas that could benefit from this approach. But, quantum computing is "still very far away," according to Scott Crowder from IBM's Systems Group. In the meanwhile, the Armonk-based company still has to contend with 19 straight quarters of reporting losses on its balance sheet due to changes in its business.

Images from Conservative Review. Mark Levin hits back on CNN, media 'dishonesty' By Paul Bedard (@SecretsBedard) • 3/6/17 2:44 PM Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/headshot-PBedardHR.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Popular conservative and constitutional talker Mark Levin is ripping CNN and the mainstream media for slamming his comments based on their reporting of possible wiretapping of Team Trump by the Obama administration. In an open letter to CNN's Brian Stelter published on his Conservative Review website, and directed at the larger media too, Levin wrote: I simply put together the stories that YOUR profession reported, on the public record. Do you deny there were two FISA applications? Do you deny the first was turned down? Do you deny the second was approved? It's called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It is about surveillance. The fact that we cannot discern all the details because of the secrecy, except for what the media have revealed and selective leaks by the government, should cause you to want to know more, not to trash those who point it out. Levin emailed me, "Do you deny there were two FISA applications?" I replied: "I don't know. You don't know. The reporting is very murky." https://t.co/uSyUgooRl0— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) March 6, 2017 Stay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

He added: Your lack of curiosity and dishonesty about such matters and in dealing with me demean you and your profession. Reporters trying to determine the reason President Trump on Saturday sent out a storm of tweets accusing Obama of bugging Trump tower have looked to comments Levin made, which he said are legitimate questions raised by the media. Levin said that there are some "logical implications" that can be made from the reporting on the issue, which includes pre-election reports in papers like the New York Times. He wrote: Also from the Washington Examiner The return of Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul is back in a familiar place: at the center of attention. By W. James Antle III • 03/07/17 12:01 AM And yes, we can make several logical implications based on events and experience. A FISA application is a big deal. One, or two in this case, that involve campaign surrogates, or a server or computer related to a candidate or campaign, etc., is a big deal. President Obama's statement is not a definitive statement of anything, other than he, personally, did not order a wiretap, which I never claimed. But that does not mean he was unaware of surveillance activity by several of his departments, even through routine reports to the president, such as the Daily Intel Briefing or information conveyed to him or his staff via the Justice Department re the FBI counter-intelligence activities. As for Clapper, despite his past dissembling before Congress, he may not have been aware of what was taking place since the FBI counter-intel operation reportedly sought the warrant. The Daily Intel Briefing might provide useful information in that regard as well. On Monday, Stelter dismissed the affair as a conspiracy. His story opened this way: An incendiary idea first put forward by right-wing radio host Mark Levin is now burning across Washington, fanned by President Trump's tweets and a huge number of supportive commentators and websites — even though the facts don't back up the conclusion.

Self-driving car technology is chugging along. Find out where we are today, and when we might actually be able to buy an autonomous car. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 6, 2017 at 2:17PM Autonomous cars have been the buzz of the energy and tech sectors for years now, but how close are we as consumers to actually having fully autonomous cars in our driveways? In this week's episode of Industry Focus: Industrials, analyst Sean O'Reilly talks with Motley Fool senior auto specialist John Rosevear about the state of autonomous driving tech today, and when consumers will start to see the fruits of the industry's labors. Tune in to find out what the different levels of automation are and why they matter; where companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Ford (NYSE:F), and Fiat Chrysler fit into the story; where Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) alleged car project seem to be heading; and more. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on March 2, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is Thursday, March 2, 2017, so we're talking about energy, materials, and industrials. I am your host, Sean O'Reilly, and joining me today via phone is Motley Fool senior auto specialist, Mr. John Rosevear. Good morning, John! John Rosevear: Good morning, Sean! How are you, today? O'Reilly: Extremely well. It's good to hear your voice. It's been awhile, a month or two, since we last had a podcast, and I missed you, buddy. Rosevear: Yeah, it's been a few weeks. O'Reilly: I had to get you in here to answer an all-important question. Rosevear: What's the question? O'Reilly: You're the only guy I know who can answer this for me. I hate driving, I live in D.C., it's very tiring, I want to know when I'm going to get my self-driving car. Rosevear: Well, it depends on what you mean by get, and really depends on what you mean by self-driving, [laughs] unfortunately. O'Reilly: I'm not touching the wheel in my driveway. Rosevear: Let's back up and define some terms here. This system of classification for things that assist drivers has become pretty universal. It was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers in the U.S. The U.S. government has adopted it, other governments have adopted it, it's the way all automakers talk now. They categorize it in six levels that are helpfully numbered from zero to five. A level zero system, there's no automation, the driver does everything. This might even include warning systems like lane departure warning. But, the driver actually has to do everything. Level one is when you get some basic level of driver assistance, assistance that parallel parks for you, that kind of stuff. That's a level one system. O'Reilly: Does that include anti-lock brakes? I'm surprised that's on here. Rosevear: That's... O'Reilly: Eye of the beholder? Rosevear: The driver is still executing that. They count that as an intervention system. It's when the car decides to break for you that it starts to become assisted. These emergency stopping systems that they have now where the radar is on the front of the car, the levels one through five require some level of sensing what's going on around a car. So, yeah, these parallel park systems where the car spins the wheel for you and backs into the spot, that kind of thing, that's a level one. Level two is where it starts to get interesting. This is the system where you're on the highway and the traffic jam assist systems, maybe the earliest versions of Tesla's autopilot, where you can kind of take your hand off the wheel under certain circumstances, and the car will maintain and adjust its speed relative to the cars around to you, and it will keep itself in its lane. It's doing a little steering and a little accelerating and decelerating on its own. But there still has to be a human driver, the human driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. In fact, a lot of these systems require you to actually touch the wheel every minute or two, or something like that. Level three is when it kind of gets into self driving. This is a system that can drive under certain conditions, we might say highway driving, this is where Tesla's autopilot is starting to go, this is where some of the systems, GM's (NYSE:GM) Super Cruise that will come out on Cadillac soon, this is where it ends up, level three. O'Reilly: Super Cruise? [laughs]  Rosevear: That's what they call it. That's what they've been calling it for a few years, I'm not completely sure that's what they're going to call it when it comes to market. Anyway, the gist here is, it's self-driving until suddenly it isn't, the driver has to be ready to grab the wheel. That makes it a little tricky. We'll talk about that in a minute.  O'Reilly: The Motley Fool's Dan Sparks did that article about a year ago, he lives out in Colorado and he has a Tesla, how far did he get, 90 miles? I can't remember, but, I don't think he touched the wheel on the freeway with that thing. Rosevear: Tesla's official instructions with the original system where you're supposed to touch the wheel regularly, they considered it an advanced level two system. I think now they're into level three territory. The border here is a little bit fuzzy. The border to level four is not fuzzy. Level four is, the car is driving itself, period. It does not need you, but it's limited. Usually what it means is it's limited to an area that's been mapped, we say it's been geofenced. These systems tend to depend on very highly detailed 3D maps that show stuff that normal maps don't show, like exactly where the curb is within a couple inches and so forth, so the car can navigate precisely, especially on a city street. So, it's full self-driving, you don't ever have to touch a steering wheel, but it only works where the car has a map. Level five -- and we'll get back to this in a minute -- is the full-blown thing. It'll drive itself wherever you want under any conditions. If it's snowing, it'll go up a mountain, whatever, anything.  So, what we're talking about in the near future is level four, a car that will self-drive itself. This is coming soon. But it's limited by its maps. The idea is, gradually the maps will expand over time and you'll be able to drive -- O'Reilly: Are there cities that are being mapped right now? I'm actually surprised to hear this. Rosevear: Yeah, Pittsburgh is being mapped. This is where Uber is doing their testing, a lot of it. This is actually where Ford's new company they created as a start-up with a veteran of Uber and a veteran of Google's self-driving car project running it. This is basically Ford's software team for self-driving, and they're in Pittsburgh. There's been a lot of mapping done, interestingly, in Pittsburgh, because the artificial intelligence lab at Carnegie Mellon is the source of a lot of the research that went into this, so, a lot of the people are there. There's some mapping going on in San Francisco. I know GM's cruise automation subsidiary is doing testing of level four assistance in San Francisco, so they have mapping going on. Then, there are companies mapping all over the place. Tesla, I think, is automating some of this mapping with the sensors on their existing cars. A company called Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) is going to start doing mapping with sensors on their customers' cars, these are sensors for level two systems but they can help do the mapping for level four. This is going to start very soon, probably next year for Mobileye. There are private companies trying to do this, too, hoping to be able to sell the maps to the automakers or whoever. And, of course, the big wild card in this is, of course, Waymo. Google's been mapping for years and years. [laughs]  O'Reilly: You've seen the cars? They look ridiculous, they have the pole and they have the ball of cameras on the top, and they just drive around all these cities. That's how I can see what my dentist's office looks like from across the street. They're mapping cities with that, too? Rosevear: Yeah. I think everybody is. And it's not just mapping for Google Maps, it's mapping at a much more fine level of detail, where is the curb, where is the speed bump, and so forth, so the car knows what to expect as it's driving. The idea is, a map is a fallback from its sensors. If it's dark out, if it's foggy, if the lighter system is being buggy for whatever reason, you can kind of fall back on the maps. Because these are safety systems, there has to be redundancy built in. That's the thinking. O'Reilly: So, when is this stuff coming out? Rosevear: Good question. Tesla constantly does these upgrades, and they'll break into level four at some point. If I had to guess, I'd say 2019. But I don't know for sure. They may not even know absolutely for sure when they'll be ready to ship it. There's also an interesting question there that with their owners of their current models, they've been shipping stuff that maybe has some bugs still in it for the owners to bang on. And because Tesla owners tend to be early adopter types, they're mostly cool with that. As Tesla moves into the mass market with its upcoming Model 3, something else we've talked about, I don't know if they're going to tighten it up a little bit. They might. We'll see. But that might push that data off. But, anyway, this partnership of giant auto supplier Delphi, Mobileye, which is a machine vision specialist that has done a lot of work around-- O'Reilly: And but they are publicly traded, right? For our listeners. Rosevear: They are. The ticker there is MBLY. Look them up, because if you want a pure-play on self-driving, that's as close as it gets. The third company in this is Intel, which is designing the processors. They're working together on a level four system. We've talked about this before. They will have this available to any automaker who wants it by the end of 2019, they say. Now, the cars are going to ship in 2019. These things are incorporated as the cars are developed. So, probably late 2020, early 2021, people will be shipping cars with this system in, but those cars may not go to retail. [laughs]  O'Reilly: What?! Will they hang out and not do anything? [laughs]  Rosevear: Here's what, for instance, Ford is saying. Ford says, "We're going to mass produce a level four vehicle starting in 2021." Great. Then, they say, "Yeah, but we're not going to sell it at retail. This is going to be for car sharing use in cities and ride hailing services, Lyft and Uber and so on." It's because of the maps. They only want to sell it where they have the maps. CEO Mark Fields at Ford has said, "We're not even going to give it a steering wheel in this," so obviously it has to have the maps. Again, as the maps expand, there'll be more. Ford is saying right now that they think they'll have level four functionality in their retail vehicles 2025-ish. But they always say that, Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, always says, "We throw out these dates, but it's always earlier than I expect." So, we'll see. Right now they're saying 2025. So, yeah, he says, "This stuff moves much faster than we expect." There's also some other stuff going on. The thing to emphasize here, I should back up a little bit, not all the automakers, not all the tech companies talk about what they're doing. There will be surprises here. This is just, what has been announced, what we have seen, what we generally know is coming. O'Reilly: Yeah, once you go public with something you get held to it in some capacity, and nobody wants to get egg on their face. Rosevear: Right. And GM originally said they'd launch Super Cruise in 2016 -- O'Reilly: They need to get a different name for that. [laughs]  Rosevear: Yeah, OK. They're a level three system. They came out a while back and said, "Wait a minute, we're not happy with it, we're going to do more work and make it more advanced. We're not going to set a firm date, but we think late 2017-18, probably around there." But again, they are not holding themselves to a firm date on that. In fact, they're not holding themselves to a firm date on a lot of this stuff. Mary Barra's thing is, "We'll ship it when it's ready." But what we do know is that GM is planning to actually start building a whole lot of level four vehicles, reportedly in the thousands. These will be the electric Chevy Volts. They will be fitted with prototype level four systems, and they will go into this massive test with Lyft in several different cities. So, when will you get your level four car?  O'Reilly: Which is why they invest in Lyft. Rosevear: Right. They own 9% of Lyft, it's something like that. It's a major investment, certainly, for GM. But, when do you get yourself a driving car? If you're in D.C., you might get one in several months from now or a year from now, when you summon Lyft with your smartphone and a Chevy Volt comes. Uber is already doing this on a tiny scale in Pittsburgh. They have 8 or 12 cars or something that are prototype self-driving vehicles in their fleet. With these things, there are two engineers on board. One is ready to grab the wheel and the other one is taking notes on everything that's happening with the system. And it may be the same deal with these GM Lyft self-driving vehicles. So it might not seem all that exciting because there's somebody in the front seat, but the car is driving itself, is the idea. This is a way to rack up a whole lot of test miles quickly, if you have a whole bunch of these things out there, you know? O'Reilly: Yeah. I can't wait to see all these Lyft driverless cars handle all the roundabouts in D.C., that'll be a treat.  Rosevear: Yeah, they'll teach them. We call them rotaries up here in New England, we have lots of them too. It'll be interesting to see how they handle Boston, which is colonial era streets in some areas of town. [laughs]  O'Reilly: Yeah, they're made for horses, not driverless cars. Rosevear: Yeah. Well, they were made to walk in, or cow paths, definitely not driverless cars. But, there's other stuff in here, too. The wild card is Waymo, which is the Alphabet subsidiary that used to be the Google Self-Driving Car Project and has now been set up as a company to go into business and commercialize this in some way. Who will partner with them? They had this little deal with Fiat Chrysler where Chrysler built them some Chrysler Pacifica minivans as test vehicles that took on their latest prototype system. They've been talking to Honda, reportedly. But of course, there's a certain view in the auto industry that a deal with Waymo is a deal with the devil because Google will want all the data. And then you're an Android phone maker, and Google's making all the money. That is a great fear. I think every auto CEO in the world is mindful of the example of the phone industry. [laughs] They don't want to give up the data. I think that is actually a lot of the selling proposition of the Delphi-Mobileye system, this is a system developed within the established auto industry supplier structure. We'll share the maps among our fellow automakers and so forth, but we're not selling the data to Google. [laughs]  O'Reilly: What do you think has been going on there? Correct me if I'm wrong, but Google has those tiny little white go-kart looking driverless cars for years. The laymen, we haven't gotten a hint of them trying to make a buck off of them at all. It's weird. Rosevear: They hired, a while back, and executive named John Krafcik. He had been the president of TrueCar, and before that, he had been in the business for years. He was with several automakers, in management capacities, executive capacities. He's a guy who knows the business, a good guy, smart guy. His job is to lead Waymo and find a way to bring this stuff to market somehow. He's been out there talking to automakers. He actually did a really big presentation at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January -- I was going to say last month, but it's March now. He was talking about where their system is and so forth. They have a solid prototype level four system. I think he was there, in part, fishing for automakers who might want to have conversation. It's possible those conversations have happened and nobody is talking about them. The ones that have made it into the media are Honda and, of course, Fiat Chrysler, which is a much more overt thing, because the latest test vehicles are all Chryslers. O'Reilly: We don't have this as a note, so feel free to tell me you don't know a ton about this, but I'm sure all of our listeners are on the tip of their tongues with this, they want to hear, what is Apple up to? They have that big plan, and I've got a push notification from The Wall Street Journal a year ago that Apple was going to build a car within the decade, blah blah, then they pulled back on it, they're doing testing again. What is Tim Cook scheming right now? Rosevear: Good question. Yeah, I remember when that Wall Street Journal thing came out. O'Reilly: You got the notification too, I'm sure. Rosevear: I did, and I actually poked a few sources and ended up writing a big piece for The Motley Fool first thing on Saturday morning after that broke, sort of, what does this mean, can they actually do it, that kind of thing. And the answer was, Apple has so much money that, of course, they could start a car company, the question is, do they want to? O'Reilly: Yeah, I remember you talking about that. Rosevear: Right. They can throw money at it. The full boat, it's about $10 billion to get to where Tesla is where they have a factory and they're banging out cars and it's really high level of quality and so forth. Full boat. That's Tim Cook's lunch money these days. [laughs] Their cash load is unbelievable. They can do anything. The question is, would they want to? The margins in the car business, by Apple's standards, are pretty lousy. A luxury car business might make an operating margin of 10-12%. If you're Porsche, you might make 16%. That's kind of the upper limit. O'Reilly: So, is it possible that Google and Apple wind up dropping the brains in these cars and calling it a day? Google already, they must have tons of data on these cars operating. Rosevear: Google has made it clear, John Krafcik came out and said, "We're not building cars, we're not going to build a car factory, we are not building cars. We're looking for partnerships, we are not building cars." Apple hasn't said anything, of course. Officially, this program doesn't even exist. But the word was, a lot of the people who might have been on the actual build-a-car side of the business have been let go. People working on electric self-driving cars are in very hot demand these days. So, none of these people are wanting for employment. But it was thought that a lot of those folks were let go, and they really ratcheted down the ambitions of the program. They may be aiming to do something where they come out, like Waymo, and offer a system that Apple-izes a self driving car built by somebody else. It's possible that they will find an automaker to partner with, and maybe offer that as a deluxe ride hailing option. My thought when they were originally talking about this was that they were going to build the deluxe Apple version of robot Uber, where it's a little bit more money but it's a nicer car, and it recognizes all your Apple devices and it's this seamless experience, it sees your iPhone and it automatically sets your seat and your climate and your music and everything else and all this stuff, it takes exactly where you want to go, and it's just a subscription model, $500 a month for the Apple Car service. That's where I thought they were going to go. Others disagreed. Some of my fellow Fools who are also very close watchers of this kind of technology and particularly close watchers of Apple thought they might actually build a car for retail Tesla-style. O'Reilly: Cool. We're about out of time, John. I want to give you the last word. When am I magically going to get my driverless car in my driveway? Rosevear: If you want a Tesla, you might get it by the end of the decade. If you want a car from one of the bigger automakers, it's probably a few years beyond that. Somebody may surprise us and have a level four car out by 2020 or 2021 that has a fairly big map. But I'm thinking it might be over the next couple years after that that these start to be available for retail. I suspect the first ones that come out, it will be an expensive option on a luxury car. O'Reilly: Awesome. John, I cannot thank you enough, once again, for your time. Rosevear: It's always a pleasure. O'Reilly: I have to imagine that as this continues to ramp up, this will not be our last show about this topic.  Rosevear: Oh, heavens no. We'll be talking about this for several years to come. It's a big deal. O'Reilly: Awesome. Well, have a good day, John! Thank you, again! Rosevear: All right. Take care, Sean! O'Reilly: Bye. That's it for us, folks.

The 1700 will cost about the same as the 7700k. Maybe you could look into the 6c/12t i7 6800k too. That will cost about the same as the 1700x and is a more matured platform. If you can hold out, the Ryzen 5 1600 chips could be pretty good overall. Assuming they will clock higher because they'll only be 6c/12t, they should also run cooler. They might end up being the perfect cpu for a lot of peeople. It's up to you if you want to wait. I'm waiting atm myself, few reasons. All of the motherboards I was considering with Ryzen are pre-order atm, then there's issues with the cpu too. Some say a windows update will improve things, then there is the fact that the platform is super new and it's probably best to wait for motherboard manufacturers to update their bios and drivers.     eclap View Public Profile Find all posts by eclap   (#4) pedromr2 Newbie   Videocard: R9 Fury Nitro OC+ Processor: Intel i5-3570K@4.4Ghz Mainboard: GA-Z77X-UD3H Memory: 16GB DDR3 Soundcard: Sound Blaster Z PSU: Corsair TX-650 Yesterday, 15:37 | posts: 38 | Location: Portugal Quote: Originally Posted by Kohlendioxidus You ask this question in an AMD forum, what answer do you expect??...GO with Ryzen !!

I am going to wait a little bit longer then to see if ryzen matures with upcoming updates     pedromr2 View Public Profile Find all posts by pedromr2   (#6) Kohlendioxidus Maha Guru     Videocard: Sapphire 290X Vapor-X Processor: AMD RYZEN 1800X Mainboard: MSI B350 Tomahawk Memory: 16 Gig Corsair Vengeance Soundcard: Creative XFi Fatality Pro Gamer PSU: Corsair TX 750W Yesterday, 15:41 | posts: 1,346 | Location: Germany Quote: Originally Posted by pedromr2 I am going to wait a little bit longer then to see if ryzen matures with upcoming updates till then check this thread for updates and head-up's where we all share own Ryzen experience the best we can .

Ogg March 6, 2017 11:00 am EST Print Email Tweet Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sometimes contain information that shareholders need to know about. A filing with the SEC on Friday showed that Mubadala Development Company PJSC registered to sell some 45 million shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). The form 144 filing showed that these shares, which were held through West Coast Hitech, date back to 2007. What matters here is that this stake sale was from the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, and Reuters had noted that the Abu Dhabi investment fund will retain 97 million shares. Subsequent SEC filings show that stake to be just over 96.9 million shares. The date of the sale was listed as March 3, 2017, via Goldman Sachs, and the price per share was listed as block sale at $13.63 in a subsequent 13D filing. While AMD share price has been an exponential gainer over the past 12 months or so, this was listed as a stake sale worth more than $613 million. Even for a $12 billion market cap, that is a substantial stake. Mubadala is an investment and development company that was designed to support the growth of the economy of the United Arab Emirates. The company deploys capital in multiple sectors, and its interactive portfolio shows a 100% ownership in GlobalFoundries. Form 144 filings with the SEC regard the intent of holders of restricted stock to sell those shares, or a fraction of those shares, within 90 days. A lockup agreement was outlined in Monday’s 13D filing: Seller agrees that it will not, for a period of sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of, contract to dispose of, or enter into any transaction having the economic consequences of a disposition, of (i) Common Stock of the Company or (ii) any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for such Common Stock, or publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction; provided that the foregoing shall not apply (1) to any shares of Common Stock offered, sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a written plan for trading securities in effect on the date hereof, which was established pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act, (2) to any shares of Common Stock offered, sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a registered underwritten offering, or (3) to any shares of Common Stock offered, sold or otherwise disposed of in connection with purchase by a third party of not less than ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company; provided further that the undersigned may make gifts or transfers of shares of Common Stock to, or for the benefit of, family members, charitable institutions, and trusts, limited partnerships or other entities created for estate planning purposes, the principal beneficiaries of which are family members or charitable institutions, subject to the condition that any such family member or charitable institution or other holder shall execute an agreement stating that such transferee is receiving and holding the Common Stock subject to the provisions of this agreement. The foregoing restriction in the preceding paragraph is expressly agreed to preclude the undersigned from engaging in any hedging or other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of any Common Stock referred to in the preceding paragraph even if such Common Stock would be disposed of by someone other than the undersigned.  Such prohibited hedging or other transactions would include without limitation any short sale or any purchase, sale or grant of any right (including without limitation any put or call option) with respect to any Common Stock referred to in the preceding paragraph or with respect to any security that includes, relates to, or derives any significant part of its value from such Common Stock. Some investors are likely to wonder about the timing of this major stake sale. AMD has just released its Ryzen 7 processors, which is an 8-core processor designed for gaming, video editing or other high-demand applications. Product reviews since the formal launch date have been mixed, although the price is roughly half of the closest Intel processor. 24/7 Wall St. took the top the Google search results for the search term “Ryzen review” and these are seen below: Ars Technica’s review: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X still behind Intel, but it’s great for the price; an excellent workstation CPU, but it doesn’t game as hard as we hoped. PCWorld’s Ryzen review: AMD is back … AMD’s vaunted Ryzen CPU is a multithreaded monster with one glaring weakness. PCGamer’s review: The AMD Ryzen 7: plenty of power, but underwhelming gaming performance. … Great for video editors, not so great for gamers. One issue that has been hard to ignore in recent equity trading was that AMD shares were above $15 last week. The mixed reviews of the new Ryzen 7 processors have been blamed for the drop to under $13. The trend that goes back for centuries in investing is buy the rumor (catalyst or hype) and sell the news. While a stake sale of one-third after such a massive recovery might not scare the AMD bulls at this time, maybe even sovereign wealth funds get tempted to lock in certain capital after massive recoveries. AMD shares were last seen trading at $12.77 on Monday morning, in a 52-week range of $2.15 to $15.55. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Could Gain 15% on New Chips Recent Posts: Why Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock Could Jump 20% Higher Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is About to Rebound Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Isn’t Infallible After All View All Posts What is Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock really worth? That’s the main question on investors’ minds amid a rapid decline in NVDA stock that itself followed a rapid one-year run of 350%. Source: Shutterstock My answer? New investors who have waited patiently for a good entry point are finally being rewarded. Nvidia stock has bottomed. NVDA shares once traded at 41 times projected 2018 earnings in the midst of the company’s momentum-fueled run. But Nvidia has dropped 18% over the past month or so, dropping that valuation to 29. Yes, that’s still about 10 points above the S&P 500’s average forward P/E, but it still makes more sense given that analysts expect roughly 20% earnings growth next year. As such, I continue to expect NVDA stock to reach $130 to $135 in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 32% to 37% returns in 2017. The reason for the stock’s decline of late? Aside from fresh money now going into Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Nvidia stock has been the subject to multiple downgrades. This is even though the semiconductor company not only crushed Wall Street’s fourth-quarter estimates on almost every metric, Nvidia also raised full-year guidance. The first downgrade came from BMO Capital, which not only downgraded NVDA stock to “Underperform” from “Market Perform,” the analyst also slashed Nvidia’s price target to $85 from $100. Based on Friday’s closing price, the downgrade assumes additional declines of almost 15%. BMO insists Nvidia is overvalued and says the strong earnings growth  the company has enjoyed has begun to slow. Moreover, the firm added that competition will begin to impact Nvidia. Notably, AMD — which has been on tear over the past three months, soaring some 53% — is likely the subject of the change in competitive landscape to which BMO refers. Likewise, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is now seen as a subtle threat, despite the fact that Nvidia’s Datacenter revenue surged a whopping 205% year-over-year, eating Intel’s lunch. Based on the company’s first-quarter revenue guidance of $1.90 billion — higher than consensus estimates of $1.87 billion — Nvidia is showing no signs of slowing down. Bottom Line for NVDA Stock After a dominant 2016, some analysts are now gun-shy about NVDA stock can do going forward, suggesting Nvidia has become a victim of its own success. Nevertheless, despite the recent declines, long-term investors should remember why they’ve bet on Nvidia stock. And given that the company’s fundamentals have not changed, despite the recent downgrades, now’s the time to add to your positions. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Virtual reality took a few steps forward last week, advances highlighted by Qualcomm‘s demo of a development headset for wireless virtual reality. The prototype is part of a reference design for a second generation of VR headsets that don’t have to be connected to a PC. Hardware companies can adopt this technology, and Qualcomm has started an accelerator to enable those companies to move faster. At least five headset makers plan to launch VR headsets in 2017 that are based on Qualcomm’s newest chip, the Snapdragon 835. Osterhout Design Group has also said it will create two augmented reality smartglasses models with the 835. I tried the headset out at GDC 2017 and was taken aback at first that I could pretty much walk anywhere in the hallway where I was testing it. The device was untethered, with all of the processing taking place in the headset itself. This one had last year’s chip, the Snapdragon 820 processor, but the production versions will use the newer 835. Qualcomm vice president Tim Leland said the device was a reference model, which others could use as their own products or as a foundation for more unique designs. The 835 will have better performance per watt, significantly better graphics, and a 20 percent improvement in motion-to-photon latency, he said. There will also be better interaction with sensors and better single-buffer rendering performance. “I think the future of VR is mobile,” Leland said. “I don’t think the future of VR is tethered to a PC. The market is starting to speak on that.” Above: Dean Takahashi tries out the Qualcomm VR headset at GDC 2017 Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The headset I tried was smaller and less bulky than existing headsets like the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift. It was battery-powered, offering about five hours of life with a 3,600 milliamp-hour battery. But the battery life will be content-dependent, Leland said. The device will have a hardware version available in the second quarter, with six degrees of motion tracking. And there will be a software kit available, as well. The headset also had a fairly large bar in front of the eyes, with a couple of sensors as part of its inside-out sensing design. (“Inside-out” means the sensors are on the headset, not on devices set up around the room). Those sensors were able to detect my hands and the movements of my 10 fingers. The device used controller-freehand tracking from Leap Motion, which meant I didn’t have to hold a touch controller in my hands. The headset ran Leap Motion’s demo software. During my test run, I was able to pick up and create blocks. I could toss them around and look at my fingers in virtual reality. The resolution was good, though the tracking wasn’t absolutely precise. It was still a little hard to pick up objects, but mainly because I had no force feedback, or sense of touch, that informed me when I had touched a block. The Leap Motion software has been integrated into Qualcomm’s reference design kit that other companies can take and put their brand names on, if they wish. Leland said hand-tracking is optional for other companies to include, but the sensor for it isn’t that expensive. It adds very little weight, so including it is kind of a no brainer for hardware companies. The Qualcomm headset was smaller than Intel’s own prototype, dubbed Project Alloy. That device has the capability of a high-end laptop, with the ability to run VR apps at 90 frames per second. The Snapdragon 835 is powerful, but I don’t know what kind of performance it will have. Qualcomm’s device was also much lighter, which means it didn’t feel so heavy on the head. Above: Qualcomm’s VR headset Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The developer headset had a four-megapixel (2560×1440) WQHD AMOLED display (two megapixels per eye) and six degrees of freedom (6DoF) motion tracking. It had two monochromatic, one-megapixel (1280×800) global shutter cameras. It had four gigabytes of LPDDR$ DRAM memory and 64 gigabytes of Flash UFS. It used wireless with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB3.1 type C (power). For audio, it featured Qualcomm Aqstic audio codec (WCD9335), and for I/O it also had a trackpad on the right side of the headset. The best thing about this prototype is that it told me the second generation of VR hardware isn’t far off. That’s a good thing, because the first generation hasn’t gotten enough traction to sustain a large number of VR startups and game companies. In other developments in VR at GDC, LG showed off its first wired headset to compete with the HTC Vive. It is based on the Steam VR technology developed by Valve and can use apps that are available in the Steam VR store.

Chinese company BOE has invested $50 million in Israeli company Cnoga Medical for 23% of the company's shares, reflecting a company value of $217 million, the two companies today reported. The shares given to BOE were newly issued, not sold shares. BOE is a Chinese laboratory equipment company that wants to establish itself as a leader in the medical sector. According to the BOE, Cnoga's product, developed by the company since 2004, and which facilitates medical monitoring and processing of information on the cloud, matches BOE's strategic plan. The deal also includes the signing of an agreement for joint marketing of Cnoga's products in China and development of a new line of products for the professional health market. RELATED ARTICLES Diabetes diagnosis co CNoga Medical raises $12.5m Cnoga Medical develops diagnostics through skin color Cnoga, based in Or Akiva, has developed a series of devices for non-invasive measurement of a range of health parameters through optical diagnosis of the changing color shades of a finger. Among other things, pulse, blood pressure, cardiac output, hemoglobin, ph, red blood vessel count, oxygen saturation, and other parameters can be measured in this way. The company's products are unique in both the way the information is obtained and the way it is handled on the cloud. In 2014, the company announced that it had received a $12.5 million investment from Chinese fund GoCapital. The company's products are distributed in a number of countries, including Italy, Brazil, and China, and are approved for marketing in 35 countries. Cnoga was founded by Dr. Yosef Segman, holder of a PhD in mathematics, who previously founded OPlus Technologies, sold to Intel. The original goal was to measure blood sugar levels non-invasively, but this proved to be an extremely difficult parameter to measure. The idea for the company actually arose in China, when Segman photographed many Chinese people, and noticed a difference in their skin hues, and differences between their skin and that of Westerners. He thought, however, that they all had one thing in common - a redness in complexion resulting from the flow of blood. The company previously cooperated with US company Texas Instruments, with support from the Israel-US Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Foundation. Texas Instruments also led the Cnoga's first financing round, in which $8 million was raised.

The 2-in-1 Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook has a large 12.5” display for easy viewing and a wide range of business ports for use with modern and legacy business systems. Alongside its flexible design as a standalone tablet or connected to its own keyboard, the device is suited to the needs of many mobile workers. These include production line managers, fitters and mechanics in manufacturing, field service engineers and telecommunications technicians and customer facing sales staff in retail. “Many businesses deploying consumer 2-in-1 devices have struggled with reliability and functionality,” said Jan Kaempfer, General Manager for Marketing for Panasonic Computer Product Solutions. “This device is purpose built to bring those organisations all the flexibility and ease of use they desire but with the reliability and business-ready design they require to deliver a significant return on their investment.” Panasonic Toughpad FZ Q2 Business-ready design The display is ideal for workers needing to view technical images or data and forms clearly and for those wanting to show high quality images or presentations to potential customers. The 12.5" Full HD display (1920 x 1080) is a 10 finger capacitive IPS multi-touch screen. The device also comes with a capacitive pen for annotation. For communication and image capture there is a 2MP Webcam with stereo microphones and 8MP documentation rear camera. For intensive data entry there is a full size, backlit keyboard. Wide ranging connectivity options Unlike many consumer devices that are reducing the number of ports, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook comes with a wide range of business ports, including USB 3.0, HDMI, LAN and True Serial for connection to a wide range of systems and devices. There is also a 4G LTE option for connectivity when on the move and options for smartcard and contactless smartcard readers for security*. Built to last Drawing on Panasonic’s 20 year history in designing long-lasting mobile devices for business, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook has semi-rugged status for mobile workers requiring a premium product that can withstand light, outside duties. With its magnesium alloy cabinet casing the device is able to withstand drops of up to 76cm and has a spillproof keyboard, yet remains lightweight and slim (max. 1.93 kg and 44mm thick). The tablet without keyboard weighs 1.09kg and is 22mm thick. The fanless device means it is also built to work effectively in dusty environments. Ease of use Designed for work on the move, this latest 2-in-1 has a useful carry strap that can also be used for holding the device in one hand. There is a kickstand incorporated into the design to enable the device to stand easily when connected to the keyboard. In addition, an optional 360 degree rotating hand strap** can be added for easy working with the tablet in portrait or landscape positions. An optional, sleek desktop cradle with Kensington lock for security, also allows the device to be easily used as a desktop. Powered for productivity Built to handle the most powerful business applications and the ability to work throughout a shift, the Panasonic Toughpad FZ-Q2 notebook has an Intel 6th generation CPU (Intel® Core™ m5-6Y57 vPro™ Processor with 4 MB Smartcache, 1.1 GHz up to 2.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 515. It comes with a Windows 10 Pro operating system, downgradable to Windows 7 if required, a 128GB Solid State Drive with 256GB as a factory option and 4GB of RAM (8GB factory option, project based).

I mostly associate them with their DeathAdder mouse, with the version from 2010 still being one of the best mice I've ever used. Razer has also made audio equipment like gaming headsets for quite some time, as well as a line of gaming keyboards. As time went on, some of these products gained features that were unique to Razer, such as the use of Razer-designed mechanical switches in their gaming keyboards, and RGB backlighting in various products with the Chroma branding. Razer has made a number of attempts to move beyond the world of gaming peripherals. Some have been more successful than others. For example, some gamers may remember the Razer Edge Pro, the gaming tablet that never seemed to catch on with consumers. Razer also made a fitness band called the Nabu, but it also appears to have missed the mark and has seen some pretty heavy discounts in recent times. With Razer's recent purchase of NextBit, many have begun to speculate on whether Razer plans to move into the mobile industry. While it would be fun to speculate on Razer's plans for the future, they do have one area beyond peripherals that has been an undisputed success. Their line of laptops, which started with the unveiling of the original Razer Blade in 2011, have shown that it's possible to build gaming laptops without the bulky plastic bodies and poor quality displays that traditionally characterized high-performance laptops from other vendors. As time has gone on, Razer has iterated on the original Razer Blade, and introduced both a smaller model in the form of the Razer Blade Stealth, a 14-inch model to carry on the name of the original 17-inch Razer Blade, and the Razer Blade Pro to fill the 17-inch space. That latter model is the laptop I'll be looking at today. Prior to the launch of this new model in late 2016, the Razer Blade Pro was last updated in 2014. That model was put in an awkward position right from launch. It came with NVIDIA's GTX 860M GPU, which was actually a step down from the GTX 870M in the 14-inch Razer Blade that was updated around the same time. It also only used a 1080p display due to limitations in what 17.3-inch panels were available on the market, while the 14-inch Blade Pro clocked in at 3200x1800 despite being $100 cheaper. The headline feature of the 2014 Blade Pro was its SwitchBlade touchpad, but it again suffered from unenthusiastic reception in the market. Ultimately, the Blade Pro ended up being a more niche machine, which didn't really offer advantages compared to its little brother except for users who really needed such a large display regardless of resolution. With the 2016 Blade Pro, Razer is changing up their strategy. When I think about gaming laptops, it seems to make sense to me that a larger model will have fewer power and thermal limitations, and so it should be even more powerful than the smaller versions. For example, a 13-inch MacBook Pro is less powerful than the 15-inch model. The 2016 Blade Pro follows that line of thinking, and pushes the performance of Razer's gaming laptops farther than ever before. I've outlined its specifications below. 2016 Razer Blade Pro CPU Intel Core i7-6700HQ 4C/8T 2.6-3.5 GHz 6MB Cache 45W TDP GPU NVIDIA GTX 1080 8GB 2560 CUDA Cores 1556 - 1733 (Boost) MHz Memory 32 GB 2133MHz DDR4 Display 17.3" 3840x2160 60 Hz w/G-SYNC Storage 512GB (2 x 256GB) M.2 PCIe SSD 1TB (2 x 512GB) M.2 PCIe SSD 2TB (2 x 1TB) M.2 PCIe SSD I/O 3 x USB 3.0 Ports 1 x Thunderbolt 3 1 x HDMI 2.0 SD Card Slot 1 x Headset Jack 1 x Killer E2400 Ethernet (10/100/1000Mbps) Dimensions 22.5mm x 424mm x 281mm (HxWxD) 0.88" x 16.7" x 11" (HxWxD) Weight 3.54 kg / 7.8 lbs Battery 99 Wh, 250W AC Adapter Wireless Killer Wireless-AC 1535 2x2:2 with Bluetooth 4.1 Price $3699.99 512GB $3999.99 1TB (Model tested) $4499.99 2TB As you can see, the Razer Blade Pro is quite the laptop. It's certainly not the bulky, heavy, tank-like device that you get when you buy a desktop replacement (DTR) from Clevo or MSI, but it doesn't compromise on performance in order to do so. Inside is NVIDIA's fastest GPU, the GTX 1080. There's also a pair of PCIe SSDs, Intel's i7-6700HQ CPU, 32GB of 2133MHz DDR4 memory, a UHD display with Adobe RGB color support, and an assortment of ports so you can connect all of your existing devices without issues.  With all that power in a relatively thin and light chassis, it's not a surprise that the Blade Pro comes at such a high price. The 2014 Razer Blade Pro launched at a price of $2299, although it was lacking in the spec department in many ways, and the 14-inch Blade, with better hardware, was cheaper at $2199. Now that the Blade Pro sits at the top of Razer's laptop line for both size and performance, a price gap is actually justified. For the model with 512GB of internal storage, the Blade Pro costs 3699.99 USD. Moving to 1TB brings the price up to 3999.99 USD, and the 2TB model is the most expensive at 4499.99 USD. As I mentioned before, the 2014 Blade Pro definitely had room for improvement. The 2016 Blade Pro also comes after two years of technological improvements, and it has great potential as both a gaming machine and a mobile workstation. To start things off I'll go over the Blade Pro's design, before moving on to performance testing.

POST A COMMENT 42 Comments View All Comments Eden-K121D - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Who'll buy this? Reply Ninhalem - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link From the article: "The 2016 Razer Blade Pro is a great gaming laptop. I certainly wish I could afford one for myself. My life right now is characterized by frequent moving due to work and university, and something like the Blade Pro would allow me to bring an incredibly powerful machine with me wherever I go. While the Blade Pro fulfills its role as a high performance gaming machine, it did let me down as a mobile workstation." The last sentence feels like an unintended scenario for this laptop. Mobile workstation to me says you need to do activities like CAD and/or purely business work, and requires a CAD card instead of the mainstream variant. This laptop's intended audience clearly isn't the business world. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link No $4,000 laptop should be usable ONLY for gaming, any other laptop in this price range is a jack of all trades sans military laptops. Reply Brandon Chester - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Yeah that was my point. I'm actually willing to shell out $3700 on a laptop if it can replace every other computer in my life. If it can only replace a gaming machine then it's going to be limited to the niche of users who can afford paying that much just to bring their games around with them. Reply DanNeely - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link From a few sentences later in the article it's clear that he's talking about a image/video editing workstation not a CAD box; for the former only the screen is really holding it back. Reply QuinRiva - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Mid level technical professionals... The business is buying it, so the price is pretty insignificant compared to salary and overheads. Sure, most of my workload is offloaded to a DB or compute node somewhere, but loads of prototyping and presentation workload is done on the laptop/client side. Quadcore is essential just to run things like Excel/Tableau, and a decent graphics card is useful for Illustrator, or running neural nets; or spending a bit of time relaxing playing a game on an international business trip. And if they want "pro" buy-in, it has to look like a professional tool - I can't turn up to a client meeting with a flashing garish "gaming laptop". The XPS 15 is a pretty good compromise on this front, it's just a pity it was limited to GTX 960M. Reply digiguy - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link One negative aspect seems to be unanimously mentioned by all reviewers: the keyboard is crap. Which, for a laptop, is a big negative. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link I just wanted to agree with the author on one point, I also have the deathadder and it is the greatest mouse I have ever used for any purpose. It has been beaten on relentlessly and still operates flawlessly. The rest of Razer's products are overpriced garbage (I say that from experience) but their mice are top notch. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link I hope the current model deathadder chroma lives up to all the hype. I'm buying one as a gift for a certain mmo addict living in my home that's used a cheap Dell mouse to the point where the left mouse button isn't working anymore. I'm genuinely surprised the Dell lasted for so long (5 years) considering how much rage-clicking, grunting, and anger it endured. Even my son wasn't as hard on his mice back in the day when he was young and prone to gamer outbursts. Reply colonelclaw - Monday, March 06, 2017 - link Plus one for the Deathadder. I've been using them for, I think, over 7 years. In my office I let anyone choose any mouse they like, and over half the staff have gone for a Deathadder. Conversely, for keyboards, no two people have chosen the same (I went for a Corsair K70) Reply 1 2 3 4 5 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News Playing With Power: A Look At Nintendo Switch Power Consumption Meizu Unveils Super mCharge: Fast Charging At 55W ZTE Announces The Blade V8 Mini And Blade V8 Lite NVIDIA Unveils GeForce GTX 1080 Ti: Available Week of March 5th for $699 GeForce GTX 1080 Price Cut to $499; NVIDIA Partners To Begin Selling 10-Series Cards With Faster Memory AMD GDC 2017: Asynchronous Reprojection for VR, Vega Gets a Retail Name, & More MediaTek Announces Helio X30 Availability: 10 CPU Cores On 10nm BlackBerry KEYOne Announced: Snapdragon 625 with QWERTY, $549 Sony Launches Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs Phones For US Market Samsung Launches the 9.7-inch Galaxy Tab S3: Snapdragon 820 with 6000mAh and HDR Samsung Launch the Galaxy Book 10.6-inch and 12-inch: Windows Tablets with Kaby Lake Intel Announces Xeon D-1500 Network Series SoCs with QuickAssist, Four 10 GbE Ports TWEETS IanCutress: Don't see any benefit, don't want a non-financial relationship, don't want to dedicate resources, don't want to hand out licence @revertice IanCutress: I'd love to run commercial enterprise software e.g Fluent/Comsol for benchmarks, but I tend to get stonewalled by the software vendors IanCutress: Broadwell-E has TM3, allowing a core +500MHz, but disabled by default by mobo vendors.

No sooner have you spied the latest handset, then there's anticipation of something else, the next big thing. We've rounded up the best smartphones for 2017, those we consider to be the best across all platforms, and we've regularly updated that list as the smartphone world has evolved. You can find those in our Best smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy today feature. If your budget is a little smaller, there is also our Best budget smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy for under £250. Here we're looking at those phones that haven't yet launched, the best upcoming phones for 2017. We'll be updating this list on a regular basis, with those device rumours we think are credible and exciting, and devices just announced but yet to hit the shelves. We've also just had a glut of new smartphones at MWC 2017. Mobile World Congress 2017: All the announcements that matter Best upcoming phones 2017 Before we dive into the detail, here are some of the anticipated upcoming handsets for 2017: Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus HTC U/HTC Ocean Apple iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 8 Plus OnePlus 5 Google Pixel 2 @evleaks Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus Samsung had sure-fire hits with the Galaxy S7, especially in the S7 edge model. The company's standing in mobile might suffer a little following the Note 7's battery problems, so the Galaxy S8 might have to be extra special. Rumours have suggested that Samsung might drop the flat version of the S8, only offering curved devices in two sizes. There's also talk of increasing the screen resolution, perhaps with a move to 4K, and talk of 5.8 and 6.1-inch sizes, but with those big screens packed into more compact bodies. Samsung is sure to pack the S8 with its latest Exynos 8895 chipset for oodles of power, although we'd expect a Snapdragon 835 version too, and we'd expect to see a move to USB Type-C, following the move of the Note 7. On the software front, we'd expect the S8 to launch on Android Nougat with TouchWiz. Given Samsung's great experience, we'd not expect too many changes to Samsung's software experience. As the Samsung Galaxy S8 release date, it will be announced on 29 March 2017. Samsung Galaxy S8: Release date, rumours and everything you need to know Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus: Everything you need to know @evleaks HTC Ocean HTC's next flagship handset is thought to be going under the name of HTC Ocean. This name came from a video leak which showed off a concept handset, but supported by a leak via Twitter. HTC launched its first handsets for 2017 in the form of the U Play and U Ultra, but at the time said this wasn't the flagship and there was more to come. It's early days in the rumour cycle for this handset, but the focus of the video was on new methods of interaction, showing a phone with no buttons and using a mixture of voice, gestures and swipes to control it, so that's what we're expecting - as well as a Snapdragon 835 and a launch date at some point later in the year, perhaps April. One thing we do know for sure is that it won't be called HTC 11. HTC Ocean: What's the story on HTC's next flagship? Pocket-lint Apple iPhone 8 Yes, already. The paint has barely dried on the iPhone 7, but there's already talk of the iPhone 8, which is reported to shake things up completely. The iPhone 7, surprisingly, didn't make a huge change over the iPhone 6S, but the biggest hint at what to expect from the iPhone 8 might have come from Apple Watch. With the release of the Series 2 device, Apple introduced a ceramic version. This, paired with the jet black colouring for the iPhone 7, might point to future changes in materials for the iPhone 8.  Some are suggesting that the iPhone 8 will be mostly glass and introduce wireless charging, but there's expected to be a special edition ceramic version too. Taking it further, it's suggested that there will be an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus too, alongside this roaring iPhone 8. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint OnePlus 5 Wait, what? No, you're not going mad. There's a rumour that OnePlus will be skipping the 4 number and heading straight to OnePlus 5. The OnePlus 5 could land with a glass or ceramic body, moving on from the OnePlus 3T to present something a little different. It wouldn't be the first time that OnePlus has used something different, as it did in the OnePlus X. A 5.3-inch display might meet a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset for loads of power. This could all be heading your way in May or June. OnePlus 4/OnePlus 5: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint Google Pixel 2 The Google Pixel has received great acclaim for it's pure Google phone approach, with a lot of people really loving the camera experience.  Rumours are light on the Google Pixel 2 - we don't even have confirmation of the name - but it has been confirmed that there will be a new Pixel device in 2017. That was confirmed by Rick Osterloh, SVP of hardware at Google, i.e., the chap who will be responsible for it. Other details are light, but Osterloh also confirmed that the Pixel 2 would retain its premium positioning. That's about all we know so far, but you can expect Android O, and potentially another phone manufactured by HTC. We'd expect it to launch about October time, about a year after the original. Google Pixel 2: What do we want to see? Pocket-lint Nokia 8 Nokia made it's play at Mobile World Congress 2017, launching three Android devices. The lead device was the Nokia 6, but notably missing was a true flagship smartphone, colloquially dubbed the Nokia 8.  Originally leaking as the P1, and then finding itself levelled with the name Nokia 8, we're expecting a premium build, with an IP68 rating, a 5.5-inch display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. Most of the hardware rumours have said Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, but with plenty of mixed messaging coming from the flagship rumours and those wrapped up in the Nokia 6/5/3, we're going to be watching and waiting to see how the story of Nokia's flagship unfolds. Nokia 8 Android phone: Release date, rumours and specs facebook/designer Microsoft Surface Phone The Surface Phone is something of a Windows phone holy grail. With Nokia then Microsoft Devices producing plenty of Windows Phones, the spectre of the Surface Phone has been hanging around as the idea of the ultimate Windows mobile device. Given the recent sale of virtually all of its phone patents, and announcement that it's no longer focusing on Windows Phone development, the Surface Phone may never see the light of day. It's rumoured that the new premium device will be Surface branded and Intel powered, possibly coming in three different variants. Given the same team behind the Surface Tablets are said to be behind the Surface Phone, you can expect a solid build if it ever does appear. There's also the suggestion that Surface Phone will run a brand new update of Windows 10, aiming to capitalise on the branding and offer the ultimate experience. Launch originally wasn't expected until the latter half of 2016, but this has since shifted to 2017. That's if it appears at all. Microsoft Surface Phone: What's the story so far? Upcoming phones already announced... Pocket-lint LG G6 LG announced the LG G6 at MWC 2017, launching a phone with a 18:9 display. It's taller, narrower and designed to make it easier to use the 5.7-inch phone. It's a premium build, powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset and packing a pair of cameras on the rear, giving you regular and wide angle shots.  The LG G6 is going to be widely available, but there's no word on price or release date. We have used it, so you can read our full preview of this new handset. LG G6 preview: All screen, no frame Pocket-lint Huawei P10 and P10 Plus Huawei announced the P10 and P10 Plus at MWC 2017, delivering an update to the popular P9 handset. One of the visual changes is a range of interesting colours - it's not just black or grey, it's blue and green. There's a 5.1-inch display on the P10, a 5.5-inch display on the P10 Plus, packed into a metal body. The P10 offers Full HD, the P10 Plus makes a jump to Quad HD, with both being powered by the Kirin 960 chipset. There's a pair of Leica cameras on the rear, offering monochrome and colour capture separately, with optical image stabilisation. The Huawei P10 will be available from March 2017, costing around £550 for the smaller model, the larger is expected to be only £50 more. Read our previews for a little more information. Huawei P10 preview: The lean, green photo machine Huawei P10 Plus preview: Premium package, without a price hike Pocket-lint Nokia 6 The Nokia 6 is now a global device, offering a lovely build on mid-range specs. It has an aluminium body, fronted by a lovely 5.5-inch Full HD display. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset and offers a 16-megapixel camera on the rear, 8-megapixel on the front. Most attractive, however, is that it's pure Android, with no bloat at all - the only thing Nokia changes is the camera app. The Arte Black special edition (pictured) is only €299, the normal version is €229, meaning this is a serious bargain for Nokia's return to smartphones. There are also Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 handsets, which drop the specs down - the Nokia 6 is our star pick, however. Nokia 6 preview: A solid start for the new Android Nokia Pocket-lint Moto G5 and G5 Plus Motorola, now under the stewardship of Lenovo, pitched out the Moto G5 and G5 Plus at MWC 2017, updating it's affordable Android device. The Moto G5 now offers a metal body on both these devices, with a front fingerprint scanner. The G5 is a 5-inch device, the G5 Plus expands to 5.2-inches; the G5 Plus offers a more advanced camera and is the more powerful handset, with more storage too. That difference is also reflected in the price. The Moto G5 is £169, the Moto G5 Plus is £269. Both devices will be available in March. Moto G5 preview: The best budget phone, now dressed in a full metal jacket Moto G5 Plus preview: A big dose of premium, without the prohibitive price tag Pocket-lint BlackBerry KeyOne BlackBerry is now produced by TCL and the latest device is the BlackBerry KeyOne, formerly known as Mercury. This is a touch and type handset, offering the full glory of Android, with a BlackBerry keyboard on the bottom. This is a solidly-built handset with a premium finish, with a 3:2 display and powered by a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chipset. There's plenty of innovation here, like the fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Priced at £499, it's not hugely expensive for those looking for that keyboard fix paired with an Android experience. It will be available in April.

EPS for 2016 stood at NT$1.39, down from NT$2.09 of a year earlier. However, the company said it plans to hand out dividends of NT$2 in cash for 2016. The company reported earlier that its revenues for January 2017 were down 4.61% on year to NT$677 million due to seasonal factors. ASRock is expected to see its sales to start picking up in February-March due to the launch of Intel's Kaby Lake-based and AMD's Ryzen 7-based products, according to a Chinese-language Commercial Times report. The company's stock price rose NT$1.20 to finish at NT$43.30 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) during the March 6 session.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 March 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

Among the top 25 exporters from China to the U.S., more than 80 percent are owned by companies outside the mainland, according to a study by the Tokyo-based bank. While some manufacturing stocks face greater risk, the diversity of ownership means China itself isn’t as vulnerable as Japan was in the 1980s, when most of its big exporters were Japanese and Washington imposed curbs similar to those now being flagged by President Donald Trump, Nomura says. “A trade war between the U.S. and China could very well equally, if not more, impact stocks listed in Taiwan, Korea and the U.S.” wrote Nomura’s chief of China equity research Wendy Liu and analyst Erin Zhang. “China’s case is more complex than Japan’s experience in the 1980s.” Taiwan owns a majority of the biggest exporters to the U.S., which include Quanta Computer Inc.’s Shanghai-based unit, Tech-Com, and Pegatron Corp.’s Maintek Computer and Protek, the Nomura data show. Investors have been bracing for more information from Trump, who talked of boosting tariffs on imports into the U.S. and labeling China a currency manipulator while campaigning for the presidency. A majority of investors polled by Nomura expect some kind of spat over trade between the world’s biggest two economies, with companies in industries that have large trade surpluses with the U.S. likely to be the target of penalties, based on Japan’s experience.

Sign Up President Ronald Reagan slapped tariffs on Japanese items including motorcycles and TVs during the 1980s, and engineered a stronger yen via the Plaza Accord. His administration also lobbied to remove barriers in areas where the U.S. was competitive. China is currently the biggest source of U.S. imports, with its share of about 21 percent similar to Japan’s stake in the mid-1980s, Nomura said, citing International Monetary Fund data. “Trade volume between China and the U.S. is huge,” Chen Deming, China’s former commerce minister, told reporters Monday on the sidelines of the National People’s Congress in Beijing. “Both of us will be weakened and wounded by a trade war, and the global community will also be damaged.” Companies that make machinery and transport equipment are among those with the most to lose if trade tensions escalate, because China accounted for more than 20 percent of U.S. imports in 2016 in those sectors, according to Nomura. The bank flagged 18 stocks listed either on the mainland or in Hong Kong with more than 10 percent of sales coming from North America that chiefly manufacture outside of the U.S. They included Sichuan Chengfa Aero-Science & Technology Co., a Chengdu-based maker of aircraft parts, wigmaker Henan Rebecca Hair Products Co. and Intel Corp. supplier Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. Three Things Because American companies generally have greater access to China’s market today than they did to Japan’s in the 1980s, that means they have invested more in country and are “making good money” in China, the Nomura analysts wrote. That limits the chances of a damaging trade war. There are three key things to watch, in Nomura’s analysis -- U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s trade agenda, the April Treasury Department foreign-exchange report where the U.S. will decide whether to dub China a currency manipulator, and the future of the Sino-American framework for economic dialog, which under President Barack Obama saw annual meetings of top economic policy makers. “China’s case has more parties owning a stake than Japan in the ’80s, which means that the odds of a trade war are lower than otherwise,” the Nomura analysts concluded. Even so, “only a minority of investors in Europe and Asia believe that reconciliation between the U.S. and China is likely without a trade war,” they wrote. — With assistance by Emma O'Brien Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Guest IoT predictions for 2017 depend on helping developers Andreas Stavropoulos, DFJ@astavropoulos March 5, 2017 4:54 PM Image Credit: chombosan / Shutterstock The 20 to 50 billion new devices coming online over the next few years — estimates vary — represent a massive opportunity for businesses, and not just technology businesses. Smarter devices and troves of sensor data can improve existing business models and lead to the creation of entirely new ones. The device population explosion will lead to a data explosion that will spark the creation of businesses based on scalable, low-churn models in the coming year. Many of these businesses start with a hardware purchase, but none end there. For instance: Services that improve with individual usage. A security camera that learns to distinguish household members from strangers is much more likely to deliver context-sensitive alerts/recordings worth paying for, versus paying for hundreds of recordings of the mailman delivering a letter. Same goes for a fridge that can tell over time which brands to automatically replenish versus one-off items. The dossiers that devices build for their users are forms of lock-in. Nobody wants to retrain their devices. Services that improve with penetration density. There’s a network effect to smart devices. Shared learning (as in the self-driving car algorithms at Tesla and Google) and shared real-time data (like the Ring doorbell Neighborhoods feature, or the Tile Community Network) can make the value of a device on a network far greater than it is by itself. And again, this network effect leads to hardware and service lock-in. Devices that require higher-margin replacement parts. Think of a smart connected toothbrush (like the Oral-B Bluetooth connected model) that promotes frequent and proper brushing and orders brush replacements for you, or a smart water filtration system that orders its own parts and maintenance, or a smart thermostat that orders air filters. To succeed, these models depend on grabbing the consumer’s attention with ancillary data and analytics (tooth brushing reports and feedback, for example) to keep reinforcing the need for regular attention and replenishment. In contrast, devices that try to force a subscription for a minimal level of functionality, or with services that do not improve over time as competitors catch up, don’t stand a chance. The Internet of Things is going to kill static subscription services. But we are going to run into roadblocks unless we quickly embrace more modern development methodologies, security standards, and monitoring tools. There’s also the problem of a very small number of developers with experience in IoT devices and data structures, compared to the hordes of cloud and mobile developers. The easiest way to get developers working on IoT applications would be to give them familiar tools that abstract away the physical and low-level complexity of IoT. Enterprise developers are already using Linux container approaches (see Docker, CoreOS, and Apache Mesos). Containers will become important for the development of IoT systems as well. They open the door to virtualization, and bring benefits like failure containment and application isolation. These protections will make IoT systems more reliable, as well as easier to build. I predict significant strategic announcements in 2017 around support for container-based architectures for IoT from the likes of GE, Samsung, and Intel. Inevitably, IoT devices will get more powerful due to the falling costs of full system-on-chip architecture. It makes sense that they be treated as full-fledged, cloud-enabled network computing nodes. The more powerful they are, the easier it will be for developers to take their familiarity with existing developmental methodologies (including containers) and apply those skills directly to these devices. Developing the data architectures and analysis is a different skill set, but at least on the hardware side the future doesn’t look too alien. Security will improve alongside the drive to known development models, but we can also look forward to new standards that will constrain network traffic depending on what a device attests that it needs. Work that the Docker community is doing to implement signed images and attestation on the cloud side can transfer to the IoT domain. And for industrial IoT applications, we’ll see continued decentralization of intelligence: Nodes won’t connect to the cloud, but to edge or intermediate points. Mobile data bottlenecks, security concerns and physical limitations, coupled with the need for fast reactions between sensors and actuators, (e.g. automated factory sensors that predict failures locally and take preventative actions, like the platform Alluvium is building) all point in this direction. I expect to see machine-learning driven decision-making applications close to the edge (perhaps even on-chip), with gateway devices acting as relays to the cloud for backup, updating, network-effect sharing, and diagnostics. While these improvements would speed the connected device explosion, their interoperability and updateability are nowhere near where they need to be. Getting the development part of IoT right is a good first step. Andreas Stavropoulos is a partner at venture capital firm DFJ.

Mr Bannon can be seen through an Oval Office window waving his arms around and appearing agitated. Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and Sean Spicer can also be seen in the background. News.com.au understands White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and press secretary Sean Spicer were also in the explosive meeting While it is unclear what the debate was about it comes after CNN reported Mr Trump was “extremely frustrated” with his staff for allowing his address to Congress last week, which was well received, to be overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ meetings with the Russian ambassador. “Nobody has seen him that upset,” an anonymous source told the network. Tense moments between US President Donald Trump and chief strategist Steve Bannon Mr Trump’s anger at the repeated “mini disasters” that have distracted his administration boiled over during a heated meeting in the Oval Office on Friday, where he reportedly dressed down White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Donald Trump is reportedly a grumpy man at the moment. Pic: APSource:AP Today, Mr Trump demanded Congress investigate his claims that Barack Obama ordered a wire-tap on Trump Tower in the lead-up to last year’s election. The White House has not provided any proof to back up Mr Trump’s extraordinary accusation. In an early morning tweetfest on Saturday, the President claimed his predecessor had ordered surveillance on him. He compared the alleged wire-tapping to Watergate and McCarthyism, and called Mr Obama a “bad (or sick) guy”. Meanwhile, the director of the FBI, James Comey, has reportedly asked the US Justice Department to publicly shoot down Mr Trump’s accusation that Mr Obama ordered Trump Tower to be wire-tapped. Mr Comey reportedly said Mr Trump has falsely insinuated that the FBI broke the law. But his request to the Justice Department, made on Saturday according to the New York Times, has not resulted in a public statement. A spokesman for Mr Obama called Mr Trump’s accusations completely false. But the White House continued its attack overnight, with Mr Trump’s deputy White House press secretary calling it potentially the “greatest abuse of power” the country has ever seen. Speaking on ABC’s This Week, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the President was determined to find out exactly what happened. “Look, I think he’s going off of information that he’s seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential,” she said. “And if it is, this is the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that I think we have ever seen and a huge attack on democracy itself. “And the American people have a right to know if this took place.” A spokesman for Barack Obama has dismissed Mr Trump’s claims as utterly false. Picture: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/APSource:AP Politicians from both parties appealed for Mr Trump to provide proof for the startling claim, however the White House insisted there would be no further comment until “such oversight is conducted” by the congressional intelligence committees. Mr Trump claims the wire-tapping happened in October at the New York skyscraper where he ran his election campaign. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 However House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rubbished the claim. “It’s called a wrap-up smear,” she said. “You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge. It’s a tool of an authoritarian.” FBI director James B. Comey has asked the Justice Department to publicly reject Mr Trump’s claim saying it is false and must be corrected. Mr Comey made the request following Mr Trump’s Twitter tirade on Saturday, according to US officials, although the department has not released such a statement, the New York Times reported. Mr Comey reportedly said there is no evidence to support his claim which implies that the FBI broke the law. As the fallout continued, it also emerged Mr Trump’s accusations may be based on unproven claims by alt-right news site Breitbart News and conservative radio. CNN anchor and chief, Washington correspondent Jack Tapper, tweeted that White House sources told him Mr Trump did not get his information from government sources. WH officials with whom I spoke said POTUS got the info about wiretap from media - Breitbart, Levin - not from govt sources.— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 5, 2017 Obviously FBI/DOJ wiretap of POTUS would be HUGE story. One illegally ordered by previous POTUS even bigger. BUT WH officials have no proof— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 5, 2017 3/Most reporters I know are digging on this. But every current Intel voice is saying they know of nothing to back up this claim.— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 5, 2017 Tapper also said if this was indeed the case it would be a massive story, however there was no proof to back up Mr Trump’s extraordinary claims. He also tweeted it wouldn’t be the first time the POTUS put out “wild accusations that are untethered to reality” including Mr Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud and his leadership of the birther movement, which questioned whether Mr Obama was born in the US. Meanwhile, Mr Obama’s former press secretary Josh Earnest said presidents don’t have authority to unilaterally order the wire-tapping of American citizens. Mr Earnest accused Mr Trump of levelling the allegations to distract from the attention being given to campaign-season contacts by Trump aides with a Russian official, including campaign adviser Jeff Sessions, before he resigned from the Senate to become attorney general. Mr Obama’s spokesman Kevin Lewis said a “cardinal rule” of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered in Justice Department investigations, which are supposed to be conducted free of political influence. Mr Lewis said neither Obama nor any White House official had ever ordered surveillance on any US citizen. “Any suggestion otherwise is simply false,” he said. — with the Associated Press debra.killalea@news.com.au Leave a comment Add your comment to this story Show Comments Jump back to top Right now in finance 91Readers It’s your housing crisis, states tell feds 119Readers Shared equity: First home buyers able to co-purchase propert... 76Readers Commonwealth Bank, ANZ appear before parliamentary banking i... 58Readers ATO launches cash crackdown on small businesses in Canberra,... 51Readers Malcolm Turnbull responds to Pauline Hanson’s Muslim comment... finance breaking news 11:03Credit card 'not best way to borrow': CBA 17:42ANZ favours reviews over royal commission 17:56Stocks to watch 17:35Takeovers Panel refuses probe on Macmahon 09:30Construction expands in February A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.Find out more about our policy and your choices, including how to opt-out.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE 5G takes big leap forward at MWC 17, but next generation networks remain far over the horizon Chris O'Brien@obrien March 5, 2017 3:10 PM Tags: 5G, mobile world congress, MWC 2017, top-stories This may be remembered as the year the telecommunications industry stopped squabbling over standards for next generation telecommunications networks and started to make 5G a reality. The announcements regarding 5G surged into a tidal wave this year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. After several years of countries and companies making bland pledges to form committees to consider standards and partnerships to conduct research, the latest edition of the industry’s largest gathering was filled with concrete product announcements, pilot launches, and promises that the next revolution is at hand. It’s not. Despite the pervasive talk of 5G at MWC, and the need for every booth and product to hype it relentlessly, the reality is that it remains far over the horizon. The need to sort out technical issues, standards, and business models points to the roadblocks that still remain. For the near future, users can expect more evolution than revolution when it comes to wireless network speeds. “Many of you are wondering, ‘Why do we need 5G?’” said Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri in a keynote address. “‘Is it worth the billions that will be spent on it?’ Yes.” But in trying to temper expectations, he added: “It will not happen overnight. We believe that most carriers will want an evolutionary process that maximizes their current investment.” It’s easy to see why the notion of 5G gets the industry’s adrenaline pumping. The leap from 3G networks to 4G, with a top theoretical speed of 100 Mbps, was giant. But it would be nothing compared to 5G, which must provide a minimum of 20 Gbps and be capable of connecting 1 million devices within a square kilometer. This speed and density are almost unfathomable today. 5G is the technology that will allow us to control fields of robots with no latency and allow for roads filled almost exclusively with autonomous vehicles and skies filled continuously with unmanned drones. Not to mention all the developments that we can’t possibly imagine in a world where everything is connected all the time. Mats Granryd, director general of GSMA, the industry group that organizes MWC, predicted there would be 1 billion 5G connections by 2025. “Our industry is driving standards, business models, and public policy,” he said. “We’ll have self-driving cars reacting in milliseconds to make crucial decisions. Robots will interact with themselves and their environment.” But that number of connections is smaller than it sounds. It’s not clear in this case if GSMA is talking about people or machines. Still, getting even to that modest 1 billion will be a long and unpredictable road. That’s because telecom companies have a delicate balancing act ahead, in part because standards are not entirely settled. So whatever goes in the ground, they want to make sure it can be adapted if necessary. But more than that, many of these companies are still in the process of investing in 4G LTE, the current top speed. After almost a decade, 4G LTE is still only available in about 34 percent of the world, according to GSMA, which is a sign of just how long such changes take. In a report released last week, GSMA predicted that by 2020, 75 percent of the world’s population will be covered by 4G. Currently, about 23 percent of all mobile connections go over 4G, and the industry hopes that number will increase to more than 40 percent by 2020. That is the year the industry believes carriers will really start to deploy 5G. But even then, these companies don’t want to tear out all that 4G equipment that hasn’t even been paid for yet. Instead, as the Nokia chief suggested, they will want to evolve it to a kind of 4.5G with 1 Gbps speeds, and then maybe 3 Gbps. So expect to hear a lot about “gigabit wireless” in the coming years. Still, who wouldn’t want a 1 Gbps wireless connection, right? With those caveats in mind, however, the flurry of 5G announcements at MWC this week shows that the industry is clearly ready to start taking the next steps down this brave new wireless road. The 5G hype started in advance of the conference. The week before MWC, Qualcomm and Intel announced their respective progress toward building chipsets and modems capable of realizing the 5G dream. In its traditional keynote slot on Sunday, Samsung, along with its partners, made a series of announcements about 5G. Samsung announced a suite of 5G consumer products, including a 5G home router and radio. There was no word on when they would be available, but such gadgets are a critical piece of enabling a 5G world. There was even some talk that there might be a 5G phone by next year. On the same day, Nokia announced a technology bundle called “5G First” that’s aimed at telecom carriers. 5G First uses the industry specifications developed by the Verizon 5G Technology Forum ecosystem. The idea is to make it as quick and easy as possible for carriers to launch trials. Meanwhile, Ericsson announced collaboration on 5G trials, together with Qualcomm and NTT DOCOMO in Japan. Qualcomm is also working with Ericsson on a new 5G radio for Vodafone. “5G will enable operators to provide new use cases in areas such as the Internet of Things, automation and big data, and the ability to build new revenue streams with radically new business models,” Ulf Ewaldsson, senior vice president and chief strategy and technology officer, said in a statement. “To speed up commercialization of the global 3GPP 5G standard, we continuously work with leading operators and ecosystem players in 5G to enable global scale and drive the industry in one common direction.” Verizon will start a pilot to offer 5G to select customers in the first half of the year. AT&T will also launch 5G pilots this year. The goal of these announcements, and tests, is to encourage people to start developing applications for these networks. The estimated investment to build 5G will run will into the trillions of dollars over the next decade. The carriers want developers to be creating richer IoT uses, advanced video, and other robotic-related applications. And that’s another reason telecom companies are going to proceed with caution when it comes to 5G. The last thing they want to do is sink all that money into the ground and then have to wait other decade for someone to figure out how to use the bandwidth.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — On Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election, describing this as the former administration's "new low." Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 марта 2017 г. ​The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 4 марта 2017 г. ​"One of the focus points of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation is the U.S. government's response to actions taken by Russian intelligence agents during the presidential campaign. As such, the Committee will make inquiries into whether the government was conducting surveillance activities on any political party’s campaign officials or surrogates, and we will continue to investigate this issue if the evidence warrants it," Nunes said, as quoted in a committee statement. © AP Photo/ Evan Vucci Former US Intel Chief Clapper Rejects Trump’s Wire-Tap ClaimsThe statement comes after Trump asked congressional intelligence committees to look into "politically motivated" investigations conducted by the previous administration in the run up to last year's election. The White House statement said this should be carried out as part of the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the election. The Trump administration has been dogged by accusations of having links to the Russian government, which was accused last year of organizing damning leaks of Democratic Party emails that marred Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. ...

Levy My Other Blogs You are here: Home » General » Buy American Lies Buy American Lies [ 29 ] March 5, 2017 | Erik Loomis The problem with politicians and corporations promoting their own Made in America campaigns isn’t that we shouldn’t have an industrial policy that promotes domestically made goods. It’s that their promises are almost always lies. Take Foxconn, best known for having to put up suicide nets in its Chinese factories so that workers don’t throw themselves to their death while making your computers and phones. It has claimed it would build a big factory in Pennsylvania. Got itself lots of good press, workers in the Keystone State thought they would be able to work industrial jobs again. And then? But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said last month during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. But hey, I’m sure Trump is going to ensure accountability, right? We all know how much he values buying American! The Keystone XL Pipeline will not be subject to President Donald Trump’s executive order requiring infrastructure projects to be built with American steel, a White House spokeswoman said today. Trump signed the order calling for the Commerce Department to develop a plan for U.S. steel to be used in “all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired or expanded pipelines” inside the U.S. projects “to the maximum extent possible.” Of course. Because it’s all show. He doesn’t care about this at all. The proximate cause might be TransCanada’s NAFTA lawsuit against the U.S., but of course this sort of thing is in all sorts of trade agreements, as opposed to any workers’ rights being protected in them, so between this and the frequent lies of corporations on these issues, there’s no reason to believe that any meaningful infrastructure investment using American-made steel will actually materialize.

Different locals have served as fresh (supposedly) virgin rubes. UnderTheSun says: Foxcomm factory that wasn’t built, surely it’s evidence of Obama’s failures rather than Trumps. 2. Obama was partially-rubed by the Chandler Intel fab that ended up smaller than pimped. 3. Trump is a systematic symbiotic rube who is indiscriminately promiscuous with any fluffer/pimp. . However from the local rubes’ perspective, these vaporware promises are less expensive than mega-stadium boondoggles.

A product of any complexity, even if it says “Made in the U.S.A.” on the label, is likely to be composed of parts that were made just about anywhere else _but_ the United States. Raw materials, the materials of construction like metals and plastics, mechanical and electronic components…there isn’t just a supply chain behind the manufacture of any device but an enormous supply TREE and what mere consumer can possibly hope to trace what countries of origin that tree spreads through? BTW this is also why the notion of “consumer choice” as the all-powerful corrective to unscrupulous or substandard manufacturers is such nonsense. If some product you buy is cheap and shoddy and dangerous, there’s every chance that the real guilty party is some supplier of parts whose name you don’t even know and supplies components to EVERY brand-name end-user product supplier you’re likely to find in shops.

Log in to Reply los says: March 5, 2017 at 3:48 pm issue there _was_ one of top-level design. a better example still isn’t coming to my mind… also Samsung has manufactured for other brands, so possibly the final assembly (and more) of Samsung-labeled gadgets is in Samsung factories, not in a no-name contractor factory… I assume some defect liability haggling goes into contracts at each supplier level. Coil component maker buys copper wire. Foxconn buys transformer etc. Apple etc buys the Apple-designed and labeled product from Foxconn Then customer accepts traditional 30 day return to retailer, and the otherwise manufacturer (Apple, etc) warranty return.

Laptop charger/adapters. Same model adapter, but part number differs for multiple reasons. One reason (sometimes?) is the that the actual manufacturer of the part (charger/adapter) differs. OTOH for cordless phones and similar cheap adapters, I’ve never seen hints of different part numbers when adapter manufacturers differ. I thought it was funny to see Best Buy selling the strangely-named “unbranded” brand of touch tablet.

How many of them will bother following up on any of this? If Trump and Fox News say that Trump is Making Great Deals to bring jobs here, then it’s happening (unless they live in one of the areas in question where it never materializes). Although it makes me wonder what these companies think they’ll be getting. If Trump doesn’t care about whether they’re honoring any PR promises about jobs, what makes them think he’ll honor anything he quietly promises them in return? Log in to Reply los says: March 5, 2017 at 3:19 pm PR promises As I’ve interpreted the PR that I’ve read, both Trump and corporation perform the publicized pretend-bargaining as only symbiotic PR. The corporation supposedly kisses Trump’s a**, but actually enjoys the nearly unpaid “patriotic” PR. It reminds of those street scams, wherein one con begins a conversation with the mark. A second con approaches and acts as if another random kindly stranger, with a story that corroborates with first con’s story. They are pretending to be independent sources of the same information. Log in to Reply los says: March 5, 2017 at 4:22 pm Brett says: Fox-News-only set. How many of them will bother following up on any of this? The altcucks “follow up” in lockstep, exactly as they did when cuck-“news” fed the “starter” story. So, when cucknews is currently feeding nothing, altcucks either: a. followup with nothing. “In one ear; out the other.” or b. when there is marginally related topic, regurgitate the starter story or the most erroneous variation.

From a workers standpoint, Foxconn is similar to other factory assembly jobs around the world. From a management standpoint… They can gear up and put 30,000 new employees online in less than 3 months. That’s not going to happen in the US or Europe. In other words, only a fool would think Foxconn is branching out to the US.

As I read a few years ago, Foxconn and less-knowns operate like instant company towns. Workers are almost migrant labor, drawn in from small towns and true rural. Log in to Reply jam says: March 5, 2017 at 3:37 pm Good post but to be fair the suicide rate among Foxconn employees is well below the average for the Chinese population as a whole. Yeah, when you make inaccurate comparisons lots of things seem reasonable. Foxconn employees are all employed (by definition) and much younger than the middle-aged and older people who commit most suicide in China (a pattern found worldwide). From a workers standpoint, Foxconn is similar to other factory assembly jobs around the world. Which is why they require employees to sign documents like: Should any injury or death arise for which Foxconn cannot be held accountable (including suicides and self-mutilation), I hereby agree to hand over the case to the company’s legal and regulatory procedures. I myself and my family members will not seek extra compensation above that required by the law so that the company’s reputation would not be ruined and its operation remains stable Log in to Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Each year, developers and aspiring game creators flock to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco like they are going to the well. It’s inspiring, and it widens their horizons. It has the same effect on me, as a game journalist. Each year, there are some unforgettable moments. And here are some that made an impression on me during the past week. #1ReasonToBe This session was, sadly, the only panel that I attended in full during the show. (GDC has become more about press events and game demo appointments and interviews for me, which is a little more corporate and less serendipitous for me). But I chose wisely in attending this session about diversity. Organized by Rami Ismail of Vlambeer, this session was about geographic diversity. Rasheed Abueideh started it out by saying he is from a place that doesn’t show up on Google Maps. What is it like if you come from a place where you do not want to put your name in a game’s credits? Abueideh said he is from Palestine, which he spelled P@L!$T!NE. “It has been suffering from occupation for 69 years,” he said. As he said that, I thought he was going to go into a political rant about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But he didn’t do that. He showed a sense of humor and humanity in his presentation, and that made it very moving. Above: An image from Palestine. Image Credit: Rasheed Abueideh “The Palestinian people love playing games,” he said. Then he showed a picture of giant, real slingshot, saying, “This is how we play Angry Birds.” He showed himself taking a selfie at a checkpoint where people were queued like cattle. He said, “This is Papers, Please,” referring to the award-winning game about a border control agent. But he added, “They don’t say please.” He said he wanted to make games early on but it was under very difficult conditions. He said the country doesn’t have access to 3G networks because “we don’t have permission.” There is no access to funding. He started a game division in his company, but it shut down for lack of money. No one comes to visit from the outside world to court developers. “We are isolated,” he said. “No one comes to us.” When the Gaza war broke out in 2014, Abueideh said he imagined what would happen if his kids were killed in that war. He said there were many such deaths in real life. His team banded together and made a game, Liyla & the Shadows of War. “How do we make games if we are living as survivors?” he said. Above: Liyla & The Shadows of War. Image Credit: Rasheed Abueideh They sent it to the app store, and it was rejected because it was based on a “political statement.” Apple is skittish about publishing anything that is controversial. There were some false reports that the game was made by the Islamic State. “By the way, I am not ISIS,” Abueideh said. He said this community, this industry, was amazing, and he got support from around the world. The game was eventually approved, and it got 700,000 downloads on both platforms. The title wasn’t particularly polished, but it made a point about children in war. When he told his father what he was doing, his father replied, “My son, you will end up in jail.” He said his wife was terrified as well. She said she advised him not to put his name on the game after he had worked on it for two years. “I am honored to be here, but I am not happy,” he said. Abueideh said his No. 1 reason to be in the game industry was to make games that could stop wars and stop more children from being killed. The game did go out with his name in the credits. He got a standing ovation. Politics at the game awards Above: Nina Freeman at the IGF Awards. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi In some ways, I was surprised that Abueideh was allowed to travel to the U.S. for the talk. President Donald Trump’s travel ban isn’t as sweeping as you might expect. You could say that politics has no place in a place like the GDC, which celebrates games. And that was the attitude that I found prevailed at the DICE Summit and DICE Awards. But at the Game Developers Choice Awards, Trump’s travel ban was fair game. Nina Freeman, a game developer and host of the Independent Games Festival Awards, drew her loudest applause of the night on Wednesday as she expressed sympathy for those “affected by the Muslim travel ban.” A number of game developers said they could no longer travel to the U.S. for the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco because of the travel ban. Thousands of people applauded in the audience. Behind me, one table stood up and shouted, “Fuck Trump,” over and over. Her outspoken comment was a contrast to the DICE Awards, where none of the recipients mentioned Trump or the travel ban. “I urge you to donate to the ACLU,” Freeman said. Were all of the developers against Trump? No. I had a two-hour conversation with a CEO who felt that the left was going to far in comparing Trump to Hitler, who was a terrorist of the first order before he took office. GDC Ambassador Award After Nina Freeman spoke, Mark DeLoura, the former White House adviser on digital media, received the Ambassador Award for his work making government and the wider population more aware of games and the good impact that can come from being a gamer or game developer. Above: Mark DeLoura, former White House adviser on digital media. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi DeLoura was an advocate for the understanding the game industry in the federal government, and he made it clear that he believes games can be a force for social good during his acceptance speech at the awards show. DeLoura said, “People at the White House knew me as the guy with the big fat Pikachu at my desk.” Among his accomplishments: He organized the first game jam at the White House. In his acceptance speech, DeLoura praised the diversity of skills and creative inspiration that drives game developers to create original works of art. He said praised how games help give voices to everyone, including “the voices of women, gay and transgender individuals, underrepresented minorities, veterans, the elderly, the homeless, and, of course, immigrants and refugees.” He admired games like 1979 Revolution, That Dragon Cancer, We are Chicago, Never Alone, and Paolo Pedercini’s great web games such as Unmanned. Yet so many of us are building our next shooter, our next 4X, our next match-three….And those are great games, we love those games, billions of people love those games. Bigly. Nobody loves them more than I do. It’s true. But if we think that games can be more, do more, have a broader impact – and we’ve seen great examples of that – isn’t it incumbent upon all of us, in this room, to drive that? If we don’t stand up for the rights of others, we’ll never hear their voices. If we don’t make games easier to build, we’ll never see the amazing innovation of people using them in new ways. If we don’t start by using our own voice… how can we possibly show others the way? By putting our own hearts out there. Our own passion out there. Taking risks.” These are difficult times for many. We have unique skills that we can use to help. How are you using your unique abilities — your superpowers, making games — to share with the world your perspective? How are you taking risks to use games in new ways? How are you helping raise the voices of others? If you do that, you will change things. You will change the world. Through games. So please. We need your expertise. We need your voice. Start today. Qualcomm’s VR headset prototype Above: Dean Takahashi tries out the Qualcomm VR headset at GDC 2017. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Yes, GDC wasn’t all about politics. It had cool technology as well. I saw Qualcomm’s prototype virtual reality headset with stand-alone wireless functionality. This headset, which Qualcomm vice president Tim Leland showed me and is intended for developers, had no wires connecting it to a PC. Rather, it had Wi-Fi built into a Snapdragon 820 processor. (The real version coming this year will use the more recent Snapdragon 835). That made it smaller and less bulky than existing headsets like the HTC Vive. And to reiterate, you don’t hook the headset to a PC. All of the processing power and wireless connectivity is built into what will be an ARM-based Snapdragon processor in the headset itself. It was battery-powered, but I didn’t get any details on the type or how long the battery lasts. It also had a somewhat-large bar in front of the eyes with a couple of sensors, as part of its inside-out sensing design. (Inside-out means the sensors are on the headset, not on devices set up around the room). Above: Tim Leland of Qualcomm’s shows off wireless VR headset. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Those sensors were able to detect my hands and the movements of my 10 fingers. It used controller-freehand tracking from Leap Motion. That meant I didn’t have to hold a touch controller in my hands. The headset ran Leap Motion’s demo software. With it, I was able to pick up and create blocks. I could toss them around, and look at my fingers in virtual reality. The resolution was good, though the tracking wasn’t absolutely precise. It was still a little hard to pick up objects, but mainly because I had no force feedback, or sense of touch, that told me when I had touched a block. The Leap Motion software has been integrated into Qualcomm’s reference design kit that other companies can take and put their brand names on, if they wish. Leland said hand-tracking is opitonal for other companies to include, but the sensor for it isn’t that expensive. It adds very little weight, and so including it is kind of a no brainer for hardware companies. The Qualcomm headset was smaller than Intel’s own prototype, dubbed Project Alloy. That device has the capability of a high-end laptop, with the ability to run VR apps at 90 frames per second. The Snapdragon 835 is also powerful, but I don’t know what kind of performance it will have. Qualcomm’s device was also much lighter, and not so heavy on the head. The developer headset had a four-megapixel (2560×1440) WQHD AMOLED display (two megapixels per eye) and six degrees of freedom (6DoF) motion tracking. It had two monochromatic, one mega pixel (1280×800) global shutter cameras. It had four gigabytes of LPDDR$ DRAM memory and 64 gigabytes of Flash UFS. It used wireless with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB3.1 type C (power). For audio, it had Qualcomm Aqstic audio codec (WCD9335), and for I/O it also had a trackpad on the right side of the headset. The best thing about this prototype is that it told me that the second generation of VR hardware isn’t so far away. That’s a good thing, because the first generation hasn’t gotten enough traction to sustain a large number of VR startups and game companies. Epic’s real-time reskinning of a race car Above: The Mill’s Blackbird is a car that can be reskinned with game animations. Image Credit: Epic Games Epic Games, visual creation company The Mill, and car maker Chevrolet showed a new tool for filmmakers that blends artificial reality and the real world. It was one more step on the way to a mixed reality where we can’t tell the difference between what is animated and what is real. The demo showed how Chevy and visual production firm The Mill used the Unreal game engine to blend an animated car in real-time into a video that will be part of a television advertising campaign. The film makes use of The Mill’s special adjustable car, dubbed the Blackbird. The race car has QR codes and markers that allow it to be used as a template for digital animations. It also has a 360-degree camera. Filmmakers shot video of a real car and the Blackbird racing on a mountain road. Then, in real-time, the animators covered the car with digital animations that transformed it into another sleek race car. As they shot the Blackbird, the filmmakers could see through a viewfinder what the finished animated car would look like in the scene. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney (who will be a speaker at our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event in May) said in an interview with GamesBeat that the creators used an advanced implementation of Epic’s Unreal Engine with The Mill’s proprietary virtual production toolkit, Mill Cyclops, to create a film that merges real-time visual effects and live-action storytelling. “This is a way to bring down the costs of animation,” Sweeney said. “Brands can’t always have a car on the set. Sometimes that’s due to security reasons. We had to find a way to visualize a car that wasn’t there. So we created a virtual car using the Blackbird. We used the Blackbird in shoots and then skinned it with a computer-generated car.” In the ad campaign, “The Human Race” is about a real-life car driver’s battle with an artificial intelligence being that drives a car without human control. The film features the 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 in a heated race with the Chevrolet FNR autonomous concept car. “This sounded crazy, but we figured out how to do this in real-time,” said Kim Libreri, CTO, Epic Games, in an interview. “It’s real-time visual effects. We generate cars, composite them, and put them in a video. This looks like it went through months of post-production processing. In reality, it is rendered in real-time.” Sweeney said, “The question here is can your game engine produce pixels that match the real world.” The only physical vehicle filmed for “The Human Race” was the Mill Blackbird, a fully adjustable rig that enables filmmakers to insert any car model into any filed environment. Until now, computer-animated cars were added by visual effects artists in post-production, requiring days of rendering to produce high-quality imagery. During this shoot, however, live video feeds as well as positional data from the tracking system were fed directly into Unreal Engine. The Camaro was then rendered and composited seamlessly into the footage in real-time AR, allowing the directors to instantly see the final look and composition of each shot. Above: These cars have been reskinned in real-time. Image Credit: Epic Games The same real-time technology was used to create, alter and produce the short film, blurring the lines between production and post. The ability to create ‘final pixels’ in real time will ultimately change the way filmmakers create content and make critical decisions, Sweeney said. Alistair Thompson, executive vice president at The Mill, said at Epic’s event that his company created Blackbird because it couldn’t get access to a car that it needed to shoot a commercial. Chevy’s commercial creators, however, need to be able to see the animated car as they shoot a scene through a viewfinder. On stage, Epic, Chevy, and The Mill showed how they could present an animated car onscreen simultaneously as the Blackbird was being filmed in front of the crowd. Sweeney said, “This technology is changing the economics of entire industries.” Sweeney also showed how you could use virtual reality to design a game, from inside the game. The Unreal Engine VR editor is a full editing tool that lets you build an entire level of a game from inside virtual reality. It’s a bit like building a full game scene by snapping together Lego bricks and then twisting them into the right shape with your hands, the way a real artist does.

Show Caption of Expand By Rachel Uranga, Southern California News Group | PUBLISHED: March 5, 2017 at 7:11 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 8:15 am For decades, trucking has provided big-rig driver Frank Mora and his family a decent living. He doesn’t expect that will last forever. Most major truck manufacturers and several well-funded startups are busy testing automated or driver-free vehicles. Test models of cars that will shoosh passengers around town without a human at the wheel have attracted much media attention. But it’s apparent that when driverless vehicles hit the road for real, they’ll be driven by commerce, and that means trucks will likely lead the pack. Mora, whose family has been in the trucking business for three decades, said he can easily understand the appeal of a machine that can be run 24 hours a day, without forced breaks for rest and with less labor. The technology is already out there. From completely driverless big rigs to platooned trucks that could be manned by a single driver and eventually automated, the testing is underway. “Sure, as an owner I could save a lot of money on wages,” he said. “As to whether I think it’s safer, it’s too soon to tell. I am sure that there are … maneuvers that only humans can do.” Success for the technology could summon a seismic shift for California’s 218,000 truck and delivery drivers – 2.5 million across the nation – according to the latest count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “This is not the far future,” said Xiao Yun Lu, a research engineer at Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology (PATH) at UC Berkeley. “This is the near future.” The economy churns on the goods truckers carry to markets, retail stores and, increasingly, directly to consumers. Many believe automation can make the business safer, cut operator costs and address intermittent shortages of truck drivers. “There is a very strong commercial motivation,” said Steven Shladover, a research engineer and manager at PATH. “(Trucks) are out there on the road all day and every day, unlike passenger vehicles which are parked 95 percent of the time. When people buy trucks, they are looking for a return on the investment.” For truckers like Mora, life will change. “There is nothing we can do to stop it or change it,” said 28-year-old driver Mora, who spent much of his childhood inside the cab of an 18-wheeler. “But with change, there is always opportunity.” Platoons lead the pack It’s already happening. . Otto, a subsidiary of Uber, tested an automated truck with a 120-mile beer run across Colorado last year. . Freightliner, a truck produced by Daimler Trucks North America, glided across the Hoover Dam in 2015. . Startup Starsky Robotics last week announced it is testing a kit for trucks that will allow big rigs to drive alone on highways, remotely controlled. While self-driving cars offer the prospect of making roads safer and reducing traffic, these hulking trucks promise commercial benefits that could hasten their development. “Platoons” could lead the pack. Volvo Trucks was one of six truck manufacturers that last year rolled out partially automated big rigs across Europe so regulators could test their ability to safely caravan. The testing went smoothly, but in Europe, as in the United States, regulators are still grappling with how to handle vehicles that soon won’t need humans. The technology, known as platooning, allows two or more cargo trucks to ride in tandem, talking to one another. It’s considered one of the lowest levels of automation, including some simple features already known to drivers of luxury vehicles, such as automated braking. Analysts believe platoons have the potential to come to market quicker because of fewer regulatory hurdles. Already several states have adopted legislation allowing variations. What’s the hurry? Savings. Platooned trucks drive tightly together, cutting as much as 20 percent in fuel costs, by some estimates. And one of trucking companies’ biggest expenses is what goes in the tank, according to an American Transportation Research Institute. Can these packs of trucks maneuver successfully without help from human hands? That’s one question Caltrans officials will be looking at when they oversee a federally backed test of a three-truck Volvo platoon, starting Wednesday. It will be the first time platoon driving will be tried in Southern California. The trial will focus on how safe these vehicles can be with other cars weaving in and out around them. “These trucks are not going to be taking away jobs,” said Aravind Kailas, a U.S.-based technology planner at Volvo. “It’s targeting safety to get on the road.” In the trials, drivers will sit behind the wheels of three 53-foot Volvo big-rig trucks. All will steer the vehicles, but the second and third driver won’t touch the gas or break pedal. The test will be similar to the drill staged in Rotterdam but with a much shorter route, along the 110 Freeway to the Port of Los Angeles, where hundreds of cargo-loading trucks stream in and out of daily. They will communicate through a complex system of radar, cameras and Wi-Fi. “What you are achieving when these trucks talk to one another is the ability to brake synchronously at the same time,” Kailas said. “If the first truck brakes, the second and third truck brake at the same time.” This won’t be a test for speed. None of the trucks will travel faster than 55 mph. “The No. 1 thing we want to show,” Kailas said, “is that this is a technology that is targeting safety,” Anxiety at the wheel “Everything is pretty much possible,” said Wokil Hayder, director of autonomous and automated driving for Volvo Trucks in Sweden, “but whether you want to do it is another thing.” As the technology barrels forward, some anxiety is evident among regulators and consumers alike. While a Consumer Technology Association poll found 70 percent of 2,001 people surveyed ready to test out an autonomous vehicle, a University of Michigan poll revealed less than 16 percent were willing to let the machines completely take over. California, where many of the startups pursuing the technology call home, has been slow to adopt autonomous vehicle regulations, while Michigan, home to the auto industry, has shot ahead. Headlines from last summer could stoke anxiety, too. The death of a man driving a Tesla Model S car in autopilot mode renewed concerns about the technology. After an investigation, U.S. regulators, however, found no evidence of defects. CEO Elon Musk, who operates a Tesla design center in Hawthorne as well as the SpaceX rocket-building facility, applauded the decision. What needs to happen before these vehicles are fully deployed is a “mind-set change,” Hayder said. Motorists may fear sharing the road with “heavy, long big trucks” without drivers. But the long-range goal is to make robot-powered trucks safer than their human-steered counterparts. “We have a huge opportunity,” said Marques McCammon, general manager for connected vehicle solutions at Wind River, a subsidiary of Intel that has been developing software for self-driving vehicles. Smart vehicles, with more electronic eyes than humans, will have a greater ability to sense obstacles or other danger. New, “smarter” road systems that communicate with vehicles could “change the paradigm,” he said. In 2015, 35,092 people died in car accidents, according to the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration. The agency estimates 94 percent of all accidents were caused by human error. “Think about what this could mean for safety alone,” McCammon said. How long? Experts disagree about just how long it will take to get driverless big rigs on the road and just how human-free they will ever be. Platooning, for example, is a long way from robots at the wheel. Shladover estimates it could be decades. “All the truck drivers are not going to lose their jobs,” he said, “and there are a lot of other crazy predictions floating around out there. A transportation system doesn’t change that quickly. It takes a long time for vehicle fleets to turn over. “Even when we got a government mandate that all new vehicles have to be equipped with seat belts, it took 11 years to get up to 90 percent of the vehicles (in compliance),” he added. But plenty of folks are more bullish. The head of Connecticut-based transportation and logistics company XPO told a conference of maritime professionals in Long Beach last week that he expects to see driver-free trucks “everywhere” in the next decade. And Noel Perry, an economist specializing in freight, said he expects to see driverless trucks come online in 10 years and for platooning to be operational by 2020. That could eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, with median pay about $40,000 for each, according to the Department of Labor. That notion doesn’t sit well with Sam Loesche, a lobbyist for the Teamsters union, which represents about 40,000 truck and delivery drivers nationwide. “You can never be in a situation where you automate jobs overnight and expect that to be the best interest of the country,” Loesche said. “I don’t think we have even seen technology that is proven and reliable. “These drivers are the face of business,” he said. “They interact on a day-to-day basis with customers and their relationship strengthens brands. I would say anyone who writes off the role of the working class in this country … does so at their own risk.” For Perry, the arrival of automated trucking is not a drama pitting jobs and families vs. a robotically enhanced bottom line. It’s simply where the business needs to be, he said. “It will mean trucking is cheaper and safer,” he said. Tags:  Self-driving cars Rachel Uranga, Southern California News Group Subscribe Today!
