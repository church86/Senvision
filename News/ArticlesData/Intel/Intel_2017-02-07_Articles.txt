Twitter After Ryzen, AMD has no immediate plan to purge its other PC chips AMD is repackaging its existing chips, from FX to Sempron, for mid-to low-end PCs Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 09 February, 2017 08:35 - - - - print email Comments An AMD Athlon or Sempron chip may not drum as much excitement as Ryzen, but loyalty has helped those brands stick around for more than a decade. So what happens to those and other PC processors, like the A-series and FX, when AMD's new Ryzen chips start flooding the market in March? AMD has said the first high-end desktop Ryzen chips will ship in March. For now, AMD plans to make no changes to its lineup of existing chips, a company spokesman said. Instead, the chips will be regrouped to focus on price-sensitive PC buyers. Ryzen-based PCs are expected to be priced at a premium, competing with Intel's top gaming CPUs. The FX chips will not go away once Ryzen arrives, and will be targeted toward budget gamers. The A-series chips -- which were targeted toward a wide range of laptops -- will be much like Intel's Core i3, i5 and Celeron and Pentium processors, which are also targeted at low-end to mid-range laptops and Chromebooks. Unified AM4 socket compatibility helps maintain existing chips and has provided an easy path to Zen-based PC chip upgrade, the spokesman said. For example, the AM4 socket supports Zen chips and the recent 7th Generation A-series chips. Expanding the PC chip lineup will help AMD compete with Intel, from the high-end to low end. AMD is already gaining in the PC market. AMD took x86 chip market share from Intel in 2016. AMD had a 13.6 percent market share in 2016, growing from a 12.7 percent share in 2015. Intel's share was 86.3 percent in 2016, dropping from 87.1 percent in 2015, according to Mercury Research. Strong laptop chip shipments in the second half of 2016 and an inventory purge in 2015 helped AMD grow its market share, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The most vulnerable AMD chips are Athlon and Sempron, which sit on the bottom rung of the company's chip lineup.  Some brands like Phenom have died, but Athlon and Sempron have shown amazing staying power thanks to brand loyalty from home PC builders in Asia, McCarron said. Those chips will be hard to discontinue overnight, McCarron said. "Intel dealt with that in Asia on Pentium. Once it is established, they can't go away," McCarron said. Chips like the Athlon X4 and FX-4300 -- which is cheap to manufacture -- will keep serving customers' needs and will stay in production for some time to come, McCarron said. Also, PC makers need low-end products to segment markets and maintain prices. The price of high-end FX chips helps set a minimum price for Ryzen chips. It also helps retain Ryzen as a high-margin product, which is important for AMD in its pursuit of higher profitability. The low-end chips will also help keep AMD's chip volume active and meet supply agreements. AMD has an agreement with GlobalFoundries to manufacture a certain number of chips each year. Low-end chips are also important to manufacturing. They help amortize manufacturing costs and provide a market for chips with minor defects. It's fairly common for chips to get defects during manufacturing, and those are repackaged into low-end parts. That helps reduce inventory and produces revenue from those chips. AMD can't say it is getting rid of older chips because that would damage partnerships with PC makers and OEMs, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "They can't displace the entire product portfolio over night," McGregor said. But at some point, AMD will have to figure out which ones to chuck. It's likely the chips that are more expensive to manufacture will get the boot. Some chips like high-end FX parts could get the boot as Ryzen chips expand into lower-end gaming PCs. A decision to drop expensive chips and retain cheaper ones would be a cost-saving measure to reduce the manufacturing overhead. "You'll see the transition over the next nine to 12 months to move everything over," McGregor said. AMD has also released Zen-based server chips to succeed the current Opteron server chips. The company has seemingly put the development of ARM-based server chips on hold, and few server makers are using Opteron chips now. AMD will continue making embedded chips, which are used in devices with life spans of up to 10 years. Join the TechWorld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Jessica Conditt, @JessConditt 02.08.17 in Business Comments 1447 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Intel Corporation Intel plans to complete Fab 42, a semiconductor factory in Chandler, Arizona, with an investment of more than $7 billion over the next three to four years. At its peak, the factory will employ about 3,000 process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians. Fab 42 will produce 7 nanometer chips and is "expected to be the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world" -- whatever that means. The announcement was made alongside President Donald Trump at the White House. Cameras even captured Intel CEO Brian Krzanich offering the President a gift and explaining how regulatory US tax policies have "disadvantaged" his business in the past. But, as New York Times technology reporter Farhad Manjoo and others on Twitter were quick to point out, Intel's investment in Fab 42 wasn't the result of new federal subsidies or credits. In fact, the factory, which was originally announced back in 2011 and largely completed by 2014 was put on hold not because of regulatory burden, but because of declining PC sales. In the interim Intel shifted manufacturing focus to existing facilities and waited for the market to recover. Now it appears Intel is ready to move forward with it's original plans of hiring roughly 3,000 new workers. But by using the oval office as a backdrop, it's clearly hoping to curry favor with the new president. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Intel isn't alone in using the president as a way to generate media interest in an existing business deal. In December, Trump gave Sprint a signal boost when he congratulated the company on its decision to bring 5,000 jobs to the United States. Despite Trump's attempts to take credit for the deal, it was in fact put together months before he was elected. Intel also isn't the only tech company making moves in Arizona -- most recently, Uber moved its fleet of custom, self-driving Volvo XC90 SUVs to the state after a tiff with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Update: This post has been updated to reflect additional context surrounding the completion of the Fab 42 facility.

Technology Intel Heeds President Trump's Call For U.S. Manufacturing Investment Top chipmaker Intel on Wednesday announced plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete a new high-volume semiconductor factory in Chandler, Ariz. (Intel) PATRICK SEITZ 2/08/2017 Reprints Top chipmaker Intel (INTC) on Wednesday announced plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete a new high-volume semiconductor factory in Chandler, Ariz. The announcement was made at the White House by U.S. President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. The new factory, called Fab 42, will produce next-generation 7-nanometer chips to be used in devices ranging from smartphones to data centers. Intel said Fab 42 will be "the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world." The completion of Fab 42 in three to four years is expected to create 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Factoring in the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory's operations, Fab 42 could create over 10,000 jobs in Arizona, Intel said in a news release. IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 81, meaning it has outperformed 81% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 19 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup. Intel stock was up a fraction, closing at 36.38, on the stock market today. Intel broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 37.44 buy point on Jan. 24. The stock climbed as high as 38.45 on Jan. 27, but then reversed. It now trades at its 50-day moving average. "Intel's business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore's law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on," Krzanich said in a statement. "This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry." The majority of Intel's manufacturing and R&D is in the U.S. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the U.S., while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, the company said.

The factory, called Fab 42, is expected to support more than 10,000 long-term jobs, with Intel employing 3,000 people directly. It’s the kind of investment that Trump promised he would bring to America all along the campaign trail. And the president immortalized the moment with a tweet. The only problem is, Intel’s investment seemingly has little to nothing to do with Trump. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 The Intel factory actually began in 2011; then-CEO Paul Otellini even gave President Obama a tour. Work on Fab 42 stopped in 2014, possibly because of slowing PC sales and Intel’s failure to make progress in mobile. (Intel said it didn’t need the additional manufacturing capacity.) Last year Krzanich announced a workforce reduction of 12,000 jobs citing a slowdown in PC demand. Intel now wants to complete this factory because it needs to manufacture its next generation of processors, which require new equipment to make. The company needs these chips in order to stay competitive with ascendant technologies like those from ARM, which dominates mobile. The fact that the $7 billion investment was announced today, when Trump is president, seems to be purely coincidental. Intel told CNBC that it’s receiving no federal incentives for the project, so it really seems like the Trump administration had no role in making this factory happen. That’s relevant for two reasons: for one, it’s yet another example of Trump getting credit for creating jobs when he in fact played no role; and two, it means that Intel is being pretty opportunistic. Intel is being pretty opportunistic By announcing this investment at the White House, Intel gets much more press than it otherwise would have — a “majority” of Intel’s manufacturing is already based in the US. It also manages to get on Trump’s good side. Intel may not be getting anything out of Trump right now, but it’s certainly hoping for regulatory changes in its favor. “From a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete,” Krzanich wrote in an email to Intel employees this morning. “That’s why we support the administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make US manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies.” So basically, Krzanich is hoping for tax cuts, looser regulations, and something like federal subsidies or a friendlier (cheaper) way to raise and spend cash. Asked for comment, an Intel spokesperson reiterated that the company’s manufacturing has always been primarily based in the US. “However, we certainly support policies that enable and sustain American innovation, and we are pleased to have this investment in our US advanced manufacturing capabilities recognized by the administration,” said William Moss, a spokesperson for Intel. Intel’s requests are all pretty typical for a major corporation. But the company is now very clearly in a situation where it’s trying to both get the best of Trump and Republican policies without putting off workers in the tech industry at large, who generally seem to be opposed to the president’s actions. Photo: Intel Krzanich deals with this explicitly in his email to Intel employees, framing it as an issue of engagement. “When we disagree, we don’t walk away,” he writes. “We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas, and other policies that are essential to innovation.” But Krzanich has sent mixed signals on Trump. Earlier this week, Intel signed onto a brief opposing Trump’s immigration plan — it hasn’t, however, been particularly outspoken in condemning it. as a company co-founded by an immigrant, we support lawful immigration. We will provide impacted employees with Intel's full support— Brian Krzanich (@bkrunner) January 29, 2017 While Krzanich said he wouldn’t throw support behind either presidential candidate last year, he planned a fundraiser for Trump shortly after the nomination was locked in. When attention was drawn to the event, Krzanich canceled it, saying he intended it to be “a conversation,” not a fundraiser. Intel isn’t the only company in this position. Trump has gotten a bunch of tech CEOs into a room together to talk policy, and he has a regular meeting set up with industry leaders like Elon Musk. In many cases, these leaders find themselves in opposition to Trump’s policies but are trying to use his interest to find common ground. Tacitly giving Trump credit for a $7 billion investment on a new factory may be a good political move for Intel, but it also shows the limits of its opposition. Given the chance, it’ll take the photo op. Update February 8th, 7:40PM ET: This story has been updated with comment from Intel.

"And I think it's an abuse of the office of the presidency. He's putting the bully in the bully pulpit." ADVERTISEMENT Trump on Wednesday criticized the department store chain after it said last week it would no longer carry Ivanka Trump’s line. "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Trump wrote on Twitter using his personal @realDonaldTrump account.  That tweet was later shared by the official @POTUS account. Eisen, who has criticized Trump for his business dealings, said Nordstrom now has a “cause of action” against the president for his comments. "To attack this company on dubious factual assertions in order to promote his daughter, whatever degree of separation she has, we still don't know if Donald Trump himself is invested in those businesses,” he said. “And it's just the latest in a series of these entanglements." White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended Trump's tweet later in the day Wednesday, claiming that the company was "targeting" Ivanka Trump for political reasons. "When it comes to his family, he’ll be clear about how proud he is and what they’ve accomplished. For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is not acceptable and the president has every right as a father to stand up for them," Spicer said. Nordstrom reiterated that its decision was "based on performance" of Trump's brand. "Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now," a Nordstrom spokesperson said in a statement. The spokesperson added that the company has had a "great relationship" with Trump's team, adding that "Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January."

The reason? To show support of the administration's "policies to level the global playing field," especially when it comes to taxes, CEO Brian Krzanich told employees in a company email. "From a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete," the email said. "That's why we support the [a]dministration's policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies." The factory is not new — it has been in the works for several years, Krzanich said, and was even used by the Obama administration "as a symbol of the future of U.S. manufacturing," before falling vacant, The Arizona Republic reported. Here's what President Barack Obama said at Intel's construction site for the factory in 2012: "We have a huge opportunity to create more high-tech manufacturing jobs in the United States, and bring some of these jobs back from overseas. But we're going to have to seize the moment. That starts with changing our tax system." But the new $7 billion investment to finish the factory reflects support of new policies, Krzanich told reporters on Wednesday. It also reflects the pressure to make smaller, faster chips despite scientific challenges, a principle that "marches on" for the company's business, he said. "We've held off doing this investment until now," Krzanich told reporters at the announcement. "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward. That will really make it advantageous to do it in the U.S." There will be no incentives from the federal government for the Intel project, the White House said. "Brian called a few weeks ago and said, 'We want to do a big announcement,'" President Donald Trump said at the Wednesday announcement. show chapters Intel CEO announces new investment in the US    Wednesday, 8 Feb 2017 | 1:10 PM ET | 00:48 The factory will eventually employ about 3,000 and support about 10,000 jobs, Intel said. But when asked if Intel would bring back jobs from overseas, Krzanich replied, "This is about expansion — new jobs in the U.S." Intel has drawn fire from both political sides for some of its actions. It has been criticized in conservative publications such as Breitbart for laying off thousands of staffers, while simultaneously supporting legislation that would increase the number of foreign worker visas granted each year. Krzanich was also reportedly planning a fundraiser for Trump during the campaign season —which he later canceled. Neil Campling, senior vice-president and head of global TMT research at Northern Trust Securities, said there will be "massive" technical challenges for Intel to make the chip plant a reality. "Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about [Trump]," Campling wrote in a note. "In this industry, talk is cheap until the production ramps. It is safer/more logical to focus on the companies who follow through with clear strategic plans." Still, Intel's email to employees said, "When we disagree, we don't walk away." Here's the full email: Today I was proud to represent Intel at the White House, where we announced that Intel is investing $7b illion to complete a manufacturing facility that will produce the most advanced computer chips in the world. Fab 42 will create about 3,000 full-time Intel jobs and more than 10,000 jobs in Arizona to run and support the factory. Fab 42 is an investment in our own future and will help ensure that the United States remains the global leader in the semiconductor industry. The 7 nanometer (nm) chips that we're targeting for this factory — the smallest, most powerful and efficient ever — will power state-of-the-art computers, data centers, and other high-tech devices. They will enable amazing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, automated driving, medical research and treatment, and the factories of the future. I would like to take some time to answer some of the questions that are probably on your mind about this investment and the timing. The first question that may come to mind is "why now?" The answer is relatively simple. Intel's business continues to grow, and investment in capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore's Law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations we love and depend on. Leading-edge technologies like 7 nm require an increasing amount of factory space per wafer. These two factors have driven Intel to a point where we must get to work and build out another factory for 7 nm capacity. These state-of-the-art factories take a couple of years to build out capacity and begin the start-up process. As a result, we made the decision to start the process now. We are excited to begin this journey to build the world's most advanced and complex factory producing Intel's 7 nm technology. The second question is why did we choose to do this announcement at the White House? Intel is proud of the fact that the majority of our wafer manufacturing and R&D is based in the United States. This is due to the great infrastructure we have at our U.S. sites, our talented and highly skilled workforce and the proximity to our R&D facilities in Oregon. We've maintained this U.S.-based manufacturing even though approximately 80 percent of our product is sold outside the United States—we're one of the top 5 exporters and top 2 R&D spenders in the U.S.—and despite the fact that from a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete. That's why we support the Administration's policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies. Government policies play a critical role in enabling and sustaining American-driven innovation. At Intel we meet with governments from around the world, discussing and debating issues and policies important to our business, employees and shareholders. When we disagree, we don't walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation. We are an American innovation company that drives growth and opportunity in the United States and in every corner of the world. I hope you join me in being proud that Intel, the largest and most advanced semiconductor company in the world, continues to invest and invent to push the boundaries of technology. I also hope you will join me and several members of my team for an employee open forum and webcast on Thursday. We look forward to discussing this announcement with you in more detail and answering your questions. Others predict the future. At Intel, we build it. Today's announcement is the latest exciting chapter in our almost 50-year story of innovation that is changing the world. Brian — CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | February 8, 2017 -- 21:17 GMT (13:17 PST) | Topic: Hardware Image: Intel Intel said Wednesday it plans to invest $7 billion in the construction of its R&D factory in Arizona where it will produce its new 7 nanometer semiconductors. Cloud TV These business leaders are embracing cloud services See how the cloud is disrupting traditional operating models for IT departments and entire organizations. Read More Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the Fab 42 factory, which has been under construction intermittently since 2011, will help preserve the future of Moore's Law while preserving Intel's position as the global leader of the semiconductor industry. The plant is expected to create 3,000 full-time jobs within Intel once it is completed in three to four years. The chips made on the 7 nm process are used within data centers, sensors and other devices, as well as technology systems for artificial intelligence, automated driving and medical research. "These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore's Law," Intel wrote in a press release. Intel first announced plans for the Fab 42 factory in 2011 in conjunction with the Obama administration's jobs initiative. Construction of the factory was supposed to be completed by 2013, but eventually stalled due to shrinking chip demand. It's unclear if the $7 billion investment revealed today is on top of the $5 billion Intel said it would invest six years ago. Intel currently builds most of its chips in factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico.

CEO Krzanich, speaking Wednesday at a briefing in the Oval Office, called the investment an expansion of Intel’s presence in Chandler that will enable a plant capable of advanced 7-nanometer chip production. The partially built Fab 42 facility will be completed in 3 to 4 years and create about 3,000 company jobs, Intel said in a statement following the meeting at the White House. Intel builds most of its chips in the US at factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico. It also has plants in Ireland, Israel and China as well as test and assembly facilities in China, Malaysia and Vietnam. The iconic chipmaker, one of the founding companies of California’s Silicon Valley, has held onto its 15% market-leading slice of the $300-B chip industry through outspending rivals on research, development and plants over the years. The Santa Clara, California-based company said last month it plans to boost spending in Y 2017 on new plants and equipment to about $12-B, an increase of about $2-B from last year. Intel has about 106,000 employees around the world. The Arizona investment means innovation and jobs for Americans.

By JohnD. McKinnon TedGreenwald RebeccaBallhaus WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Intel Corp. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich on Wednesday announced plans for a $7 billion investment in a major manufacturing facility in Arizona. The announcement was the latest in a series of events by Trump touting his job-creation efforts, and gave the president an opportunity to reframe his relationship with the high-tech sector after a round of criticism from Silicon Valley over his recent immigration order. Intel Announces $7 Billion Investment in Arizona Plant(2:17) During a meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced plans to invest $7 billion in a major semiconductor manufacturing facility in Arizona that will employ 3,000 people. Photo: Reuters A White House official described the planned Intel facility as “the most advanced semiconductor facility in the world.” It will provide 3,000 high-skill manufacturing jobs, officials said. Intel’s INTC, -0.34%   new plans involve opening a manufacturing plant at an existing facility in the Phoenix area. The factory, known as Fab 42, was largely completed several years ago but never put in service, executives said. That facility drew praise from then-President Barack Obama in 2012 for its potential to bring more manufacturing jobs to the U.S. But the company announced in 2014 the plant wouldn’t be opening after all amid changing market conditions. Since then, Intel had already started increasing its overall investment again. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut disclosed the comments from Judge Neil Gorsuch after meeting with the nominee Wednesday. Trump referred to a Seattle judge who put a stay on his immigrant travel ban as a "so-called judge." Gorsuch's confirmation team confirmed that Gorsuch was referring to that comment and described it as disheartening. Gorsuch is making the rounds in the Senate, drawing praise from Republicans but skepticism from many Democrats, including Blumenthal. ___ 4:30 p.m. Republican Sen. John McCain isn't budging from his assessment that the U.S. raid in Yemen wasn't a success after he was criticized by the White House. McCain says any operation where a $75 million airplane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, "cannot be labeled a success." His remarks came after White House spokesman Sean Spicer said anyone who questions the success of the Yemen operation is doing a "disservice" to the life of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. McCain recalled a failed 1970 mission to rescue U.S. service members held in North Vietnam. He says, "Any connection between success or failure and the heroism of men and women who serve, there is none." ___ 2:50 p.m. White House press secretary Sean Spicer says those who question the success of a deadly U.S. raid in Yemen are doing a "disservice" to the life of a Navy SEAL who was killed in the raid. The comments come after Arizona Sen. John McCain said Tuesday that he wouldn't describe the raid as a success, given the loss of American life. Spicer says the action taken in Yemen was a "huge success" and that any other characterization does a disservice to the life of Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who was killed in the assault. Innocent civilians, including children, were also killed in the raid. Three other U.S. service members were wounded. ___ 2:15 p.m. A White House spokesman says President Donald Trump was standing up for his daughter when he posted a tweet criticizing Nordstrom. Trump tweeted that Ivanka Trump was treated "so unfairly" by the department store, which decided to stop selling her clothing and accessory line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter." Spicer says Trump is president — and "for people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump's tweet. ___ 1:10 p.m. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is at the White House and bringing the kind of economic news that President Donald Trump likes to trumpet: a $7 billion investment in an Intel factory in Arizona. The CEO says in an Oval Office visit with Trump that Intel will be completing the factory and making "the most advanced" chips on the planet." The CEO says the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich says the announcement comes partly in response in part to Trump's tax and regulatory policies. Trump calls the product that Intel will be making is "amazing." ___ 12 p.m. The U.S. military is looking to rent space at Trump Tower for use when President Donald Trump is working in New York City. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle says the Department of Defense is looking for the space "in order to meet official mission requirements." It's not immediately clear how much it would cost the Pentagon to rent space in the 58-story midtown Manhattan tower owned by the Trump Organization. Trump lives in the three-story penthouse. He hasn't returned to New York since taking office on Jan. 20. His wife, Melania, and their young son, Barron, are living there for now. It's customary for the military to obtain space near a president's residence. ___ 11:50 a.m. Organizations opposed to President Donald Trump's executive order on government regulations are suing to block it. The order required federal agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed or issued. The suit contends the order exceeds the president's constitutional authority — and directs agencies to unlawfully repeal rules intended to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the environment. Filing suit are Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, the Communications Workers of America and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ 11:25 a.m. President Donald Trump isn't happy about Nordstrom's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories — and he's tweeting his criticism. Trump says his daughter has "been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom." The president says she's "a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Nordstrom said last week that it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter's brand. Nordstrom hasn't immediately responded to an email seeking comment. Ivanka Trump has formally stepped down from her leadership role with the brand. ___ 9:57 a.m. President Donald Trump is promising "zero tolerance" for violence against law enforcement officers. He tells a group of police chiefs that his administration will give their departments the resources to recruit and retain officers. Trump also says "no one in America should be punished" simply for growing up in a place where violence may be prevalent. And as he has done before, he's singling out Chicago, saying the level of violence in the city cannot be allowed to continue. He says "we've allowed too many young lives to be claimed." When it comes to people who may be living illegally in the United States and involved in criminal activity, the president wants law enforcement and the public to report them to the Department of Homeland Security. In his words — "I want you to turn in the bad ones." ___ 9:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is asserting that had the right to enact his travel ban. He tells a group of police chiefs that his immigration order was "done for the security of our nation." He says the provision supporting the order was written "beautifully" and was within his executive authority. Trump says "a bad high school student would understand this." A federal judge has put the ban on hold, and an appeals court is considering an appeal from the Trump administration. The order includes a temporary travel ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. While awaiting a decision, Trump says "courts seem to be so political." ___ 7:55 a.m. President Donald Trump is expected to have lunch Thursday with a group of moderate Senate Democrats who could play a key role in his legislative agenda. The lunch is expected to include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana. Trump faces a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and hopes to secure some support among Democrats for his agenda and the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. All four Senate Democrats face re-election in 2018. The lunch was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by the Senate offices. The White House did not immediately provide details on the lunch, which is also expected to include Republican lawmakers. __ 7: 24 a.m. President Donald Trump is tweeting that if he loses the pending court case over his travel ban, the country "can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled." The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of Trump's executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on those from seven Muslim-majority countries. The appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but it also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. The president tweeted early Wednesday, "If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.

Andrew Cunningham - Feb 8, 2017 10:35 pm UTC Enlarge / Intel's uncompleted Fab 42 in Chandler, AZ. reader comments 98 Share this story Intel announced today that it would spend $7 billion to complete Fab 42, a factory in Chandler, Arizona that will eventually be used to build chips on Intel's 7nm manufacturing process. According to Intel's release, the facility will "directly create 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site" and that a further 7,000 jobs will be created indirectly to support the facility. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made the announcement at the White House with President Donald Trump; Krzanich briefly attracted controversy last summer when he canceled a Trump fundraising event. In an e-mail to Intel employees after the announcement (PDF), Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a show of support for "the Administration's policies to level the global playing field and make US manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies." Krzanich also noted that Intel is "one of the top five exporters and top two R&D spenders in the US—despite the fact that from a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete." Though Krzanich bemoans US taxes and regulations, it's also worth noting that US government restrictions make it more difficult for Intel to build cutting-edge chip manufacturing facilities outside of the United States in the first place. Under the terms of the Wassenaar Arrangement, Intel needs to get government approval before it can export manufacturing equipment capable of making anything smaller than 45nm chips (that number changes over time as manufacturing processes improve). This is one reason why Intel only has one factory in China and why that factory was making then-outdated 65nm chips when it opened in 2010. It's not that Intel can't build advanced chip factories outside of the US, but it does appear to be easier overall to keep the most advanced processes in the US. Further ReadingIntel closes AZ chip factory before it even opens Fab 42 was originally announced back in 2011, and then-President Obama spoke there back in 2012. At the time, Intel expected to build 14nm chips there, and it anticipated the facility would be completed at some point in 2013 (PDF). The main building was completed right down to its heating and air conditioning systems, but in 2014, Intel announced amid a downturn in PC sales that it would instead build 14nm chips at existing facilities in Oregon and Arizona. The 1,000 jobs that the facility was supposed to create instead went to those existing factories. Before today, Intel hadn't decisively commented on the facility's fate, but at the time of the cancellation, the company did say that the building would eventually be used. The original estimate of 1,000 directly created jobs may have increased to 3,000 because of the increased complexity of the 7nm process; Krzanich also notes that the 7nm process will require a greater amount of factory space per wafer. What's not clear is how many of those jobs might be offset by job cuts elsewhere—Intel announced plans to cut as many as 12,000 of its jobs worldwide in April of 2016, representing about 11 percent of its total workforce. Intel also didn't announce a timeline for hiring the new facility's employees. New manufacturing processes take years to get going, and Intel still has to start producing chips on its planned 10nm process before it gets around to making 7nm chips. The time it takes to migrate to a new manufacturing process has also increased since the turn of the decade, taking three or four years where it used to take around two. Fab 42 will be Intel's third manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona. Fab 12 opened in 1996, and as of 2011 or 2012 Intel said it would be producing 22nm chips there (PDF). Fab 32, opened in 2007, manufactures 22nm and 14nm chips. Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

PHOENIX (AP) - Chip-making giant Intel said it will finally complete a multi-billion dollar Arizona plant it announced during a visit by then-President Barack Obama to a company plant in Oregon in 2011. The announcement came Wednesday during a visit by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich with President Donald Trump at the White House. The Chandler plant was built and then left vacant by the Santa Clara, California-based company. It had touted the facility as a new $5 billion investment in Arizona that would bring 2,000-3,000 construction jobs to the state. State lawmakers said they expected about 1,000 permanent positions. The facility was left vacant after market conditions for the chips it planned to make there changed. Wednesday's announcement increased the investment amount to $7 billion, the total jobs to 10,000 with 3,000 being high-tech positions. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The mayor of Chandler simply calls it a win for his city where the plant is expected to generate thousands of jobs. (Feb. 8) AP Intel's fabrication plant 42 in Chandler, Arizona. (Photo: Intel Corp.) 374 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 46 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Intel CEO Brian Kraznich stood next to President Trump in the Oval Office Wednesday to announce that the chip maker would spend $7 billion to complete a mothballed plant in Chandler, Ariz. that was begun in 2011. The opening of the plant is part of Intel's overall pivot away from the PC market which has taken place over the past few years and is beginning to pay dividends, though some also saw a possible political tint to the timing. Fabrication plant 42 will produce microprocessors and will take between three and four years to come online, creating approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage jobs when it opens, Kraznich said. “It will be the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant on the planet,” said Stacy Smith, Intel’s head of sales and manufacturing. Intel originally built the plant in 2011-2012, when it spent $5 billion on the facility, but then made the decision not to complete it because of shifts in the semiconductor industry as the public turned away from PCs and towards tablets and smartphones. Shipments of PCs dropped 5.7% in 2016, according to IDC. Since then Intel has rebounded by pivoting to focus on the needs of cloud computing facilities and devices. Intel already has two other factories in Arizona. "Intel is very proud of the fact that a majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S., and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80% of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.," Krzanich said in the White House. The investments needed to create new chips is “enormous, so we have to start now in order to intercept demand that’s a few year’s out,” said Smith The decision to built out the plant in Chandler has nothing to do with the Trump Administration’s America first policies, said Gartner lead Intel analyst Mark Hung. “Traditionally, Intel’s leading-edge work has always been done in the United States,” he said. The plant will be using Intel’s 7-nanometer manufacturing process, a cutting-edge advanced process. “They needed to bite the bullet at some point to do it, and given that the plant’s new, it’s a good place for it,” Hung said. While the move is largely in line with Intel’s long term plans, there could well be an element of fortuitous timing to the announcement, said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. “Currently Intel has large amounts of cash overseas and the company employs a lot of highly-skilled works who use a lot of H-1B visas. These are items that the president is currently evaluating. So it’s a pretty advantageous time for Intel to be announcing the creation of 3,000 new jobs,” he said. Intel has made chips for personal computers in Chandler since the 1980s. It is the number one private employer in Arizona, Krzanich said.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) comments WASHINGTON — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times EST): 8:40 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has written Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) to wish the "Chinese people a happy Lantern Festival and prosperous Year of the Rooster." The White House says Trump wrote Xi to thank him for a congratulatory letter and to express his hopes of developing "a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China." Before taking office, Trump questioned the "one-China policy" that shifted U.S. recognition from self-governing Taiwan to China in 1979. He said it was open to negotiation. Trump also wants to pressure Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. ___ 6 p.m. First lady Melania Trump has named Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as White House social secretary, putting her at the helm of the White House's social events, state dinners and other high-profile gatherings. Mrs. Trump says Niceta Lloyd — who goes by Rickie — brings "solid diplomatic, political and social entertaining experience" to the job. The White House says Niceta Lloyd has worked with both Republicans and Democrats in planning events for the last five presidential inaugurations. She's also assisted the State Department's Office of Protocol with events with several secretaries of state. Mrs. Trump has yet to move to Washington, but she is starting to fill out her staff. She's said she plans to stay in New York while the president's 10-year-old son, Barro, finishes the school year. ___ 5:30 p.m. Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee has told a Democratic senator that he found the president's attacks on the judiciary "disheartening" and "demoralizing." Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut disclosed the comments from Judge Neil Gorsuch after meeting with the nominee Wednesday. Trump referred to a Seattle judge who put a stay on his immigrant travel ban as a "so-called judge." Gorsuch's confirmation team confirmed that Gorsuch was referring to that comment and described it as disheartening. Gorsuch is making the rounds in the Senate, drawing praise from Republicans but skepticism from many Democrats, including Blumenthal. ___ 4:30 p.m. Republican Sen. John McCain isn't budging from his assessment that the U.S. raid in Yemen wasn't a success after he was criticized by the White House. McCain says any operation where a $75 million airplane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, "cannot be labeled a success." His remarks came after White House spokesman Sean Spicer said anyone who questions the success of the Yemen operation is doing a "disservice" to the life of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. McCain recalled a failed 1970 mission to rescue U.S. service members held in North Vietnam. He says, "Any connection between success or failure and the heroism of men and women who serve, there is none." ___ 2:50 p.m. White House press secretary Sean Spicer says those who question the success of a deadly U.S. raid in Yemen are doing a "disservice" to the life of a Navy SEAL who was killed in the raid. The comments come after Arizona Sen. John McCain said Tuesday that he wouldn't describe the raid as a success, given the loss of American life. Spicer says the action taken in Yemen was a "huge success" and that any other characterization does a disservice to the life of Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who was killed in the assault. Innocent civilians, including children, were also killed in the raid. Three other U.S. service members were wounded. ___ 2:15 p.m. A White House spokesman says President Donald Trump was standing up for his daughter when he posted a tweet criticizing Nordstrom. Trump tweeted that Ivanka Trump was treated "so unfairly" by the department store, which decided to stop selling her clothing and accessory line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter." Spicer says Trump is president — and "for people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success."

Credit: Advanced Micro Devices More like this AMD sets up Ryzen chip for a strong start as battle with Intel looms AMD tries to drum up support for 32-core Zen server chip 5 burning questions about AMD's Zen chip Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana An AMD Athlon or Sempron chip may not drum as much excitement as Ryzen, but loyalty has helped those brands stick around for more than a decade. So what happens to those and other PC processors, like the A-series and FX, when AMD's new Ryzen chips start flooding the market in March? AMD has said the first high-end desktop Ryzen chips will ship in March. For now, AMD plans to make no changes to its lineup of existing chips, a company spokesman said. Instead, the chips will be regrouped to focus on price-sensitive PC buyers. Ryzen-based PCs are expected to be priced at a premium, competing with Intel's top gaming CPUs. The FX chips will not go away once Ryzen arrives, and will be targeted toward budget gamers. The A-series chips -- which were targeted toward a wide range of laptops -- will be much like Intel's Core i3, i5 and Celeron and Pentium processors, which are also targeted at low-end to mid-range laptops and Chromebooks. Unified AM4 socket compatibility helps maintain existing chips and has provided an easy path to Zen-based PC chip upgrade, the spokesman said. For example, the AM4 socket supports Zen chips and the recent 7th Generation A-series chips. Expanding the PC chip lineup will help AMD compete with Intel, from the high-end to low end. AMD is already gaining in the PC market. AMD took x86 chip market share from Intel in 2016. AMD had a 13.6 percent market share in 2016, growing from a 12.7 percent share in 2015. Intel's share was 86.3 percent in 2016, dropping from 87.1 percent in 2015, according to Mercury Research. Strong laptop chip shipments in the second half of 2016 and an inventory purge in 2015 helped AMD grow its market share, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The most vulnerable AMD chips are Athlon and Sempron, which sit on the bottom rung of the company's chip lineup.  Some brands like Phenom have died, but Athlon and Sempron have shown amazing staying power thanks to brand loyalty from home PC builders in Asia, McCarron said. Those chips will be hard to discontinue overnight, McCarron said. "Intel dealt with that in Asia on Pentium. Once it is established, they can't go away," McCarron said. Chips like the Athlon X4 and FX-4300 -- which is cheap to manufacture -- will keep serving customers' needs and will stay in production for some time to come, McCarron said. Also, PC makers need low-end products to segment markets and maintain prices. The price of high-end FX chips helps set a minimum price for Ryzen chips. It also helps retain Ryzen as a high-margin product, which is important for AMD in its pursuit of higher profitability. The low-end chips will also help keep AMD's chip volume active and meet supply agreements. AMD has an agreement with GlobalFoundries to manufacture a certain number of chips each year. Low-end chips are also important to manufacturing. They help amortize manufacturing costs and provide a market for chips with minor defects. It's fairly common for chips to get defects during manufacturing, and those are repackaged into low-end parts. That helps reduce inventory and produces revenue from those chips. AMD can't say it is getting rid of older chips because that would damage partnerships with PC makers and OEMs, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "They can't displace the entire product portfolio over night," McGregor said. But at some point, AMD will have to figure out which ones to chuck. It's likely the chips that are more expensive to manufacture will get the boot. Some chips like high-end FX parts could get the boot as Ryzen chips expand into lower-end gaming PCs. A decision to drop expensive chips and retain cheaper ones would be a cost-saving measure to reduce the manufacturing overhead. "You'll see the transition over the next nine to 12 months to move everything over," McGregor said. AMD has also released Zen-based server chips to succeed the current Opteron server chips. The company has seemingly put the development of ARM-based server chips on hold, and few server makers are using Opteron chips now. AMD will continue making embedded chips, which are used in devices with life spans of up to 10 years.

Sign up now Menu ARN Intel repeats Obama-era pledge to invest billions in a new factory Intel repeats Obama-era pledge to invest billions in a new factory In a meeting with Trump, Intel's CEO again says the company will invest billions to make Fab 42 and create jobs Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 09 February, 2017 07:02 - - - - print email Distributors BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Intel CEO Brian Krzanich's meeting with new U.S. president Donald Trump was followed by a big announcement: The company will invest US$7 billion over the next three to four years to complete a factory to make 7-nanometer chips. The completion of Fab 42 -- where the chips will be made -- will create about 3,000 jobs in the Chandler, Arizona, area, Intel said. The chipmaker expects to help create 10,000 jobs tied to supporting the activities of Fab 42. Trump has been pushing for more jobs in the U.S. and for bringing manufacturing back to the country. Making the announcement after meeting with Trump amplifies Intel's efforts to promote itself as a jobs creator. But just last year, the company laid off more than 12,000 employees to restructure operations. Also, this isn't the first time Intel has committed to creating jobs and investing billions to make Fab 42. It made a similar announcement in 2011 but then backed off. In February 2011, then-CEO Paul Otellini announced the company was investing $5 billion to complete Fab 42 to make 14-nm chips and create 4,000 jobs. That announcement was made during former President Barack Obama's visit to an Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. Intel slammed the breaks on that plan in 2014 to keep the space available "for unspecified future technology." The construction of Fab 42 began in 2011, but its completion was delayed, William Moss, an Intel spokesman, said in an email. "We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business," Moss said. In 2011, Intel announced the factory as it expected to grow its mobile device business. But Intel has now stopped making smartphone chips and is instead focusing on growth in the internet of things, server, automotive, and other markets. The White House hailed the completion of the factory as a positive development. Trump called the announcement a "great thing" for Arizona. "We're very happy, and I can tell you, the people of Arizona are very happy," he added. Intel's announcement is the latest in a "wave of economic optimism" since Trump took office, Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said later. Outside the U.S., Intel also operates factories in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Israel, and Ireland. Many of Intel's chip design takes place in Israel, and the company is making its latest Optane memory chips in Dalian, China. Intel regularly establishes new factories to create smaller, powerful and more power-efficient chips. The 7-nm factory is a big investment and could lead toward longer battery life to smaller devices. The 7-nm chips will be made for PCs, sensors, and other high-tech devices. The chips will "enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more," Krzanich said in an email to Intel's employees. Two weeks ago, Intel said it was establishing a pilot 7-nm plant to manufacture test chips. Intel currently ships 14-nm PC, server, and IoT chips, and is expected to start shipping its first 10-nm PC chips code-named Cannonlake by the end of the year. The announcement also gives a time frame for when Intel will make its first 7-nm chips. Intel will likely release three or more chip architectures on the 10-nm process, like it has with 14-nm, before switching over to 7-nm. The 7-nm could also introduce new tools like EUV (extreme ultraviolet), which will help make finer chips, and materials like gallium-nitride (GaN) in chips.

While Trump appeared to take credit for the plan, Intel called the investment an "update" of a 2011 plan to invest $5 billion for the same facility in the southeastern US state. An Intel spokesman said the initial plan had not been completed due to lack of demand, and that Wednesday's move represented a "new" investment of $7 billion. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (L) speaks following a meeting with US President Donald Trump (2nd L) in the Oval Office of the White House on February 8, 2017 ©MANDEL NGAN (AFP) It marked the latest in a string of such announcements since Trump began pressing companies to create more American jobs and reverse the trend of offshore manufacturing. "Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US," chief executive Brian Krzanich said at a White House event with Trump. The company said the Arizona plant would produce "the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet" and directly lead to 3,000 "high-tech, high-wage jobs" at Intel. With the indirect impact, the company said an estimated 10,000 jobs would result from the factory. Trump said Krzanich "called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced." He called the investment a "great thing for Arizona," and added, "it's a lot of jobs." Krzanich acknowledged that "we've been working on this factory for several years" but "held off actually doing this investment until now." Asked if the decision came in response to the new president's actions, he said, "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US." The announcement came in spite of a deepening rift between the new Trump administration and the tech sector over a White House order barring entry to refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Intel joined a group of over 120 tech and other firms backing a court challenge to the travel ban -- which is currently suspended. Tech companies have fiercely opposed the move, saying it would hurt the effort to hire and retain skilled employees from around the world and potentially break up families. The sector relies heavily on foreign-born scientists and engineers. Share or comment on this article e-mail 8 shares Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The factory will employ 3,000 people at its peak, Krzanich said. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP) President Trump met with Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of U.S.-based technology company Intel, on Wednesday to announce a $7 billion investment in an advanced computer chip factory in Chandler, Ariz. Speaking from the president’s side in the Oval Office, Krzanich said the facility, called Fab 42, would employ 3,000 people at its peak and indirectly create 10,000 jobs in the Arizona area in support of the factory. In remarks to the press, Trump called Intel a “great, great company” and a “great thing for Arizona.” "Brian called a few weeks ago and said 'We want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced,'" Trump said. In his remarks, Krzanich echoed the president’s broader economic message, of employing Americans and increasing exports rather than imports. “Intel is very proud of the fact that a majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S., and the majority of or research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.," Krzanich said. Krzanich said the company had decided to make the announcement in response to Trump's business-friendly policies on taxes and regulation. But some analysts raised the question of whether the company would have made the investment sooner or later. “This would have happened anyway. This was always part of their plan,” said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research in Phoenix. “But obviously the current administration and Intel are going to try to get some political gain out of it.” [Donald Trump’s plan to bring jobs back to America comes with one giant asterisk] McGregor said the announcement was a positive sign for Intel, but not a significant change in strategy or policy. He described Intel and other chipmakers as having a rotation cycle, in which they periodically update, build and shutter facilities. The Chandler facility has featured prominently in American politics before. A company executive originally announced the factory in February 2011, after giving a tour of Intel’s Hilsboro, Ore. plant to then-president Barack Obama. In Jan. 2012, Obama visited the Chandler construction site on a tour of potential swing states in the election later that year, using it as a backdrop for a speech in which he talked about a vision for an economy built on American manufacturing. “When this factory is finished, Intel will employ around 1,000 men and women,” Obama said. “As an American, I’m proud of companies like Intel, who create jobs here.” In 2014, Intel announced it would postpone the facility's opening amid decreased global demand for its products, the Oregonian reported at the time. For years, the factory has stood as an empty shell while Intel focused on other facilities. It's not clear when Intel ultimately planned to bring the Chandler facility online, but the company likely would have completed its investment in Chandler at some point, analysts said. Furthermore, as Intel invests in Arizona, it’s also likely to retire older facilities in other areas — including perhaps an aging factory in Rio Rancho, N.M., said McGregor. The Chandler facility will be completed in three to four years, Intel announced on Wednesday. In his remarks, Krzanich said Intel had been working on the factory for several years, but had “held off actually doing this investment until now.” In response to a question from the press, he said Intel had decided to make its announcement in support of the administration’s tax and regulatory policies that “really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” Krzanich also took aim at past government policies, saying that his company had been able to achieve its success despite regulatory and tax policies that “disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world.” “The president and the administration’s commitment to tax reform, smart regulation and deregulation and a general attitude of 'make it in America' has given them the confidence and the will to move forward,” said Reed Cordish, assistant to the president. [The places in America most exposed to a trade war] Pointing out that the product was high-tech, cutting-edge technology, Cordish added, “It’s a wonderful statement for where we’re heading, bringing manufacturing back to America, creating 21st century jobs in America and the feeling of optimism and confidence that CEOs all over the country are showing and a validation of the president’s policies and views.” Intel joined more than 100 companies to file a legal brief opposing Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order, which barred entrants to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries. In a letter to employees about the investment on Wednesday, Krzanich briefly mentioned the controversy. “When we disagree, we don’t walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation.”   Since Trump won the election, numerous companies have announced plans to create or retain jobs in the United States. Yet some analysts have charged that many of these plans were in the works before the election, or had come at significant cost to taxpayers. In November, air conditioning company Carrier announced it would keep hundreds of factory jobs in the United States that were slated to move to Mexico. While Trump celebrated the announcement as a win, later reporting revealed that Indiana had agreed to give the company up to $7 million in tax credits. In December, when Japanese corporate giant SoftBank announced it would invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new jobs, analysts said that those funds likely would have been destined for the United States anyway. Intel’s stock rose after the announcement but pared gains before the market closed. The stock ended the day up just 0.08 percent, underperforming overall gains by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. As sun streamed in the windows of the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump invited Krzanich to introduce Intel’s product. Krzanich held up a shiny, reflective wafer that would be built in the Chandler factory and repeated Intel’s slogan for the cameras. When asked if Intel would bring jobs back to the United States that are currently overseas, Krzanich did not directly answer the question, saying “this position is actually about growth and new jobs in the U.S.” Much of the company’s manufacturing is U.S.-based, though it also has facilities in Ireland, Israel and China.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Trumponomics Intel CEO touts $7 billion factory investment in Trump meeting by Seth Fiegerman   @sfiegerman February 8, 2017: 2:55 PM ET Trump meets with Intel CEO On Sunday, Intel told a court that it believed President Trump's immigration order was unconstitutional. On Wednesday, the CEO stood next to Trump in the White House and announced a $7 billion investment in a new U.S. factory. Intel (INTC, Tech30) CEO Brian Krzanich said the investment was "really in support of the tax and regulatory polices that we see the administration pushing forward," which he thinks will be beneficial to domestic manufacturing. The full story is more complicated. Intel previously announced a $5 billion investment in the same Arizona factory with former President Obama in 2011. That money was used to build the "shell" of the factory," but the project was left uncompleted due to a lack of "general demand for the product," according to William Moss, a spokesman for Intel. "We're making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect," Moss told CNNMoney. "That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration's pro business and pro investment goals." While standing by Trump in the Oval Office, Krzanich said the new computer chip factory "will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory." Trump introduced Krzanich as the CEO of a "great, great company" and stressed the positive impact the investment would have on Arizona jobs. Related: Trump sits down with top Silicon Valley execs The announcement comes just days after Intel joined more than 100 other companies in filing court papers declaring Trump's executive order on immigration to be unconstitutional. "As a company cofounded by an immigrant, we support lawful immigration," Krzanich wrote in a tweet after Trump's executive order imposing a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. "We will provide impacted employees with Intel's full support." In an email to employees on Wednesday, Krzanich noted the factory's value to Intel as well as the importance of engaging with governments around the world. "When we disagree, we don't walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation, Krzanich wrote in the memo, a copy of which was provided to CNNTech. Krzanich was one of about a dozen tech CEOs to meet with then President-elect Trump in December to talk about jobs, a centerpiece of Trump's campaign. Since then, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has announced plans to create 100,000 new jobs in the U.S. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) also pumped $1 billion into a massive technology fund from Japan's SoftBank Group, whose founder had previously committed to invest in U.S. hiring.

Trump was the second president to celebrate the computer chip maker's attempts to expand its domestic production at the same facility in Chandler, Arizona. In 2012, Obama went to the factory's construction site and celebrated that the plant would produce "some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth." President Donald Trump looks at Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, holding a silicon wafer, during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) "Let's stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas," Obama said at the time. "Let's reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America." But by 2014, however, Intel had pulled back from finishing the factory. The company said Wednesday that it expects to open the plant known as "Fab 42" within four years. "We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand," said William Moss, an Intel spokesman. "We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business." Like Obama, Trump declared it a win for workers. "We're very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy," Trump said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an Oval Office visit with Trump that the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly —and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich said he made the announcement from the White House because "it's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward." But Intel has not been a universal fan of Trump's policies. It was among the tech companies that filed a legal brief that challenged the president's 90-day ban on travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. The announcement comes as Intel has shed jobs. It announced last year that it planned to lay off 12,000 workers in a reorganization prompted by a decline in sales of personal computers. That was about 11 percent of the company's workers. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

So what happens to those and other PC processors, like the A-series and FX, when AMD's new Ryzen chips start flooding the market in March? AMD has said the first high-end desktop Ryzen chips will ship in March. For now, AMD plans to make no changes to its lineup of existing chips, a company spokesman said. Instead, the chips will be regrouped to focus on price-sensitive PC buyers. Ryzen-based PCs are expected to be priced at a premium, competing with Intel's top gaming CPUs. The FX chips will not go away once Ryzen arrives, and will be targeted toward budget gamers. The A-series chips -- which were targeted toward a wide range of laptops -- will be much like Intel's Core i3, i5 and Celeron and Pentium processors, which are also targeted at low-end to mid-range laptops and Chromebooks. Unified AM4 socket compatibility helps maintain existing chips and has provided an easy path to Zen-based PC chip upgrade, the spokesman said. For example, the AM4 socket supports Zen chips and the recent 7th Generation A-series chips. Expanding the PC chip lineup will help AMD compete with Intel, from the high-end to low end. AMD is already gaining in the PC market. AMD took x86 chip market share from Intel in 2016. AMD had a 13.6 percent market share in 2016, growing from a 12.7 percent share in 2015. Intel's share was 86.3 percent in 2016, dropping from 87.1 percent in 2015, according to Mercury Research. Strong laptop chip shipments in the second half of 2016 and an inventory purge in 2015 helped AMD grow its market share, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The most vulnerable AMD chips are Athlon and Sempron, which sit on the bottom rung of the company's chip lineup.  Some brands like Phenom have died, but Athlon and Sempron have shown amazing staying power thanks to brand loyalty from home PC builders in Asia, McCarron said. Those chips will be hard to discontinue overnight, McCarron said. "Intel dealt with that in Asia on Pentium. Once it is established, they can't go away," McCarron said. Chips like the Athlon X4 and FX-4300 -- which is cheap to manufacture -- will keep serving customers' needs and will stay in production for some time to come, McCarron said. Also, PC makers need low-end products to segment markets and maintain prices. The price of high-end FX chips helps set a minimum price for Ryzen chips. It also helps retain Ryzen as a high-margin product, which is important for AMD in its pursuit of higher profitability. The low-end chips will also help keep AMD's chip volume active and meet supply agreements. AMD has an agreement with GlobalFoundries to manufacture a certain number of chips each year. Low-end chips are also important to manufacturing. They help amortize manufacturing costs and provide a market for chips with minor defects. It's fairly common for chips to get defects during manufacturing, and those are repackaged into low-end parts. That helps reduce inventory and produces revenue from those chips. AMD can't say it is getting rid of older chips because that would damage partnerships with PC makers and OEMs, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "They can't displace the entire product portfolio over night," McGregor said. But at some point, AMD will have to figure out which ones to chuck. It's likely the chips that are more expensive to manufacture will get the boot. Some chips like high-end FX parts could get the boot as Ryzen chips expand into lower-end gaming PCs. A decision to drop expensive chips and retain cheaper ones would be a cost-saving measure to reduce the manufacturing overhead. "You'll see the transition over the next nine to 12 months to move everything over," McGregor said. AMD has also released Zen-based server chips to succeed the current Opteron server chips. The company has seemingly put the development of ARM-based server chips on hold, and few server makers are using Opteron chips now. AMD will continue making embedded chips, which are used in devices with life spans of up to 10 years. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

'Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst' Trump said in a tweet afterward. Construction on a plant at the site began during Barack Obama's first term and was abandoned in 2014 before it ever opened. Now Intel says plans to invest in new computing technology there, creating 3,000 jobs when it is up and running. More than 10,000 Arizonians will support the plant, Krzanich said. Scroll down for video  Intel Corp chose the Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a $7 billion investment in a new Arizona semiconductor factory today Trump said Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich noted that Intel has been working on the factory - its third in Arizona - for several years but held off on the investment until now.  He said he wanted to announce it at the White House as a sign of support for the 'tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.' The company said in a release that the plant would be completed in three or four years. In 2014, as Intel put off the opening of a chip factory at the site, a spokesman told Reuters, 'The new construction is going to be left vacant for now and it will be targeted at future technologies.' Obama had visited the Arizona factory in 2012 while campaigning for reelection. He pointed to it as an example of the potential the U.S. manufacturing industry had. Intel planned to make advanced microchips at the site but backed off the project after a 10 percent drop in global PC sales. 'Having hired tens of thousands of people himself, the president's keenly aware of what prevents businesses from being successful and creating jobs in the current economy,' White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.

Share this article Share Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich announced the investment to reporters while standing behind President Donald Trump, a signal of how corporate America is adapting to a White House that is not reluctant to single out companies for praise or criticism Spicer noted as he took a victory lap on behalf of the president that 'President Obama by contrast visited this same factory site, where this factory will be built, during his last reelection visit in 2012, touting the government incentives that was supposed to bring back jobs that had been lost to Asia. 'President Trump knows that for business the real government incentives is the government restraining itself,' he said. 'For too many years Washington has smothered industry in this country under burdens and regulation. This administration has set out to free businesses from constraints of government bureaucracy and regulation.' Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, campaigned on a promise to push for companies to keep or create jobs in the United States, rather than sending them abroad. Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power data centers and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.  Intel's Brian Krzanich (L) shakes hands with Gary Cohn (C), head of the National Economic Council and Reed Cordish, assistant for intragovernmental and technology initiatives.  Cordish told reporters that the announcement was the latest show of confidence from CEOs in this administration and a 'validation of the president's policies and views' 'Intel is very proud of the fact that a majority of our manufacturing is here in the US, and the majority of or research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US,' Krzanich said in remarks from the Oval Office. Trump told him, 'We're very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy.'  Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. But that issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives. Cordish told reporters that the announcement was the latest show of confidence from CEOs in this administration and a 'validation of the president's policies and views.' 'It's a wonderful statement for where we're heading, in terms of bringing manufacturing back to America,' he said.  The White House official said Intel contemplated the investment 'for over four years... even had tried to start' it, and they now 'have the confidence to proceed.' 'They've had this empty property for a long time. So the property's there, and now the will is there,' Cordish said.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 275 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Advertisement In what is being billed at the “most advanced semiconductor factory in the world,” Intel Corp. (IW 500/20) announced on February 8  plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete Fab 42. The high-volume factory is in Chandler, Ariz., and is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich  and President Donald Trump at the White House. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on,” said Krzanich. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry.” The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona.  “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs -- high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” Popular Now Achieving Competitive Advantage Through Supply Chain Management The Industrial Internet: Six Ways Manufacturers Can Fuse Big Data, Automation and IoT for Better Operations 5 Key Trends Impacting the Aerospace Sector and What They Mean for Growth Intel is America’s largest high-technology capital expenditure investor ($5.1 billion in the U.S. 2015) and its third largest investor in global R&D ($12.1 billion in 2015). The majority of Intel’s manufacturing and R&D is in the United States. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States, while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, including semiconductor tooling, software, logistics, channels, OEMs and other manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs. The 7 nm semiconductor manufacturing process targeted for Fab 42 represents the future of Moore’s Law. In 1968 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computing power will become significantly more capable and yet cost less year after year. The chips made on the 7 nm process will power the most sophisticated computers, data centers, sensors and other high-tech devices, and enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more. These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore’s Law.

Try asking Intel Corp. The high-end department-store chain’s stock took a hit after Trump tweeted, at 10:51 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday, that his daughter Ivanka had been treated “unfairly” by Nordstrom, which dumped her fashion label, citing poor sales. “Terrible!” Trump called it. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 The stock JWN, -1.21% was down 0.3% at about $42.65 at 10:50 a.m., then was down as much as 1% at $42.36 within a minute of Trump’s tweet. That post-tweet low was above its intraday low of $42.32, which was hit in the first minute after the open. By 10:55, the stock had bounced back above $42.65, effectively erasing the effect of Trump’s tweet. Although the stock dipped back below $42.65 several times over the course of the next five minutes, by 11 a.m. it was above that level for good. And by 11:01 a.m. the stock had turned positive on the day, and it trended higher thereafter. FactSet White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday that Trump had every right to tweet at Nordstrom, as the tweet wasn't about promoting a family business but defending his daughter against an attack. Nordstrom closed Wednesday with a gain of more than 4.1%. In comparison, the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund was up 1.6% XRT, +0.69% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.36% inched upward by 0.1%. White House Defends Trump Tweet Against Nordstrom(1:50) White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended a tweet by President Trump admonishing Nordstrom over its decision to drop his daughter Ivanka's fashion label, saying Trump 'has every right' to defend his family. Photo: Getty The shares continued to rally Thursday, powering up 4.1% in midday trade, after Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” Don’t miss: Political endorsement redefined as Kellyanne Conway tells America to buy Ivanka Trump’s fashion brand. Last Friday, Nordstrom said it would stop selling the Ivanka Trump brand but said the move was purely a business decision and not one based on protests or any other political reason. The company told MarketWatch that it culls about 10% of the brands it carries every year. Based on the Ivanka brand’s performance, it said, “we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” Meanwhile, a positive tweet from Trump wasn’t too helpful for Intel Corp.’s stock INTC, -0.34% on Wednesday.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 At 2:21 p.m. Eastern time, the chip maker’s stock was trading at $36.43.

Don’t miss: Opinion: Trading on Trump’s tweets would have left you sad and poorer. See also: Opinion: How CEOs can tame Trump and protect your investments. FactSet The stock ticked up to $36.46 shortly thereafter, before selling off within a few minutes and ending at $36.38, for a Wednesday gain of 3 cents but a post-Trump-tweet decline of a nickel. The shares slipped further on Thursday, shedding 0.4% in midday trade.

CEO Brian Krzanich shows how many steps he took during a keynote address as tracked by a wearable processor called Curie, a prototype open source computer the size of a button that he unveiled at the 2015 International CES at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 6, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES, the world’s largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 9 and is expected to feature 3,600 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to about 150,000 attendees. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: February 8, 2017 at 12:38 pm | UPDATED: February 8, 2017 at 6:13 pm In the first high-profile move by a Silicon Valley company to publicly support President Donald Trump’s proposed policies, Intel’s CEO on Wednesday announced the company would invest $7 billion in an Arizona factory that would eventually employ 3,000 workers. A spokesman for the Santa Clara chipmaker wouldn’t say if the plan represented a pivot toward Trump, but CEO Brian Krzanich made the announcement during a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. Trump took to Twitter to applaud the plan. “Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst,” Trump tweeted. Intel’s move comes as opposition to the Trump administration gains ground in Silicon Valley and a growing chorus of investors, startups and companies speak out against the administration. Last week Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from Trump’s business advisory council in the face of protests from employees and the public, and nearly all major Silicon Valley tech firms — including Intel — this week joined legal action against the president’s travel ban. Krzanich, asked during the Oval Office meeting whether the investment to produce semiconductor chips was spurred by something Trump said or did, answered, “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” In an email to employees, Krzanich described a more focused support. “We support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies,” he said. Intel spokesman Will Moss wouldn’t say whether Intel’s announcement — made by Krzanich while standing beside Trump — reflected support for the Trump administration. “There’s nothing new about us making substantial investments in the United States,” Moss said. With five plants overseas making and assembling computer chips, Intel has substantial exposure should the White House follow through on proposed plans for import tariffs that would deter foreign manufacturing by U.S. companies. One prominent Trump opponent expressed sympathy for Intel’s difficult position, but warned that a perceived alignment with the president could hurt the company’s brand. “It’s fraught because perception is reality and companies can’t align themselves with Trump or his policies without inadvertently aligning themselves with non-economic policies such as the Muslim ban,” said Shannon Coulter of San Francisco, who co-founded the “Grab Your Wallet” campaign to boycott Trump family products after Trump’s comments about grabbing women went public. “I would really caution any company from aligning itself in any way with the Trump name right now, because to do so, at a brand level means aligning yourself with a bunch of things that are unconstitutional and anti-American, not to mention the alleged sexual assault of women.“ Krzanich linked himself to Trump last year, when he planned to host him at his home in Atherton as the likely Republican presidential nominee. Krzanich later canceled the event, telling a conference he did so because it had turned into a fundraiser. Construction on the Arizona plant, called “Fab 42,” had started in 2011, but work was suspended when PC sales slowed, a decline that also led Intel to announce last year it would slash 12,000 jobs. Former President Barack Obama, touring the factory site in 2012, praised the planned project as a boon for creation of “the next generation of good manufacturing jobs.” It will take three to four years to complete the Arizona facility, Intel said. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry,” Krzanich said in a statement. “Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located,” Krzanich said in the statement, echoing many of Trump’s job-creation priorities. In the meeting with Trump, the CEO depicted his firm as a weapon against U.S. trade imbalances with other countries. “Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S. and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.,” Krzanich said. Moss, asked whether the Oval Office announcement conflicted with the firm’s opposition to Trump on the executive order temporarily banning refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, said, “When we disagree we don’t walk away. “We think we need to be part of the conversation on issues such as immigration … and other policies that are essential to innovation.” Intel, Coulter said, is in a “tricky” spot. “I have some sympathy for them,” she said. “We know that American jobs are very important and that some companies will need to make decisions like this based on new policies from the White House.” Tags:  Intel Technology Trump Administration Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

CEO Brian Krzanich uses it to endorse White House efforts to boost US manufacturing. Tech Industry by Stephen Shankland February 8, 2017 5:00 PM PST @stshank Enlarge Image Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, left, stands next to President Donald Trump to announce a next-generation chip factory. CBS News Intel chip factories come and go, but one planned for Arizona has assumed new political importance amid President Donald Trump's attempt to enliven US manufacturing. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich stood by Trump in the White House on Wednesday to announce a plan to resuscitate an Arizona chip factory called Fab 42, boasting of the company's manufacturing prowess and criticizing US regulations. His proximity contrasts with many tech companies' displeasure with the new administration. "Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US," Krzanich said. "We've been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we've had across the world." Trump tweeted his pleasure at Intel's move: "Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst" Although Intel capitalized on the administration's priorities as a way to publicize the factory, that had nothing to do with the company's actual decision. "We're thrilled to have the recognition for the investment and to be able to show people we're investing in the future of innovation in the US, but it wasn't tied to any specific policy or anything the administration did," Intel spokesman William Moss said. "It's driven because we anticipate demand for the factory along the time frame it'll take us to complete." Intel no doubt would like more favorable regulations in the US, but tight ties with Trump can come with a cost. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned from a Trump economic advisory council after customers uninstalled his company's ride-hailing app en masse in part to protest Uber's cooperation. Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla, hasn't resigned despite similar pushback, but he's also offered some resistance to the Trump administration's fondness for fossil fuels. For example, a tweet Wednesday from Musk pointed toward a Wall Street Journal op-ed seeking a carbon tax to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Intel's investment reawakens an old plant. The company announced Fab 42 in 2011 as part of a $5 billion investment plan that would mean 1,000 new jobs, but mothballed it in 2014 because of slumping chip demand. Now it's back on with a $7 billion plan that will mean 3,000 jobs in three or four years, Intel said. Enlarge Image Intel announced Fab 42 in Chandler, Ariz., in 2011, mothballed it in 2014 and is now set to begin manufacturing chips there in 2020 or 2021. Intel At the White House, Krzanich echoed Trump's speaking style to boast of the plan. "This factory will produce the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars -- the most powerful computing devices on the planet," he said. In an email to employees, he also lent his backing to Trump administration policy. "We support the administration's policies to level the global playing field and make US manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies," he said. But Intel has also joined Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and dozens of other tech companies that objected to Trump's immigration ban. "When we disagree, we don't walk away," Krzanich said in his email. "We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H-1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation."

Credit: Intel More like this Intel pursues Moore's Law with plan to make 7-nm chips this year AMD sets up Ryzen chip for a strong start as battle with Intel looms U.S. chipmaker plans new factory in China Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Intel CEO Brian Krzanich's meeting with new U.S. president Donald Trump was followed by a big announcement: The company will invest $7 billion over the next three to four years to complete a factory to make 7-nanometer chips. The completion of Fab 42 -- where the chips will be made -- will create about 3,000 jobs in the Chandler, Ariz., area, Intel said. The chipmaker expects to help create 10,000 jobs tied to supporting the activities of Fab 42. Trump has been pushing for more jobs in the U.S. and for bringing manufacturing back to the country. Making the announcement after meeting with Trump amplifies Intel's efforts to promote itself as a jobs creator. But just last year, the company laid off more than 12,000 employees to restructure operations. Also, this isn't the first time Intel has committed to creating jobs and investing billions to make Fab 42. It made a similar announcement in 2011 but then backed off. [ Further reading: The 8080 chip at 40: What's next for the mighty microprocessor? ] In February 2011, then-CEO Paul Otellini announced the company was investing $5 billion to complete Fab 42 to make 14-nm chips and create 4,000 jobs. That announcement was made during former President Barack Obama's visit to an Intel facility in Hillsboro, Ore. Intel slammed the breaks on that plan in 2014 to keep the space available "for unspecified future technology." The construction of Fab 42 began in 2011, but its completion was delayed, William Moss, an Intel spokesman, said in an email. "We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business," Moss said. In 2011, Intel announced the factory as it expected to grow its mobile device business. But Intel has now stopped making smartphone chips and is instead focusing on growth in the internet of things, server, automotive, and other markets. The White House hailed the completion of the factory as a positive development. Trump called the announcement a "great thing" for Arizona. "We're very happy, and I can tell you, the people of Arizona are very happy," he added. Intel's announcement is the latest in a "wave of economic optimism" since Trump took office, Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said later. Outside the U.S., Intel also operates factories in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Israel, and Ireland. Much of Intel's chip design takes place in Israel, and the company is making its latest Optane memory chips in Dalian, China. Intel regularly establishes new factories to create smaller, powerful and more power-efficient chips. The 7-nm factory is a big investment and could lead toward longer battery life to smaller devices. The 7-nm chips will be made for PCs, sensors, and other high-tech devices. The chips will "enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more," Krzanich said in an email to Intel's employees. Two weeks ago, Intel said it was establishing a pilot 7-nm plant to manufacture test chips. Intel currently ships 14-nm PC, server, and IoT chips, and is expected to start shipping its first 10-nm PC chips code-named Cannonlake by the end of the year. The announcement also gives a time frame for when Intel will make its first 7-nm chips. Intel will likely release three or more chip architectures on the 10-nm process, like it has with 14-nm, before switching over to 7-nm. The 7-nm could also introduce new tools like extreme ultraviolet, which will help make finer chips, and materials like gallium-nitride in chips.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during the daily press briefing, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017, at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The White House says Trump wrote Xi to thank him for a congratulatory letter and to express his hopes of developing "a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China." Before taking office, Trump questioned the "one-China policy" that shifted U.S. recognition from self-governing Taiwan to China in 1979. He said it was open to negotiation. Trump also wants to pressure Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. ___ 6 p.m. First lady Melania Trump has named Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as White House social secretary, putting her at the helm of the White House's social events, state dinners and other high-profile gatherings. Mrs. Trump says Niceta Lloyd — who goes by Rickie — brings "solid diplomatic, political and social entertaining experience" to the job. The White House says Niceta Lloyd has worked with both Republicans and Democrats in planning events for the last five presidential inaugurations. She's also assisted the State Department's Office of Protocol with events with several secretaries of state. Mrs. Trump has yet to move to Washington, but she is starting to fill out her staff. She's said she plans to stay in New York while the president's 10-year-old son, Barro, finishes the school year. ___ 5:30 p.m. Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee has told a Democratic senator that he found the president's attacks on the judiciary "disheartening" and "demoralizing." Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut disclosed the comments from Judge Neil Gorsuch after meeting with the nominee Wednesday. Trump referred to a Seattle judge who put a stay on his immigrant travel ban as a "so-called judge." Gorsuch's confirmation team confirmed that Gorsuch was referring to that comment and described it as disheartening. Gorsuch is making the rounds in the Senate, drawing praise from Republicans but skepticism from many Democrats, including Blumenthal. ___ 4:30 p.m. Republican Sen. John McCain isn't budging from his assessment that the U.S. raid in Yemen wasn't a success after he was criticized by the White House. McCain says any operation where a $75 million airplane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, "cannot be labeled a success." His remarks came after White House spokesman Sean Spicer said anyone who questions the success of the Yemen operation is doing a "disservice" to the life of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. McCain recalled a failed 1970 mission to rescue U.S. service members held in North Vietnam. He says, "Any connection between success or failure and the heroism of men and women who serve, there is none." ___ 2:50 p.m. White House press secretary Sean Spicer says those who question the success of a deadly U.S. raid in Yemen are doing a "disservice" to the life of a Navy SEAL who was killed in the raid. The comments come after Arizona Sen. John McCain said Tuesday that he wouldn't describe the raid as a success, given the loss of American life. Spicer says the action taken in Yemen was a "huge success" and that any other characterization does a disservice to the life of Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who was killed in the assault. Innocent civilians, including children, were also killed in the raid. Three other U.S. service members were wounded. ___ 2:15 p.m. A White House spokesman says President Donald Trump was standing up for his daughter when he posted a tweet criticizing Nordstrom. Trump tweeted that Ivanka Trump was treated "so unfairly" by the department store, which decided to stop selling her clothing and accessory line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter." Spicer says Trump is president — and "for people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump's tweet. ___ 1:10 p.m. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is at the White House and bringing the kind of economic news that President Donald Trump likes to trumpet: a $7 billion investment in an Intel factory in Arizona. The CEO says in an Oval Office visit with Trump that Intel will be completing the factory and making "the most advanced" chips on the planet." The CEO says the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich says the announcement comes partly in response in part to Trump's tax and regulatory policies. Trump calls the product that Intel will be making is "amazing." ___ 12 p.m. The U.S. military is looking to rent space at Trump Tower for use when President Donald Trump is working in New York City. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle says the Department of Defense is looking for the space "in order to meet official mission requirements." It's not immediately clear how much it would cost the Pentagon to rent space in the 58-story midtown Manhattan tower owned by the Trump Organization. Trump lives in the three-story penthouse. He hasn't returned to New York since taking office on Jan. 20. His wife, Melania, and their young son, Barron, are living there for now. It's customary for the military to obtain space near a president's residence. ___ 11:50 a.m. Organizations opposed to President Donald Trump's executive order on government regulations are suing to block it. The order required federal agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed or issued. The suit contends the order exceeds the president's constitutional authority — and directs agencies to unlawfully repeal rules intended to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the environment. Filing suit are Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, the Communications Workers of America and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ 11:25 a.m. President Donald Trump isn't happy about Nordstrom's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories — and he's tweeting his criticism. Trump says his daughter has "been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom." The president says she's "a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Nordstrom said last week that it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter's brand. Nordstrom hasn't immediately responded to an email seeking comment. Ivanka Trump has formally stepped down from her leadership role with the brand. ___ 9:57 a.m. President Donald Trump is promising "zero tolerance" for violence against law enforcement officers. He tells a group of police chiefs that his administration will give their departments the resources to recruit and retain officers. Trump also says "no one in America should be punished" simply for growing up in a place where violence may be prevalent. And as he has done before, he's singling out Chicago, saying the level of violence in the city cannot be allowed to continue. He says "we've allowed too many young lives to be claimed." When it comes to people who may be living illegally in the United States and involved in criminal activity, the president wants law enforcement and the public to report them to the Department of Homeland Security. In his words — "I want you to turn in the bad ones." ___ 9:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is asserting that had the right to enact his travel ban. He tells a group of police chiefs that his immigration order was "done for the security of our nation." He says the provision supporting the order was written "beautifully" and was within his executive authority. Trump says "a bad high school student would understand this." A federal judge has put the ban on hold, and an appeals court is considering an appeal from the Trump administration. The order includes a temporary travel ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. While awaiting a decision, Trump says "courts seem to be so political." ___ 7:55 a.m. President Donald Trump is expected to have lunch Thursday with a group of moderate Senate Democrats who could play a key role in his legislative agenda. The lunch is expected to include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana. Trump faces a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and hopes to secure some support among Democrats for his agenda and the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. All four Senate Democrats face re-election in 2018. The lunch was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by the Senate offices. The White House did not immediately provide details on the lunch, which is also expected to include Republican lawmakers. __ 7: 24 a.m. President Donald Trump is tweeting that if he loses the pending court case over his travel ban, the country "can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled." The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of Trump's executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on those from seven Muslim-majority countries. The appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but it also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. The president tweeted early Wednesday, "If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!"

On Wednesday, the CEO stood next to Trump in the White House and announced a $7 billion investment in a new U.S. factory. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the investment was "really in support of the tax and regulatory polices that we see the administration pushing forward," which he thinks will be beneficial to domestic manufacturing. The full story is more complicated. Intel previously announced a $5 billion investment in the same Arizona factory with former President Obama in 2011. That money was used to build the "shell" of the factory," but the project was left uncompleted due to a lack of "general demand for the product," according to William Moss, a spokesman for Intel. "We're making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect," Moss told CNNMoney. "That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration's pro business and pro investment goals." While standing by Trump in the Oval Office, Krzanich said the new computer chip factory "will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory." Trump introduced Krzanich as the CEO of a "great, great company" and stressed the positive impact the investment would have on Arizona jobs. The announcement comes just days after Intel joined more than 100 other companies in filing court papers declaring Trump's executive order on immigration to be unconstitutional. "As a company cofounded by an immigrant, we support lawful immigration," Krzanich wrote in a tweet after Trump's executive order imposing a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. "We will provide impacted employees with Intel's full support." In an email to employees on Wednesday, Krzanich noted the factory's value to Intel as well as the importance of engaging with governments around the world. "When we disagree, we don't walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation, Krzanich wrote in the memo, a copy of which was provided to CNNTech. Krzanich was one of about a dozen tech CEOs to meet with then President-elect Trump in December to talk about jobs, a centerpiece of Trump's campaign. Since then, Amazon has announced plans to create 100,000 new jobs in the U.S. Apple also pumped $1 billion into a massive technology fund from Japan's SoftBank Group, whose founder had previously committed to invest in U.S. hiring.

The completion of Fab 42 -- where the chips will be made -- will create about 3,000 jobs in the Chandler, Arizona, area, Intel said. The chipmaker expects to help create 10,000 jobs tied to supporting the activities of Fab 42. Trump has been pushing for more jobs in the U.S. and for bringing manufacturing back to the country. Making the announcement after meeting with Trump amplifies Intel's efforts to promote itself as a jobs creator. But just last year, the company laid off more than 12,000 employees to restructure operations. Also, this isn't the first time Intel has committed to creating jobs and investing billions to make Fab 42. It made a similar announcement in 2011 but then backed off. In February 2011, then-CEO Paul Otellini announced the company was investing $5 billion to complete Fab 42 to make 14-nm chips and create 4,000 jobs. That announcement was made during former President Barack Obama's visit to an Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. Intel slammed the breaks on that plan in 2014 to keep the space available "for unspecified future technology." The construction of Fab 42 began in 2011, but its completion was delayed, William Moss, an Intel spokesman, said in an email. "We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business," Moss said. In 2011, Intel announced the factory as it expected to grow its mobile device business. But Intel has now stopped making smartphone chips and is instead focusing on growth in the internet of things, server, automotive, and other markets. The White House hailed the completion of the factory as a positive development. Trump called the announcement a "great thing" for Arizona. "We're very happy, and I can tell you, the people of Arizona are very happy," he added. Intel's announcement is the latest in a "wave of economic optimism" since Trump took office, Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, said later. Outside the U.S., Intel also operates factories in China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Israel, and Ireland. Many of Intel's chip design takes place in Israel, and the company is making its latest Optane memory chips in Dalian, China. Intel regularly establishes new factories to create smaller, powerful and more power-efficient chips. The 7-nm factory is a big investment and could lead toward longer battery life to smaller devices. The 7-nm chips will be made for PCs, sensors, and other high-tech devices. The chips will "enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more," Krzanich said in an email to Intel's employees. Two weeks ago, Intel said it was establishing a pilot 7-nm plant to manufacture test chips. Intel currently ships 14-nm PC, server, and IoT chips, and is expected to start shipping its first 10-nm PC chips code-named Cannonlake by the end of the year. The announcement also gives a time frame for when Intel will make its first 7-nm chips. Intel will likely release three or more chip architectures on the 10-nm process, like it has with 14-nm, before switching over to 7-nm. The 7-nm could also introduce new tools like EUV (extreme ultraviolet), which will help make finer chips, and materials like gallium-nitride (GaN) in chips. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Evan Vucci AP Photo 1 of 5 i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times EST): 8:40 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has written Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) to wish the "Chinese people a happy Lantern Festival and prosperous Year of the Rooster." The White House says Trump wrote Xi to thank him for a congratulatory letter and to express his hopes of developing "a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China." Before taking office, Trump questioned the "one-China policy" that shifted U.S. recognition from self-governing Taiwan to China in 1979. He said it was open to negotiation. Trump also wants to pressure Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. ___ 6 p.m. First lady Melania Trump has named Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as White House social secretary, putting her at the helm of the White House's social events, state dinners and other high-profile gatherings. Mrs. Trump says Niceta Lloyd — who goes by Rickie — brings "solid diplomatic, political and social entertaining experience" to the job. The White House says Niceta Lloyd has worked with both Republicans and Democrats in planning events for the last five presidential inaugurations. She's also assisted the State Department's Office of Protocol with events with several secretaries of state. Mrs. Trump has yet to move to Washington, but she is starting to fill out her staff. She's said she plans to stay in New York while the president's 10-year-old son, Barro, finishes the school year. ___ 5:30 p.m. Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee has told a Democratic senator that he found the president's attacks on the judiciary "disheartening" and "demoralizing." Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut disclosed the comments from Judge Neil Gorsuch after meeting with the nominee Wednesday. Trump referred to a Seattle judge who put a stay on his immigrant travel ban as a "so-called judge." Gorsuch's confirmation team confirmed that Gorsuch was referring to that comment and described it as disheartening. Gorsuch is making the rounds in the Senate, drawing praise from Republicans but skepticism from many Democrats, including Blumenthal. ___ 4:30 p.m. Republican Sen. John McCain isn't budging from his assessment that the U.S. raid in Yemen wasn't a success after he was criticized by the White House. McCain says any operation where a $75 million airplane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, "cannot be labeled a success." His remarks came after White House spokesman Sean Spicer said anyone who questions the success of the Yemen operation is doing a "disservice" to the life of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. McCain recalled a failed 1970 mission to rescue U.S. service members held in North Vietnam. He says, "Any connection between success or failure and the heroism of men and women who serve, there is none." ___ 2:50 p.m. White House press secretary Sean Spicer says those who question the success of a deadly U.S. raid in Yemen are doing a "disservice" to the life of a Navy SEAL who was killed in the raid. The comments come after Arizona Sen. John McCain said Tuesday that he wouldn't describe the raid as a success, given the loss of American life. Spicer says the action taken in Yemen was a "huge success" and that any other characterization does a disservice to the life of Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who was killed in the assault. Innocent civilians, including children, were also killed in the raid. Three other U.S. service members were wounded. ___ 2:15 p.m. A White House spokesman says President Donald Trump was standing up for his daughter when he posted a tweet criticizing Nordstrom. Trump tweeted that Ivanka Trump was treated "so unfairly" by the department store, which decided to stop selling her clothing and accessory line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter." Spicer says Trump is president — and "for people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump's tweet. ___ 1:10 p.m. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is at the White House and bringing the kind of economic news that President Donald Trump likes to trumpet: a $7 billion investment in an Intel factory in Arizona. The CEO says in an Oval Office visit with Trump that Intel will be completing the factory and making "the most advanced" chips on the planet." The CEO says the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich says the announcement comes partly in response in part to Trump's tax and regulatory policies. Trump calls the product that Intel will be making is "amazing." ___ 12 p.m. The U.S. military is looking to rent space at Trump Tower for use when President Donald Trump is working in New York City. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle says the Department of Defense is looking for the space "in order to meet official mission requirements." It's not immediately clear how much it would cost the Pentagon to rent space in the 58-story midtown Manhattan tower owned by the Trump Organization. Trump lives in the three-story penthouse. He hasn't returned to New York since taking office on Jan. 20. His wife, Melania, and their young son, Barron, are living there for now. It's customary for the military to obtain space near a president's residence. ___ 11:50 a.m. Organizations opposed to President Donald Trump's executive order on government regulations are suing to block it. The order required federal agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed or issued. The suit contends the order exceeds the president's constitutional authority — and directs agencies to unlawfully repeal rules intended to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the environment. Filing suit are Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, the Communications Workers of America and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ 11:25 a.m. President Donald Trump isn't happy about Nordstrom's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories — and he's tweeting his criticism. Trump says his daughter has "been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom." The president says she's "a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Nordstrom said last week that it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter's brand. Nordstrom hasn't immediately responded to an email seeking comment. Ivanka Trump has formally stepped down from her leadership role with the brand. ___ 9:57 a.m. President Donald Trump is promising "zero tolerance" for violence against law enforcement officers. He tells a group of police chiefs that his administration will give their departments the resources to recruit and retain officers. Trump also says "no one in America should be punished" simply for growing up in a place where violence may be prevalent. And as he has done before, he's singling out Chicago, saying the level of violence in the city cannot be allowed to continue. He says "we've allowed too many young lives to be claimed." When it comes to people who may be living illegally in the United States and involved in criminal activity, the president wants law enforcement and the public to report them to the Department of Homeland Security. In his words — "I want you to turn in the bad ones." ___ 9:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is asserting that had the right to enact his travel ban. He tells a group of police chiefs that his immigration order was "done for the security of our nation." He says the provision supporting the order was written "beautifully" and was within his executive authority. Trump says "a bad high school student would understand this." A federal judge has put the ban on hold, and an appeals court is considering an appeal from the Trump administration. The order includes a temporary travel ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. While awaiting a decision, Trump says "courts seem to be so political." ___ 7:55 a.m. President Donald Trump is expected to have lunch Thursday with a group of moderate Senate Democrats who could play a key role in his legislative agenda. The lunch is expected to include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana. Trump faces a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and hopes to secure some support among Democrats for his agenda and the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. All four Senate Democrats face re-election in 2018. The lunch was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by the Senate offices. The White House did not immediately provide details on the lunch, which is also expected to include Republican lawmakers. __ 7: 24 a.m. President Donald Trump is tweeting that if he loses the pending court case over his travel ban, the country "can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled." The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of Trump's executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on those from seven Muslim-majority countries. The appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but it also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. The president tweeted early Wednesday, "If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!"

On Wednesday, the CEO stood next to Trump in the White House and announced a $7 billion investment in a new U.S. factory. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the investment was “really in support of the tax and regulatory polices that we see the administration pushing forward,” which he thinks will be beneficial to domestic manufacturing. The full story is more complicated. Intel previously announced a $5 billion investment in the same Arizona factory with former President Obama in 2011. That money was used to build the “shell” of the factory,” but the project was left uncompleted due to a lack of “general demand for the product,” according to William Moss, a spokesman for Intel. “We’re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,” Moss told CNNMoney. “That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration’s pro business and pro investment goals.” While standing by Trump in the Oval Office, Krzanich said the new computer chip factory “will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory.” Trump introduced Krzanich as the CEO of a “great, great company” and stressed the positive impact the investment would have on Arizona jobs. The announcement comes just days after Intel joined more than 100 other companies in filing court papers declaring Trump’s executive order on immigration to be unconstitutional. “As a company cofounded by an immigrant, we support lawful immigration,” Krzanich wrote in a tweet after Trump’s executive order imposing a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. “We will provide impacted employees with Intel’s full support.” In an email to employees on Wednesday, Krzanich noted the factory’s value to Intel as well as the importance of engaging with governments around the world. “When we disagree, we don’t walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation, Krzanich wrote in the memo, a copy of which was provided to CNNTech. Krzanich was one of about a dozen tech CEOs to meet with then President-elect Trump in December to talk about jobs, a centerpiece of Trump’s campaign. Since then, Amazon has announced plans to create 100,000 new jobs in the U.S. Apple also pumped $1 billion into a massive technology fund from Japan’s SoftBank Group, whose founder had previously committed to invest in U.S. hiring.

The mayor of Chandler simply calls it a win for his city where the plant is expected to generate thousands of jobs. (Feb. 8) AP Intel's fabrication plant 42 in Chandler, Arizona. (Photo: Intel Corp.) 374 CONNECTTWEET 9 LINKEDIN 46 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Intel CEO Brian Kraznich stood next to President Trump in the Oval Office Wednesday to announce that the chip maker would spend $7 billion to complete a mothballed plant in Chandler, Ariz. that was begun in 2011. The opening of the plant is part of Intel's overall pivot away from the PC market which has taken place over the past few years and is beginning to pay dividends, though some also saw a possible political tint to the timing. Fabrication plant 42 will produce microprocessors and will take between three and four years to come online, creating approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage jobs when it opens, Kraznich said. “It will be the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant on the planet,” said Stacy Smith, Intel’s head of sales and manufacturing. Intel originally built the plant in 2011-2012, when it spent $5 billion on the facility, but then made the decision not to complete it because of shifts in the semiconductor industry as the public turned away from PCs and towards tablets and smartphones. Shipments of PCs dropped 5.7% in 2016, according to IDC. Since then Intel has rebounded by pivoting to focus on the needs of cloud computing facilities and devices. Intel already has two other factories in Arizona. "Intel is very proud of the fact that a majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S., and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80% of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.," Krzanich said in the White House. The investments needed to create new chips is “enormous, so we have to start now in order to intercept demand that’s a few year’s out,” said Smith The decision to built out the plant in Chandler has nothing to do with the Trump Administration’s America first policies, said Gartner lead Intel analyst Mark Hung. “Traditionally, Intel’s leading-edge work has always been done in the United States,” he said. The plant will be using Intel’s 7-nanometer manufacturing process, a cutting-edge advanced process. “They needed to bite the bullet at some point to do it, and given that the plant’s new, it’s a good place for it,” Hung said. While the move is largely in line with Intel’s long term plans, there could well be an element of fortuitous timing to the announcement, said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. “Currently Intel has large amounts of cash overseas and the company employs a lot of highly-skilled works who use a lot of H-1B visas. These are items that the president is currently evaluating. So it’s a pretty advantageous time for Intel to be announcing the creation of 3,000 new jobs,” he said. Intel has made chips for personal computers in Chandler since the 1980s. It is the number one private employer in Arizona, Krzanich said.

The company will use the $7 billion to complete its Fab 42 factory in Chandler, Ariz., Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a meeting at the White House with President Trump. ADVERTISEMENT Krzanich said the decision to make the announcement with the White House was borne out of Intel’s support for Trump’s economic and trade policies. “We support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies,” Krzanich wrote in an email to Intel employees. “When we disagree, we don’t walk away,” he continued. “We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation.” Trump tweeted about the meeting on Wednesday afternoon, calling it a “great investment” in “American INNOVATION and JOBS!”  Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirstpic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 The Fab 42 factory, which is projected to be complete in three to four years, will create semiconductor chips. Intel said the investment would create 3,000 Intel jobs and 10,000 long-term jobs in Arizona. Intel had previously coordinated the announcement of the project with former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaAppeals court judge wants vote on whether to reconsider travel ban ruling DNC hopeful Buttigieg wants to capitalize on protest energy Obamas sign with agency for speaking gigs MORE in 2011 after he toured the company’s Hillsboro, Ore., facility. Intel started construction of the Fab 42 plant in 2011, but shelved the project in 2014 amid slowing computer sales. In his letter, Krzanich explained that Intel decided to revive the project as its growth increases. The company has reported relatively steady increases in income and asset growth over the past five years. “Fab 42 is an investment in our own future and will help ensure that the United States remains the global leader in the semiconductor industry,” Krzanich wrote. The chips manufactured at the plant “will enable amazing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, automated driving, medical research and treatment, and the factories of the future,” he added. Arizona lawmakers applauded the announcement on Wednesday.  “I welcome Intel Corp.’s decision to invest in Arizona’s workforce and President Trump’s continued commitment to policies that facilitate job creation here in the United States,” Sen.

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) in a separate statement. Intel was one of 100-plus technology companies to sign an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit against Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration, which temporarily suspends travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and halts admittance of refugees.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) . . 1 of 4 . . More News Video Buy AP Photo Reprints WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times EST): 2:15 p.m. A White House spokesman says President Donald Trump was standing up for his daughter when he posted a tweet criticizing Nordstrom. Trump tweeted that Ivanka Trump was treated "so unfairly" by the department store, which decided to stop selling her clothing and accessory line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter." Spicer says Trump is president — and "for people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump's tweet. ___ 1:10 p.m. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is at the White House and bringing the kind of economic news that President Donald Trump likes to trumpet: a $7 billion investment in an Intel factory in Arizona. The CEO says in an Oval Office visit with Trump that Intel will be completing the factory and making "the most advanced" chips on the planet." The CEO says the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich says the announcement comes partly in response in part to Trump's tax and regulatory policies. Trump calls the product that Intel will be making is "amazing." ___ 12 p.m. The U.S. military is looking to rent space at Trump Tower for use when President Donald Trump is working in New York City. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle says the Department of Defense is looking for the space "in order to meet official mission requirements." It's not immediately clear how much it would cost the Pentagon to rent space in the 58-story midtown Manhattan tower owned by the Trump Organization. Trump lives in the three-story penthouse. He hasn't returned to New York since taking office on Jan. 20. His wife, Melania, and their young son, Barron, are living there for now. It's customary for the military to obtain space near a president's residence. ___ 11:50 a.m. Organizations opposed to President Donald Trump's executive order on government regulations are suing to block it. The order required federal agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed or issued. The suit contends the order exceeds the president's constitutional authority — and directs agencies to unlawfully repeal rules intended to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the environment. Filing suit are Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, the Communications Workers of America and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ 11:25 a.m. President Donald Trump isn't happy about Nordstrom's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories — and he's tweeting his criticism. Trump says his daughter has "been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom." The president says she's "a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Nordstrom said last week that it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter's brand. Nordstrom hasn't immediately responded to an email seeking comment. Ivanka Trump has formally stepped down from her leadership role with the brand. ___ 9:57 a.m. President Donald Trump is promising "zero tolerance" for violence against law enforcement officers. He tells a group of police chiefs that his administration will give their departments the resources to recruit and retain officers. Trump also says "no one in America should be punished" simply for growing up in a place where violence may be prevalent. And as he has done before, he's singling out Chicago, saying the level of violence in the city cannot be allowed to continue. He says "we've allowed too many young lives to be claimed." When it comes to people who may be living illegally in the United States and involved in criminal activity, the president wants law enforcement and the public to report them to the Department of Homeland Security. In his words — "I want you to turn in the bad ones." ___ 9:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is asserting that had the right to enact his travel ban. He tells a group of police chiefs that his immigration order was "done for the security of our nation." He says the provision supporting the order was written "beautifully" and was within his executive authority. Trump says "a bad high school student would understand this." A federal judge has put the ban on hold, and an appeals court is considering an appeal from the Trump administration. The order includes a temporary travel ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. While awaiting a decision, Trump says "courts seem to be so political." ___ 7:55 a.m. President Donald Trump is expected to have lunch Thursday with a group of moderate Senate Democrats who could play a key role in his legislative agenda. The lunch is expected to include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana. Trump faces a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and hopes to secure some support among Democrats for his agenda and the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. All four Senate Democrats face re-election in 2018. The lunch was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by the Senate offices. The White House did not immediately provide details on the lunch, which is also expected to include Republican lawmakers. __ 7: 24 a.m. President Donald Trump is tweeting that if he loses the pending court case over his travel ban, the country "can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled." The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of Trump's executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on those from seven Muslim-majority countries. The appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but it also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. The president tweeted early Wednesday, "If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.

The Chandler, Ariz. manufacturing plant, where Arizona has long had manufacturing operations, will be used to make computer chips. In a statement, Intel said the opening of the factory will lead to 3,000 “high-tech, high-wage jobs” and will create more than 10,000 long-term jobs in Arizona. Intel, which has its headquarters in Santa Clara, announced 12,000 layoffs across the company last year. The construction of the manufacturing plant, Fab 42, was nearly finished several years ago, but was put on hold due to changing market conditions. The reinvigoration of this plant, which is expected to be finished in two to three years, is convenient timing for a company looking to forge connections with a new administration that is largely focused on keeping jobs in the U.S. Ivanka Trump's fashion line will not be available at Nordstrom this coming season. The company announced Thursday night that it was formally dropping the brand created by President Trump's daughter. It said in a statement, "Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season. Media: WochIt Media ALSO Trump Today: President tweets Nordstrom treated Ivanka ‘unfairly’ Trump Today: President sounds off on 9th Circuit Court judges Trump update: He praises ‘amazing job’ by Frederick Douglass The role of this plant as a political symbol isn’t new. While in office, President Barack Obama praised Fab 42 as a symbol of the future of U.S. manufacturing. Intel was one of about 100 companies that filed a legal brief this weekend opposing Trump’s controversial ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. According to a White House Pool report, when asked by Reuters why Intel is making this announcement at the White House, Krzanich said: “It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” Chipmakers like Intel stand to benefit from tax credits on purchases of manufacturing equipment, for example.

(Credit: Intel Corporation) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail February 08, 2017 01:12 PM Eastern Standard Time WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intel Corporation today announced plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete Fab 42, which is expected to be the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world. The high-volume factory is in Chandler, Ariz., and is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made by U.S. President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House. The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona. Context for the investment was outlined in an e-mail from Intel’s CEO to employees. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on,” said Krzanich. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry.” “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs -- high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” Intel is America’s largest high-technology capital expenditure investor ($5.1 billion in the U.S. 2015) and its third largest investor in global R&D ($12.1 billion in 20151). The majority of Intel’s manufacturing and R&D is in the United States. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States, while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, including semiconductor tooling, software, logistics, channels, OEMs and other manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs. The 7 nm semiconductor manufacturing process targeted for Fab 42 will be the most advanced semiconductor process technology used in the world and represents the future of Moore’s Law. In 1968 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computing power will become significantly more capable and yet cost less year after year. Making a leading-edge computer chip is the most complex manufacturing process in the world, engineering magic that turns sand into semiconductors, the foundation of the knowledge economy. The chips made on the 7 nm process will power the most sophisticated computers, data centers, sensors and other high-tech devices, and enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more. These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore’s Law.

A Fire Broke out at Samsung's SDI Plant that's Making the Galaxy S8 Battery | Main | Apple's CEO Tim Cook Greeted with a Loud Cheer by Apple Store Staff in Glasgow Scotland » February 08, 2017 Intel CEO Brian Krzanich makes Major Plant Announcement in Oval Office with President Trump   Earlier today Patently Apple posted a report noting that it was interesting to see Companies from Japan, China and South Korea willing to work with President Trump to bring jobs to the U.S. while the contribution made by American companies thus far Silicon Valley has to been to line up and complain about a 90 day ban in several Muslim countries that Obama had first deemed dangerous. I further noted that hopefully Tesla and other responsible U.S. companies would step up to the plate in the coming years and hit some home runs bringing more manufacturing jobs to the U.S. because whining produces nothing but ill will. As the report was being posted some great news came from the Oval Office with Donald Trump and Intel's CEO about a new plant in Arizona as noted in the video below from CNBC.   Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, where the company announced it will invest $7 billion in a factory employing up to 3,000 people.   The factory will be in Chandler, Arizona, the company said, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area will support the factory. Krzanich confirmed to CNBC that the investment over the next three to four years would be to complete a previous plant, Fab 42, that was started and then left vacant.     The 7 nanometer chips will be produced there will be "the most powerful computer chips on the planet," Krzanich said in the Oval Office with the Trump administration. Most Intel manufacturing happens in the U.S., Krzanich said.   "America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation," Krzanich said in a statement. "Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located." For more on this read the full CNBC report here.   It's refreshing to see a top Silicon Valley giant make a commitment to bringing more jobs to the U.S. Way to go Krzanich, you're a great example of being a proud American company wanting to make America Great Again.

This is an innovative and absolutely new concept not only in Bangladesh but also in the rest of the world, Kazi I Huque, chief executive of Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd, told The Daily Star in an interview recently. Grameen Intel soon plans to go for large-scale marketing of the bangle that has been named Coel; it will be available at a price of Tk 1,000 to Tk 1,200, said Huque, who is also the finance director for Intel Corporation. A unique feature of the bangle is that it can detect and alert the presence and level of indoor air pollution, particularly carbon monoxide, during daily activities like cooking that often involves burning wood, charcoal or animal dung, said Huque. The smart bangle, especially designed for pregnant women, can play an important role in improving maternal health. Photo: Star “We developed and designed the bangle in Dhaka, and took help from Intel to install the silicon in it.” Coel is a water resistant bangle made of high quality durable plastic. The device lasts for 10 months, the entire pregnancy period, without charging and is also programmed to deliver about 80 pregnancy related wellness messages. The messages have been taken from an UN Foundation initiative called MAMA-Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action, which are used by 7.5 million women through 160 institutions in 54 countries. Grameen Intel has translated the short messages on -- proper diet, vaccination, when to see a doctor, and preparations for delivery -- into Bangla and installed in the bangle. The device does not require internet connectivity to function. It is crucial that a pregnant woman gets the right information at the right time, making Coel the right device to meet such advisory needs. This device can be set up according to the pregnancy dates and it will provide the pregnancy related messages accordingly -- around two messages each week -- to ensure the good health and wellness of the mother and the child. Huque said they have piloted this device and found positive feedback, with some recommendations. Currently, they have only one size, which fit around 60 percent of all women. “This is too big or too small for some women, so we need to work on it.” The country's leading social business company plans to market Coel directly and in some cases, they will join hands with a few non-governmental organisations that are working on health issues. Huque has 16 years of experience with Intel in their finance division and has led many worldwide investment projects. Prior to Intel, he worked as a technology consultant for EDS, now a division of HP. Grameen Intel is also working on e-agro solutions and some other software that helps increase crop productivity. The company has developed different software for use in other countries as well. From Bangladesh, they run business in two other countries -- India and Cambodia. In India the company has a partner and they joined hands with IFAD, a UN organisation in Cambodia. “We are currently running a project in India that is similar to the one in Bangladesh. We are using new technologies there and trying to find solutions to reduce their cost of agro production and help increase productivity.” The company is developing a portable digital soil testing kit that will automatically test soil conditions and recommend necessary fertilisers. “On average, this kit will help increase production by around 30 percent, though it also depends on weather and rainfall,” Huque said. In 2008, Craig Barrett, then chairman of Intel Corporation, and Nobel Peace laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus announced to create a social business along with Intel and Grameen. They signed a memorandum of understanding and started the company next year. On Bangladesh's prospects in the digitisation process and investment in high-tech industries, Huque said it needs to establish huge infrastructure and connectivity like roads, power generation, and internet accessibility. At the same time, it needs to increase government investment in developing quality manpower. “If we can develop infrastructure properly and ensure high quality human resources, investment will not be an issue.” And only then, global giants will show their interest in investing here in Bangladesh, he added.

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service Intel Unveils Security Readiness Program to Help Prevent Cybercrime in Health Care WEBWIRE – Wednesday, February 8, 2017 Intel has teamed up with over 40 solution providers to create the Healthcare Security Readiness Program, aimed at helping to prevent breaches, including cybercrime hacking and ransomware. Nearly 90 percent of health care organizations  often seen as vulnerable targets lagging in security compared with peers in other industries, such as financial services  have experienced a breach in the past two years.1 Intel will share more about the program and results at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) 2017 event from 12 to 1 p.m. EST Monday, Feb. 20. Intel and multiple industry partners will also run an interactive group security readiness workshop and information sharing session at HIMSS 2017 from 2-5 p.m. EST Wednesday, Feb. 22. Press Kit: Advancing Data-Driven Health Care Solution Through its collaborations, the Intel program is already addressing the security capabilities of more than 60 health care organizations across nine countries, shining light on priorities across eight types of breaches and ransomware along with strengths, weaknesses and opportunities across 42 security capabilities. According to the FBI, ransomware is expected to become a $1 billion a year crime in 2016, up 6,000 percent from just $24 million in 2015.2 The average total cost of a breach is now $4 million2, with health care leading all industries in terms of per capita impact at $355 per patient record breached. Ransomware, software that blocks access to data in exchange for payment, has severely disrupted health care with some infections causing health care organizations to shut down and send some of their patients elsewhere.3 To help health care organizations understand where they stand in terms of security and how they measure relative to their peers and the industry, the Healthcare Security Readiness Program provides one-hour complimentary and confidential workshops. In addition to assessing maturity, priorities and capabilities, health care organizations also learn through this engagement how their security capabilities relate to HIPAA, NIST, PCI DSS, ISO2700x, CIS, and GDPR requirements. Ransomware is the highest priority type of breach, and health care organizations show a wide spread in readiness from having as little as only 17 percent of the relevant security capabilities to having up to 85 percent, said Jennifer Esposito, general manager of Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation. The average readiness for ransomware across health care is only 58 percent revealing that there is much room for improvement in security capabilities to mitigate risk. The programs findings show that even foundational capabilities such as Security Incident Response Plans are severely lacking, with only a 58 percent average level of implementation across health care. Health care organizations can supplement existing regulatory, data protection law and standards compliance activities with this valuable additional security readiness input to better inform future security decisions, reduce risk of breaches and ransomware, and pave the way for improved patient care.

The factory will be in Chandler, Arizona, the company said, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area will support the factory. Krzanich confirmed to CNBC that the investment over the next three to four years would be to complete a previous plant, Fab 42, that was started and then left vacant. The 7 nanometer chips will be produced there will be "the most powerful computer chips on the planet," Krzanich said in the Oval Office with the Trump administration. Most Intel manufacturing happens in the U.S., Krzanich said. show chapters Intel CEO: To invest $7B in Arizona chip factory    Wednesday, 8 Feb 2017 | 1:02 PM ET | 02:17 "America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation," Krzanich said in a statement. "Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located." After the announcement, Trump tweeted his thanks to Krzanich, calling the factory a great investment in jobs and innovation. Tweet: "Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst" It comes as the technology industry has pushed back against the Trump administration, amid mounting pressure to move manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. There will be no incentives from the federal government for the Intel project, the White House said. Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. The White House had said earlier that Vice President Mike Pence would speak on Wednesday with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a member of Trump's business advisory council, whose companies had also signed onto the brief. Intel has been criticized in conservative publications such as Breitbart, for laying off thousands of staffers, despite an influx of visa requests. — Reuters contributed to this report. show chapters Intel CEO announces new investment in the US    Wednesday, 8 Feb 2017 | 1:10 PM ET | 00:48 Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous    To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

The contract, which is seen by many industry experts as unnecessary and shady, will see Sibton Switch Systems Limited – a company formed only in August 2015 – run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. Initial figure sighted by DAILY GUIDE as the cost submitted by Sibton to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for the implementation of the retail payment system was GH¢4,667,414,340.82. What raises eyebrows is the fact that two other entities that bid for the same contract – Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Vas Intel Files For Annulment Minutes of a tender committee meeting dated Monday, July 04, 2016, capture the bids submitted by all the three interested companies. The tender committee, chaired by Mr Innocent Asamoah, in its remarks after the evaluation of the tenders, concluded that all three were responsive and met their expectations and so awarded the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. This led Vas InteL Limited to write to the BoG to protest the award of the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. In its letter dated July 25, 2016, Vas Intel wrote that it was conceivably impracticable for the BoG to award a contract to Sibton within six business days after the opening of tenders on July 4, 2016. According to the letter, “All procurement actions taken by the BoG pursuant to Act 663 must be done with a strict and uncompromising adherence to the principles of transparency and fairness so as to protect and preserve public property and interest, as well as the integrity of the laws governing public procurement within the territory of the Republic of Ghana.” Telecom operators in the country are unhappy about moves by the Central Bank to impose on them a third-party company which will be intermediate in mobile money transactions across different networks. Telecom Operators Outraged The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has bared its teeth at the Central Bank and condemned the move to impose Sibton Switch Systems Limited on the players in the industry. In a letter dated January 9, 2017, the chamber argues that the move by the BoG and Sibton is not in alignment with international standards or benchmarks. They also argue that the fees being charged by the switch are too high and have the potential to undermine the successes chalked by the industry. The Telecoms Chamber, after meetings with banks, mobile money operators and the Central Bank, warned that aside the outrageous costs of the project, the scope was also not well defined and could run the industry into a state of chaos. Case For GHIPSS The Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana. It was incorporated in May 2007 with a mandate to implement and manage interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Industry leaders believe that the BoG should annul the deal with Sibton Switch Systems Limited and offer GhIPSS the needed leverage to continue integrating payment systems like they have successfully done over the past decade.

Trump is scheduled to meet with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Pence will speak via phone with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who sits on the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum. Representatives from Intel and SpaceX did not give details on the meeting, and Tesla did not immediately return The Hill’s request for comment. ADVERTISEMENT An initially burgeoning relationship between the technology industry and Trump abruptly changed course last week when he issued an executive order banning foreign nationals from seven countries with predominantly Muslim populations. The order spurred negative responses from across the tech industry, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Krzanich and Musk also spoke out against the ban. "I have heard from many of you, and share your concern over the recent executive order and want you to know this is not a policy we can support," Krzanich’s told Intel employees, according to The Oregonian. The outcry culminated in an amicus brief against the order jointly filed by over 100 tech companies including Intel, Tesla and SpaceX. However, even after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from the Strategic and Policy Forum, a presidential advisory group, Musk defended his decision to stay, tweeting, “Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?”  Musk added that the travel ban was a prioritized topic during the forum’s first meeting last Friday: At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2017   View the discussion thread.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 February 2017 by Military News Clearwater Compliance Joins Intel Healthcare Security Readiness Program NASHVILLE, Tenn.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Today Clearwater Compliance, a leading provider of hospital cybersecurity and compliance solutions, announced an agreement to join the Intel Healthcare Security Readiness Program to help health & life sciences (HLS) organizations manage their growing cybersecurity risk. An open industry collaboration with multiple industry partners, this program helps healthcare organizations globally with the urgent challenges of breaches and ransomware that have reached alarming levels of frequency and impact, averaging $4 million USD per breach event according to the Ponemon Institute 2016 Cost of a Data Breach Study. Healthcare has the highest per capita cost, averaging $355 USD per patient record breached. Ransomware infections in healthcare in 2016 have resulted in healthcare organizations being severely disrupted to the point of needing to send patients elsewhere. No healthcare organization wants to be lagging the industry and relatively vulnerable to breaches and ransomware. However, it has been a challenge in the past for healthcare organizations to measure how they are doing with their security relative to the rest of the industry. With this readiness program, healthcare organizations can gain valuable insights by assessing their security maturity, priorities and capabilities against the global healthcare industry. A one-hour complimentary confidential engagement enables healthcare organizations to see how their security compares, identify opportunities for improvement, and identify where such improvements may also help with compliance. Healthcare organizations will not only be positioned to both exceed the healthcare industry in security readiness, but will also comply with standards and regulations including National Institute of Standards and Technology, HIPAA and The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. Clearwater will work with healthcare CIOs and CISOs to evaluate priorities across eight key types of breaches and ransomware, and 42 key security capabilities, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards that can help mitigate the risk of security breaches and ransomware. Confidential readiness analysis results and insights will be shared with the healthcare organization. These results show security maturity, priorities and capabilities relative to the healthcare industry, and shine a light on areas where the healthcare organization may be lagging the industry and that require closer attention. “Our goal in 2017 is to leverage Intel’s global data and distinctive program as a new engagement model to give hospital leaders powerful insights to help them protect what they value most – financial stability, brand reputation and patient safety,” said Bob Chaput, CEO and founder of Clearwater Compliance. “We are rolling out a bold plan to introduce the Intel program to the hundreds of hospitals and health systems around the country that have benefited from Clearwater’s solutions. Intel and Clearwater are in pursuit of a common mission centered on empowering hospital leaders to solve healthcare’s toughest cybersecurity challenges so they can stay focused on patient care. And with Intel, we are in an incredible position to seize new growth while bringing value to patient safety and healthcare organizations.” The announcement marks the continued growth across Intel’s extensive partner ecosystem by selecting Clearwater Compliance to join Intel’s Security Readiness Program, a global pilot program. It also comes at an opportune time for Clearwater with the company experiencing record growth and its recent rollout and strong demand for its Cyber Risk Services™ (CRS™) solution. CRS is a new managed solution endorsed by the American Hospital Association that helps hospitals and health systems establish and mature their cybersecurity programs. To get started today on receiving a confidential benchmark analysis, healthcare CIOs and CISOs should visit: http://go.clearwatercompliance.com/healthcare-breach-security-assessment-brought-to-you-by-clearwater-intel-health-and-life-sciences. “Both Intel and Clearwater are aligned in the goals and strategies to help healthcare organizations analyze and improve their security, reduce risk of breaches and ransomware, build patient trust, and enable new technology adoption to improve the quality and reduce the cost of patient care,” said Jennifer Esposito, General Manager of Global Health and Life Sciences at Intel Corporation.

Two impressive facts came to light during the session attended by engineers from various chip making firms. Firstly, AMD's 14nm Zen x86 cores fit into a 10 per cent smaller die than Intel's second generation 14nm processor cores. Secondly AMD's chip construction techniques enabled a reduction in switching capacitance by 15 per cent compared to its existing chips. A report from the ISSCC by the EETimes says that "analysts and even Intel engineers in the session said the Zen core is clearly competitive." Whether AMD can save money on manufacturing, thanks to its more compact die requirements, remains to be seen and can be impacted by many further variables. Looking at the table above you can see that the 14nm Zen x86 quad-core cluster takes up 44mm2, compared to an Intel Skylake quad-core at 49mm2. AMD has previously worked very hard and enjoyed excellent results from design-level enhancements. For example it managed to implement a 30 per cent reduction in layout area by using a high density cell library template for the Steamroller chip design, resulting in both area and power reductions. Switching capacitance with Zen has been reduced by 15 per cent. The white paper notes that AMD moved to metal-insulator-metal capacitors in its latest designs which has "helped lower operating voltages and provide greater per-core voltage and frequency control". The EETimes reports that AMD engineers worked for over a year on reducing switching capacitance.

Posted by Valantar - Wed 08 Feb 2017 10:47 While most of this is too technical for me to fully grasp, it seems that AMDs engineers have done a bang-up job with the design of the Ryzen core. I'm well and truly impressed. As long as performance lives up to expectations (i.e. comparable IPC to BDW-E), I'll probably end up getting at least one Ryzen CPU. Even if final shipping clocks are lower than KBL, an unlocked 6-core for quad core i5-i7 money sounds very good to me. Posted by CAPTAIN_ALLCAPS - Wed 08 Feb 2017 11:57 Interesting that AMD have the smaller core despite their “14nm” fab process having larger feature sizes than Intel's 14nm process. I wonder if this density has costs associated with it (e.g. lower frequencies, more prone to electromigration) or if Intel were simply lazy during the design phase - either because of their lead in the market or because the tick-tock strategy emphasises pushing new chips out the door quickly.

At the latest such event German overclocker 'der8auer' pushed an Intel Core i7-7700K CPU to 7.2GHz. Now this OC champ has published a video on YouTube detailing his experiences of travelling to Taiwan to take part in the ASUS Absolute Zero event and some of the details of the overclock achieved. (Click appropriate icon for to enable English subtitles if you German isn't up to scratch.) The technical overclocking details are discussed from about 5 minutes and 10 seconds onwards. 100 litres of LH - gone in 15 minutes To get the most out of Intel's latest generation chips Asus offered the overclockers access to not just liquid nitrogen (LN), but liquid helium (LH). LH is rather expensive at around €40 Euros per litre, compared with LN at 30 to 40 cents per litre. Furthermore LH is lighter, evaporates much more quickly (one litre lasts about 10s), and needs lancing direct to the CPU, says der8auer. Lancing the LH What you are paying more for is LH's key property - being about 70C lower in temperature than LN. In other words LH is about -269C. In the overclocking world every degree is important in being able to achieve higher OC scores so would that extra cash for the LH be well spent? der8auer says that there are nearly always the additional costs of some CPUs being destroyed by testing, especially with new CPUs where voltage tolerances aren't part of anyone's experience. So what was achieved? der8auer managed to get his Intel Core i7-7700K to overclock to 7,328MHz, claimed to be "the highest speed ever reached by a quad-core Intel CPU". Interestingly, and rather unusually, the best OC was achieved by der8auer with all four cores operating and Hyper-Threading turned on.

Tech Culture by Shara Tibken February 6, 2017 1:53 PM PST @sharatibken Intel drones lit up the Houston sky in an American flag formation during the Super Bowl halftime show. Intel Lady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime show featured something never done before: 300 synchronized drones that danced and created the outline of an American flag. The only problem is, anyone shelling out thousands of dollars for their Super Bowl ticket didn't actually see the drone show. That's because Intel's Shooting Star drones and Gaga's terrifying leap from the roof of Houston's NRG Stadium were taped earlier in the week. Federal Aviation Association regulations about drones -- and a ban of drones within 34.5 miles of the stadium on game day -- meant Intel and Gaga had to film the halftime show's opening sequence early. Intel said other factors that played into the decision to pretape the opening scene were possible weather challenges and the fact the stadium is a dome. Drones, which are typically camera-equipped quadcopters, have become a new consumer and business phenomenon for those interested in remote-controlled vehicles, aerial photography and even aerial racing. As the aircraft have grown in popularity over the past several years, though, drones have become a concern for the government agency responsible for regulating the nation's airspace. The FAA estimates that by 2020, there will be 4.3 million hobbyist drones sold, up from about 1.9 million sold in 2016.

It received a special waiver from the FAA to fly the fleet up to 700 feet in the air. Intel also received an additional special waiver to fly the drones in the more restricted Class B airspace. "Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before, and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's new technology group, said Sunday in a press release. Intel designed the Shooting Star drones for festivals and entertainment events. The quadcopters are equipped with LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and can easily be programmed for any animation. Each weighs only 280 grams, less than the weight of a volleyball, and can fly for up to 20 minutes. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

This after rumor continues to circulate that the upcoming MacBook Pro models would likely be powered by Intel Kaby Lake processors. To those who are unaware, the Kaby Lake is the natural successor to the Skylake processors which are used in the MacBook Pro 2016 models. The rumor is in line with what has been reported six weeks ago which could be a bad thing given that the current line of MacBook Pro has already been criticized for various reasons. One of the complaints the device is facing is having low RAM. Furthermore, a report from Bloomberg stated that Apple is making their own Mac processor. This will be working in tandem with Intel processors for upcoming Mac products in the future. In addition, the report also suggests that the chip will be a logical extension of the processor based on ARM T1. The said ARM-based T1 processor is currently being used to power the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro. This chip is reportedly more efficient and would take on more power management tasks. As a result, the upcoming MacBook Pro will have significant improvements when it comes to increasing battery life. Pixabay Upcoming MacBook Pro variations with Intel Kaby Lake processors The Mac-B4831CEBD5A0C4C might be for two new 13” MacBook Pros that feature function keys. As mentioned above, these models would likely have Intel Kaby Lake processors powering them. If the rumors are true, these chips will have a maximum Turbo Boost of 3.5, 3.7GHz and 4.1GHz, respectively. Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz with 15W Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5GHz with 15W Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 The Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921, on the other hand, might be for three new 13” MacBook Pros that also feature the Touch Bar. Compared to the models above, it would have a slightly higher Turbo Boosts of 3.8GHz, 3.9GHz, and 4.1GHz, respectively. Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1GHz with 28W Intel Iris Plus 650 Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3GHz with 28W Intel Iris Plus 650 Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5GHz with 28W Intel Iris Plus 650 Meanwhile, the Mac-551B86E5844E2388 might be for the new three new 15” MacBook Pro models that also feature the Touch Bar. These models have the same Turbo Boost of 3.8GHz, 3.9GHz, and 4.1GHz, respectively. Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8GHz with 45W Intel Iris Plus 630 Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9GHz with 45W Intel Iris Plus 630 Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1GHz with 45W Intel Iris Plus 630 Still, MacBook fans shouldn’t expect a massive improvement when it comes to performance. Intel Kaby Lake processors only have slight bumps when it comes to Turbo clock speeds and base clock speeds. It is important to realize that efficiency is where Kaby Lake truly outperforms the Skylake. For more news and updates on MacBook Pro and Intel Skylake processors, stay tuned to TheBitBag.

A bit more digging by Paul further turned up that the problem was with Intel’s Atom C2000 family, better known by the codenames Avoton and Rangeley. As a refresher, the Silvermont-based server SoCs were launched in Q3 of 2013 – about three and a half years ago – and are offered with 2, 4, and 8 cores. These chips are, in turn, meant for use in lower-power and reasonably highly threaded applications such as microservers, communication/networking gear, and storage. As a result the C2000 is an important part of Intel’s product lineup – especially as it directly competes with various ARM-based processors in many of its markets – but it’s a name that’s better known to device manufacturers and IT engineers than it is to consumers. Consequently, an issue with the C2000 family doesn’t immediately raise any eyebrows. Jumping a week into the present, since their earnings call Intel has posted an updated spec sheet for the Atom C2000 family. More importantly, device manufacturers have started posting new product errata notices; and while they are keeping their distance away from naming the C2000 directly, all signs point to the affected products being C2000 based. As a result we finally have some insight into what the issue is with C2000. And while the news isn’t anywhere close to dire, it’s certainly not good news for Intel. As it turns out, there’s a degradation issue with at least some (if not all) parts in the Atom C2000 family, which over time can cause chips to fail only a few years into their lifetimes. The Problem: Early Circuit Degradation To understand what’s going on and why C2000 SoCs can fail early, let’s start with Intel’s updated spec sheet, which contains the new errata for the problem. AVR54. System May Experience Inability to Boot or May Cease Operation Problem: The SoC LPC_CLKOUT0 and/or LPC_CLKOUT1 signals (Low Pin Count bus clock outputs) may stop functioning. Implication:   If the LPC clock(s) stop functioning the system will no longer be able to boot. Workaround:  A platform level change has been identified and may be implemented as a workaround for this erratum. At a high-level, the problem is that the operating clock for the Low Pin Count bus can stop working. Essentially a type of legacy bus, the LPC bus is a simple bus for simple peripherals, best known for supporting legacy devices such as serial and parallel ports. It is not a bus that’s strictly necessary for the operation of a computer or embedded device, and instead its importance depends on what devices are being hung off of it. Along with legacy I/O devices, the second most common device type to hang off of the LPC is the boot ROM/BIOS– owing to the fact that it’s a simple device that needs little bandwidth – and this is where the C2000 flaw truly rears its head. As Intel’s errata succinctly explains, if the LPC bus breaks, then any system using it to host the boot ROM will no longer be able boot, as the system would no longer be able to access said boot ROM. The good news is that Intel has a workaround (more on that in a second), so it’s an avoidable failure, but it’s a hardware workaround, meaning the affected boards have to be reworked to fix them. Complicating matters, since Atom C2000 is a BGA chip being used in an embedded fashion, an LPC failure means that the entire board (if not the entire device) has to be replaced. Diving deeper, the big question of course is how the LPC bus could break in this fashion. To that end, The Register reached out to Intel and has been able to get a few more details. As quoted by The Register, Intel is saying that the problem is "a degradation of a circuit element under high use conditions at a rate higher than Intel’s quality goals after multiple years of service." Though we tend to think of solid-state electronics as just that – solid and unchanging – circuit degradation is a normal part of the lifecycle of a complex semiconductor like a processor. Quantum tunneling and other effects on a microscopic scale will wear down processors while they’re in use, leading to eventual performance degradation or operational failure. However even with modern processors the effect should take a decade or longer, much longer than the expected service lifetime of a chip. So when something happens to speed up the degradation process, if severe enough it can cut the lifetime of a chip to a fraction of what it was planned for, causing a chip (or line of chips) to fail while still in active use. And this is exactly what’s happening with the Atom C2000. For Intel, this is the second time this decade that they’ve encountered a degradation issue like this. Back in 2011 the company had to undertake a much larger and more embarrassing repair & replacement program for motherboards using early Intel 6-series chipsets. On those boards an overbiased (overdriven) transistor controlling some of the SATA ports could fail early, disabling those SATA ports. And while Intel hasn’t clarified whether something similar to this is happening on the Atom C2000, I wouldn’t be too surprised if it was. Which isn’t to unnecessarily pick on Intel here; given the geometries at play (bear in mind just how small a 22nm transistor is) transistor reliability is a significant challenge for all players. Just a bit too much voltage on a single transistor out of billions can be enough to ultimately break a chip. The Solution: New Silicon & Reworked Motherboards Anyhow, the good news is that Intel has developed both a silicon workaround and a platform workaround. The long-term solution is of course rolling out a new revision of the C2000 silicon that incorporates a fix for the issue, and Intel has told The Register they’ll be doing just that. This will actually come somewhat late in the lifetime of the processor, as the current B0 revision was launched three and a half years ago and will be succeeded by Denverton this year. At the same time though, as an IT-focused product Intel will still need to offer the Atom C2000 series to customers for a number of years to come, so even with the cost of a new revision of the silicon, it’s in Intel’s long-term interest. More immediately, the platform fix can be used to prevent the issue on boards with the B0 silicon. Unfortunately Intel isn’t disclosing just what the platform fix is, but if it is a transistor bias issue, then the fix is likely to involve reducing the voltage to the transistor, essentially bringing its degradation back to expected levels. Some individual product vendors are also reporting that the fix can be reworked into existing (post-production) boards, though it sounds like this can only prevent the issue, not fix an already-unbootable board. Affected Products: Routers, Servers, & NASes As a result of the nature of a problem, the situation is a mixed bag for device manufacturers and owners. First and foremost, while most manufacturers have used the LPC bus to host the boot ROM, not all of them have. For the smaller number of manufacturers who are using SPI Flash, this wouldn't impact them unless they were using the LPC bus for something else. Otherwise for those manufacturers who are impacted, transistor degradation is heavily dependent on ambient temperature and use: the hotter a chip and the harder its run, the faster a transistor will degrade. Consequently, while all C2000 chips have the flaw, not all C2000 chips will have their LPC clock fail before a device reaches the end of its useful lifetime. And certainly not all C2000 chips will fail at the same time. Cisco, whose routers are impacted, estimates that while issues can occur as early as 18 months in, they don’t expect a meaningful spike in failures until 3 years (36 months) in. This of course happens to be just a bit shorter than the age of the first C2000 products, which is likely why this issue hasn’t come to light until now. Failures would then become increasingly likely as time goes on, and accordingly Cisco will be replacing the oldest affected routers first, as they’re the most vulnerable to the degradation issue. As for other vendors shipping Atom C2000-based products, those vendors are setting up their own support programs. Patrick Kennedy over at ServeTheHome has already started compiling a list of vendor responses, including Supermicro and Netgate. However as it stands a lot of vendors are still developing their response to the issue, so this will be an ongoing process. Finally, what’s likely to be the most affected on the consumer side of matters will be on the Network Attached Storage front. As pointed out to me by our own Ganesh TS, Seagate, Synology, ASRock, Advantronix, and other NAS vendors have all shipped devices using the flawed chips, and as a result all of these products are vulnerable to early failures. These vendors are still working on their respective support programs, but for covered devices the result is going to be the same: the affected NASes will need to be swapped for models with fixed boards/silicon. So NAS owners will want to pay close attention here, as while these devices aren’t necessarily at risk of immediate failure, they are at risk of failure in the long term.

Intel Celeron/Pentium/Core i3/i5/i7 - NVIDIA vs. AMD Linux Gaming Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 8 February 2017. Page 1 of 4. 40 Comments Five AMD/NVIDIA graphics cards tested on five different Intel Kabylake processors from a low-end $40 Celeron CPU to a high-end Core i7 7700K is the focus of today's Linux benchmarking. Various OpenGL and Vulkan Linux gaming benchmarks were run to see how the RadeonSI and NVIDIA Linux performance evolves from a Celeron G3930 to Pentium G4600 to Core i3 7100 to Core i5 7600K to Core i7 7700K. There's been a lot of requests for a multi-way GPU vs. CPU comparison with modern hardware and games. Given the recent roll-out of Intel Kabylake processors in January and the ever-advancing state of RadeonSI, I figured it was a good time for a fresh comparison. The AMD cards were tested with Mesa 17.1-devel as of earlier this week along with the Linux 4.10 kernel. Those red cards tested were the Radeon RX 480 (Polaris) and Radeon R9 Fury (Fiji) for a modern look at things. Tested with the NVIDIA proprietary 378.09 beta driver atop Ubuntu 16.10 was the GeForce GTX 1050, GTX 1060, and GTX 1080 from the Pascal family. So with those two Radeon GPUs and three GeForce GPUs, they were tested with the Celeron G3930 (dual-core 2.9GHz; 2MB cache), Pentium G4600 (dual-core + HT 3.6GHz; 3MB cache), Core i3 7100 (dual-core + HT 3.9GHz; 3MB cache), Core i5 7600K (quad-core 3.8GHz; 4.2GHz turbo; 6MB cache), and Core i7 7700K (quad-core + HT 4.2GHz; 4.5GHz turbo; 8MB cache). All the tests happened on the same MSI Z270-A PRO motherboard, 2 x 8GB DDR4-2400MHz Corsair memory, and Samsung 950 PRO 256GB NVMe SSD system running Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 and then the aforementioned driver configurations for the latest RadeonSI and NVIDIA look. AMDGPU-PRO wasn't tested since most Linux gamers now are using RadeonSI as well as because AMDGPU-PRO doesn't yet support Ubuntu 16.10. A variety of OpenGL and Vulkan benchmarks were run for this multi-way comparison. All of the benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner with the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

The modular philosophy in AMD's construction-core processors could never find the type of integer-heavy parallel workloads it needed to shine. At the same time, Intel continually extended its consistent advantage in manufacturing technology every year, while pushing AMD out of the mobile and server markets almost entirely. The red team claims it's now back and ready to compete in every CPU metric, including logic gate density. In a paper published as part of the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), the company claims that its Zen cores have a 10% advantage in die size compared to "Competitor A's" processor built on a 14-nm process.  EETimes' Rick Merritt says this is a reference to Intel's Skylake sixth-generation Core CPUs.   Zen Competitor A Tech 14nm 14nm Cores 4 Cores, 8 Threads 4 Cores, 8 Threads Area 44mm2 49mm2 L2 512KB, 1.5mm2 per core 256KB, 0.9mm2 per core L3 8MB, 16mm2 8MB, 19.1mm2 CPP (nm) 78 70 Fin Pitch (nm) 48 42 1x Metal Pitch (nm) 64 52 Standard 6t SRAM (mm2) 0.0806 0.0588 Metal Layers 12 with MiM 13 with MiM Table data: ISSCC via EETimes A logic gate density advantage over Intel would be quite an impressive feat, but this news requires a little bit of seasoning. These figures come from AMD alone, since Intel doesn't release die size information. All of Intel's Skylake CPUs carry onboard graphics, but the IGP portion reportedly has not been counted in these measurements. Intel engineers may be the only persons truly capable of identifying exactly what parts of the die are specific to the IGP. Intel's die could also include logic for features like vPro that may not be present in Zen. Smaller die sizes typically lead to cost savings for silicon manufacturers, though other factors also impact manufacturing costs. The fact that Intel runs its own manufacturing plants while AMD relies on third-party manufacturing from companies like Global Foundries and Samsung surely plays a role in determining AMD's production costs. Merritt goes on to comment on the techniques AMD has reportedly employed to reduce Zen's switching capacitance by 15% when compared to existing chips. Zen is apparently the first design where AMD used metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, a move that's said to allow reduced processor voltage and more fine-grained control over per-core frequency and voltage. AMD has claimed several times that Zen will compete toe-to-toe with Intel's desktop offerings when it comes to performance and power consumption. Now, the red team is saying that it is more than competitive with Intel with respect to silicon density. We can't wait to get Ryzen chips in the lab and tell you how AMD's latest squares up against Kaby Lake.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Trident Capital spins out cybersecurity-focused firm and launches $300 million fund Bérénice Magistretti@bmagistretti February 8, 2017 5:30 AM Tags: cybersecurity, funding daily, top-stories, Trident Capital, Trident Capital Cybersecurity Above: Sean Cunningham, managing partner at Trident Capital Cybersecurity Image Credit: Trident Capital Cybersecurity Trident Capital Cybersecurity, which spun out of Trident Capital in 2015, announced today that it has closed a $300 million venture fund — Fund I — that will invest primarily in early stage cybersecurity companies. Managing directors Alberto Yépez and Don Dixon, who cofounded the new fund, were investing managing directors at Trident Capital. Sean Cunningham, former director of strategic investments at Intel Capital, joined as managing partner, and Will Lin, of Trident Capital, came on as vice president. Yépez, Cunningham, and Dixon together made 30 cybersecurity investments during a nearly 20-year period at Trident, Intel Capital, and now Trident Capital Cybersecurity, with 16 exits to date. These include Accertify (acquired by American Express), Qualys (Nasdaq: QLYS), Signio (acquired by Verisign), Solera Networks (acquired by Blue Coat Systems), and Sygate (acquired by Symantec). The San Mateo, Calif.-based VC firm will be investing in security startups across five sectors, namely Internet of Things (IoT), secure payments and fraud, next-generation identity platforms, behavioral analytics, and privacy and security. The team has already backed five companies through Fund I — 4iQ, Appthority, Bayshore Networks, ID Experts, and IronNet Cybersecurity — and will be sourcing investments globally, with a focus on the U.S., Canada, Israel, and Northern Europe. “There’s no question that sector-specific funds typically have better returns over the course of their life,” said Cunningham in an interview with VentureBeat. “The reason we raised a $300 million fund is because we wanted to be able to invest two-thirds of the money in early stage and a third in growth stage, as well as be able to actually lead investments and have a key holding in these companies.” According to Cunningham, cybersecurity used to be very expensive for investors. However, that’s changed over the past few years in both the private and the public markets. “We feel really bullish about the fact that we raised a fund now because we feel the pricing is very reasonable,” he said. Moreover, security needs have increased for both businesses and consumers. From mainframe to PCs, mobile, cloud, and IoT, devices are becoming increasingly connected and therefore increasingly vulnerable to hacks. The fact that hackers are able to monetize on the dark web is a major motivator, Cunningham said. Hackers’ “business models” allow them to make money via ransomware, phishing scams, and other types of attacks. “Passwords are the weakest links in the system right now,” said Cunningham. Yahoo is an example of millions of passwords and identities being stolen in the enterprise sector. But these threats are also extending to the state level, with state-sponsored attacks like North Korea’s Sony hack and Russia’s cyberattack on the Democratic National Convention. The heterogeneous nature of cyber attacks makes them difficult to counter. “That’s one of the things about cybersecurity, there is no silver bullet,” said Cunningham. “That’s why you see this proliferation of security companies trying to solve these problems. Everything has to be more automated, and that’s why you’re starting to see the AI (artificial intelligence) companies getting more traction.” SentinelOne, which just raised $70 million, is one example of a startup that is developing a more automated security response. Or take Exabeam, which is working on predictive software to fight security breaches. The San Mateo, Calif.-based startup just raised $30 million. According to Cunningham, all this activity spells opportunity for cybersecurity-focused funds. For instance, Jay Leek, who recently left Blackstone to join Florida-based VC firm ClearSky, will lead a $300 million cybersecurity fund. In terms of returns, Cunningham argues that the exit window for most cybersecurity companies is four to seven years, which is an aggressive timetable. He expects his portfolio companies to be acquired rather than go public. Yet the sector already has a handful of unicorns — including CloudFlare, Cylance, and Okta — some of which are widely expected to exit via an initial public offering (IPO). We’ll see whether their experiences lend credence to his prediction. Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

The details were leaked in the macOS 10.12.4 public beta and were unearthed and interpreted by Apple blog Piker Universum. The data reveals references to a new set of products with ids that do not match current Apple devices. Further analysis of these products and a peek at Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processors reveals that the 2017 MacBook Pros will all be updated to Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake platform. Essentially, every 6th generation Skylake processor in the current lineup will be replaced by an equivalent Kaby Lake processor. So the i5 6360U is replaced by the i5 7260U, the i5 6267U by the i5 7267U, the i7 6700HQ by the i7 7700HQ, and so on. Kaby Lake is just a minor advancement over Skylake, so owners of current MacBook Pros will see no incentive to upgrade. Intel’s Kaby Lake platform is fractionally more efficient than Skylake and hence, runs fractionally faster, resulting in a minor bump in performance. The internal graphics does get a slight upgrade, resulting in reduced battery consumption during playback of certain types of 4K files, but that’s about it. Apple sacrificed RAM capacity and speed on the altar of battery life last year. This year’s Kaby Lake MacBooks might be available with support for DDR4L memory and up to 32GB of RAM. This will indeed be good news for professionals with RAM-heavy workloads (rendering, game development, image processing, etc.). Sadly, Piker Universum says that there’s no mention of new iMacs, Mac Minis or a Mac Pro in the beta update. There’s also no mention of a MacBook or MacBook Air. The latter is expected to be officially killed off soon enough.

Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime light show – prerecorded to comply with prohibitions on flying drones over people – was choreographed by Intel Corp. It provided a dramatic backdrop for the performance and also illustrated the ways large companies are embracing unmanned aircraft in sometimes unexpected ways. The registration of drones used for business has gone from a trickle to a flood. Only a handful were listed in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft registration database a few years ago. That number swelled to 6,683 as of the end of 2016, according to agency records analyzed by Bloomberg. The list of companies reads like a who’s who of top U.S. corporations, along with startups seeking to catch the wave of unmanned commerce. It comprises old-guard railroads like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s BNSF, utilities including Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co., and technology companies like Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and a company that has supplied drones to Alphabet Inc.’s Project Wing. In December alone, Disney Co.’s TV network, ABC Inc., registered 29 drones, bringing its total to 51. 37,000 More “It does show that there is a lot of interest, and this industry is, pardon the pun, really ready to take off,” Tom McMahon, a spokesman for the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a Virginia-based trade group, said in an interview. The companies listed in the FAA’s database are the ones the public knows about. Most unmanned aircraft now are being registered in a new, separate online system that the agency has ruled isn’t public information. It has a total of more than 37,000 additional commercial drones registered since the agency created it a year ago. Intel, for example, had registered 112 drones in the public database, giving it the second-largest total. Those were for an earlier light show. The hundreds it has used for the Super Bowl and other recent events are registered separately in the nonpublic system, spokeswoman Krystal Temple said in an e-mail. Temple declined to say how many unmanned craft the company has in the U.S. “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before,” Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, said in a statement. The portion of Gaga’s performance including the light show was taped in advance, Temple said. U.S. regulations prohibit drones from flying over people in most cases. The Federal Aviation Administration also imposed a temporary drone ban around the stadium. Before drone commerce can really flourish, the FAA must expand the current regulations that mostly prohibit flights above people and over long distances, according to the Small UAV Coalition trade group. A UAV is an unmanned aerial vehicle. “But what we are seeing, which is incredibly exciting, is companies are investing in this,” Michael Drobac, the coalition’s executive director, said in an interview. The Washington-based group represents companies including Amazon and Intel. The use of drones for business has benefited from regulatory changes. The FAA put rules in place last year allowing more routine commercial drone flights during the day, at low altitudes and within sight of an operator. It also set up a waiver process to allow night operations or other expanded missions if an applicant proves they are safe. While automated drone deliveries and other far-flung uses won’t be permitted initially, the agency is laying the foundation for expansion. It is crafting a proposal to allow some drone flights over people, for example. Gaga’s roof-top opening portion of the Super Bowl show, with drones forming a star-like backdrop, also was pretaped prior to the game and fed into the broadcast, Temple said. Fans in the stadium had to watch it on video, just like people at home. Intel also produced a holiday show with Disney in Florida from Nov. 20 through Jan. 8, with drones forming a green Christmas tree and a blue dove, among other effects. Through the end of 2014, there had been only about 230 drones registered with the FAA, almost all by companies manufacturing the devices, such as military supplier Aerovironment Inc., academic institutions researching them or government agencies, according to FAA data. That began to change after the FAA created a process in 2014 for businesses to use unmanned aircraft. By March 2015, at least 100 were being registered per month. The registrations in the FAA’s public database peaked last May with 449. An analysis of more than 5,500 of the initial permits granted for commercial drone flights issued by the FAA before the latest regulations went into effect found that most were for small companies with less than $1 million in annual revenue for purposes involving aerial photography or data collection, according to the AUVSI. Mapping, Agriculture One smaller company hoping to capitalize on the new industry had registered the most drones in the FAA’s system. PrecisionHawk USA Inc., which operates drones for agriculture and mapping, listed 113 of its aircraft, beating out Intel by a single drone, according to the FAA’s data. The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company provides drone services to companies that prefer not to own and operate them. Its remote sensors and mapping tools can be used by insurance agents documenting property damage and by farmers assessing their crops, said Thomas Haun, PrecisionHawk’s vice president of global strategy. The company also has teamed up with Deere & Co. to add value to the data it collects. John Deere tractors can be programmed to automatically fertilize needy patches of soil identified from drone flights. Green Mountain Power Corp., which provides three-quarters of Vermont’s electricity, has 16 drones it uses for maintenance, mostly in emergencies, spokeswoman Kristin Carlson said. It has even used drones to check on whether osprey nests on its poles were abandoned or occupied, Mike Burke, director of field operations, said. ABC’s news division is embracing drones in a big way, said Maria Stefanopoulos, production manager for the Good Morning America show. The network is equipping every one of its field producers with an unmanned aircraft so they can be used to cover disasters and other breaking-news events, Stefanopoulos said. A project to film a volcano in Iceland two years ago showed the value of mounting cameras on unmanned aircraft, she said, and they’ve been used since for coverage of forest fires and tornadoes. “We realized it was going to change the way we told stories forever,” she said.

Earlier this month, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple will release new Kaby Lake models of the MacBook Pro this year, and new code in the latest version of MacOS backs up his prediction. According to MacRumors, Apple blog  Pike's Universum has uncovered several bits of code in the macOS 10.12.4 beta that seem to point toward new laptops. The code refers to three new motherboards that don’t exist in any MacBook Pros at the moment, but use the same power management as the current models  identifiers in the OS’ code, all of which do not correspond to any existing models. According to the Pike’s Universum blog, we should see the following upgrades when WWDC rolls around: 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar  Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W)  Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W)  13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar  Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W)  Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W)  Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W)  15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar  Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W)  Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W)  Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W)  Will be replaced by the:  Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W)   Everything else we know about the new MacBook Pro 1. The new MacBook Pro has a stunning Touch Bar The Touch Bar is by far the most interesting feature on the new MacBook Pro, and it’s also one of the things we were pretty certain about before it was launched. Essentially, Apple has removed the function keys, replacing them with a reactive, OLED screen that changes depending on what you’re doing. There were some pretty convincing demos of the hardware last night, and our hands-on also suggests it’s more than a gimmick. 2. The new MacBook Pro is up to 2.3x faster than the last model Apple has squeezed a quad-core i7 chip into the new MacBook Pro along with 16GB of LPDDR3 onboard memory. That means that the new MacBook Pro is up to 2.3 times faster than its predecessor. Graphics-card wise, the 15in version also uses a Radeon Pro 450 or 455 with 2GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching. Battery life is always an important factor, and the new MacBook Pro offers pretty impressive performance here, too. Both the 13in model will give you around ten hours of use before needing a charge.  3. Apple has removed three familiar features From the outside, one of those is obvious. For years, a glowing Apple logo has been a hallmark of every MacBook, but it’s gone on the MacBook Pro. The new 12in MacBook is the only other laptop in Apple’s range without a glowing logo, so its removal could have something to do with the introduction of new screen technology. Second, and somewhat less obviously, Apple has also done away with the startup chime on the new MacBook Pro – and that’s because it boots up as soon as it’s opened. Lastly, the MagSafe charging connector is gone, although that also disappeared on last year's 12in MacBook.  4. The new MacBook Pro has Touch ID As expected, the new MacBook Pro comes with Touch ID, so you can use your fingerprint to make purchases, open encrypted files and more. The Touch ID module is on the right-hand side of the new Touch Bar, and it’s controlled by a brand-new “T1” chip. 5. The are NO normal USB ports Both MacBook Pros feature no USB ports, but do come with four Thunderbolt or USB Type C ports each. That means any of those points can be your charging socket, and you'll still have room for another three devices. They're also capable of 10GB/sec transfer speeds. Of course, you're going to have to buy at least three dongles to get the most out of them... 6. There are THREE new MacBooks Apple is also unveiling another 13in MacBook Pro without all the new-fangled features of the two flagship models. As you’d expect, it’s slightly less powerful and customisable than the other two models, but it does cost a bit less, too. It features actual physical function keys, and it will have two fewer Thunderbolt ports. All models are available in either Space Grey or Silver. 7. The new MacBook Pro costs A LOT more money See related  The iPhone 7 needs a new cable to connect to the new MacBook Pro — and that's not cool iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7: Which smartphone should you buy in 2016? In addition to a total removal of regular USB ports, the main issue with the new MacBook Pro is its astonishing price. The new MacBook Pro starts at £1,449, but you have to pay at least £1,749 to get four USB Type-C ports and the new Touch Bar, too. As for the 15in version? That starts at an eye-watering £2,349.  8. The new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter Apple has shrunk the size of both the 13in and the 15in MacBook Pros. The new 13in laptop is 14.6mm thick, 23% smaller, and weighs just 3.02 pounds – half a pound less than the outgoing version. The 15in MacBook Pro is 20% smaller, and only 15.5mm in width. It also weighs 4.02 pounds, just one more than the 13in MacBook Pro. 9. And that’s partly because of a new keyboard The new MacBook Pro’s thinness owes a lot to its brand-new keyboard. Apple has introduced a double-hinged, butterfly-style keyboard to the new MacBook Pro, and it’s a development of the one we’ve seen on the 12in MacBook. As a result, the new keyboard has considerably less key travel than before, and that’s something you’ll probably have to get used to. At least the already fantastic trackpad is now twice as large as before.  10. The new display is LUSH Apple has improved the new 15in MacBook Pro’s Retina display so it’s even better than before. This time around, the screen is 67% brighter and has a 67% better contrast ratio than the previous version. Apple says the new panel can display 25% more colours too, so pictures will look more vibrant and natural. 11. Storage isn’t bad either All the new MacBook Pro’s come with an SSD of at least 256GB in size, but if you’re willing to pay that can extend to extend to 1TB on the 13in MacBook Pro and 2TB on the 15in model. Storage is up to 50% faster, too. 12. Cheaper models could be coming soon According to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kup Apple is getting ready to release 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, with Intel’s brand new Kaby Lake processors. As written by MacRumours,the report goes on to say that production fo both laptops will start in the early third waurter around July. If you’re waiting for a price drop, it looks like you may be in luck. Kuo predicts the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro – the one without the TouchBar – should be discounted this year, partly to bring it in line with the 13-inch MacBook Air it’ll eventually replace.

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. With a 4K display, pen and all-metal body, can HP strike twice with the larger Spectre x360 15? You bet. Last year, HP released its revamped Spectre x360 13-inch Ultrabook with accolades all around. I named it my favorite laptop of the year, besting the venerable Dell XPS 13. The question remained, however, if the company would apply its lessons-learned formula to the Spectre's bigger brother, the Spectre x360 15. HP answered that question in early January at CES with the brand new — and similarly designed — Spectre x360 15-bl062nr. The new Spectre x360 15 is bigger and heavier, but after a week with the device, I'm very impressed with HP's engineering. Here is why this laptop is the best value for your money. About this review The HP Spectre used here in testing is the Kaby Lake Core i7 (i7-7500) version with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. HP provided an early review unit, and the Spectre x360 15 is expected to go on sale on February 24. What's new 2017's changes and improvements The Spectre x360 15 is a different beast amongst laptops. Usually, once you hit the 15-inch range, the devices start packing 45W quad-core processors with much bigger, heavier chassis. It's even rarer to find a two-in-one convertible at this size. In that sense, the Spectre x360 15 is best thought of as a large Ultrabook. For instance, the Spectre x360 15 packs "only" a 15W dual-core processor, and while it has a dedicated NVIDIA GPU, it's more of a boost than it is for gaming graphics. (More on that below). HP kept the display to only 4K instead of offering two versions (Full HD and 4K). The reason for that choice is consumers overall preferred the 4K variant with one caveat. They wanted the battery life of the Full HD version. That initiated the second change: a larger battery. By putting in a 79-WHr battery, HP bucked a trend and made the 2017 Spectre slightly thicker than last year's model. That's a bold move but absolutely the right one. (The laptop is still just 0.70 inches (17.78 mm) thin.) There is also the massive reduction in the display's bezel, something that HP says a whopping 97 percent of customers wanted. The result is this year's Spectre has bezels that are 70 percent thinner than last year's model, coming in at just 4.65mm. The overall design language mirrors the smaller 13-inch variant, with the only other change being the color, a dark ash instead of silver. Packed to the brim HP Spectre x360 15 specifications Category HP Spectre x360 15 Processor Intel Core i7-7500U 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) 2.7GHz base, up to 3.5GHz Turbo Internal storage Up to 1TB PCIe SSD RAM 8GB or 16GB DDR4 (2 DIMM) Display 15.6" 4K (3840x2160) Touch and pen enabled 72% Adobe color gamut; 282 PPI 340 nits brightness Direct bonded IPS Graphics NVIDIA GeForce 940MX 2GB DDR5 VRAM Ports 1x USB-A 3.1 3.5mm jack Full SD card 2x USB-C (1x Thunderbolt 3; 1x USB-C 3.1) 1x HDMI 2.0 Camera Front-facing HP TrueVision FHD IR webcam with integrated dual-array digital microphones Windows Hello enabled 88-degree, wide-angle field of view Wireless 2x2 802.11ac WLAN Bluetooth 4.2 Battery 79.2 WHr 90W AC fast-charge adapter Weight 4.42lbs (2kg) Dimensions 0.70" (H) x 14.00" (W) x 9.88" (D) 17.78 mm (H) x 355.6 mm (W) x 253.49 mm (D) Color HP finish in dark ash silver Audio Bang & Olufsen with dual speakers Active Pen Yes, included in box An all-metal beauty HP Spectre x360 design The 15-inch Spectre is very similar in design to the 13-inch version, just bigger. That's a good thing, too, because HP found, in my opinion, the sweet spot between form and function. The HP Spectre x360 15 is made from CNC machined aluminum, and it's outstanding. The all-metal feel makes it rather heavy at 4.42lbs (2kg), but that just adds to the quality feel. It's a dense beast that very much mimics the beautiful qualities of Apple's devices. Nonetheless, HP maintains a very distinct look with the Spectre x360 series, and no one will mistake it for a MacBook Pro. Unlike the 13-inch version, the 15 is offered in "dark ash silver." To my eyes, it looks like black and copper, but there is a subtle distinction. It is not quite that black but more ash. While the all-silver 13 looks great, I think dark ash silver offers a very handsome, professional look. This was an excellent color choice by HP, especially with those contrasting polished edges. I think the Spectre x360 is by far one of the nicest looking and quality feeling Windows laptops, even besting Microsoft's Surface series. (Yes, I just wrote that.). One slight downside of the dark ash silver is it is slightly prone to collecting fingerprints, but it is not nearly as bad as the Razer Blades of the world. You still can't open this laptop with one hand, however, because you need some help holding down the base. My only real gripe with this laptop is a small one. Due to the x360 hinge that lets you turn the device into a tablet, you can shake the laptop until the display slips down on its hinge. To be clear, this doesn't happen when typing in your lap, but it's an apparent side effect of having a large, 15.6-inch touch display with an aluminum chassis. I'm not sure how you engineer around that, as the hinge needs to be flexible enough to switch to tent, presentation and tablet modes without much force. Overall, while the Spectre x360 15 is one of the heavier 15.6-inch laptops that's not quad-core, its outstanding build quality, machined body, and elegant color choice makes this notebook feel substantial and worth every dollar. It's just outstanding. 4K glory HP Spectre x360 15 display The argument over the need for 4K displays in laptops won't end anytime soon, but no one can deny that they look great. The real concerns are impacts on performance and battery life. The 4K (3840 x 2160) IPS display HP uses in the Spectre x360 15 is a different class than Sharp IGZO display found in Dell's XPS line. That's not a knock. I like this display panel in the Spectre x360 15. The colors are not overly vibrant, and while the screen is glossy, I didn't find reflections too bothersome. HP also says the display is non-PenTile and features Panel Self Refresh technology. PenTile screens have had mixed reactions, with some hating the subpixel layout with noticeable grain and other distractions. Luckily, those criticisms do not apply here as non-PenTile is smoother and clearer. Panel Self Refresh technology helps save power when viewing static images. Both are neat to have, and display nerds will likely welcome them. The brightness is OK. HP claim 340 nits, which is enough for indoor use under bright lights. Users will struggle outdoors, though, with reflections and the lack of more power. Companies such as Samsung add "outdoor modes" with displays peaking at 500 nits for short periods. I had no issue with general use. The display also gets dim enough to be used comfortably in a dark bedroom without flooding the room with light and waking a spouse. HP's 4K display is one of the most natural, easy-on-the-eyes 4K panels I have used. Color accuracy, rated at 72% Adobe, is not the highest but it is more than fine for most professionals. The look of this screen is the opposite of AMOLED and other technologies that offer high contrast at the expense of looking fake. I sometimes find Dell's IGZO 4K overwhelming, but I did not have such a problem here. Inking is here HP Spectre x360 15 pen When HP released the Spectre x360 13 last year, many people asked about the missing Active-Pen support. There is no such confusion with the 15-inch version. The Spectre x360 15 comes with a very nice Active Pen. There is no slot in the laptop to carry the pen but HP threw in an excellent leather-ish sleeve to protect the laptop and hold the pen. To be clear, the Active Pen takes a battery (one AAAA cell), it does not rely on Bluetooth, and the display detects the pen when hovering and not only direct contact (like a passive stylus). There is no pairing required. You just put in the battery and begin writing on the display. The pen has two buttons, both of which are configurable using HP's pen app that runs in the taskbar. HP's pen feels a lot like Microsoft's Surface Pen. Both are metal-ish and while the Surface Pen is heavier at 22g, compared to the 17g for HP's pen, the balance and diameter are very similar. I applaud HP for that choice. It's a splendid pen, especially because it's included with the laptop. Although, I am scratching my head as to why HP's pen has a silver accent instead of a laptop-matching copper one. Microsoft Surface Pen (top) vs HP Active Pen (bottom) Being able to flip the Spectre x360 into tablet mode and use the pen, or just use it on the display to navigate, use Stick Notes or draw, is a great option to have. It works well. I'm not an artist, but I can't say it felt radically different from use on the Surface. HP also says the Spectre x360 15 will work with the forthcoming N-Trig Universal Pen, which should work on Wacom tablets and all Windows products that use a stylus. So you'll likely have even more options later this year when that device is released. A typing delight HP Spectre x360 15 keyboard The Spectre x360 15's keyboard is even better than the 13-inch version's keypad. You get the same 1.5mm of key travel, but because the keys are now ash silver you get much better contrast with the backlit chicklet keys. HP spent a lot of time on the so-called "force curves" of each key, or how the keys feel when you push them down, as well as on the return. Ideally, the keys bounce back at the same rate as your fingers leave them. If it's too fast the key pushes your finger, too slow and the key feels stuck. Whatever the company did, it worked. HP also ensured that each key feels the same, for consistency. The Spectre x360 15's keyboard is likely my favorite keyboard on any laptop. It's outstanding. There's no flex on the body when typing on a desk, and it is just a satisfying experience. I will, however, raise one possible issue: the Home key. HP put the Home-key row to the right of the keyboard, running down vertically. That means the Home key is to the right of the Backspace key. While I had no issues with this setup when typing, a few friends of mine hit the Home key instead of Backspace repeatedly. Lenovo did something similar years ago, and that did bother me because the Backspace key was also regular sized. HP's is double-wide, which is why it's not a problem for me. That and you must stretch your pinky to reach the Home key. If you're sensitive to such changes, however, it may take you some time to adjust. I type at a brisk 75 words per minute, and with a proper typing position, the key placement is just fine. Still not "Precision" but also not bad HP Spectre x360 15 trackpad HP opted for a very spacious layout for the trackpad, which is preferred especially once you enlarge the right-click area under Settings. It's a very smooth, satisfying trackpad with adequate clicking that won't annoy you each time you use it in a quiet room. The copper trim looks great, and it serves as an excellent peripheral guide when looking for the trackpad. My beef with the trackpad is the same Why-not-Precision? an argument I made with the 13-inch Spectre. HP uses Synaptics hardware, which is fantastic, but it also chose to enable Synaptics software for the trackpad configuration. While you can configure plenty of gestures, clicks, speed, scrolling and more, it's not quite as smooth as a Microsoft-tuned Precision version. To be clear, HP could use the same hardware but enable Precision software instead. (Synaptics can do both, and the choice is up to the manufacturer.) The result is some Windows 10 gestures, such as the three-finger swipe, often have delays or don't register at times. While I never experienced issues with Precision, I saw quirks with the Synaptics software. Nonetheless, despite my snobbery over Precision versus Synaptics, it is still a superb trackpad one. In the future, HP could let customers decide which setup to use, as it already does on some of its business lines. Dual power HP Spectre x360 15 audio Unlike the 13-inch Spectre, the 15-inch version only has two speakers instead of four. Those extra speakers allowed for high-quality audio when in tablet mode. The 15, however, opts for just two but they are discretely amped and larger than on the 13. They are also placed on the left and right sides of the keyboard and fire upwards. As usual, HP has had these speakers tuned by Bang & Olufsen, and they come with equalizer software for further configuration by the user, for specific modes such as music and movies. HP also include an audio switch app that lets you change quickly between internal and external speakers, headphones and microphones. One small bug is present, however. Occasionally, when scrolling with two-fingers on the trackpad I can hear a faint audible buzz coming from the speakers. For context, you would need to have your ear placed near the speaker to hear it or be in an exceptionally quiet room. To me, this falls into coil whine territory where some people are very sensitive to it while others are not. Overall, the speakers are nice, though I find them to be very "crispy." While they can get thunderous, I do wish there were some more bass and richness to the audio to make it perfect. Well hello, Windows Hello HP Spectre x360 15 camera The front-facing web camera is one of the better ones I have used on a laptop. It's full HD and wide-angle making it ideal for conference calls or just a Skype chat. HP kept the camera on the top bezel, giving it a standard-looking view. Like the 13-inch version, the 15-inch features two IR cameras that can be used with Windows Hello, which lets you log into Windows 10 using just your face. It's exceptionally fast and accurate though you may have to fine tune it for use in different lighting conditions. HP Spectre x360 benchmarks Performance-wise, the Spectre x360 15 holds its own. Since the dual-core i7-7500U is the same found in the 13-inch version, performance is nearly identical using Geekbench 4.0. Geekbench 4.0 benchmarks (Higher is better) Device Single Core Dual Core Surface Studio 4,200 13,323 Razer Blade 14 3,774 12,638 XPS 13 (9360) Core i7 4,120 7,829 Spectre x360 13" 4,100 7,469 Spectre x360 15" 4,098 8,022 Apple MBP 13 (2016) 4,027 7,802 Surface Book Core i7 3,948 7,415 For traditional computing, the Spectre x360 15 is on par with other Kaby Lake Ultrabooks on the market. Where things get more interesting is when we turn to more GPU-intensive tasks, such as CUDA scores. Geekbench 4.0 CUDA (Higher is better) Device Score Razer Blade 14 GTX 1060 139,603 Surface Book GTX 965M 63,029 Surface Studio GTX 965M 53,685 Spectre x360 15" 28,868 Compared to other devices with dedicated GPUs from NVIDIA, the Spectre's CUDA scores are low, but that is expected with the 940MX because it's an older, lighter chip. OpenCL gives a better comparison with similar Ultrabooks that lack dedicated GPUs. Geekbench 4.0 Graphics OpenCL (Higher is better) Category Score Surface Book GTX 965M 64,108 Apple MBP 13 (2016; Iris Pro) 31,022 HP Spectre x360 15 28,868 XPS 13 (9350) Iris 26,436 XPS 13 (9360) HD620 19,410 Surface Book HD520 18,197 Here you can see the benefit of the NVIDIA 940MX. Its performance is very like Intel's Skylake-era Iris Pro graphics. My hunch is HP would have used Iris or Iris Pro in the Spectre x360 15 too, but that variant from Intel for Kaby Lake is not yet on the open market. HP likely wanted to release this laptop sooner than later so it tossed in a comparable performing 940MX as a substitute. Looking at PCMark using Home Conventional 3.0, the Spectre x360 15 gets a score of 2,472 and is rated better than 41 percent of all results, slightly edging out the notebook average. That test is more about the CPU and overall performance than graphics. PCMark (Home Conventional 3.0) Device Score Comparison Surface Studio 980M 3,281 Better than 67 percent of all results Spectre x360 15 2,472 Better than 41 percent of all results Using 3DMark Cloud Gate, which is ideal for most consumer-level PCs and laptops, the Spectre gets a reasonable 8,185 making it "better than 28 percent of all results" in that category. Turning things up to the extreme is 3DMark Time Spy (DirectX 12), which is reserved for gaming rigs, desktop PCs, VR-enabled computers and anything considered high-end. As you'd expect, the 940MX does not do well here. 3DMark (Time Spy) Device Score Comparison Razer Blade Pro 1080 5,591 Better than 71 percent of all results Surface Studio 980M 2,862 Better than 16 percent of all results Surface Studio 965M 1,531 Better than 7 percent of all results Spectre x360 15 613 Better than 1 percent of all results For casual gaming, the Spectre x360 15 does just fine. I had no issue playing Pinball FX2 with high graphics for instance. More intense but still casual games such as Killer Instinct and ReCore, are also perfectly playable with high framerates and medium-to-high graphics, if you tune it down to 720p resolution. That may sound bad, but 720p upscaled on a beautiful 4K display still looks darn good. The bottom line is the NVIDIA 940MX is there to help with those 4K graphics when using Office, the web and any Windows apps. While it will help with gaming this laptop is not advertised as, nor should it be thought of as, a gaming laptop . Finally, the Spectre x360 15 sports a Toshiba THNSN5xxxGPUK NVMe SSD in 256GB and 512GB versions. It's not clear what HP will use for 1TB drives, as those have not shipped yet. As far as SSDs go, they are PCIe, which is good. But they are not the fastest on the market. CrystalDiskMark (Higher is better) Device Read Write Razer Blade Pro 2,571 MB/s 2,467 MB/s Razer Blade (960 EVO) 2,079 MB/s 1,809 MB/s MacBook Pro 13 (2016) 1,549 MB/s 1,621 MB/s Spectre x360 1,332 MB/s 589 MB/s Surface Studio 1,327 MB/s 512 MB/s XPS 13 (9360) 1,287 MB/s 794 MB/s HP Spectre x360 15 1,128 MB/s 862 MB/s Surface Book 1,018 MB/s 967 MB/s The drive seems to be user-replaceable, however, though it is a bit tricky to change. In usage, the SSD performed quite well, so it's probably best to not get fixated too much on the numbers. Just know there are much faster, albeit expensive, storage options available. More room, less noise HP Spectre x360 15 heat and fan noise The 15-inch Spectre x360 has two fans located on each side of the laptop for cooling. That means there are now two vent grills on the sides instead of one, as with the 13-inch version. Because of those two fans and more room to work with, the cooling is significantly better and quieter. Some people have observed that the fan on the 13-inch kicks in even when it's idle, that is not the case with the 15-inch version. Under heavy load the Spectre x360 15 never gets above 111℉ (44°C) Using an IR camera, temperatures under load from ten minutes of gaming peaked at 111℉ (44°C) directly out of the vents. The laptop itself only got warm near the top (above the keyboard), and there it never went above 100℉ (38°C). Under regular usage (web browser or watching videos), the laptop's hottest spot was around 81℉ (27°C). Overall, this is a well-cooled machine, and it is comfortable to use in most scenarios, even under heavy load. All day and quick charging HP Spectre x360 15 battery life HP put a large, 79WHr battery in the new Spectre x360 15 so that with a 4K panel it can still match the battery life of last year's Full-HD version. Using a closed-loop video test, HP pushed 12.75 hours of battery. Of course, a video loop test is not real world use, which is tougher to measure, especially if you're using the dedicated GPU. In my experience, the laptop lasted at least six hours but often pushed eight. That may not sound super impressive, but we are talking 16GB of RAM, Core i7 and a dedicated GPU, all driving a 15.6-inch 4K panel. I think that eight-hour mark is the sweet spot, and most people should be OK with that. HP includes a beefy 90W USB Type-C charger in the box. That's a bigger charger than the one that comes with the 13-inch, which is only 45W, resulting in quicker charges. The included fast-charge ability means you should get around a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes, or from 0 percent to 90 percent in about 90 minutes. Battery life can always be better, but I was content with what I got out of the 15-inch Spectre x360. USB-C and USB-A?! HP Spectre x360 15 ports HP includes two USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 2 ports on the right of the device. Both ports can handle "HP Sleep and Charge, " and one of them is Thunderbolt 3, with no compromises. There is also a full HDMI 2.0 port for video out if Thunderbolt 3 is not used. On the left side, there is a standard USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-A) for legacy users. HP also squeezed in a full SD card reader. That SD slot lets you squeeze in the entire card, too, instead of having to leave it out halfway, like some other laptops. There is also a power button, audio headphone jack and volume rocker for use in tablet mode on the sides. Overall, HP did a great job here giving everyone a little of everything. Is the HP Spectre x360 15 the perfect all-around laptop? While there are more powerful 15-inch laptops on the market, especially ones that feature quad-core processors and beefier GPUs, the HP Spectre x360 15 may be the best all-around laptop yet. I say that for a few reasons, including overall design, build quality, typing, display, battery and performance. Furthermore, while there are quad-core laptops none of them also double as tablets or offer an Active Pen in the box for notetaking. That's a huge advantage, and it puts the Spectre x360 15 in a class all its own. Perhaps the top reason why I love the Spectre x360 15 is the same reason I loved the 13-inch: value. The version tested here comes with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of Storage, Core i7, and a 4K touch display, with a pen, all for $1,499. As HP notes, that's nearly a grand less than a MacBook Pro (which is admittedly a different machine in many ways.) If you want lesser specs, HP will happily sell you a Core i7 version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage with the same 4K display for $1,279. If you want the top-end (16GB, 1TB of storage), you'll fork over a still reasonable $1,699. Those are some crazy prices for a CNC machined aluminum chassis, 4K touch display, and a small-but-efficient GPU. I'm not sure what other devices out there can do all that the Spectre x360 15 can at this size and for that price. As I noted in my review of the 13-inch model, HP has created a very well balanced PC that has something for everyone. Sure, the trackpad and speakers could be a bit better, but these are minor complaints. The overall experience is excellent, and that's what matters. Toss in Fast Charge, Windows Hello IR camera, an Active Pen and the premium design, and I think it's fair to call the Spectre x360 15 a near-perfect, all-around laptop for students, creatives and professionals. Simply put, the HP Spectre x360 15 does the most, the best — at a great value. See at Best Buy See at HP.com Pros: High-quality CNC build. Best keyboard experience. Windows Hello with facial recognition. Excellent camera placement. Fantastic 4K IPS display. Good battery life with fast recharge. Cons: SSD could be better. Trackpad hardware is great, but the software isn't as good as Precision. Not a light machine at 4.42lbs (2kg). Only dual-core, strictly notebook class.

If you buy a USB-c to HDMI dongle, you will definitely be able to do it at 60Hz.  If it doesn't work, then it's something wrong with your monitor... 0 3 days ago Reply Joe Booth   I received my pre-order of the 1TB version on Friday - I still can't make my mind up whether to keep it. The GPU stuggles to keep the screen fluid in my experience, and can't output 4K at 60hz through HDMI. I wonder if the author could test it over USB C as I have to buy a new monitor anyway. If it can output 4K @ 60hz through usb3/thunderbold then I may consider keeping it. Otherwise I think I may return and get a surface book. The hinge design annoys me though, as you have to detach and retach to go between the 2 modes. No good if I have photoshop/illustrator open as it won't let the screen detach... 0 3 days ago Reply edit1754 Non-PenTile = Fantastic! For those unaware, PenTile, more specifically RG/BW Pentile, replaces the RGB in each pixel with either only RG or only BW. It is commonly regarded to be a deceptive marketing practice. HP's 2016 Spectre x360 15t used it, and so did all of HP's other consumer-class 15.6" models that claimed the 4K resolution. Be aware that HP's Envy 15, Pavilion 15, and Omen 15, 4K options/models, seem to not yet have moved on from this, but this is certainly a very important step in the right direction towards total honest display advertising in the market. The HP Spectre x360 15t 4K, and Dell Inspiron 7000 4K are two laptops that have moved away from pentile and towards the full-RGB matrix. (though there's a whole 'nother issue with the FHD panels in the new Inspiron) More info here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/5jiwcg/psa_the_4k_uhd_3840x2160_d...

Even though I loved it... The battery drain of 12-15% per day when it was turned OFF was just too much. Getting this 15 inch Spectre x360 instead is a win win situation. Especially since this has discrete graphics, higher display resolution, ~20 nits brighter display, pen support, and micro SD slot. The 15 inch fixes/adds all the things I didn't like about the 13 inch. Even if the 15 inch turns out to have the battery drain when off too, then hopefully HP gets a solution for it soon. Even if it doesn't either way it will be worth that minor defect for all these features at this price. 0 4 days ago Reply eshy This is the laptop that will probably replace my Surface Pro 3.

I'm also not into the whole brand loyalty/disloyalty thing. I try each laptop, judge on its own merits.

Flaw in Intel Atom chip could crash servers, networking gear Intel is 'implementing and validating a minor silicon fix' to resolve the issue Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 08 February, 2017 07:08 0 - - - - print email A flaw in an old Intel chip could crash servers and networking equipment, and the chipmaker is working to fix the issue. The issue is in the Atom C2000 chips, which started shipping in 2013. The problem was first reported by The Register. In January, Intel added an erratum to the Atom C2000 documentation, stating systems with the chip "may experience [an] inability to boot or may cease operation." The chip is the last among Intel's line of short-lived low-power Atom chips for servers. It was used in microservers but also networking equipment from companies like Cisco, which has issued an advisory about a product defect related to a component degrading clock signals over time. A clock signal degrade hurts the ability of the chip to carry out tasks. Intel is trying to fix the issue but declined to comment on when it'll deliver an update. "There's a board level workaround that we are sharing with customers now," an Intel spokesman said in an email. "Additionally, we are implementing and validating a minor silicon fix in a new product [update]." The usual server refresh cycle is three to five years, but networking and storage equipment -- which the C2000 is targeted toward -- is often used for five to 10 years. Companies using the chip should contact their field representative or system provider for updates. Intel continuously finds flaws in its chips, and it fixes them over time. But one that may crash a system is serious and could put data at risk. Intel also had an issue with its Skylake chip that could freeze PCs under certain conditions when executing complex workloads. The chipmaker has given up making Atom chips for servers, replacing them with the Xeon-D and Xeon-E3 chips.

Creative Commons Zero Pixabay The security vulnerabilities that you need to consider when developing open source software can be overwhelming. Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) IDs, zero-day, and other vulnerabilities are seemingly announced every day. With this flood of information, how can you stay up to date? “If you shipped a product that was built on top of Linux kernel 4.4.1, between the release of that kernel and now, there have been nine CVEs against that kernel version,” says Ryan Ware, Security Architect at Intel, in the Q&A below. “These all would affect your product despite the fact they were not known at the time you shipped.” ryan-ware_01.jpg Ryan Ware, Security Architect at Intel Used with permission In his upcoming presentation at ELC + OpenIoT Summit, Ryan Ware, Security Architect at Intel, will present strategies for how you can navigate these waters and successfully manage the security of your product. In this preview of his talk, Ware discusses the most common developer mistakes, strategies to stay on top of vulnerabilities, and more. Linux.com: Let's start from the beginning. Can you tell readers briefly about the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), 0-day, and other vulnerabilities? What are they, and why are they important? Ryan Ware: Excellent questions. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a database maintained by the MITRE Corporation (a not-for-profit organization) at the behest of the United States government. It’s currently funded under the US Department of Homeland Security.  It was created in 1999 to house information about all publicly known security vulnerabilities. Each of these vulnerabilities has its own identifier (a CVE-ID) and can be referenced by that. This is how the term CVE, which really applies to the whole database, has morphed into meaning an individual security vulnerability: a CVE. Many of the vulnerabilities that end up in the CVE database started out life as 0-day vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities that for whatever reason haven’t followed a more ordered disclosure process such as Responsible Disclosure. The key is that they’ve become public and exploitable without the software vendor being able to respond with a remediation of some type -- usually a software patch. These and other unpatched software vulnerabilities are critically important because until they are patched, the vulnerability is exploitable. In many ways, the release of a CVE or a 0-Day is like a starting gun going off.  Until you reach the end of the race, your customers are vulnerable. Linux.com: How many are there? How do you determine which are pertinent to your product? Ryan: Before going into how many, everyone shipping software of any kind needs to keep something in mind. Even if you take all possible efforts to ensure that the software you ship doesn’t have known vulnerabilities in it, your software *does* have vulnerabilities. They are just not known. For example, if you shipped a product that was built on top of Linux kernel 4.4.1, between the release of that kernel and now, there have been nine CVEs against that kernel version. These all would affect your product despite the fact they were not known at the time you shipped. At this point in time, the CVE database contains 80,957 entries (January 30, 2017) and includes entries going all the way back to 1999 when there were 894 documented issues. The largest number in a year to date was 2014 when 7,946 issues were documented. That said, I believe that the decrease in numbers over the last two years isn’t due to there being fewer security vulnerabilities. This is something I’ll touch on in my talk. Linux.com: What are some strategies that developers can use to stay on top of all this information? Ryan: There are various ways a developer can float on top of the flood of vulnerability information. One of my favorite tools for doing so is CVE Details. They present the information from MITRE in a very digestible way. The best feature they have is the ability to create custom RSS feeds so you can follow vulnerabilities for the components you care about. Those with more complex tracking problems may want to start by downloading the MITRE CVE database (freely available) and pulling regular updates. Other excellent tools, such as cvechecker, allow you to check for known vulnerabilities in your software. For key portions of your software stack, I also recommend one amazingly effective tool: Get involved with the upstream community. These are the people who understand the software you are shipping best. There are no better experts in the world. Work with them. Linux.com: How can you know whether your product has all the vulnerabilities covered? Are there tools that you recommend? Ryan: Unfortunately, as I said above, you will never have all vulnerabilities removed from your product. Some of the tools I mentioned above are key. However, there is one piece of software I haven’t mentioned yet that is absolutely critical to any product you ship: a software update mechanism. If you do not have the ability to update the product software out in the field, you have no ability to address security concerns when your customers are affected.  You must be able to update, and the easier the update process, the better your customers will be protected. Linux.com: What else do developers need to know to successfully manage security vulnerabilities? Ryan: There is one mistake that I see over and over. Developers always need to keep in mind the idea of minimizing their attackable surface area. What does this mean? In practice, it means only including the things in your product that your product actually needs! This not only includes ensuring you do not incorporate extraneous software packages into your product, but that you also compile projects with configurations that turn off features you don’t need. How does this help? Imagine it’s 2014. You’ve just gone into work to see that the tech news is all Heartbleed all the time. You know you include OpenSSL in your product because you need to do some basic cryptographic functionality but you don’t use TLS heartbeat, the feature with the vulnerability in question. Would you rather: a. Spend the rest of your work working with customers and partners handholding them through a critical software update fixing a highly visible security issue? b. Be able to tell customers and partners simply that you compiled your products OpenSSL with the “–DOPENSSL_NO_HEARTBEATS” flag and they aren’t vulnerable, allowing you to focus on new features and other productive activities. The easiest vulnerability to address is the one you don’t include. Embedded Linux Conference + OpenIoT Summit North America will be held on February 21-23, 2017 in Portland, Oregon.

Intel CFO Robert Swan indicated in the Q4 2016 earnings call that "a product issue limited profitability during the quarter, forcing the biz to set aside a pot of cash to deal with the problem." Intel updated the documentation for the C2000 family last month with a description of a clock flaw characterized by Intel as "a degradation of a circuit element under high use conditions at a rate higher than Intel’s quality goals after multiple years of service." Last week, Cisco warned that a number of its products sold prior to November 16, 2016 "contain a faulty clock component that is likely to fail at an accelerated rate after 18 months of operation," and the affected systems utilize the C2000 family. A number of other manufacturers also utilize the chips, so be on the lookout if any of your devices that contain an Atom C2000 start acting up or stop working entirely.

The Core i7-7740K will 'replace' the Core i7-7700K (because it's been so long since it was released) and will feature the same 4C/8T goodness from the Kaby Lake architecture, on the 14nm+ process node.   The purported Core i7-7740K will have a 4.3GHz base clock speed, while boosting up to 4.5GHz - it'll also have 8MB of L3 cache, and a 112W TDP.   The more interesting CPU is the purported Core i5-7640K, which is the first Core i5 CPU on the HEDT platform. This will be a direct answer to AMD's threat in the high-end space with their purported Ryzen R7 1800X processor (I'm seriously loving the name the more I type/say it).   Intel's upcoming Core i5-7640K will have 4C/4T on the LGA 2066 socket, 4GHz base clock with 4GHz boost clock, 6MB of L3 cache, and the same 112W as the LGA 1151-based Core i7-7740K.   We should find out about Intel's purported new processors in the coming weeks, which I'm sure will launch right after AMD unleashes Ryzen onto the world next month.

Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course Welcome to my world of The Unexplained – yes, you're welcome to it More like this Cisco Atom Hardware Data Centre Intel Atom chips have been dying for at least 18 months – only now is truth coming to light Vendors clocked C2xxx flaw when returns spiked 7 Feb 2017 at 23:10, Thomas Claburn Exclusive The flaw in Intel's Atom C2000 family of chips has been vexing Intel's hardware customers for at least a year and a half, according to a source at one affected supplier, but it wasn't immediately obvious that Intel's silicon was to blame. The well-placed insider, who spoke to The Register on condition of anonymity, said the problem – which results in bricked systems – became apparent to engineers at product makers when the return rate on gear spiked about 18 months ago. It took additional time to figure out that Intel's hardware was responsible. The vendor in question worked with Intel engineers during this period to replace affected units under manufacturer warranty. Then about two months ago, Intel acknowledged the issue was with its chip blueprints, the source said. In January, with the publication of errata documenting the flawed LPC clock outputs in its Atom C2000 system-on-chips, Intel acknowledged the issue publicly. Around the same time, chief financial officer Robert Swan said profitability during Intel's fourth quarter last year had been constrained by an unspecified product issue, prompting the company to establish a cash reserve to deal with the blunder. Cisco's subsequent publication of an advisory warning that a variety of its products could fail after 18 months of use because of a faulty clock component appeared to The Register to be related to Intel's disclosure, in no small part because Cisco's devices contained Intel Atom C2000 line chips. Both companies have repeatedly refused to acknowledge the linkage, despite repeated hectoring from The Register. At the same time, they have refused to offer any correction or claim that their respective issues are unrelated. "We are working with all customers to implement the fix we have available now," an Intel spokesperson told The Register on Tuesday. "We aren't providing additional details on which companies." Companies that appear to be affected by the Atom C2000 flaw include not only those mentioned in our previous report – Aaeon, Dell, HP, Infortrend, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgate, Netgear, Quanta, Supermicro, Synology, and ZNYX Networks – but also ASRock Rack (C2550D4I and C2750D4I), iXsystems (FreeNAS Mini), Seagate (NAS Pro), and Sophos (UTM firewall SG 125). Our industry source suggested that non-disclosure agreements with Intel prevent companies from releasing or discussing information about technical issues related to Intel products. Some Intel customers, however, have trouble maintaining the code of silence. A spokesperson for Synology contacted The Register on Tuesday in response to a languishing query, saying that "Synology is investigating this issue together with Intel." The spokesperson subsequently asked to revise the company's statement with alternative facts that omitted any mention of Intel. This code of silence, in the opinion of our source, ends up hurting Intel's hardware customers because they get blamed for products that fail, even when the fault is Intel's. Public's right to know Had Intel spoken up sooner and named customers with affected products, there might not be so many forum posts and online product reviews lamenting unexplained failures of devices running Atom C2000 chips. "I think it's better for the public to know [the failure is] not because of our product," the source said. Intel's hardware partners and their customers are still trying to sort things out. A Reg reader reported that when he asked about his Seagate NAS Pro, which contains an Intel Atom C2338, Seagate technical support offered a response suggesting disinterest in any potential problem: "Regarding the Intel Specifications Sheet on the Atom C2000 series in reference to item AVR54, Seagate does not maintain any information on device failure rates or failure rates that may exist due to the above related bulletin." Synology said it is still investigating the issue and that while it "has not seen any indication that this issue has caused an increase in failure rates for DiskStation or RackStation models equipped with Intel Atom C2000 series processors," the company intends to post an advisory when additional information becomes known. Others report more positive interaction with affected companies. "I had an ASRock C2750D4I (Intel Atom C2750-based Mini ITX board) that died after 26 months of use!" a Reg reader told us. "Yes, 2 months out of its warranty! Thankfully ASRock replaced the board with no fuss at all ... ASRock just said that the board wasn't repairable and sent a replacement, nothing was ever said regarding why it died." ® Updated to add In a statement today, pfSense-maker Netgate said: "Netgate has become aware of an issue related to a component manufactured by one supplier that affects some of our products. This is a widely used component that is used by many companies around the world ... if the component fails, the system will not successfully reboot. We are working with the component supplier and our manufacturing partner to resolve this issue as quickly as possible."

The issue is in the Atom C2000 chips, which started shipping in 2013. The problem was first reported by The Register. In January, Intel added an erratum to the Atom C2000 documentation, stating systems with the chip "may experience [an] inability to boot or may cease operation." The chip is the last among Intel's line of short-lived low-power Atom chips for servers. It was used in microservers but also networking equipment from companies like Cisco, which has issued an advisory about a product defect related to a component degrading clock signals over time. A clock signal degrade hurts the ability of the chip to carry out tasks. Intel is trying to fix the issue but declined to comment on when it'll deliver an update. "There's a board level workaround that we are sharing with customers now," an Intel spokesman said in an email. "Additionally, we are implementing and validating a minor silicon fix in a new product [update]." The usual server refresh cycle is three to five years, but networking and storage equipment -- which the C2000 is targeted toward -- is often used for five to 10 years. Companies using the chip should contact their field representative or system provider for updates. Intel continuously finds flaws in its chips, and it fixes them over time. But one that may crash a system is serious and could put data at risk. Intel also had an issue with its Skylake chip that could freeze PCs under certain conditions when executing complex workloads. The chipmaker has given up making Atom chips for servers, replacing them with the Xeon-D and Xeon-E3 chips. Intel is now dedicating Atom chips to drones, robots, gateways, smart devices, and internet of things products. Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

After being knocked out of the market due to missed commitments, getting back in would typically be ugly. Server buyers tend to be very conservative and would be slow to move to a new processor anyway. AMD is taking a very interesting path to market that pulls from its core differentiating feature and builds on its increasing financial success to overcome this shortcoming. Let’s chat a bit about this because the process is unique and I think it might represent a best practice for how to speed an enterprise-class product to market and assure customer advocacy for it. AMD’s Sustaining Advantage over Intel If I were to sum up one of the top competitive advantages that AMD has had over Intel, it is that it asks OEM customers what they want and then tries to build it. Intel tells its customers what it’s going to build. Historically, there has been more tension between OEMs in all segments and Intel with regard to direction and policies, while AMD’s issues have historically been more about meeting roadmap promises. In short, AMD, being smaller, has historically been more responsive and often favored in terms of relationships, but this has been offset by an historic problem with execution. Lisa Su, AMD’s current CEO, who came from IBM, has been addressing AMD’s execution issues with near amazing success. AMD’s steadily improving financial performance supports these results and if AMD can convince OEMs that they will get the relationship they want, with the reliability they need, getting design wins shouldn’t be a problem. Clearly this is being showcased in its game console, PC, and graphics car businesses. But getting these systems into companies might still be problematic. Cloud Strategy In general, new systems like this have a cart and horse problem, in that large companies don’t want to buy technology in this class until it has been proven in large companies, making it nearly impossible to get around an entrenched vendor. However, we have a new class of companies at scale that are far more open to new technology, largely because their performance and cost needs are typically well ahead of where technology is currently performing. These are the massive cloud providers that are building data centers the size of small towns with energy requirements that rival some cities. They will often take products that haven’t even completed a beta cycle of aggressive testing and sometimes even use them in order to address these critical needs. And given that they tend to have cutting-edge fail-over capability tied largely to their critical ability to shift loads of all sizes near instantly, their environments are far more tolerant of as-yet untested technology. What AMD is doing is putting its parts in development into these environments under load to assure that they are reliable and that the parts are tuned to the unique requirements of these massive cloud providers. In theory, if the coming Naples offering is specifically designed to handle affordably (in power used and cost) the massive variety of loads of a major cloud provider, then it should not only be ideal for on-premises cloud offerings but for a wide variety of similar requirements from enterprise buyers. In short, by the time Naples comes to market, there should be a number of high-visibility, high-load cloud companies that will be happy to advocate that it performs as promised, potentially effectively addressing that cart and horse problem. Wrapping Up: Best Practice Generally, I think it ideal, particularly for a new product, to partner with end customers in that product’s development because it should assure a far better match to the needs of the related market. I’m not sure this process should ever be broken; it used to be really hard to collaborate in this fashion because doing so securely across company lines, particularly through OEMs, was virtually impossible. But given that cloud providers often work directly with companies like AMD, and collaboration tools have massively improved over the last decade, suddenly there is an opportunity for even parts makers like AMD to build relationships with those that use their products. Through this, it can uniquely understand current and emerging needs and come up with products that can address those needs. I also think this process was likely refined in AMD due to its unique position with Microsoft and Sony’s game console divisions, which have to work tightly with the parts providers because, although their solutions are very different from servers, they too have to push the performance envelope while keeping costs down. It won’t be until next year around this time when we’ll know if this process is actually effective for Naples, AMD’s new server part. But it should be, because working closely during development with those who will use a new product has been proven in most professions going back hundreds of years. Apparently, we in tech are sometimes slow learners. So, what is strange about this path is that it is unusual. I think everyone should work with users to develop new products.

The contract, which is seen by many industry experts as unnecessary and shady, will see Sibton Switch Systems Limited – a company formed only in August 2015 –run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. Initial figure sighted by Daily Guide as the cost submitted by Sibton to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for the implementation of the retail payment system was GH¢4,667,414,340.82. What raises eyebrows is the fact that two other entities that bid for the same contract – Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Vas Intel files for annulment Minutes of a tender committee meeting dated Monday, July 04, 2016, capture the bids submitted by all the three interested companies. The tender committee, chaired by Mr Innocent Asamoah, in its remarks after the evaluation of the tenders, concluded that all three were responsive and met their expectations and so awarded the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. This led Vas InteL Limited to write to the BoG to protest the award of the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. In its letter dated July 25, 2016, Vas Intel wrote that it was conceivably impracticable for the BoG to award a contract to Sibton within six business days after the opening of tenders on July 4, 2016. According to the letter, “All procurement actions taken by the BoG pursuant to Act 663 must be done with a strict and uncompromising adherence to the principles of transparency and fairness so as to protect and preserve public property and interest, as well as the integrity of the laws governing public procurement within the territory of the Republic of Ghana.” Telecom operators in the country are unhappy about moves by the Central Bank to impose on them a third-party company which will be intermediate in mobile money transactions across different networks. Telecom operators outraged The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has bared its teeth at the Central Bank and condemned the move to impose Sibton Switch Systems Limited on the players in the industry. In a letter dated January 9, 2017, the chamber argues that the move by the BoG and Sibton is not in alignment with international standards or benchmarks. They also argue that the fees being charged by the switch are too high and have the potential to undermine the successes chalked by the industry. The Telecoms Chamber, after meetings with banks, mobile money operators, and the Central Bank, warned that aside from the outrageous costs of the project, the scope was also not well defined and could run the industry into a state of chaos. Case for GHIPSS The Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana. It was incorporated in May 2007 with a mandate to implement and manage interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Industry leaders believe that the BoG should annul the deal with Sibton Switch Systems Limited and offer GhIPSS the needed leverage to continue integrating payment systems like they have successfully done over the past decade.

Built for power users with robust graphics applications, ClearCube’s A6106SLW Workstation delivers Xeon E3-1200 v5 processors or 6th generation Intel Core i7 and i5 processors, Intel C236 chipset (Skylake), up to 64 GB DDR4-2133 MHz RAM, and NVIDIA’s Quadro K420, K1200, K2200, and K4200 video cards. Ten A6106SLW Blade PCs mount in a chassis that takes up only six rack units (10.5 inches). A6106SLW Workstations are specially designed with embedded PCoIP® host cards that host IP connections from remote desktop zero client end point devices. Zero clients support up to four displays, have no memory, operating system or local storage. All processing takes place on the A6106SLW Workstation, and only pixel changes are transmitted to the zero client devices over an encrypted protocol. No data exists at the desktop location, which is a huge deterrent to data theft and security breaches. Zero clients are so secure they are used by financial trading floors, NSA and other intelligence agencies. „The new A6106SLW allowed us to design a flexible environment for our demanding workflow, and gave the best utilization of resources,” said Jeff Vandehey, Sr. Desktop System Administrator, LAIKA animation studio. „While running in a controlled location, this set of powerful workstations delivers top of the line graphics through a simple connection back to the desktop where it’s needed.” Designed to eliminate PCs from work areas, the centralized ClearCube architecture locates workstation assets—including powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and storage drives—in the customer’s secure datacenter. Graphics rendering and other computation-intensive applications are typically associated with the roar of noisy GPUs and fans running at full speed, all the time. The A6106SLW virtually eliminates this grievance by optimizing power requirements (lowering fan speed) and sequestering the workstation to a secure datacenter, away from the work area. By centralizing workstations, organizations can power and cool A6106SLWs more cost-effectively than distributed PCs, and IT staff can return workstations to service quicker.

But patenting an idea does mean that you think it’s worth protecting, and I really can’t say that’s true about Intel’s curved laptop concept. Don't Miss: This is our best look yet at the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus The patent, which was filed for in 2015 and uncovered by The Leaker, shows a laptop with a curved screen and curved base. This makes sense, insofar as TVs and phones have recently started to have curved displays, and someone at Intel thought there’s probably some marketing mileage in bringing that over to laptops. But when you start to actually look at the design, you can see that this is objectively the worst thing to come out of a design studio since two Samsung engineers sat down and thought “hey, maybe we should make this battery thinner.” The curved base is obviously necessary to accommodate the curved screen, but I imagine typing on it would be hellacious and it won’t exactly sit nicely on a table. Also, imagine trying to fit this in a backpack that’s been designed to take a nice, normal, flat laptop. Then there’s the curved screen itself. Curved gaming monitors make a tiny amount of sense, because you’re normally the only one using them, sitting in a dark room far away from the rest of the human race. But for almost all other applications, they suck. Consider The Verge‘s recent review of a Samsung TV with a curved screen, “which means that it picks up and seemingly magnifies every glimmer of light in the room.” This is true of almost any curved display, and means that you’ll never be able to have two people simultaneously viewing your laptop screen, ever. In conclusion: a curved laptop would be bad in every possible way. The only redeeming feature of this patent is that it is not yet reality, which means there’s time for Intel to kill the idea with fire and never speak of it again.   Trending right now: 8 paid iPhone apps on sale for free right now Apple leaks details about the upcoming MacBook updates The Mars rover just sent back data that has scientists completely stumped See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next The White House employee who ensures Trump doesn’t get hacked has been fired BGR News Why Customers Will Be Back For DIRECTV.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel puts mobile chip failures in its past with first speedy 5G modem Intel researches tech to prepare for a future beyond today's PCs Intel's latest Xeon chips based on Skylake due next year Video Highlights from Interop 2015 A flaw in an old Intel chip could crash servers and networking equipment, and the chipmaker is working to fix the issue. The issue is in the Atom C2000 chips, which started shipping in 2013. The problem was first reported by The Register. In January, Intel added an erratum to the Atom C2000 documentation, stating systems with the chip "may experience [an] inability to boot or may cease operation." The chip is the last among Intel's line of short-lived, low-power Atom chips for servers. It was used in microservers and in networking equipment from companies like Cisco, which has issued an advisory about a product defect related to a component degrading clock signals over time. A clock signal degrade hurts the ability of the chip to carry out tasks. Intel is trying to fix the issue but declined to comment on when it will deliver an update. "There's a board level workaround that we are sharing with customers now," an Intel spokesman said in an email. "Additionally, we are implementing and validating a minor silicon fix in a new product [update]." [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] The usual server refresh cycle is three to five years, but networking and storage equipment -- which the C2000 is targeted toward -- is often used for five to 10 years. Companies using the chip should contact their field representative or system provider for updates. Intel continuously finds flaws in its chips, and it fixes them over time. But one that may crash a system is serious and could put data at risk. Intel also had an issue with its Skylake chip that could freeze PCs under certain conditions when executing complex workloads. The chipmaker has given up making Atom chips for servers, replacing them with the Xeon-D and Xeon-E3 chips. Intel is dedicating Atom chips to drones, robots, gateways, smart devices and internet of things products.

Will AMD Be Launching 17 Ryzen Processors Next Month? Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Tue, Feb 07, 2017 - 2:28 PM Rumor has it that AMD is going to be releasing 17 Ryzen processors that are divided into three series named R3, R5 and R7. The high-end Ryzen processors will be placed into the R7 range and will all be 8-core 16-thread processors that are meant to compete with the Intel Core i7 series. Next you have the mid-range R5 Ryzen CPUs will that are all 6-core 12-thread parts and then at the bottom-end of the stack you have the R3 Ryzen processors that are all quad-core parts that either have no additional threads or a maximum of eight. AMD calls this additional threading SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) technology, which is the equivalent to Intel’s HT (Hyper-Threading) technology. AMD has been able to come up with 17 processors by varying clock speeds and other features for product range differentiation. The AMD R7 1800X or R7 Pro 1800X as some sites are calling it will be the eight-core, 16-thread monster that AMD has been touting since Zen debuted. According to the leaked slide above from some sites in Asia, the clock speeds on that processor might be 3.60 GHz and there is no mention of boost clocks on the leaked processor table. This table shows that AMD will be having six-core Ryzen CPU models and that is interesting as Zen is made of CPU complexes (CCXes) that each contain four cores. That means the existence of 6-core Ryzen processors would mean that AMD has been able to successfully disable part of one of the two CCX units. Rumors still have the AMD Ryzen processors coming our on March 3rd, 2017, but we’ve still seen some people saying that March 7th, 2017 is the date. Both dates are less than a month away, so it will be interesting to see what we can learn before the official release. Just remember that Ryzen is pronounced rye-zen, not rizen! AMD Ryzen R7 CPU Lineup R7 1800X R7 PRO 1800 R7 1700X R7 1700 R7 PRO 1700 The AMD R7 family of processors will feature 8 cores with SMT for a total of 16 threads. These processors will be competing against Intel Core i7-7700, Core i7-7700K, Core i7-6800K and the Core i7-6900K,. The battle between the AMD R7 1700X will be going up against the Core i7-7700K will be one that gamers and performance enthusiasts should be most interested in. AMD Ryzen R5 Series CPUs R5 PRO 1600 R5 1500 R5 PRO 1500 R5 1400X R5 PRO 1400 R5 1300 R5 PRO 1300 The mid-range AMD R5 series of CPUs will 6 core and 4 core variants with SMT enabled for either 12 or 8-threads. These processors will compete against the Intel Core i5-7400 to the Core i5-7600K processors. The AMD R3 series does not have SMT support and they were not compared to any Intel processors in the table. FXi2 Well at least AMD is likely to offer more than 4 cores on a consumer platform. Intel makes you go “extreme” for that. Competition is good for all Arnulf Will fake speculation table turn out to be fake speculation table?

Via Paul Thurrott, Microsoft is offering discounts of up to $250 on several Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 models. The deals include: Microsoft Surface Book – Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 128 GB. $1299, $200 off. Microsoft Surface Book – Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 256 GB, discrete GPU (first-gen). $1649, $250 off.

Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 256 GB. $1049, $150 off. Related Stories Microsoft Going Big With Next Surface Pro Surface Pro 5 Spec Rumors Suggest eSIM In Microsoft's 2017 Tablet Surface Book vs. MacBook Pro 2016 — Which Is Better? Microsoft’s current promotion runs until Feb. 25. While the consumer-level Surface Pro 4 has seen several discounts in the past, the higher-end Book’s rarely sees similar price savings. As Paul Thurrott noted, the Book’s $1,299 promo price is close to the cheapest price Microsoft has charged for the high-end tablet PC. The Surface Pro 4 is Microsoft’s flagship consumer tablet PC and is anchored around a central tablet with laptop-level storage and specifications. The Surface can also be connected to Microsoft’s Type Cover, which is a combo cover-keyboard that provides full typing functionality for the computer. By comparison, the Surface Book is a higher-end counterpart to the Surface Pro series. The premium-priced Surface Book lineup sports specifications in line with more powerful business and enterprise-friendly laptops, making it suitable for applications like photo processing and video editing. Unlike the Type Cover — which is thinner and meant for portability — the Book features a detachable full-sized keyboard that comes with the tablet PC. While Microsoft has yet to formally announce a successor to the Surface Book or Pro 4, both models have some age versus competing models. The Pro 4 and Book were originally launched in late 2015, though they’ve seen incremental updates since then. For a new Surface Pro 5, potential features and specifications that could see upgrades include USB-C support, Intel Kaby Lake or Cannonlake processors and improved Windows 10 integration.

Join For Free In a continuing series of articles sharing what I've learned about Oracle JET, I'd like to extend upon the previous article talking about installing Oracle JET for web application development, and this time look at installing Oracle JET for hybrid mobile application development. Oracle JET is capable of not just building client-side web applications, but thanks to the underlying power of Apache Cordova it can build & deploy hybrid mobile applications too, for Android, iOS and Windows UWP. Installing the base tooling for Oracle JET is relatively easy, and extending it with Cordova is easy too. However installing the tooling for each mobile platform for the uninitiated can be challenging and why I thought I'd attack this "beast" in a separate article to help others. Installing the Oracle JET Prerequisites In the previous article for web application development, I covered what you needed to install for Oracle JET. This included installing Git and NPM first, then via NPM installing Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and the Oracle JET generator. It just so happens this set of packages is the prerequisite for installing the additional hybrid mobile tooling. So, for all intents and purposes, Oracle JET hybrid mobile development is just an extension of Oracle JET web development. While there are certainly some tasks that are mobile specific (such as integrating the camera or GPS), it's useful to understand from a learning perspective that an Oracle JET mobile app is pretty much the same as an Oracle JET web app, just deployed to a mobile device. This means that when things don't work in your JET mobile app because of a bug in your code, but say the Android Emulator is being its usual painful self during debugging, you can often run and test apps in your development machine's browser to get around this sort of development grind. There are a few mobile specific tasks we can't test in the browser, but thanks to the mock plugins provided by Cordova you can actually do a lot. Installing Apache Cordova Having installed the Oracle JET tooling from the previous article, using NPM we can install Apache Cordova for mobile development as follows: npm install -g cordova To check which Cordova version was installed run the following: npm list -g --depth=0 An example result from my Mac: /usr/local/lib
├── bower@1.7.9
├── cordova@6.3.1
├── generator-oraclejet@1.1.0
├── grunt-cli@1.2.0
├── node-inspector@0.12.5
├── npm@2.15.9
└── yo@1.8.4 From here we need to make a choice of which mobile platform we're going to support. Apache Cordova itself supports (at last count) eight different platforms, but Oracle has made the decision upon extending itself on top of Cordova to only support Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps (deployable to Windows 10 devices). Which we choose is up to us and our needs, each of us will need to pick our own poison (as the saying goes, which nicely sidesteps me from any Android-vs-iOS-vs-Windows debates I hope ;-). From a development perspective, it's worth noting of the 3 mobile development platforms we're about to talk about, that is the Android SDK for Android development, Apple Xcode for iOS, and MS-Visual Studio for Windows UWP, only the Android SDK is capable of being installed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux development machines. Xcode is tied to MacOS only, and Visual Studio to Windows only. In Oracle's mobile team when writing tutorials for developers to use, as the Android SDK covers virtually all the PC operating systems that developers can bring to a classroom, we tend to focus on the Android SDK first as a pseudo-universal development platform, as we know (hope?) all students can install this. So I'll cover Android first, but, skip to your favorite mobile platform if you're interested in iOS or Windows instead. Android, the Android SDK and Android Emulator For hybrid mobile development on Android, we require the Android SDK. The Android SDK is either bundled with Android Studio or a separate download from the following page. The SDK is now somewhat obscured as "command line tools" at the bottom of the page, where we find the downloads for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. For this article, we'll assume you download & installed the SDK rather than Android Studio. The SDK zip does not come with any specific version of Android installed, known as an Android API, so you must run the SDK Manager to download these in turn. Once the SDK is installed we start the SDK Manager via <install-dir>/sdk/tools/android(.exe). On opening it for the first time the SDK Manager at the bottom will report it is loading from an external repository to determine what is available for download. If you are behind a corporate firewall you will need to open the SDK Manager preferences and set the proxy settings for this to work correctly, remembering to restart the SDK Manager if the process is stuck. By default the SDK Manager will suggest some required packages it will automatically download, but from there we need to pick a specific Android API. In doing so we need to be mindful that the version of Cordova we download has its own dependencies of what Android API level it supports, so you should check this yourself. For Apache Cordova 6.3.1 at the time of writing, according to the Cordova documentation that is Android 6.0 (API 23). In expanding a specific API, it includes a whole bunch of system images for different Android platforms including ARM and mobile devices, as well as specialized TV and Wear platforms. We'll drop the later two to save some unnecessary downloads. From the Extras top level option, it's also useful to select the Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer). I'll talk about this more in a moment. Once we've selected the options, we then select the Install Packages button, accept the relevant licenses then wait for everything to download. Be patient. It can take a while on slow connections. Like downloading the APIs as an extra step, assuming we don't have an Android device to run with, Android makes our job harder as we also need to setup the Android Emulator before we can start developing and testing our app. In turn, the Android Emulator is notoriously slow making it painful to develop with. This is where the Intel HAXM installer from above comes in. While there are some other options to the slow Android Emulator such as Genymotion, the Intel HAXM driver if installed on an Intel-based PC including Intel-based Windows, MacOS & Linux will significantly increase the speed of the Android Emulator. It does this by allowing the emulator to access the Intel CPU virtualization optimizations. There are some prerequisites such as your Intel CPU supports Intel's Virtualization Technology and VT-X, and if running on Windows Hyper-V must be disabled, which you can read about here. By default the Intel HAXM drivers are not installed when downloaded via the SDK Manager, you need to execute the file downloaded to the <android-home>/extra/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager directory, typically called something like intelhaxm.exe or IntelHAXM_X.X.X.dmg. The install instructions are fairly self-explanatory. My tip is to make sure you reboot your PC once installed, at least on MacOS I've had some problems with the drivers not properly applying post install unless I reboot. Now that we have the HAXM drivers installed we can setup the Android Emulator. The Android Emulator requires that we configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD), which is a configuration set of the Android device we want to emulate. Luckily it has a number of predefined templates that make this easier. With the SDK Manager running select the Manage AVDs menu option. In the resulting AVD Manager window, select the Device Definitions tab where it will list a number of preconfigured AVDs for known devices like the Nexus 5. On selecting this, then Create AVD, we will be presented with the remaining options we need to configure. From experience, first-time users tend to try to max out the AVD settings. But as the emulator can be so slothful, I recommend trying to keep this to a minimum. The target represents the Android API level we downloaded earlier. Remember to select something relevant to your Cordova release. For the CPU/ABI, for the Intel HAXM driver to work, we must select a System Image built by Intel, typically "Intel Atom (x86)" or "Intel Atom (x86_64)" (the difference being the 64 image emulates 64bit Intel Atom devices). For the Skin select "Skin with dynamic hardware controls," and then the rest of the options are left as default. Finally, note the default AVD Name at the top. Change this to something simple like "MyAVD" with no spaces, then press Ok. Next, for building Android apps, Apache Cordova requires that the Java Standard Edition SDK be installed (v7 or the latest v8). Having installed the Android SDK and Java SDK, Cordova then requires environment variables ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME to point at these. The Cordova documentation gives instructions for how to set the environment variables on different operating systems. Phew. Android certainly requires the most steps to setup.  At this point, we've set up the Android SDK & Android Emulator and we're ready to return to working with Oracle JET. Skip right down to the last section before the conclusion to see what to do next. iOS, Apple Xcode, and the iOS Simulator If we instead choose to go the iOS route we can take some satisfaction that getting up and running is much easier than with the Android SDK. As a reminder, though, Apple's Xcode is only available on MacOS, there are no Windows or Linux versions. As such you will need a Mac to develop iOS applications via Xcode with Oracle JET. To install Xcode, we need to check what versions of iOS and Xcode are supported by Cordova before continuing. At the time of writing, Cordova supports Xcode 7, by the time you read this Xcode 8 may be supported. Cordova does great work in supporting the latest and greatest, but, if the latest version just came out a few days before you sometimes need to show some patience and download an older version. You can download the latest version from the Apple App Store for free, or older versions via the Apple Developer Center. Once installed we need to run Xcode at least once to accept the terms and conditions. Also, in the past, from experiences, it's been important to run iTunes at least once to do the same as can block iOS app builds & deployments. We've found in running a number of workshops corporate users of MacOS/OSX have never run iTunes unlike regular Mac users and this has caught them out. Having done all this, by installing Xcode we get a full set of device simulators at the most recent O/S version supported by that version of Xcode. If we want older simulators we can download them via the Preferences -> Components -> Simulator window. Otherwise, we're ready to kick on with JET. Skip right down to the last section to see what to do next. Finally Cordova itself requires we install the following via the command line, to support Cordova installing through Xcode. xcode-select --install
npn install -g ios-deploy Windows 10 UWP and MS-Visual Studio 2015 and the Emulator Setting up the development environment for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps is also straight forward. In this case, we need to download and install MS-Visual Studio 2015 to our Windows 10 PC. The free Community Edition of Visual Studio 2015 is a good option. On installing Visual Studio we need to ensure during the install process to also select "Universal Windows App Development Tools" and the associated children. If you miss the option during the install, try the Tools menu -> Extensions and Updates and Tools section. Once installed we need to run Visual Studio once to accept the terms and conditions. Note here how I'm not telling you to check the Cordova documentation. At the time of writing while Cordova does support Windows 8 & MS-Visual Studio 2013 development, for Oracle JET, Oracle has decided to only support Windows 10 UWP apps via MS-Visual Studio 2015 going forward. So you need to be cognizant of Oracle's support for Windows, not Cordova's in this case. Once complete this is a fairly rudimentary install compared to Android. Having finished the install we not only get some Windows device simulators, but we can also deploy our app directly to our development machine (unlike iOS & Android). Continue to the next section to find out what to do next with Oracle JET. Creating, Building and Running Oracle JET Hybrid Mobile Apps Once we have the respective mobile development platform installed on our development PC, we're ready to return to Oracle JET and create a hybrid mobile app. Like the previous article we use Yeoman on the command line to generate an Oracle JET scaffold, with a slightly different syntax from just creating a web application: yo oraclejet:hybrid MyMobileProject --template=navbar --platform=<android|ios|windows> Note for the "platform" (singular) option we must specify our mobile platform of choice without the brackets, such as the following: yo oraclejet:hybrid MyMobileProject --template=navbar --platform=android We can also use the "platforms" (plural) option to specify multiple platforms to support.  Wait patiently for the components to download and install. Next, we can build and serve our app: cd MyMobileProject
grunt build
grunt serve By default, the last two options will build the app for our selected mobile platform via Cordova, then start the associated emulator or simulator for our platform, deploy the app to the emulator or simulator and finally start the app for us. For platforms like Android where we may already have a number of emulator AVDs configured, or on iOS where we might want to pick out a specific simulator, we might like to use the extra option "destination" to specify the AVD name we set up earlier: grunt serve --destination=MyAVD ...and the result: Another option as explained earlier is to bypass the mobile emulator or simulators using the development machine's browser, instead, with the browser option. The browser can be a much faster route to development particular when fixing layouts for example. grunt serve --browser ...which will look like: At this point we're now up and running with the hybrid mobile development platforms for Oracle JET mobile development, and we're ready to continue learning about Oracle JET. As previously recommend if you're new to Oracle's JET I highly recommend hitting the Oracle JET homepage which includes links to the documentation, tutorials, videos, demo applications and a detailed cookbook. Conclusion The nice thing about learning Oracle JET for web development is everything we learn is extensible to Oracle JET hybrid mobile development. Yes there are plenty of arguments from the native mobile development camp about native mobile apps are best, but there is a great attraction to being a JavaScript developer and being able to develop solutions for web and mobile apps using exactly the same skillset.

After all, that’s what Apple does every year with its MacBooks, even if not every year brings over a major Mac redesign. But thanks to Apple’s own macOS 10.12.4 beta files, we now have a pretty good idea of what to expect this year for the MacBook Pro update. Don't Miss: The Mars rover just sent back data that has scientists completely stumped Apple blog Pike’s Universum discovered in the new macOS beta release three motherboards that do not correspond to any current MacBook Pro model. The motherboards would not fit future desktops, and they use the exact same processor management data as the 2016 MacBook Pro models. The 2017 line of MacBook Pro models is expected to feature faster, more efficient Intel Kaby Lake processors. The blog looked at the various Kaby Lake CPU versions currently available and discovered which chips will probably be used in each new MacBook Pro. Here they are, as listed by MacRumors: 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Even though Apple’s latest macOS beta may contain revealing data about the next MacBook Pro update, you shouldn’t expect a release anytime soon. Apple is likely to unveil the 2017 models much later this year with WWDC 2017 being the earliest possibility.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel responds to AMD’s Ryzen onslaught with… Intel responds to AMD’s Ryzen onslaught with some Core i7 and i5 updates By Mark Coppock — February 7, 2017 10:46 AM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you AMD's new Ryzen CPUs could force Intel to cut prices and pump up performance, giving you even more powerful PC gaming options. AMD is getting ready to roll out its new Ryzen CPUs, promising significantly improved performance not only over AMD’s previous processor line but also in comparison to the best that Intel currently has to offer. AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn’t standing still in the face of Ryzen’s impending release, Hexus reports. More: Leaked roadmap shows AMD may release three classes of Ryzen desktop processors According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. We’re still not certain which of AMD’s new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you’re Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you’re a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn’t your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements.

The chip giant is reportedly surprised by the performance of the Ryzen lineup and will release higher clocked Kaby Lake CPUs to not be ‘humiliated’ by AMD. The information comes from the well respected French website Canard PC (via) who reports that Intel considers the new AMD Ryzen CPU as a ‘serious threat’. Canard PC writes, “Intel’s communication department is now trying to avoid at all costs the humiliation of a Ryzen CPU with performance comparable to a Core i7 6900K (€1200) , but for a much lower price.” In response to AMDs Ryzen CPUs, Intel would be planning to release two new CPUs of its Kaby Lake generation, a Core i7 and a Core i5. The Core i7 would be the  7740K that is reportedly clocked at 4.3 Ghz, has 8MB L3 cache and a TDP of 100 W. This CPU has a clock speed that is 100 Mhz higher than the Core i7 7700K and in return the TDP is 9 watts higher. The Core i5 is the 7640K that has 4 cores running at 4.0 Ghz and comes with 6MB L3 cache. The TDP of this CPU would climb above the 100 watts. Canard PC initially reported this CPU would have Hyper Threading but isn’t sure about this anymore. According to the website it would be the first time a desktop Core i5 supports Hyper Threading, a feature that normally differentiates between an desktop i5 and i7. On laptops Hyper Threading on a Core i5 is common. Intel might release even more Kaby Lake CPUs complementing these models, depending on the final test results of the Ryzen CPUs, Canard PC writes. Major customers of the chip giant are reportedly testing the Core i5 7640K and Core i7 7740K but Intel doesn’t guarantee them they will be sold. The main reason is that validation of the new CPU models is time consuming and Intel wants to be able to respond within days in case AMD’s Ryzen CPUs perform better than expected. Especially Intel’s clock speed per core is still higher which means that its CPUs will perform better on applications that are not able to take advantage of the 6 and 8 cores some of the AMD Ryzen CPUs will provide. Up to 4 cores Intel will still be faster and it seems the company will underline that to respond to AMD with higher clocked Kaby Lake processors. Canard PC is sceptical on how afraid Intel should be. The website is unsure if the entire Ryzen lineup will really perform as well as some expect. AMD might be looking for a ‘WOW’ effect with its 8 core Ryzen CPUs, but it might only be able to sell a handful of them. The rest of the range might perform a lot less as AMD might have issues with its yield. The company might need to lower the clock speed of cores to make sure they work reliable and even disable cores that don’t function well. The 4 core and 6 core Ryzen CPUs are already 8 core CPUs where AMD has disabled defective cores, according to Canard PC. The website concludes that in case AMD provides journalists only with the high end 8 core 3.6 / 4.0 Ghz CPUs, and doesn’t provide 4 core variants, the company might have issues with the performance of the rest of the range of Ryzen CPUs.

Don't hold your breath! 2 Agree UTR MyCE Resident Posted on: 07 Feb 17 20:19 IMO, the Ryzen CPUs are why Intel gave the Kaby Lake Pentiums hyperthreading to compete with them on the lower end. I hope AMD cleans Intel's clock in the bang-for-the-buck arena. Without decent competition, Intel gouges the crap out of its customers. 5 Agree RTV71 MyCE Member Posted on: 09 Feb 17 15:16 I'm planning on getting a new laptop but I'm waiting until mobile Ryzen systems are available.

Apple released the current generation of MacBook Pro models in October. The code discovered in macOS 10.12.4 points to what could be coming in the next lineup. Pike’s Universum shared the discovery in a blog post (via MacRumors) that points to unused board-ids: Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C – two models with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3400 and 4000 MHz. This one uses the exact same processor power management data as the new MacBookPro13,1. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 – three models with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3500/3700 and 4000 MHz. This one uses the exact same processor power management data as the new MacBookPro13,2. Mac-551B86E5744E2388 – three models with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3800/3900 and 4100 MHz. This one uses the exact same processor power management data as the new MacBookPro13,3. The post adds that based on the perf-bias setting, these likely refer to future MacBook hardware and not new iMac desktops. In total, the new motherboard identifiers include two new 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar models, three new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models, and three new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models with faster processors. The code discovered so far lines up with what has so far been rumored for this year: Kaby Lake processors for MacBook Pros expected later this year. Apple is also rumored to be dropping the prices of new MacBook Pro models and introducing a 32GB RAM option, addressing complaints of the current lineup. Here’s what the Pike’s Universum blog post expects for the base 13-inch, Touch Bar 13-inch, and Touch Bar 15-inch MacBook Pros based on the code discovered: MacBookPro13,1 Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) MacBookPro13,2 Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) MacBookPro13,3: Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Apple’s current lineup of MacBook Pros use Skylake generation Intel processors. Intel detailed its seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips expected in future MacBook Pros earlier this year. Apple is also reportedly adding a second ARM-based chip in new MacBook Pros (Touch Bar already includes one) that could handle low power tasks.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --February 2017 AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!! --February 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

That is impressive seeing how the AMD FX Series of processors struggles to keep up with most any Intel quad-core processor released over the past several years. We’ve never actually benchmarked the Intel Core i7-6900K processor and seeing how AMD is focusing the performance of Ryzen against that particular processor it seemed like it might be a good idea to have an Intel 8-core processor in our benchmark charts for comparison sake. We are also very interested in seeing how the 6900K performs in our updated benchmark test suite for 2017. Intel Broadwell-E LGA2011-3 Desktop CPU Lineup SKU Name Cores/Threads Core Clock Boost Clock L3 Cache TDP PCIe Lanes Price (USD) Core i7-6950X 10/20 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz 25 MB 140W 40 $1635 Core i7-6900K 8/16 3.2 GHz 3.7 GHz 20 MB 140W 40 $1030 Core i7-6850K 6/12 3.6 GHz 3.8 GHz 15 MB 140W 40 $570 Core i7-6800 6/12 3.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 15 MB 140W 28 $420   The Intel Core i7-6950X and Core i7-6900K processor are aimed at those that need as many processing cores that they can get on a desktop platform. If four or six cores aren’t enough and you have the proper funds, you can move up to an eight or ten core processor. Thanks to Intel Hyper-Threading technology you’ll actually end up with double that number when it comes to threads, so you can run up to 20 simultaneous operations at once!  All four of these HEDT parts have Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 and the good news on that front is that Microsoft has been offering native support for that since Windows 10 Anniversary Update (version 1607 and beyond). If you are running an older OS you’ll need to install a separate driver on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and earlier Windows 10 releases. You can find that driver here if you are needing it. For those that have unlimited cash and want the most cores available, the Intel Core i7-6950X for $1635 is the easy choice. If you actually have a budget the Intel Core i7-6900K is an interesting processor as it costs roughly 37% less than the 6950X and has faster clocked cores despite having 20% fewer. The Core i7-6900K’s base and boost clock speeds are each 200 MHz higher than the Core i7-6950X 10-core processor, so it might actually be faster on lightly threaded applications. Both processors have 40 PCI Express lanes, so you don’t have to worry about the limitations of the Intel Core i7-6800 on Intel X99 platforms. Since this processor has been out since Q2’2016 we’ll get right to the benchmarks after looking at the test systems on the next page. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

In SLI or crossfire, 8 PCI express lanes are enough to drive a second GPU without a bottleneck. Or you can just forget about SLI or Crossfire – a single GTX 1080 get’s the job done – even at 4K. You may have to dial back settings in the latest games – which I’ve done and the games still look great. Only in the most heavy threaded applications will you benefit from having 8 cores over 6. Those applications always make you wait…you’ll still be waiting…only waiting less. If your workload is only sometimes heavy threaded (Arguably 99+% of people on the planet) then you can save yourself another $600. When you compare the extra money spent versus the performance gained, the i7-6800K really shines. Dorian Kunch Nate, thanks for the thorough review and including my 2700K at 4.5 in da mix. I can still sit tight.

Apple blog Pike's Universum uncovered a trio of motherboard identifiers that do not correspond with any current MacBook Pro model, but use the exact same processor power management data as 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models released in late 2016. The plist files do not exist in previous macOS Sierra versions. The next-generation MacBook Pro models would likely be powered by Intel's faster Kaby Lake processors, which are the natural successor to Skylake processors used in late 2016 models. This would be in line with a report from six weeks ago claiming the MacBook Pro will receive only minor bumps in processing power for 2017. Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C would likely be for two new 13-inch MacBook Pro models with function keys. The models would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3400 MHz and 4000 MHz respectively. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 would likely be for three new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. These notebooks would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3500/3700 MHz and 4000 MHz respectively. Mac-551B86E5744E2388 would likely be for three new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. These notebooks would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3800/3900 MHz and 4100 MHz respectively.The blog said it checked the performance bias setting of each motherboard and determined that they are unlikely to be for desktop models such as the iMac and Mac Pro. There is also no GPU data as of yet. The blog cross-referenced Intel's lineup of Kaby Lake processors currently available with the motherboard identifiers and was able to determine which chips are likely to be used in each new MacBook Pro: 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W)Apple seeded the first beta of macOS 10.12.4 to developers on January 24, and additional betas should follow. It is highly unlikely Apple will launch new MacBook Pros until the software update is officially released at the earliest, which should happen by late February or early March based on previous releases. Apple could feasibly launch next-generation MacBook Pro models at any point following the release of macOS 10.2.4, but its late 2016 models are still rather new. WWDC 2017 in June is likely the earliest possibility for a refresh, but previous rumors also point towards a launch in the second half of 2017 or later. Last month, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said new Kaby Lake-equipped MacBook Pros will enter mass production in the July quarter. He also mentioned a "15-inch MacBook" that will include 32GB of RAM and enter mass production in the early fourth quarter, which starts in September.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Report: Intel to launch a Kaby Lake chip with AMD Radeon graphics 02/04/2017 at 9:23 AM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Chip makers Intel and AMD may be seen as rivals, but late last year HardOCP’s Kyle Bennett reported that Intel was planning to launch a new product featuring an Intel CPU and AMD graphics. Now he’s followed up with some more details, suggesting that the new multi-chip-module will launch before the end of 2017. Intel is said to be “licensing AMD GPU technology” with the goal of releasing a module sporting an Intel 7th-gen “Kaby Lake” processor bundled with an AMD graphics processor. This may just be the first of several such offerings. The first Intel/AMD solution is said to be aimed at entry-level or mid-range devices, which suggests Intel isn’t necessarily hoping to sway customers for its high-end products featuring Intel Iris integrated graphics. But using AMD Radeon graphics rather than Intel HD graphics could allow Intel to bring higher-performance graphics to its more affordable products. Keep in mind, neither Intel nor AMD have verified any of this information, and Bennett says “no money has changed hands yet,” which is allegedly why there are no details about the deal in the latest earnings reports from the two companies. via TechPowerUp Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Latest News BLU Tank Xtreme 5.0 is a cheap, rugged Android phone Budget phone maker BLU's latest device is a $130 Android smartphone that has a … [Read More...] Reports: Xiaomi is working on its own line of smartphone chips, dubbed “Pinecone” Chinese phone maker Xiaomi also produces a whole bunch of other things, … [Read More...] GPD Pocket 7 inch laptop crowfunding campaign starts Feb 15th The GPD Pocket is a tiny laptop computer with a 7 inch full HD display, an Intel … [Read More...] Deals Deals of the Day (2-10-2017) Sure, the biggest smartphone show of the year is coming up at the end of the … [Read More...] Featured articles Intel Compute Card is a tiny PC for a modular world Intel envisions a world where you'll be able to buy a smart TV, smart … [Read More...] The Loving Project: a podcast celebrating 50th anniversary of Loving v Virginia In 1967 the Supreme Court struck down state laws banning interracial marriage. … [Read More...] Playing with Fire: Hacking Amazon’s $50 Fire tablet The Amazon Fire Tablet may not be one the best tablets money can buy, but more … [Read More...] Latest news from the LPX Show LPX Episode 14: Adapted (Kaomi Goetz on Korean international adoptees returning to Korea) LPX Episode 13: Someone is wrong on the internet!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 7, 2017 at 8:54AM On Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) most recent earnings call, CFO Robert Swan provided some insight into the company's gross profit margin guidance for the full year of 2017. Intel guided to full-year gross profit margin of 62% on a GAAP basis for 2017 -- a 110 basis point (1.1%) improvement from the 60.9% gross profit margin that it reported for 2016. A pair of Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple. Interestingly, Intel tells investors to expect gross profit margin of 62% in the first quarter of 2017, which suggests that the company isn't expecting margins to improve throughout the year. This is a little bit surprising, as Intel usually enjoys the benefit of revenue leverage during the second half of any given year relative to the first half, since industrywide personal computer sales tend to be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first. Swan explained what's going on, and from that explanation, the chipmaker appears to be betting on having won cellular modem orders for the next-generation Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. The CFO speaks Swan said that "headwinds" to the company's gross profit margin in 2017 compared to 2016 will come in the form of increased non-volatile memory product sales, as well as from modem sales. The executive was quick to explain that increased memory and modem sales lead to "good growth, increasing profitability, [and] good earnings." That said, he also conceded that those products carry lower gross profit margins than the rest of the company's business. The way to think about it is this: It's generally better for a company to sell $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin and $30 worth of product at 30% gross profit margin -- diluting the average gross profit margin percentage to 53% -- than to just sell the $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin, assuming all else is equal. What does this have to do with the iPhone 8? Circling back to the topic at hand, let's go over why this commentary might suggest that Intel is inside the next iPhone. If we look at the trend in Intel's cellular modem revenue, we see that the company saw an initial ramp-up of shipments during its third quarter, with sales accelerating in the fourth quarter. This is consistent with Apple's iPhone ramp-up plans: it builds a bunch of phones in anticipation of the launch, sells even more phones in the quarter following the launch, and then it sees iPhone sales cool off in the following quarters -- until the cycle begins anew. If Intel doesn't expect to be in the next-generation iPhone, then investors should expect the company to see a substantial drop in cellular modem revenue during the second half of 2017. (In this case, Intel would only be shipping modems into older, discounted iPhone 7 models.) In that case, cellular modems wouldn't be a headwind to gross profit margin improvement for Intel during the second half of 2017 relative to the first half of 2017, since its cellular modem volumes/revenue would naturally decline -- proving a tailwind to average gross profit margin, not a headwind. It seems likely, then, that Intel expects to be inside of at least some of Apple's next-generation iPhone models. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

At that time HardOCP Editor, Kyle Bennett, had recently posted a statement saying that there would be Intel processors packing AMD GPU technology in the not-too-distant future. Bennett seemed to have a lot of faith in his sources and in the fact that the deal was done. Just ahead of the weekend Mr Bennett returned to his site's forums to reaffirm his position. He published the statement as reproduced below: OK. Got information back on this. Everything I have mentioned here is definitively correct. Intel is licensing AMD GPU technology. No money has changed hands yet, so there is not financial impact till late in the year, hence nothing in the current earnings report. The first product AMD is working on for Intel is a Kaby Lake processor variant that will positioned in the entry-to-mid level performance segment. It is in fact an MCM (multi-chip-module), and will not be on-die with the KB CPU. It is scheduled to come to market before the end of the year. I would expect more collaboration between AMD and Intel in the future on the graphics side. And you can take all that to the bank. As mentioned back in December, Intel's Nvidia GPU licensing agreement is to expire - and now it's just around the corner, the end of next month to be exact. There are no reports of an extension to the existing Intel / Nvidia deal. If a new deal is brokered by any of the three parties at the end of March it should be announced to investors, as it is share-price sensitive information. Some kind of Intel / AMD deal does look increasingly likely. However, a Kaby Lake processor with Radeon graphics sounds like something that could possibly harm the prospects of AMD's own Raven Ridge APUs, for example. Furthermore, did we see Intel processors with Nvidia GPUs on board during the existing licensing deal? - No. Time will tell.

The first set of products with Kaby Lake-U were ultrabooks. However, ultra-compact form-factor (UCFF) PCs were not long behind. There are already three vendors in the market with Kaby Lake UCFF PCs - ASRock (Beebox-S), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi 2). We have already reviewed the MSI Cubi 2 - a no-frills Kaby Lake 'NUC' The most important differentiating features of the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U include a USB 3.1 Gen 2 bridge, as well as a LSPCon (for HDMI 2.0 / HDCP 2.2 support) on the motherboard. This review takes a look at how the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U fares in typical UCFF PC workloads. Introduction Ultra-compact form factor (UCFF) PCs have become quite popular after Intel introduced the NUCs. They have become powerful enough to be the primary computing platform for many households. In addition to the Intel NUCs, many system vendors have come up with their own approach to UCFF PCs. These include ASRock (with the Beebox series), ECS (LIVA), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi) amongst others. Kaby Lake-U, as per Intel's claims, is fabricated on a much more mature 14nm process and brings about a 11% improvement in performance for the same power consumption. The GPU's media engine has also been updated. On the whole, the performance improvements look good for UCFF PCs - particularly for those upgrading from the first or second-generation systems. We have reviewed multiple Beebox systems before (Cherry Trail, Skylake), and, from an industrial design viewpoint, the Beebox-S 7200U Kaby Lake version is no different. The dimensions are one of the smallest to allow the installation of a 2.5" drive. Unlike the MSI Cubi 2, the Beebox-S 7200U supports a M.2 2280 SSD (with the help of a M.2 riser - the same as the one used in the Skylake Beebox-S 6200U). The Kaby Lake Beebox series is currently made of two SKUs, one based on the Core i3-7100U and another based on the Core i5-7200U. Both of these come barebones (no storage, memory, or OS). ASRock sampled us the version with the Core i5-7200U. The Beebox-S 7200U can take up to two DDR4 SO-DIMMs (operating at 2133 MHz). We completed the hardware build to result in the following specifications for our Beebox-S 7200U review configuration. Note that we processed most of our benchmarks with the NVMe drive, but a few testing routines used the SATA SSD (the relevant sections will go into the details). ASRock Beebox-S 7200U Specifications Processor Intel Core i5-7200U Kaby Lake, 2C/4T, 2.5 GHz (up to 3.1 GHz), 14nm PLUS, 3MB L2, 15W TDP Memory G Skill F4-2133C15-8GRS DDR4 15-15-15-36 @ 2133 MHz 2x8 GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Disk Drive(s) Samsung SSD 950 PRO (512 GB; M.2 Type 2280 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe; 40nm; MLC V-NAND) (OR) Crucial MX200 CT500MX200SSD1 (500 GB; 2.5in SATA 6Gb/s; 16nm; MLC) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160 (1x1 802.11ac - 433 Mbps) 1x Intel I-219V Gigabit LAN Display 1x mini-Display Port 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) 1x HDMI 1.4b (4096x2160 @ 24 Hz) 1x HDMI 2.0a (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) Audio 3.5mm Headphone Jack & Microphone Combo Jack Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Miscellaneous I/O Ports 3x USB 3.0 (Type-A) 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Type-C) Operating System Retail unit is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing $350 (barebones) $815 (as configured with NVMe SSD) / $666 (as configured with SATA SSD) Full Specifications ASRock Beebox-S 7200U specifications Buy ASRock Beebox-S 7200U on Amazon.com The ASRock Beebox-S 7200U kit doesn't come with any pre-installed OS, but does come with a CD containing Windows drivers. In any case, we ended up installing the latest drivers downloaded off ASRock's product support page. In addition to the main unit, the other components of the package include a 65 W (19V @ 3.42A) adapter with a US power connector, a VESA mount (along with the necessary screws), a driver CD, user's manual and a quick-start guide. In addition, we also have the appropriate cables - both data and power - to install a 2.5" drive in the system. A small IR remote control with a pre-installed CR232 battery (not shown in the picture below) is also part of the package. The unique part of the package is a small plastic tab and an additional screw that allows for installation of a M.2 2280 SSD in the unit. Note that even though Kaby Lake-U can theoretically support up to three simultaneous displays, the Beebox-S 7200U supports only two at a time (either HDMI 2.0 + HDMI 1.4 or HDMI 2.0 + DP). Other components that reside on the underside of the motherboard include the ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 bridge chip and the MegaChips LSPCon to enable the HDMI 2.0 output from the DisplayPort output of the Kaby Lake-U SiP. The most important update from the Skylake Beebox is the additional HDCP 2.2 capability and DRM capabilities enabled by the Kaby Lake-U processor. The PCIe lanes from the SiP are distributed as follow: PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #4      In Use @ x1 (ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller) PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #5      In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160 AC HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 2.0 x4 port #9      In Use @ x4 (Samsung NVMe SSD Controller) ASRock's BIOS has plenty of features that are missing in the BIOS from other vendors. I will not go into the details of all the BIOS features, but, readers interested in checking out the available options can peruse the user manual available here. Compared to the MSI Cubi 2 with Kaby Lake, we find the Realtek GbE adapter replaced by the Intel I-219V. The Wi-Fi adapter is the Intel AC3160 compared to the AC3168. Compared to the barebones Core i5 version of the Cubi 2 (Cubi2-006BUS) at $375, the Beebox-S 7200U with the same processor is cheaper at $350 and also comes with better capabilities. In the table below, we have an overview of the various systems that we are comparing the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U against. Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U when we come to those sections.

Reply lordmocha - Tuesday, February 07, 2017 - link According to "7th-gen-core-family-desktop-s-processor-lines-datasheet-vol-1.pdf": 2.5.8 describes the CPU display support info: "The HDCP 2.2 keys are integrated into the processor and customers are not required to physically configure or handle the keys. HDCP2.2 for HDMI2.0 is covered by the LSPCON platform device." (The LSPCON is the 3rd party motherboard soldered down solution.) DP supports HDCP2.2 with HDR (4k@60 10 bit) HDMI1.4 does supports HDCP2.2 but NO HDR (4k@30 8 bit) HDMI2.0 does supports HDCP2.2 but NO HDR (4k@60 12bit (YUV 420)) HDMI2.1 does supports HDCP2.2 with HDR (4k@60 12bit (YUV 420)) 2.4.3.1 describes the CPU Hardware Accelerated Video Decode support: HEVC/H265 (8 bit) Profile: Main, Level: 5.1: Max Resolution: 2160p HEVC/H265 (10 bit) Profile: Main, BT2020, isolate Dec, Level: 5.1, Max Resolution: 2160p It does not clarify if these are HEVC Version 1 profiles or HEVC Version 2 profiles. It does says "All supported media codecs operate on 8 bpc, YCbCr 4:2:0 video profiles.". Reply lordmocha - Wednesday, February 08, 2017 - link Of note is the CPU maxes out at HEVC level 5.1 whereas the HEVC spec goes up to level 6.2, and videos can be found online using levels above 5.1, thus they won't be able to be hardware decoded. vdpauinfo output would be nice to see Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, February 07, 2017 - link Is it just weird perspective, or is the computer shown on the packaging a much longer model than the one that was reviewed? Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, February 07, 2017 - link Like all NUC form factor systems, this one is adorably cute! Cooling looks like its done via the internal fan and movement of air so it's a candidate for a collection of kitten stickers on the outside. Those won't hurt internal temps, I'm thinking because of the case being made from plastic. Too bad about the heat issues. It probably won't be a problem under normal use right from the start, but dust buildup might take its toll over time. I do wish companies overbuilt their cooling systems a bit to tolerate fan slowdown and dust. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, February 08, 2017 - link That would blow up the "planned obsolescence" strategy. Reply BrokenCrayons - Wednesday, February 08, 2017 - link Does a company really need to do something like that with a NUC box? The CPU is soldered down and the motherboards can't be swapped out so the obsolescence is already implied. Designing and installing effective cooling probably would save a company money on in-warranty returns and build goodwill toward the brand by limiting failures and possible erratic behavior. Reply fanofanand - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link Your logic is sound, but most failures don't occur within the warranty period. Sometimes it seems they set the warranty period based on failure rates during QA testing. If they have a 50% failure rate on year 4 they just make sure the warranty is 3 years (oversimplified and inaccurate figures but that's the gist of it). Auto manufacturers have been doing this for decades, there was a reason most powertrain warranties went to 50,000 miles but massive head gasket failures or transmission failures would occur at 60k (I experienced both with GM products which is why they won't be getting any more of my hard earned money).

By Liam Tung | February 7, 2017 -- 11:31 GMT (03:31 PST) | Topic: Laptops Lenovo's ThinkPad P71 is designed to help creators meet the expected growing demand for virtual-reality content. Image: Lenovo One of three new ThinkPad Windows 10 mobile workstations from Lenovo is just for virtual-reality content creators. To help creators meet the expected growing demand for VR content, Lenovo has released its new mobile ThinkPad P71 workstation. The unit has Oculus, HTC, and Nvidia certifications, and it's powered by Intel's Xeon E3-v6 processors for mobile, while its GPU options max out at Nvidia's Quadro 5000. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet review: Compact, robust and modular Lenovo's 12-inch ThinkPad X1 Tablet is a compact and robust modular 2-in-1 hybrid. It's not cheap though, and you'll probably have to add the optional Productivity Module to get reliable all-day battery life. Read More The 17-inch laptop weighs in at a hefty 7.6lb (3.4kg), coming with 64GB RAM and four storage devices with up to 1TB of SSD storage. It also features a 4K UHD display with the option to switch to a FHD touch display and dual-fan cooling. Operating system options consist of Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Also available are a range of connectivity options, including four USB 3.0 ports, dual Intel Thunderbolt 3 ports to help move big files, a docking connector, and smartcard reader. Lenovo is also tipping in two new 15-inch ThinkPad models. The ThinkPad P51s is over half a pound lighter than its predecessor, making it the lightest and thinnest mobile workstation ever built by Lenovo's ThinkPad brand. The model weighs 4.3lb (1.95kg) and is 0.79 inches (20.2mm) thick, featuring a 15.6-inch 4K UHD IPS display with optional FHD touchscreen. Top options for the P51s are a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia Quadro M520M graphics chip, 32GB RAM, and either HDD or SSD storage of up to 1TB. It also features a USB-C port with Intel's Thunderbolt 3 technology, three USB 3.0 ports, and a docking connector. OS options are Windows 10 or Windows 7. The P51 meanwhile caters to engineers but doesn't aim for Ultrabook status, weighing 5.6lb (2.5kg) with a thickness of 1.02 inches (25.9mm). Still, it does offer Intel Xeon E3-v6 mobile processors, seventh-generation Intel core processors, and up to two Quadro M2200M graphics chips, with 64GB RAM and up to 1TB storage. Operating system options are the same as the P71's, with Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The cheapest of the three is the ThinkPad P51s, which goes on sale in March from $1,049. The pricier ThinkPad P51 and P71 will arrive a month later, and will start at $1,399 and $1,849, respectively.

Photographer: Bob Levey/Getty Images The synchronized swarm of 300 drones lit up the night sky behind Lady Gaga, morphing into an American flag as she recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime light show -- prerecorded to comply with prohibitions on flying drones over people -- was choreographed by Intel Corp. It provided a dramatic backdrop for the performance and also illustrated the ways large companies are embracing unmanned aircraft in sometimes unexpected ways. Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Photographer: Bob Levey/Getty Images The registration of drones used for business has gone from a trickle to a flood. Only a handful were listed in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft registration database a few years ago. That number swelled to 6,683 as of the end of 2016, according to agency records analyzed by Bloomberg. The list of companies reads like a who’s who of top U.S. corporations, along with startups seeking to catch the wave of unmanned commerce. It comprises old-guard railroads like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s BNSF, utilities including Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co., and technology companies like Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and a company that has supplied drones to Alphabet Inc.’s Project Wing. In December alone, Disney Co.’s TV network, ABC Inc., registered 29 drones, bringing its total to 51. 37,000 More “It does show that there is a lot of interest, and this industry is, pardon the pun, really ready to take off,” Tom McMahon, a spokesman for the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a Virginia-based trade group, said in an interview. The companies listed in the FAA’s database are the ones the public knows about. Most unmanned aircraft now are being registered in a new, separate online system that the agency has ruled isn’t public information. It has a total of more than 37,000 additional commercial drones registered since the agency created it a year ago. Intel, for example, had registered 112 drones in the public database, giving it the second-largest total. Those were for an earlier light show. The hundreds it has used for the Super Bowl and other recent events are registered separately in the nonpublic system, spokeswoman Krystal Temple said in an e-mail. Temple declined to say how many unmanned craft the company has in the U.S. “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before,” Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, said in a statement. The portion of Gaga’s performance including the light show was taped in advance, Temple said. U.S. regulations prohibit drones from flying over people in most cases. The Federal Aviation Administration also imposed a temporary drone ban around the stadium. Before drone commerce can really flourish, the FAA must expand the current regulations that mostly prohibit flights above people and over long distances, according to the Small UAV Coalition trade group. A UAV is an unmanned aerial vehicle. “But what we are seeing, which is incredibly exciting, is companies are investing in this,” Michael Drobac, the coalition’s executive director, said in an interview. The Washington-based group represents companies including Amazon and Intel. The use of drones for business has benefited from regulatory changes. The FAA put rules in place last year allowing more routine commercial drone flights during the day, at low altitudes and within sight of an operator. It also set up a waiver process to allow night operations or other expanded missions if an applicant proves they are safe. While automated drone deliveries and other far-flung uses won’t be permitted initially, the agency is laying the foundation for expansion. It is crafting a proposal to allow some drone flights over people, for example. Gaga’s roof-top opening portion of the Super Bowl show, with drones forming a star-like backdrop, also was pretaped prior to the game and fed into the broadcast, Temple said. Fans in the stadium had to watch it on video, just like people at home. Intel also produced a holiday show with Disney in Florida from Nov. 20 through Jan. 8, with drones forming a green Christmas tree and a blue dove, among other effects. Drones on Way to U.S. Sky With Privacy Issues in Tow: QuickTake Through the end of 2014, there had been only about 230 drones registered with the FAA, almost all by companies manufacturing the devices, such as military supplier Aerovironment Inc., academic institutions researching them or government agencies, according to FAA data. That began to change after the FAA created a process in 2014 for businesses to use unmanned aircraft. By March 2015, at least 100 were being registered per month. The registrations in the FAA’s public database peaked last May with 449. An analysis of more than 5,500 of the initial permits granted for commercial drone flights issued by the FAA before the latest regulations went into effect found that most were for small companies with less than $1 million in annual revenue for purposes involving aerial photography or data collection, according to the AUVSI. Mapping, Agriculture One smaller company hoping to capitalize on the new industry had registered the most drones in the FAA’s system. PrecisionHawk USA Inc., which operates drones for agriculture and mapping, listed 113 of its aircraft, beating out Intel by a single drone, according to the FAA’s data. The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company provides drone services to companies that prefer not to own and operate them. Its remote sensors and mapping tools can be used by insurance agents documenting property damage and by farmers assessing their crops, said Thomas Haun, PrecisionHawk’s vice president of global strategy. The company also has teamed up with Deere & Co. to add value to the data it collects. John Deere tractors can be programmed to automatically fertilize needy patches of soil identified from drone flights. Green Mountain Power Corp., which provides three-quarters of Vermont’s electricity, has 16 drones it uses for maintenance, mostly in emergencies, spokeswoman Kristin Carlson said. It has even used drones to check on whether osprey nests on its poles were abandoned or occupied, Mike Burke, director of field operations, said. ABC’s news division is embracing drones in a big way, said Maria Stefanopoulos, production manager for the Good Morning America show. The network is equipping every one of its field producers with an unmanned aircraft so they can be used to cover disasters and other breaking-news events, Stefanopoulos said. A project to film a volcano in Iceland two years ago showed the value of mounting cameras on unmanned aircraft, she said, and they’ve been used since for coverage of forest fires and tornadoes. “We realized it was going to change the way we told stories forever,” she said.

The contract, which is seen by many industry experts as unnecessary and shady, will see Sibton Switch Systems Limited – a company formed only in August 2015 – run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. Initial figure sighted by DAILY GUIDE as the cost submitted by Sibton to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for the implementation of the retail payment system was GH¢4,667,414,340.82. What raises eyebrows is the fact that two other entities that bid for the same contract – Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Vas Intel Files For Annulment Minutes of a tender committee meeting dated Monday, July 04, 2016, capture the bids submitted by all the three interested companies. The tender committee, chaired by Mr Innocent Asamoah, in its remarks after the evaluation of the tenders, concluded that all three were responsive and met their expectations and so awarded the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. This led Vas InteL Limited to write to the BoG to protest the award of the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. In its letter dated July 25, 2016, Vas Intel wrote that it was conceivably impracticable for the BoG to award a contract to Sibton within six business days after the opening of tenders on July 4, 2016. According to the letter, “All procurement actions taken by the BoG pursuant to Act 663 must be done with a strict and uncompromising adherence to the principles of transparency and fairness so as to protect and preserve public property and interest, as well as the integrity of the laws governing public procurement within the territory of the Republic of Ghana.” Telecom operators in the country are unhappy about moves by the Central Bank to impose on them a third-party company which will be intermediate in mobile money transactions across different networks. Telecom Operators Outraged The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has bared its teeth at the Central Bank and condemned the move to impose Sibton Switch Systems Limited on the players in the industry. In a letter dated January 9, 2017, the chamber argues that the move by the BoG and Sibton is not in alignment with international standards or benchmarks. They also argue that the fees being charged by the switch are too high and have the potential to undermine the successes chalked by the industry. The Telecoms Chamber, after meetings with banks, mobile money operators and the Central Bank, warned that aside the outrageous costs of the project, the scope was also not well defined and could run the industry into a state of chaos. Case For GHIPSS The Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana. It was incorporated in May 2007 with a mandate to implement and manage interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Industry leaders believe that the BoG should annul the deal with Sibton Switch Systems Limited and offer GhIPSS the needed leverage to continue integrating payment systems like they have successfully done over the past decade.

In the same session, AMD showed its Zen x86 processor sports a 10 percent smaller die than Intel’s latest 14nm CPUs. The Stratix X uses Intel’s Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to link the FPGA with four external transceivers. The bridge is made using silicon die mounted in a BGA substrate which is significantly smaller than the silicon substrates used in the CoWoS process developed by TSMC and used by rival FPGA vendor Xilinx and GPU designer Nvidia.

Lenovo's Yoga A12 Android 2-in-1 has futuristic touch panel keyboard The Yoga A12 replaces the hard keyboard with a touch panel one Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 06 February, 2017 16:01 0 - - - - print email Lenovo is ditching the hard keyboard for a cool new touch one on its new Yoga A12 2-in-1, which can be an Android tablet or a laptop. But for those seeking the latest and greatest hardware, there's a disappointment. It runs on an old chip from Intel, which has rolled back its development of Android, raising questions on the frequency of OS updates. The highlight of Yoga A12 is the versatile touch panel that can be a smartphone-like virtual keyboard. It's a feature adapted from the Yoga Book, which was introduced last year. The Yoga A12 has a 12.2-inch touchscreen, and a back-lit input touch panel replaces the hard keyboard. Lenovo said the virtual keyboard provides a user experience similar to on-screen ones on smartphones and tablets. Lenovo is betting that those comfortable with mobile typing will adapt quickly to this touch keyboard. The Android OS also provides a familiar mobile interface. The Yoga A12 has Android 6.0.1, and will ship in many countries this month starting at US$299.99. But there are some disappointments. The screen has a resolution of 1200 x 800 pixels, and its components are aging. It has Intel's Atom X5 tablet processor, code-named Cherry Trail, which the chip maker is now phasing out. Intel is replacing Atom X5 chips with newer Celeron and Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake, which are mainly going into Windows tablets and 2-in-1s. Intel in May last year discontinued Atom smartphone chips. Lenovo had an explanation on why it used Atom X5 in Yoga A12. "When Intel made its announcements about Atom, the Yoga A12 was already well in development. Intel has nevertheless committed to keeping the Atom X5 in the market to support the Yoga A12 and other products," a spokesperson said in an email. Lenovo said there's a clear upgrade path from Atom to Apollo Lake processors. That's an indication that Lenovo may use Apollo Lake chips in the successor to Yoga A12. Most Android devices today are based on ARM chips. Only a handful of Android tablets have Cherry Trail chips, including Lenovo's Yoga Book and Panasonic's ToughPad FZ-A2. PC makers are also quickly cutting Atom chips from tablets. Dell isn't selling Android tablets with Atom chips, and Microsoft has discontinued Surface 3, which had a Cherry Trail chip. Lenovo said it plans to upgrade Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0 in the next couple of months. Yet, there are questions on the frequency of OS upgrades. Intel -- which was responsible for developing Android updates -- has scaled back development of the OS for mobile devices, and is focusing more on Windows and Chromebooks. Lenovo may have to take on the development of a custom Android 7.0 for Yoga A12, which could be a challenging task. It could get some help from Intel and the open-source community. Current Atom-based Android mobile devices are mostly stuck at Android 5 or 6, and won't get Android 7.0. With 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, the Yoga A12 has features similar to that of a Chromebook -- except it is for Android users. But Chromebooks are now getting the ability to run Android applications. In the future, Lenovo plans to bring its virtual keyboard to Chromebooks as well.

In the same session, AMD showed its Zen x86 processor sports a 10 percent smaller die than Intel’s latest 14nm CPUs. The Stratix X uses Intel’s Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to link the FPGA with four external transceivers. The bridge is made using silicon die mounted in a BGA substrate which is significantly smaller than the silicon substrates used in the CoWoS process developed by TSMC and used by rival FPGA vendor Xilinx and GPU designer Nvidia. EMIB uses a combination of 55 micron micro-bumps and 100+ micron flip-chip bumps to support up to 24 transceiver channels with 96 I/Os each. They deliver 2 Gbits/second/pin at 1.2 pJ/bit/die using a proprietary protocol. EMIB uses fine-pitch vias and flip-chip interconnects rather than through-hole vias. (Images ISSCC) Currently, the bridge links four 28 GHz serdes to the FPGA. Intel has a road map to faster serdes and other kinds of external chips, said David Greenhill, an Intel engineer who presented the paper at ISSCC. The packaging technology drew several questions from a crowded session. Responding to a question from a Xilinx engineer, Greenhill said the Intel team doesn’t foresee any issues dealing with thermal challenges migrating the design to 56G serdes. Intel announced the technology more than two years ago as an offering in its foundry service. So far, it has not announced any other users of EMIB. The 14nm Stratix X packs 2.8 million logic elements into a 560mm2 fabric running at a gigahertz.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have been on a tear since the company reported better-than-expected earnings last week, in a report that was drowned out by earnings from tech behemoth Apple Inc. In the past five days, its shares are up nearly 28%. On Monday alone, AMD’s AMD, +1.19%  stock soared 11.36%. A positive story in Barron’s, with the headline “AMD’s Revival is for Real,” and comments by CNBC’s Jim Cramer provided the most fodder for traders, but there was also an unconfirmed report that it will license its graphics chip designs to partner/frenemy Intel Corp. INTC, -0.34% when its deal with Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -2.37%   ends in March. Shares of AMD topped the most active gainers on Monday, and outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +0.36%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.48%   An AMD spokesman declined to comment on the rumors of another licensing deal with Intel. (AMD already licenses the core x86 chip design from Intel.) Last week, several analysts raised their earnings estimates and price targets on AMD, the perennial No. 2 to Intel. AMD has a history of ups and downs, including financial woes, management issues and product execution problems. But as MarketWatch has noted in a previous column, many investors are counting on a new product family, known as Zen, to help it regain lost share in the server market, a fast-growing field where it has not been a player for the past few years. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst with Loop Capital Markets, has a buy rating on AMD and raised her price target to $12 last week. But she noted that she also has a new tone of cautiousness, because of concerns that the stock is now “priced to perfection.” “Although AMD had an impressive year of beats and raises in 2016, we believe the bar has been set very high in 2017 with AMD having no room for error,” she said. Why AMD Shares Are Soaring(5:00) Barron's Bounce: Graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices power devices that run applications ranging from video games to artificial intelligence. Plus: an undervalued energy play and what's next for Chipotle shares. AMD is set to launch three major chips in the first half of this year: A desktop processor called Ryzen based on its new Zen family architecture; graphics processing chips called Vega; and server chips also based on the new Zen architecture, with a processor called Naples. “We believe over the course of AMD’s long history that this is the first time the company has ever embarked upon such an aggressive endeavor to ramp three new products in such a short amount of time,” Van Hees wrote. The results from all these product launches are not going to be evident overnight, noted Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. “Investors are going to want to see the fruits of the company’s labors translate into meaningful financial upside,” Rasgon wrote last week. “Additionally, given likely channel dynamics it will probably be 2018 before we know if gains, if any, are sustainable. This still requires a leap of faith we’re not quite ready to make.” AMD’s management, under Chief Executive Lisa Su, who joined AMD in October 2014, has made huge strides in building credibility again on Wall Street. Now, the next question is whether those same kind of gains can be made again in the corporate computing market. With its shares now surging past many analysts’ current price targets, it might wise to proceed with some caution.

View Latest Posts >>> Down Here on the Farm (Part II) By Preston James, Ph.D on February 6, 2017 We are being "farmed" and asset stripped by the Banksters. American soldiers have been used as profit-making cannon fodder in all wars engineered by the Banksters to "liberate" cheap natural resources for their corporate cronies. Our assets are being continuously stripped by the Banksters charging pernicious usury for "renting" what should have been our own money in the first place. How did this ever happen to us? by  Preston James Ever since the top brass of the US Army Air Corps (which later became the USAF) decided that the Roswell Crash had to be suppressed, a revolutionary change occurred in US Intel. Thus the Roswell crashed flying saucer story was immediately excised from the Major Mass Media and a flimsy cover story was substituted that a weather balloon crashed instead. The Big Boys who really run things decided this incident provided a terrific opportunity to seize complete control over the USG and the whole United States of America, including all dissonant political factions. How was this done? It was done using the same methodologies that locked down the Manhattan Project: use of special Intel classifications levels and “need to know” as a standard for what Intel was shared with whom. During WW2,a serious tone was projected that “loose lips” sink American ships in reaction to the discovery of the penetration of Nazi saboteurs in certain Eastern ports. The FBI under Hoover had moved quickly under wartime national security to arrest and stop these saboteurs. After Roswell. “If the human race knew the truth, some people would be worried…” After Roswell this same wartime attitude of the seriousness of secrecy being necessary to protect “national security” was also projected, intensified and taken to the extreme with the passage of the national Security Act of 1947 which gave the authority for the creation of the CIA. The CIA was never supposed to be deployed domestically but thanks to Roswell, asserted itself and took charge of the new USAF when it was transformed from the WW2 US Army Air Corps. The crashed Alien ET anti-gravity craft and Roswell and other locations was seized and used to manipulate President Truman into believing the CIA was necessary to protect this secret from the Russians and Chinese. Later Truman claimed this was the biggest mistake of his Presidency because he came to realize that the CIA spread its control all over America by setting up, acquiring and even hijacking hundreds of proprietary fronts as cover. Soon nobody knew where all these were, or what they were, nor did future Presidents have the necessary security clearances to be able to find out. The foreign technology back-engineering program at Patterson Army Air Corp Base (later to become Wright Patterson USAF Base). The Alien ET recovery program and back engineering of these anti-gravity craft led to deep-black and beyond-black unacknowledged programs buried deep within certain aeronautical and defense contractors which formed off the books secret alliances with the USAF and alternatively the USN, both competing for space superiority. Initially all the  analysis and back-engineering done at Patterson, later to become Wright Patterson USAF Base. Later, these functions were transferred to Groom lake, areas S4 and then S2 and finally to the Four Corners areas into cloaked bases underground. These underground bases opened up to receive aircraft and trucks. One well known was is located outside Sedona, Arizona allegedly connected to the large Argo Tunnel accessible through a hotel in Denver at one end for top brass to enter. The Banksters who sit at the top of the Pyramid of Power. Now consider the Big Boys that sit at the top of the hierarchical Pyramid of Power, that is, the illegal, unconstitutional private central Banksters. They asset strip We The People of vast amounts of our wealth through the issuing of fake Fiat “funny money” (script), the illegal, unconstitutional charging pernicious usury on use of this funny money, and the illegal, unconstitutional fraudulent pernicious usury on an imaginary debt. Obviously it is extreme RICO fraud to charge American’s pernicious usury to use what should have been their own money in the first place that isn’t even real money. This funny money is accepted only because there are illegal, unconstitutional laws requiring it to be accepted as “legal tender”. These City of London Banksters viewed Roswell and a great opportunity to lockdown all America by expanding this WW2 wartime concept of locking down secrecy. The CIA was set up by Third Reich Nazi Intel brought over under Operation paperclip run by Gehlen and Mueller with full support of the Duklless and Prescott Bush, even though Bush had his Union bank Assets seized and his hands slapped for supporting the Nazis during WW2. Prescott Bush became an informant for the FBI and gained immunity from prosecution for treason by signing an agreement that his progeny would never run for any political office. He was a hard core Nazi man like his “son” GHWB and the Dulles brothers. This immunity agreement Prescott Bush signed was allegedly the document Sandy Berger tried to steal from the National Security section of the US National Archives (and was caught and received minimal correction for). GHWB climbs to the top for managing Op40 at Dallas.  GHWB ran OP40 assassination of JFK, RFK and MLK and his reward was to climb the ladder into the higher levels of the Pyramid of Power. He created a massive Fourth Reich Intel operation that absorbed the CIA in full. This is best referred to as the Bush Crime Cabal (BCC) and many believe that Trump’s victory (whatever it turns out to be) was a complete defeat of the BCC. The CIA and the BCC as well as the Fourth Reich were merged into this CIA group and over 750 of the largest International Corporations bought with stolen Nazi Gold and assets. This was all allowed by the City Of London Rothschild Khazarian Banksters who formed a working partnership with them. There was a large secret “Roundtable” of Intel and organized crime entities formed that reputedly involved the Cosa Nostra, the Khazarian Mafia (included the Red Mafia in Soviet Russia and its satellites), the CIA, NATO (which included Gladio run by the Fourth Reich and their “left Behind Army”), the Japanese Yakuza and the Chinese Triads, and the Corsican Mafia. The Third Reich becomes the Fourth Reich and goes corporate “three piece suit”. In the mid 1950s the Third Reich went “three piece suit” becoming the Fourth Reich and allegedly formed a working relationship at the roundtable with the Israelis. Deals were made. Hitler had to be taken care of as did Bormann. It was alleged that the Israelis had been hunting these surviving Nazis in South America but did not have the power to get them because these Nazis has formed a secret alliance with the USG under paperclip. Thus the Nazis had been authorized by the USG to align themselves with South American dictators and provide their security services like they did for the Egyptian government. Otto Skorzeny Skorzeny makes a deal with the Babylonian Talmudists (aka Khazarians). Supposedly Skorzeny who believed that the Israelis were hunting him as Peron started losing power, used back channels to negotiate a deal with the Israelis. If he was to do some occasional wetwork for them and make certain that the Nazi enclaves and safe-houses in South America were for the most part defanged or destroyed as false cover suggesting an end to the Third Reich, he would be left alone. However, it is a good bet that the Israelis had much more in mind such as forming a strategic partnership with the new arising Fourth Reich as the USG was busy doing in order to use the Nazi technology, drug business and worldwide Intel network. Like a number of the top Nazis, use of doubles and faked deaths was something Bormann was an expert in. Accounts vary, some believe that he died in the mid 1950’s which a better bet is that he lived until other early 1980’s living in luxury in Buenos Aries serving as CEO of the Fourth Reich. What is  not in doubt is that Bormann was the Third Reich’s business manager and also the Fourth Reich’s initial one and played a key role in transforming the Third Reich into the Fourth Reich, using the vast wealth that the Third Reich acquired. Where all the Gold and assets the Third Reich came from is a very big mystery. Yes there was the gold confiscated by the Nazi machine all over Europe, but some researchers have hypothesized that the Nazis actually found Solomon’s missing gold from Old Testament times. In any event the Third Reich morphed into the Fourth Reich, completely three piece suit, corporate on the surface, while forming a partnership with the CIA and Mossad to set up the drug cartels in South America and run them. Conflict was always elicited between the cartels to keep them from getting too strong. Special ops, spooky teams and Delta Forces were allegedly used to keep non-payers in line who went off the reservation and broke the rules. Fourth Reich and the Israeli (Khazarian mafia) merge together at the City of London Banksters “Roundtable of Organized crime conglomerates”. It is seemingly quite counterintuitive for the Israelis to sit at the same Roundtable with the Fourth Reich and other organized crime conglomerates. But the best reports suggest that this is what actually occurred. And this is why the Cosa Nostra went into business with the CIA in trafficking in opium from the Golden Triangle and later cocaine from the Mena Arkansas operations of GHWB. What is truly amazing is that all this is hidden in plain sight and could be easily researched, but few even working in the CIA or top LE have any clue that this is what is really going on or what the select powerbrokers at the top of the Pyramid of Power are really like or stand for. A secret war between the USAF (hijacked by the BCC) and the US Navy. Some insiders claim that the USN has succeeded in becoming the prominent Secret Space War agency even over the USAF. And some have claimed that there has been a secret war ongoing between the USAF which was fully absorbed by the CIA and the Bush Crime Cabal (BCC) that hijacked it against the USN. Allegedly this war went live when the Pentagon was struck at the Naval Intel offices by a Tomahawk cruise missile with a hardened nose cone fired from an Israeli Dolphin Class diesel sub purchased from the Germans. This set off the pre-planted internal charges that murdered many innocents including about 25 of the Able Danger Team that was investigating the Mossad theft of Davy Crocket nuclear warheads from Pantex in Amarillo, Texas which had been processed and re-weaponized into mini-nukes and micro-nukes. A good guess is that mini-nukes were pre-planted in the basements of the Twin Towers, one each that turned the rock formations to lava, then blasted upward while micro-nukes were detonated progressively every ten stories starting at the top which were pre-planted in the elevator shafts during nine months of maintenance of the elevators. I have heard repeated reports that the USN has instituted a rear guard action to stimulate and elicit populism in the American People through the Internet’s Alternative Press in an attempt to break the back of the Bush Crime Cabal, its CIA leadership and the leadership of the USAF and NATO. And even stranger it is rumored that a certain faction of the Mossad has joined forces. The Black Pope is reputed by insiders to be calling the shots right now. The bottom line is that the COL Banksters who sit up high on the pyramid of power underneath the Jesuit Superior General (aka the “Black Pope”), have used the Alien ET crashes and the related Foreign technology programs (recovery teams and back-engineering programs) as a opportunity to lock down all of America. And this has been done under this false cloak of so-called “national security” which can be invoked to cover every single abridgement of the US Constitution and basic felony violations of the Rule of Law. This has prevented any oversight at all and any Member of the US Congress who tries get the Dave Durenberger fake smear job or if that doesn’t work they get the Senator Paul Wellstone correction (which is permanent sanction). Obviously over half of the male members of the US Congress and the USG in general have been completely compromised and are easily black-mailable by various Intel agency “handlers”. It’s a sad fact that so many have been seriously “human compromised”. Good reasons to believe that the Israelis have been blackmailing the USG over its partnership with the Nazis after WW2 under Operation paperclip and other joint functions. It’s a very good bet that the Israelis have been blackmailing the USG over Operation Paperclip and their joint Intel ventures, joint NASA ventures, Secret Space War ventures, secret South American security forces, death squads and drug cartel enterprises with the Nazis for a very long time. Once this sinister truth is learned by We The People in mass, the power of this Israeli blackmail will end. Like it or not America is basically a Fourth Reich nation operating in partnership with the Israeli PNACers and Israeli-American “Israeli-first” Dual Citizen traitors. This must end and the revelation of all this via the Internet can bring it about. Certainly the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) would never do so. It is now pretty clear that the Fourth Reich has pretty much gained control over the USG through its Secret Space War Program and its CIA, which has expanded into thousands of proprietary cover businesses throughout America and much of the world. The folks that run the CFR and stack and control the USG to meet their needs, have been able to ride the Fourth Reich wave to personally empower and enrichen themselves beyond measure. To do this they had to give up their very souls to Lucifer (not kidding here), betray America and sell out to the City of London RKM private Globalist Banksters who started Bolshevism and Nazism and Maoism in the first place. Conclusion: Culling the herd with flying machines … Basically the Alien ET, recovered and back engineered anti-gravity craft, Secret Space War issue has been used to create this complete lock-down of America. And this has lockdown has been used to transform America into a plantation of Serfs and Slaves into the COL Banksters’ war-making machine, designed to asset strip huge profits from We The People and other nations exclusively for the .00001 who sit at the top of the Pyramid of Power at the expense of the common folk. Partial official disclosure is likely to occur this year, because, thanks to the Internet, the New Gutenberg Press, all secrecy is ending in stages. It was supposed to end in 2015 but the BCC prevented it. Now with the demise of the BCC, it is expected disclosure will likely occur sooner than later. And it has been rumored that some who sit on Majestic, the organization controlling it have started authorizing it in bits and pieces from senior individuals who know the full story all the way back to WW2 with the Nazis. In the meantime, until this important truth disseminates to most of We The People in believable form, we are all essentially going to remain being being “farmed” and asset stripped for our labors by the COL Banksters and their stateside Franchisees the Federal Reserve System, the biggest financial fraud in US history and the greatest crime ever committed under RICO state and federal laws. ______________ Related Posts: Exclusive: The Coming Shift to the Esoteric (updated) Deepest Darkest Secrets behind the Establishment Hierarchy’s evil Globalist NWO Agenda The Secret Law of Opposites The Zionist-Christian Alliance and the Great Deception Obama Commutes Whistleblower Chelsea Manning’s Sentence The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Log in to Reply frog  February 8, 2017 at 5:46 am I am at a loss with your statement that an Israeli sub fired a Tomahawk at the Pentagon. Don’t get me wrong, they are capable of doing this, but I look at the evidence. Radar picked up an aircraft on a down ward spiral, then hitting the Pentagon. A small engine part was found with small landing gear at the Pentagon,(no seats,luggage,food carts, cushions, bodies found) to me, more likely a Global Hawk. A G H flies above civilian radar, it’s about 90% Carbon Fiber so can’t be picked up easily, did the G H fire the missile before crashing into the Pentagon. And why was the FBI out directing Pentagon staff in a line to pick up small parts.( Of the G H?) Also there is a picture of about 8 Pentagon military guys caring a long item under a blue tarp. Was this part the fuselage of the G H.? What about the Pentagon, does it have it’s own missile protection system? and did it fire on it’s self. It was some kind of missile like you say, because it went through 3 rings of the Pentagon, each with 18 inch of reinforced concrete each side. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  February 8, 2017 at 3:02 pm The aircraft passed over the Pentagon at the same time the flashbang charges were ignited in the trash bins brought outside. The eyewitness who was going to go public with this was murdered by FBI div 5 wetboy. frog  February 8, 2017 at 8:33 pm Thanks for your reply Preston, but a Tomahawk cruise missile does not have landing gear. or was that placed their?? Like the engine and later the landing gear jammed between two buildings(With a long piece of rope still attached,wow) I remember the dumpsters, totally separate from the pentagon burning with huge black smoke, otherwise excellent article. MileHighLife  February 7, 2017 at 12:23 pm Thanks Dr James, hopefully the major changes brought on by the “good guys” that you often mention are nigh! There’s been several large pedophile/human trafficking ring busts over the past few days that were vaguely covered by Fake-stream news networks. Wonder why? Also, there is current buzz, supposedly backed by FBI anon sources, that mass arrests are imminent in a major D.C. pedo/trafficking ring, consisting of high ranking officials that will shock many — at least those who haven’t been paying attention. This “Pedo-Gate” ring has slowly been exposed over the past several months with whistleblower and Intel “leaks”, expanded with the help of countless online citizen investigators and citizen journalist (New Gutenberg Press!). Anyone capable of critical analysis and thoroughly investigates the loads of available data on Pedo-Gate, yet still believes there’s nothing to it, are likely a; shill, been compromised, too stupid to live, or has an unhealthy craving for pizza 😉 Log in to Reply jensingr  February 7, 2017 at 2:09 pm ” too stupid to live, or has an unhealthy craving for pizza” lol, yeah the wrong kind of pizza!

They have their labs underground but the rest of the underground has been formed into functional, connected areas that can be lived in with all necessities. They have taken everything underground for themselves. Most of them have definitely sold their souls and the blood rituals continue behind closed doors as well, because if they don’t align with satan, they will lose everything because of the karmic law. The only difference is they will lose it in the END! If people knew what is going on underground they would be shocked! If they knew what sick things they do, they would be shocked.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Why a dual-processor Fusion Mac makes a lot of sense Dan Moren 7 February, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA 1 Comment News Why use one processor when two will do? This week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has developed an ARM-based chip that it will integrate into future Macs to handle some of the low-power responsibilities, thus taking pressure off the main, more power-hungry Intel processor. Here’s the thing: this multipronged approach is nothing new to Apple. And while I do believe that Apple is investigating building computers based solely on the same type of ARM architecture it uses in its iOS devices, this latest report doesn’t necessarily draw a straight line to that future. After all, the Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor in the new MacBook Pro already rely on an ARM chipped dubbed the T1. Mainly, it’s another example of Apple mixing and matching technologies where appropriate so that it always has the best tool for the job. A second chip for better battery life The putative purpose of this ARM chip, which Bloomberg reports is dubbed the T310, is to handle low-power activities, such as the Power Nap feature first introduced in Mountain Lion. Power Nap activates when your computer is put to sleep, allowing your Mac to continue carrying out certain tasks like fetching your mail, updating synced data like contacts and reminders, getting new pictures posted to Photo Stream, and keeping Find My Mac up-to-date. Basically, it ensures that when you wake up your Mac, it doesn’t have to spend several minutes updating everything before you can see the latest content. It also attempts to perform certain housekeeping features while the computer is otherwise idle. But even though Power Nap is intended to use the Mac’s processor in a low-power fashion, those Intel chips are still more power intensive than their ARM counterparts, which were designed for battery-sipping mobile usage. Hence the idea to add a second chip dedicated to handling this kind of activity, allowing the main processor to go to sleep. That potentially ratchets up the battery life that Apple is so very concerned with in its portable Mac line. Apple Apple’s A10 Fusion chip has two higher-power cores and two efficiency cores, and powers the iPhone 7. If this approach sounds familiar, it should, because Apple’s used it multiple times before: most recently in the A10 Fusion processor used in the iPhone 7. That chip contains both two high-performance cores for tasks that require serious horsepower, as well as two high-efficiency cores that use less power. Similarly, the MacBook Pro line has long offered machines with both discrete and integrated graphics chips, switching between them as needed. This is right out of Apple’s playbook. Enter the Fusion Mac? Now we jump into the ‘wild speculation’ part of proceedings. Apple is probably not ready to totally forgo Intel chips in its Mac line, though it certainly has some things to gain by that move: an internal development schedule that’s not dependent on a partner company, better power efficiency and a unified processor architecture with iOS, to name a few. However, ARM chips still aren’t ready to deliver kind of performance that Mac users are accustomed to. But by shipping Macs that include both Intel and ARM chips, Apple will have created hybrid Macs – or perhaps Fusion Macs would be a better name, following the pattern of the A10 Fusion processor and the Fusion drive. At the start, the capabilities of the ARM chips would likely be more limited, as described in the Bloomberg story, handling low-power tasks when the computer was asleep. But that doesn’t mean Apple couldn’t subsequently offload more tasks to the ARM chip as subsequent versions grow more powerful. Eventually, the ARM chip could be responsible for low-power tasks not only when the Mac is sleeping, but also when it’s active. In addition to Power Nap, Apple has a feature called App Nap that shifts an application into a low-power state when it meets a series of criteria, such as not being the foreground app, not updating content in a visible window, and so on. That reduces power consumption by limiting how often the app can get new data, read and write data to disk and so on. Apple If Apple wants to keep making its laptops thinner and thinner, it needs to find power efficiency everywhere it can. So rather than simply shifting them into a low-power mode on the primary processor, what if a Fusion Mac could shunt those napping applications onto the lower-power ARM chip? Not only would that help consume less energy, but because the ARM chips have lower power consumption overall, those apps may still be able to accomplish some tasks in the background. Road blocks There are certainly challenges to overcome with such a Fusion Mac, but probably none that are insurmountable. Apple has undergone a couple processor transitions in the past, going from Motorola’s 68k architecture to the PowerPC in the mid-90s, then to Intel processors in the mid-2000s. In both cases, Apple tried to mitigate the impact on developers and end users by offering solutions like fat binaries that contained code to run on both platforms. In the past, porting many Mac apps to a new architecture has in many cases been as simple as checking a box while compiling. Switching between processor architectures on the fly certainly seems radical, but looking back at Apple’s history of hybrid technologies, it hardly seems unprecedented. While the company has long pushed towards the aspirational, it’s never been hesitant to find ways to bridge it with the practical. And if the world isn’t yet ready for an ARM-based Mac, a Fusion Mac may be a bridge to get to that future.

The technology underpinning the Intel Shooting Star drone system is fascinating in and of itself, but its potential applications are even more so. The same drones that accompanied Lady Gaga will one day revolutionize search-and-rescue, agriculture, halftime shows, and more. First, though, let’s focus on the fun stuff. Drone Show Performing for a global audience of about 160 million or so people represents this drone platform’s biggest stage, but Intel has done this before. The company’s Shooting Star drone squad recently finished a three-week run at Disney World, and last year 500 synchronized drones flew in Sydney, setting the highly specific world record for “most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously.” RELATED: Imagining Football’s Future Through the Super Bowl of 2066 Each drone is about a foot long square, weighs just over eight ounces, and sports a plastic and foam body to soften inadvertent impacts. They aren’t as flashy as consumer quadcopters, which is just as well, because you’re not supposed to notice them. Instead, you’re supposed to notice the four billion color combinations created by the onboard LEDs, and the aerial acrobatics choreographed with meticulous coding. Each drone communicates wirelessly with a central computer to execute its dance routine, oblivious to what the hundreds of machines around it are doing. The system can adapt on the, er, fly, too. Just before showtime, the computer checks the battery level and GPS signal strength of each drone, and assigns roles accordingly. Should a drone falter during the show, a reserve unit takes over within seconds. All of which is pretty cool in its own right. But making it work for the biggest television event of the year takes a whole different level of planning. Red Zones and Red Tape Student of Super Bowl security measures and FAA regulations may by this point have some questions. The government strictly forbids drones within 34.5 miles of Houston’s NRG Stadium, after all, and the FAA limits on how high drones can fly in any circumstance, let alone above 80,000 or so people. How on earth did Intel get away with it? The short answer is, it taped the show earlier this week.© Intel Intel The long answer is worth exploring though, because it provides insight into the evolution of Shooting Star system and where it might go from here. Preparations kicked off in early December, when Intel’s engineers started wading into the mind-numbing logistics of choreographing 300 dancing drones. Do they fly inside the stadium? How are they integrated into what Lady Gaga is doing onstage? Is stadium’s domed roof open or closed? “The whole halftime is a huge execution monster of an exercise,” says Anil Nanduri, who leads Intel’s drone efforts. READ MORE: How Astronauts Watch the Super Bowl in Space Once Intel and the Super Bowl creative team understood the restraints, they started storyboarding the show, settling on a sparkling array of stars that culminates in one giant, glittering, fluttering flag effect. Oh, and also the Pepsi logo, which was at least blue if not red and white. It was a brief performance, and secondary to Gaga’s onstage glitter and glam. Pulling it off, though, was a feat. The team required a dispensation from the feds—an especially tricky task given that NRG Stadium sits within Houston Hobby Airport’s air traffic control jurisdiction, and that Intel and the NFL had just weeks to put it all together. Swarm Hugs Synchronized programmable drones are entertaining for sure, and you can see them providing a wow factor like fireworks. They’re easier to control, allow for more elaborate effects, and are reusable. But the technology offers far more practical, and potentially life-saving, applications. “I see them searching for a lost hiker with multiple drones at night with the right payloads looking for them,” says Nanduri. “Or search and rescue efforts after a landslide, when it’s hard to get people on the ground.” There are commercial applications, too. Instead of sending humans to inspect hazardous areas of, say, a construction site, send a few dozen drones. And what better way to inspect hectares of crops than to outsource it to a fleet of quadcopters? All of this is at least a few away, though, and not just because of the technological limitations. FAA regulations, for instance, require that drone operators to maintain a line of sight with their charges, which makes it hard to deploy them in collapsed buildings or remote areas. And individually programmed drones may prove less effective than smart drones that can “think.” For now, though, there are light shows. And while they may not pack the punch of Prince serenading a stadium with “Purple Rain,” the drones did make for a memorable halftime show.

Those lights were actually Intel's Shooting Star drones, 300 of which were launched above NRG Stadium in Houston to bring an extra sparkle to Gaga's show. Lady Gaga performs during the halftime show of the NFL Super Bowl 51 football game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017, in Houston. Darron Cummings / AP It's the first time the colorful drones were used at an event of this scale. "Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group, said in a statement. Our drones have returned to the ground after an amazing #PepsiHalftime show #ExperienceMore pic.twitter.com/Augpbt05u6— Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 Of course, the biggest sporting event of the year comes with plenty of security precautions. The secret behind the overhead display: The drone show was filmed last week. Intel received a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates drones, allowing them to fly up to 700 feet and in more restrictive airspace. Related: A Real Flying Tinker Bell? Disney Parks Plan to Use Acrobatic Drones Each quadcopter has LED lights that can create 4 billion color combinations, according to Intel. The entire swarm is able to be controlled by a single operator and computer. One Shooting Star drone weighs less than a volleyball.

While Intel says the drones meet Federal Communications Commission specifications, they haven't been formally authorized. For now, Walden said it's all about inspiration. "The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of," he said.

 Lady Gaga's jump from the top of the Super Bowl stadium was actually an edited illusion Paul Schrodt Feb. 7, 2017, 9:56 AM 86,796 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Lady Gaga seemed to fly seamlessly from the top of NRG Stadium in Houston to a platform below during her stunning Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday. But it turns out the drop from the top of NRG was actually a prerecorded stunt. USA Today spoke to two top people at Intel Drones — which provided the drones in the sky behind Gaga that displayed the US flag and the Pepsi logo — who confirmed that her stunt was done in advance. The Intel sources said the opening jump was filmed ahead of time because of "weather and environment" issues. Basically, if it had rained during the Super Bowl, the roof of the stadium where Gaga was standing would have been closed. While the drones still could have operated, they said, Gaga couldn't have flown down from a closed stadium roof. But Gaga did drop from the top of NRG Stadium in the prerecorded bit and didn't use a stunt double, so we can still be impressed. Clever editing made it appear both at home and on the jumbotrons at the stadium that Gaga's drop from the top of the stadium led directly to her flight on cables in the middle of the stadium. But on Sunday, Gaga started from a lower point, as you can see in this video from TMZ and another video from inside the stadium: Lady Gaga started her live descent at the Super Bowl from a lower point in the stadium. Her jump from the top was prerecorded. TMZ LADY.

The device’s new Touch Bar wowed, whereas its price for the parts inside certainly did not. Just four months since that tumultuous release, reports and rumors of what Apple’s MacBook Pro 2017 follow-up will be like have surfaced, and all signs point to better parts for the price. However, there is also so much that we don’t know, so check back on this space every once in a while, as we’ll be updating it with the latest regarding the would-be 2017 MacBook Pro. Cut to the chase What is it? The new MacBook Pro’s successor When is it out? Anywhere between spring and fall 2017 What will it cost? Likely as much as – if not more than – current models Anticipate seeing the Touch Bar on the next MacBook Pro models MacBook Pro 2017 release date Sadly, this is one of the facets to the new MacBook Pro story that we know very little about. The closest thing to an idea is a report from famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that the next MacBook Pro models will go into production in Q3 2017, so around July. That would logically place the new MacBook Pro in an October 2017 release window, which would make a whole lot of sense considering when the updated MacBook Pro released in 2016. (Hint: it was in October.) However, Apple has debuted new MacBooks in the past during the months of March and April as well as during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. Without an alluring email invitation from Apple, anything is possible. MacBook Pro 2017 price Considering the backlash to the price hike we saw coming from the generation of MacBook Pro’s into the current one, we wouldn’t expect to see major changes in MacBook Pro pricing. Of course, we wouldn’t anticipate them coming down in price by comparison. That would just be ludicrous. So, it would be safe to expect the next line of MacBook Pro models to start at $1,499, £1,449 or AU$2,199 – starting with the lowest-power, non-Touch 13-inch model – and top out around $2,799, £2.699 or AU$4,249 for the highest-end, 15-inch model with Touch Bar. Then again, Apple has a way of introducing new, exciting features to dull the blow of an increased price, if last year is any indication. In this age of Apple, be prepared for a wild, new feature that could potentially drive the price up. The 2016 MacBook Pro in an exploded view (Image: © iFixit) MacBook Pro 2017 specs Probably the biggest point of discussion regarding the new MacBook Pro is what Apple will choose to place inside. This is one of the most divisive points surrounding the current range of MacBook Pro’s and continues to be so as long as Apple continues its particular trend of price per part. The current line of MacBook Pro’s has been criticized for its low RAM, or memory, threshold of 16GB as well as its use of “dated” 6th generation (Skylake) Intel Core i-series processors. Naturally, the latest rumor surrounding the would-be new MacBook Pro is that it will contain both the latest, 7th generation ( Kaby Lake) Intel Core i-series chips as well as room for up to 32GB of RAM. These details were first brought to the public via the same aforementioned report in which Ming Chi-Kuo projected the release window for the new MacBook Pro’s. But since, evidence of these Kaby Lake-equipped models has allegedly appeared within the code of the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta – the one currently underway, as of this writing. Further to this scuttlebutt regarding what will be inside the new MacBook Pro’s is a Bloomberg report citing sources with claims that Apple is working on its very own Mac processor to work in tandem with Intel chips for future Mac products.  According to the report, this chip will be a logical extension of the ARM-based T1 processor currently used to power the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. This chip would reportedly take on more power management tasks that Intel's processors currently handle, with the goal of increasing battery life. For starters, we'd like to see even sharper screens MacBook Pro 2017: what we want to see Beyond these reports, we know little else about what the new MacBook Pro will be capable of. Of course, we’ve drafted up a brief wish list for Apple’s next pro-bent laptop. Longer battery life This is no doubt low-hanging fruit, but being one of the primary complaints lobbed toward Apple for the MacBook Pro’s of today, we couldn’t help ourselves. After all, Apple once prided itself on the longevity of its laptops. And, the firm has quite a lot going for it in this direction. Between rumors of more power-efficient Kaby Lake processors inside and those of a special power management chip, longer battery life should be in the bag for the new MacBook Pro. Sharper screens Apple no doubt spurred the obsession with screen resolution in all consumer electronics once it unleashed its “Retina” screen standard years ago with the iPhone 4. But, the rest of the technology world has at last caught up to the firm’s screen sharpness. Frankly, in computing, Apple’s Retina display was surpassed years ago, and it’s about time that its standards for “Retina” were updated. Especially for the price, the new MacBook Pro’s should come sporting 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ displays at least – and that’s at 13.3 inches. Naturally, what we’ll see is some incredibly particular resolution that hovers around industry standards but doesn’t get too close. Jokes aside, it’s time for sharper MacBook Pro screens. More (and more varied) ports Throwing a glut of Thunderbolt 3 ports, while impressive, at a laptop doesn’t solve the users’ problem of not having compatible connectors or accessories to use them with. To that end, we need to see either more variety in the ports that the new MacBook Pro offers or for Apple to include more adapters in the box. Professional users need to be bridged between where they are technologically right now and where a creator like Apple envisions them being in the next few years. At the very least, a few more USB-C adapters would go a long way. These are the best laptops that the new MacBook Pro is up against Tags MacBook Pro ABOUT THE AUTHOR Joe Osborne Joe has worked in games and technology media for nearly a decade for several publications.

The company will use the $7 billion to complete its Fab 42 factory in Chandler, Ariz., Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a meeting at the White House with President Trump. Krzanich said the decision to make the announcement with the White House was borne out of Intel's support for Trump's economic and trade policies. "We support the Administration's policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies," Krzanich wrote in an email to Intel employees. ADVERTISEMENT "When we disagree, we don't walk away," he continued. "We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation." Trump tweeted about the meeting on Wednesday afternoon, calling it a "great investment" in "American INNOVATION and JOBS!" Intel started construction of the Fab 42 plant in 2011, but shelved the project in 2014 amid slowing computer sales. Read more here.

"But I think we allow them to take those first steps." ANOTHER FCC REFORM: FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced another reform measure on Wednesday, one that will require a full vote of the commission to approve consent decrees. Previously, the FCC's Enforcement Bureau would generally sign off on such agreements at the direction of the chairman. "That abuse of process ends now," Pai said in a statement. "I have instructed the Enforcement Bureau that starting today, any consent decree settling a Notice of Apparent Liability or Forfeiture Order issued by the full Commission must now be approved by a vote of the full Commission."

"The valuations are pretty darned reasonable, but I have a hard time proving it to people because we are in an incredibly visceral, polarizing moment stemming from the election of a pro-business president who seems to rack up an incredible amount of baggage on a daily basis," the "Mad Money" host said. To prove that stocks are not overvalued once and for all, Cramer compared the top companies that dominated the market back in 1999, when the market was last on the verge of collapsing due to true overvaluation. Overvaluation is a different scenario than an economic collapse, such as the Great Recession. That is why Cramer chose to look at the 1999 bear market, because it was the last time stocks collapsed under their own weight due to overrun fundamentals. Getty Images People walking outside the New York Stock Exchange on January 3, 2017. The five biggest stocks at the end of 1999 were Microsoft valued at $600 billion, General Electric at $507 billion, Cisco Systems at $355 billion, Wal-Mart at $307 billion and Intel at $275 billion. The current five largest companies are Apple at $689 billion, Alphabet at $565 billion, Microsoft at $490 billion, Berkshire Hathaway at $400 billion and Amazon at $388 billion. Cramer also looked at Facebook's $387 billion, since it's only one billion less than Amazon. Back in 1999, Microsoft and Intel sold at 65 times earnings, and 35 times earnings. The assumption was that the internet would take over the world and these companies had the software and hardware to make it happen. Unfortunately, the earnings explosion that investors expected never happened. Cisco's earnings pretty much collapsed soon after its business was crushed by telco carriers that raised money in the stock market to build out their networks. Wal-Mart was supposed to be the fastest growing retailer, too. Unfortunately, the company over-expanded and the model didn't scale overseas like it was supposed to and Wal-Mart hit a wall. "You could argue that all of these companies were overvalued on past earnings and they turned out to be even more overvalued on future earnings," Cramer said. Looking at today's top companies, Apple sells at just 14 times earnings with a rapidly growing service revenue stream. Alphabet sells at about 21 times next year's earnings with $52 billion in cash overseas and has a 16 percent growth rate. Facebook sells at 22 times next year's earnings with 52 percent revenue growth and has $29 billion in cash. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sells for 20 times earnings. The only outlier was Amazon, trading at 110 times earnings. But Amazon has always been an outlier, Cramer said. Given how it has crushed Wal-Mart and threatened the entire brick-and-mortar business with extinction, Cramer thinks it is merely taking the market capitalization away from the businesses it destroys and said the market cap is justified. "The question to ask isn't how did this current group of behemoths get so expensive. It's how did they get so cheap," Cramer said. With only one of the six largest companies not bound by conventional metrics, Trump or no Trump, the valuations seemed completely rational to Cramer. Questions for Cramer?

Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich went to Washington Wednesday and stood beside President Donald Trump in the Oval Office to announce the company’s $7 billion investment in a semiconductor fab, known as Fab 42, in Arizona. Fab 42 had stood vacant and unequipped in Chandler, Ariz. since the shell was completed at the end of 2013.  Intel's Fab 42 in Chandler, Arizona (Source: Intel)  "The completion of Fab 42 in three to four years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site,” Intel said in a statement. The 7nm semiconductor manufacturing process will be targeted for Fab 42. Not for the capacity Nathan Brookwood, Principal at Insight-64, told EE Times he was surprised by the news. He noted that “Intel is reactivating Fab 42 — probably not for the capacity, but for bringing EUV equipment necessary for 7nm manufacturing.” Rob Lineback, ‎senior market research analyst at IC Insights, also agrees. He believes Fab 42 is where EUV lithography tools will go. “Availability of EUV lithography tools and processes will help make 7nm successful, but this exposure technology represents a major change.” Noting that Intel is still putting the target three to four years out for Fab 42 to be “completed,” Lineback said, “Intel is rightly so being cautious.” However, when asked about Intel’s adoption of EUV equipment, an Intel spokesman was less than forthcoming. He told us, “We are still evaluating. We haven’t said at which node we may turn to EUV.” Driving this announcement, Lineback speculated, is that “Intel needs to tell the industry that it's not falling behind TSMC and Samsung in advanced technology.”  He added, “We're still talking 2020-2021, based on the timeframe in the announcement. Other Intel fabs will produce 7nm processors and ICs ahead of 2020, but Fab 42 will be a volume production plant.” Further, Lineback suspects that Intel will probably use Fab 42 for FPGAs now that it owns the Altera business. "Eventually, IoT ICs (embedded processors and microcontrollers) will move to 7nm technology, but that most likely won't occur for a few more years." What caused Intel to put Fab 42 on hold? In January 2013 Intel put on hold Fab 42, a massive fab that President Barack Obama once touted as a symbol of the future of U.S. manufacturing. Intel made that decision then because “they simply didn’t have adequate demand on the market,” Brookwood said. Fab 42 was originally planned for 14nm. What Intel failed to see then was that Intel's Tick-Tock MPU technology roadmap started to struggle in keeping to a two-year cycle for process generations and maintaining the aggressive pace for Moore's Law, Lineback observed. Also at that time, Intel did not see the success it had hoped for in smartphone application processors, he added. The company couldn't dislodge the ARM architecture.  In addition, the PC market has turned south, just about the same time when 14nm was having its rocky ramp, because of yield issues, Lineback noted. Even though Intel is doing well in the server market, Brookwood said, “Servers don’t need a lot of silicon.” Next page: How long had Intel been planning on this?

As Moores Law is running out of steam, manufacturing nodes live longer and longer. It already happend with both a difficult slow start and an extended life for 14 nm at Intel. The extensions of 14 nm is because 10 nm proves even harder and/or more expensive. That 7 nm node may have quite a long life as the most advanced node. Under such conditions, fab + equipment + research can be written off over many more years. I have no real insight into the relation between upfront costs and additional per wafer cost but cost per area could come down quite a lot after initial write-off of fab, equipment and research. That may open the area of "chip cost based on area plus a margin" over "property tech with huge margins". Think solar panel like production where you pay the end product per square meter. Low power neural net processors would benefit hugely from per-area pricing.

So this is the next node for upcoming 3/4 years. Still i don't know if "expand" where they need is so great. Expand means stop the production in the chosen clean room. Fab 28 was offline more than two years to be ready with the 10nm node. TSMC does one or two relatively little new modules every new node, to not stop the production in others clean rooms. They have an idle $1.5/2B empty clean room, why not to equip it?? the tools costs billions and billions, who cares in which factory they are up??? this is irrelevant. Intel sure has a projection for an higher wafer output in future, don't ask me why.  Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Purely political resistion   2/9/2017 4:40:38 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Just saying, there are other considerations besides where to put the EUV tools. With 3-4 years they can expand gradually where they need. But the original reason 42 was stopped was not enough business. In 3-4 years 10nm foundry might be their best bet.

They need of an untouched clean room to fully equip it with an EUV line. In my knowledge EUV scanners are pretty big, they are over multiple stories so i don't know if retool an old Fab is a good idea after all. Fab 42 is the only full volume production building that allow this, the building is pretty tall for Intel standards, likely it was thinked from the beginning for EUV and 450mm too. Intel know that this is a bet and they say 3/4 years just to stay safe, still they have informations from ASML that we don't have, so they believe to be lucky. All industry believe to be lucky :)  Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Purely political resistion   2/9/2017 3:38:01 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate None of the analysts got it right. The spokesman said basically it was a political maneuver. "we wanted to show our support for the new administration to push pro-business, pro-investment agenda" Technology-wise, for 7nm they would be planning whether to use III-V materials for example. Otherwise, to keep things simple, this fab can be 10nm but more like a foundry than for Intel-specific processors.

Under Trump this kind of thing receives a lot of attention, whether it be for hiring or firing. Sure, it'll create 10k jobs in 3-4 years, but this is a company that laid off 12k in the last year alone. IIRC, BK tried to get into Trump's pants ealier in the election cycle with a private fundraiser, which was promptly canceled due to public backlash, and now this?

The factory will be in Chandler, Arizona, the company said, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area will support the factory. Krzanich confirmed to CNBC that the investment over the next three to four years would be to complete a previous plant, Fab 42, that was started and then left vacant. The 7 nanometer chips will be produced there will be “the most powerful computer chips on the planet,” Krzanich said in the Oval Office with the Trump administration.

(AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in China AAPL stock may not be the top dog in China anymore, but Apple stock remains strong By Greg Gambone, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 8, 2017, 12:47 pm EST     Popular Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in China Recent Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is No Longer Top Dog in China Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Could Dominate With New Compute Card Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Hike App Store Prices … Because Brexit? View All Posts Earlier this week, research firm IDC released a report indicating that, for the first time ever, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone shipments to China have decreased significantly. According to the report, shipments of iPhones to China decreased last year to 44.9 million, a 23.2% decrease from 2015. Source: iphonedigital via Flickr Apparently, Chinese smartphone makers, particularly Oppo, Vivo and Huawei, have increased market share in the region by offering “higher-end gadgetry that appeals to consumers seeking Apple-like quality and innovation.” This has led to an overall decrease in the AAPL market share in China, down to 9.6% from 13.6% in 2015, and a subsequent drop in revenue — Apple’s “fourth consecutive year-over-year dip in the region” — by 11.4%. This new situation is potentially disconcerting to a number of analysts and investors, as China has presented a fantastic opportunity for growth in years past. However, due to the challenges faced by American companies attempting to conduct business in China — namely, the Chinese government’s overbearing regulation and frequent demands for controversial app and product modifications — coupled with the “ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives,” sales of the iPhone 7 were less than spectacular. Some analysts have attributed the reduced demand for the iPhone 7 to a lack of innovation and significantly higher product prices compared to other countries. This is potentially disconcerting for AAPL stock management and investors alike, since “China remains an important market for Apple, as it contributes 20.7% of its revenue and is the location for the bulk its [sic] manufacturing facilities.” It’s quite possible that AAPL stock will recover in China, and the lull in sales and Chinese-based revenue will reverse when Apple finally reveals its 10th-anniversary edition of the iPhone. Even considering the recent drop-off in both market share and sales in China, Apple stock is still going strong. According to Strategy Analytics, AAPL earned 91% of global smartphone operating profits in the third quarter. Bottom Line for AAPL Stock in China Of the 43 analysts providing recommendations to MarketWatch.com, 33 call Apple stock a buy and 10 call it a hold. The average target price for AAPL stock is $140.57, which represents a potential upside of more than 7% from Tuesday’s per-share closing price of $131.35. Overall, Apple stock is still one of the best choices for your tech-centered investment portfolio. While the struggle for dominance of market share in China will undoubtedly be a long and bloody battle, AAPL has a history of producing some of the world’s most innovative and compelling products, and this reputation — and expectation from consumers and analysts alike — will ensure Apple stock remains on everybody’s short list. As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Trump was the second president to celebrate the computer chip maker’s attempts to expand its domestic production at the same facility in Chandler, Arizona. In 2012, Obama went to the factory’s construction site and celebrated that the plant would produce “some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth.” Hiring freeze result of Trump team's review of federal agencies “Let’s stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas,” Obama said at the time. “Let’s reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America.” Advertisement But by 2014, however, Intel had pulled back from finishing the factory. The company said Wednesday that it expects to open the plant known as “Fab 42″ within four years. “We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand,” said William Moss, an Intel spokesman. “We’re making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business.” Like Obama, Trump declared it a win for workers. “We’re very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy,” Trump said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an Oval Office visit with Trump that the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly —and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich said he made the announcement from the White House because “it’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” But Intel has not been a universal fan of Trump’s policies. It was among the tech companies that filed a legal brief that challenged the president’s 90-day ban on travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. The announcement comes as Intel has shed jobs. It announced last year that it planned to lay off 12,000 workers in a reorganization prompted by a decline in sales of personal computers. That was about 11 percent of the company’s workers.

Though he has tweeted in the past about companies such as the U.S. automakers, Boeing and Carrier, ethics experts saw the fact that this one was about a business run by his daughter raising conflict-of-interest concerns and even carrying an implicit threat. In the message, Trump said, "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Posted first on his personal account, it was re-tweeted more than 6,000 times in less than an hour. It was also retweeted by the official @POTUS account. Trump's presidency has raised unprecedented concerns about ethical conflicts. His plan to separate himself from his sprawling real estate business has been criticized by ethics experts, who say it doesn't do enough to make sure that Trump won't make decisions to personally benefit himself, his family or his company. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert, said the Nordstrom tweet is problematic because other retailers may think twice now about dropping the Ivanka Trump brand for fear of getting criticized publicly by the president. She said it was especially disturbing that Trump retweeted his message on the official White House account. "The implicit threat was that he will use whatever authority he has to retaliate against Nordstrom, or anyone who crosses his interest," said Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Clark defended the president's right to use his personal Twitter account to express his views, however, pointing out that government workers at the EPA recently set up alt-EPA accounts to criticize the president's policies. "A government employee, even a president, is allowed to tweet in his personal capacity." Trump has feuded with several consumer brands before and after winning the presidency. After Macy's dropped his line of ties and shirts during the summer of 2015 over his comments about immigrants, Trump singled Macy's out for having a tough holiday season. "Good news, disloyal @Macy's stock is in a total free fall. Don't shop there for Christmas," he tweeted that December. And in January of this year, he scolded General Motors for "sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border." ''Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax," he said. Nordstrom reiterated Wednesday that its decision was based on the brand's performance. Since it confirmed its decision about the brand last week, the company has been responding to disappointed or angry shoppers on its Twitter, stressing that its reasons were based on poor performance. Nordstrom shares had dropped after the tweet, like those of other companies Trump has mentioned in the past, but they later recovered to close more than 4 percent higher. A social media campaign called "Grab Your Wallet" has urged a boycott of stores that stock Ivanka Trump or Donald Trump products, though the companies that have stopped ordering or cut back on the Ivanka Trump brand have not mentioned it. Nordstrom said last week its decision was based on the Ivanka Trump brand's performance, and that each year it replenishes about 10 percent of its supply with new products. On its website alone it has more than 2,000 products on its website alone. "Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business," it said. Retailer Belk Inc. said Wednesday it will no longer be carrying the Ivanka Trump brand on its website, but will still offer the merchandise at its stores. The New York Times reported that TJX Cos., which operates T.J. Maxx, told employees not to display Ivanka Trump goods separately and to discard the brand's signs, according to a memo obtained by the paper. TJX spokeswoman Doreen Thompson confirmed the memo and said the communication was "intended to instruct stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor." She said that "at this time, we continue to offer the line of merchandise." Rosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, said last week that the brand is expanding and saw "significant" revenue growth last year compared to the previous year. Ivanka Trump has said she would take a leave of absence from her clothing and accessories business as well as the Trump organization. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter" when he posted the tweet and that "he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." "For someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is not acceptable," Spicer said. Trump's tweet was posted at 10:51 a.m., a little over 20 minutes after the scheduled start of the president's daily intelligence briefing in the Oval Office. Spicer waved off reporters' questions about the timing, saying the president was not otherwise occupied when he wrote the tweet. It's not the first time Trump's tweets have at least temporarily affected a stock. "What we are seeing is that we are living in a world with a different kind of chief executive in the White House," said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation trade group. "He has a strong opinion on issues. We are learning to work in the environment." Retailers drop brands all the time because of poor performance, said brand consultant Allen Adamson, but given a highly charged political environment, perception is reality for loyal Trump fans. "It is clearly hard for Nordstrom to tell the story that it is dropping (the brand) for business reasons," said Adamson, founder of the consulting firm Brand Simple. "The timing is awful. The environment is full of companies taking political stands. So in this environment it will be perceived as a political statement. Nordstrom is getting dragged into this even though they may not want to be." He said that the best advice he can give companies is to be clear, firm and succinct in their message. But one thing is evident: "They shouldn't get into a Twitter war with the president," he added. "That is a no-win situation."

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops The best MacBook Air alternatives Emily FerronFebruary 9th, 2017 6 pictures New Atlas' picks for MacBook Air alternativesView gallery - 6 images The MacBook Air is not the lightest, thinnest, most powerful or most recent of the Apple laptop lineup, but with its slim size, worthy internals and mix of expansion ports, it is arguably the most user-friendly. If you're looking for comparable options, New Atlas has a few suggestions. Dell XPS 13 (2016) If you're willing to jump ship from macOS Sierra to Windows 10, the Dell XPS 13 (2016) is worthy of consideration. Like the Air, it has an attractive tapered metal build and more expansion ports than many of its competitors. It also boasts seventh-generation Intel Core CPUs (i3, i5, or i7) and a higher resolution display than the MacBook Air. Those specs represent a improvement in speed and power over the MacBook Air's fifth-generation i5 or i7 processors. In terms of the display, the MacBook Air offers only 1,440 x 900 resolution, while the entry-level Dell XPS' 13.3-inch display is 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, with a 3,200 x 1,800 QHD touchscreen upgrade also available. The XPS is equipped with legacy USB 3.0 ports x 2, USB-C x 1, SD card slot and an audio jack. The Dell XPS 13 starts at $800, though we recommend upgrading to at least the $1,000 Core i5 version. Keep in mind that big box stores like Best Buy often run sales on the XPS 13 and other Dell laptops, but be sure you're looking at the latest version, as previous models have the same name. 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro If you're trying to fill the shoes of a MacBook Air, look to the generation-old MacBook Pro rather than the 2016 edition. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display from 2015 encompasses some incremental improvements over the older MacBook Air, without some of the alienating qualities of the newer MacBook Pros. You're also more likely to find it at a compelling markdown. The MacBook Air is taller, wider and thinner than the 2015 MacBook Pro. It's also about 15-percent lighter. But if you can handle the extra weight, the MacBook Pro offers a 2,560 x 1,600 (227 ppi) display, a solid-state Force Touch trackpad instead of the older hinged version, a faster processor and better integrated graphics. Unlike the newest models with only two USB-C ports, the 2015 MacBook Pro still packs in an array of expansion options: SD card slot, USB 3 x 2, HDMI out and Thunderbolt 2 x 2. There's also a dedicated MagSafe charging port, something Apple has since done away with. Unfortunately, those two Thunderbolt 2 ports may well be obsolete if you don't have any compatible peripherals, and you'll probably miss the USB-C. The 2015 MacBook Pro is available new from Apple starting at $1,299, but can easily be found for less elsewhere, especially if you wait for sales or consider used or refurbished models. Buy MacBook Pro with Retina Display on Amazon 12-inch MacBook If you are drawn to the MacBook Air due to its former reputation as the lightest, most compact Apple laptop, that title now belongs to the 12-inch MacBook (just "MacBook", no suffixes). Switching to the MacBook means a downgrade in display size and number of ports, not to mention spending about $300 more. However, it's a newer, smaller machine with a higher-quality display. The biggest complaint against this machine is its single USB-C port, which is also used for charging. That means you can count on using some kind of adapter (not included) for most peripherals, though if you're a heavy cloud user you may never miss it. The MacBook also uses Intel m3, m5 or m7 processors that are more efficient, but less speedy, than the Air's core i5/i7 options. Still, the MacBook could be a good choice if you just want a newer, more portable laptop with all of Apple's characteristic good looks and operating system. It starts at $1,299 purchased new from Apple. Asus Zenbook 3 The Asus Zenbook 3 is more analogous to the 12-inch MacBook than the MacBook Air, but it's a worthy ultra-portable machine that is eye-catching and powerful to boot. Weighing only 0.95 kgs (2.09 lbs), it fits in a seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, 512 GB of flash storage, 8 or 16 GB of RAM and surprisingly capable speakers. Its display is visibly higher resolution (1,920 x 1,080) albeit a little smaller, than that of the MacBook Air. Unfortunately, the Zenbook 3 has only one USB-C port, but at least Asus includes an adapter that splits that port into a USB-C, HDMI out and USB3. The entry level Zenbook with the i5 processor and 8 GB of RAM starts at $999. The more powerful i7 version with 16 GB of RAM starts at $1,599. HP Spectre x360 The HP Spectre x360 is a highly configurable 2-in-1 tablet/laptop. 2-in-1s are increasingly popular; this is our pick for one that makes improvements on the MacBook Air in the same approximate price range. It that was originally introduced in 2015, but it was upgraded with seventh-generation Intel core processors last year. If versatility is a priority, you'll enjoy its touchscreen and 360-degree hinge. You can even add on optional active stylus for about $50. At 1.3 kg (2.85 lbs), it's slightly lighter than the MacBook Air, it has higher display resolution, and you won't even have to say goodbye to your expansion options. The Spectre x360 is equipped with USB-C x 2 and USB3 x 1. The base configuration starts at $1,049 directly from HP, but we've seen it go on sale. Want to explore comparable 2-in-1s? We also recommend the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, but we do expect a new version of that option in the next few months.View gallery - 6 images The best MacBook Air alternatives 1 / 6 Tags #MacBook #Apple #Laptop #MacBook Air #Microsoft Surface #Dell #MacBook Pro #Product alternatives Share this article Post a comment   Over 255,000 people receive our email newsletter See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning Your Email Top stories Harley-Davidson’s Road King Special gets the bagger treatment Three new uranium-rich minerals unearthed in Utah LG Watch Sport vs. Samsung Gear S3 Walking robot takes first steps into the market Recommended for you Latest in Laptops The best MacBook Air alternatives The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives Review: Asus Zenbook 3 is an ultra-portable mini powerhouse The best Microsoft Surface Book alternatives The best MacBook Pro (2016) alternatives Dell's latest laptops are built to survive the classroom Samsung Notebook 9 vs. Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch) 12-inch MacBook case would add ports, power, protection Hands-on: An accessory that gives the MacBook Air a touchscreen Hands-on with the updated Gram, LG's light and capable laptop Hands-on with Samsung’s Chromebook 2-in-1 and fleet of 2017 laptops Dell's new laptop leaves the power cord in the past Editors Choice How do you solve fake news problem in the post-truth era?

Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich announced the investment to reporters while standing behind President Donald Trump, a signal of how corporate America is adapting to a White House that is not reluctant to single out companies for praise or criticism. Trump said Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said Intel has been working on the factory — its third in Arizona — for several years. He said he wanted to announce it at the White House as a sign of support for the "tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward." The company said in a release that the plant would be completed in three or four years. Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, campaigned on a promise to push for companies to keep or create jobs in the United States, rather than sending them abroad. Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. But that issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives. Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power data centers and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.

The high-volume factory is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made jointly by President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House. According to company officials, the completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on,” said Krzanich. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry.” “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs, high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” Intel is America’s largest high-technology capital expenditure investor ($5.1 billion in the U.S. 2015) and its third largest investor in global R&D ($12.1 billion in 20151), Intel officials said. The majority of Intel’s manufacturing and R&D is in the United States. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States, while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, including semiconductor tooling, software, logistics, channels, OEMs and other manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs. The 7 nm semiconductor manufacturing process targeted for Fab 42 will be the most advanced semiconductor process technology used in the world and represents the future of Moore’s Law. In 1968 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computing power will become significantly more capable and yet cost less year after year. The chips made on the 7 nm process will power the most sophisticated computers, data centers, sensors and other high-tech devices, and enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more. These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore’s Law, a suggestion from experts in the field predicting the number of integrated circuit transistors per square inch has doubled and is likely to increase to the same degree every year.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said the semiconductor maker will invest $7 billion to complete a chip factory in Chandler, Arizona, becoming the latest company to use a meeting with President Donald Trump to tout spending and job-creation plans that were already in place. Krzanich, speaking Wednesday in the Oval Office, called the investment an expansion of Intel’s presence in Chandler that will finish a plant — already under construction — capable of advanced 7-nanometer chip production. The Fab 42 facility will be completed in 3 to 4 years and create about 3,000 company jobs, Intel said in a statement following the meeting at the White House. The chipmaker took a page from what has become a familiar playbook for technology and other companies: making a splashy announcement on investment and job additions after a high-profile huddle with Trump, who has threatened punishment for companies that shift operations overseas. Intel already builds most of its products in the U.S., at facilities in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico, and part of the spending will come out of the chipmaker’s previously disclosed budget for new plants of about $12 billion this year. In December, IBM Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said she planned to hire about 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years — an announcement made on the eve of a meeting of technology industry leaders with Trump. The president, in the run-up to his inauguration, also sought credit for Sprint Inc.’s commitment to create or bring back 5,000 jobs that the telecommunications company said are part of broader U.S. hiring plans previously announced by Japan-based parent SoftBank Group. The massive facilities required to make advanced semiconductors in an economically competitive way don’t require heavy staffing. Chip plants are among the most automated factories on the planet. Their immense cost — more than $5 billion for a state-of-the art facility — comes from the expense of equipping them with that automation. Intel, like other chipmakers, typically locates its factories in areas where it can get tax breaks to offset some of the outlay. “We’ve been working on this factory for several years. We’ve held off actually on doing this investment until now,” Krzanich said from the Oval Office. “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” The investment will also indirectly generate about 7,000 jobs in support of the facility, Intel said. The Chandler plant, when completed, will take its place among a worldwide network of Intel factories, which are also located in Ireland, Israel and China. The chipmaker, one of the founding companies of California’s Silicon Valley, has held onto its 15 percent market-leading slice of the $300 billion global chip industry through outspending rivals on research, development and plants over the years. Fab 42 has been celebrated by presidents before. In 2012, Barack Obama made a speech in front of the building, which was then going to benefit from $5 billion of investment. Echoing language Krzanich used in the Oval Office Wednesday, Obama called it “a factory which will turn out some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth.” “The factory being built here behind me is an example of an America within reach,” Trump’s predecessor called it at the time. “An America that attracts the next generation of manufacturing jobs.” Intel’s decision to complete work on the plant now is likely based on industry dynamics. The company is under competitive pressure to move to more advanced production, and the factory was already built and just needed to be equipped. “Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about Trumponomics,” said Neil Campling, the London-based head of global technology, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Securities. “In this industry, talk is cheap until the production ramps.” The Santa Clara, California-based company has about 106,000 employees around the world, with half of them located in the U.S. The chipmaker’s staffing levels have stayed roughly unchanged through acquisitions. In April last year Krzanich announced he would be eliminating 12,000 jobs, the company’s biggest cutbacks in a decade, prompted by slower growth amid a continuing slump in demand for personal computers, Intel’s biggest market. 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2kPsRtn TOP VIDEOS Mike Ilitch: 'I fell in love with Midwestern friendliness' 2:40 Microsoft moving to Detroit 3:49 Walking the floor at the NAIAS Charity Preview 1:00 Biden admires Detroit, 'an iconic city' 2:15 Chinese automaker GAC reveals three new vehicles 1:57 Mercedes-Benz introduces new cars 2:48 Infiniti introduces QX50 concept 1:19 2018 Honda Odyssey introduced 0:54 Nissan introduces Vmotion 2.0 concept, Rogue Sport SUV 1:25 2017 North American Car and Truck of the Year awards 2:03

Intel inexplicably makes jobs announcement in round room with very nice curtains Posted Feb 8, 2017 by Taylor Hatmaker (@tayhatmaker) 0 SHARES Next Story A new (old) way for product makers to defeat patent roadblocks Intel’s latest press conference was its most well-appointed yet. The chipmaker’s CEO Brian Krzanich announced his company’s newest initiative in a tasteful if traditional space with lavish gold curtains and a stately desk. The room, with notably rounded corners, was nearly 3,000 miles away from the company’s headquarters and many of its manufacturing sites. In lieu of PR a representative, Krzanich, the CEO of the “great, great” company, was introduced by a forcefully spoken if not particularly eloquent man who was seated nearby. “Brian called a few weeks ago and said we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but having to do mostly with Arizona and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced,” the man said, as camera shutters snapped wildly a few feet away. Krzanich heralded a $7 billion investment in Fab 42, the name of the semiconductor fabrication site in Chandler, Arizona that has been sitting idle after plans for it were abandoned in 2014. Fab 42 was first announced in 2011 and Intel claims that in the future it will employ 3,000 workers toward its manufacturing efforts. Notably, Intel cut 12,000 jobs — 11 percent of its workforce — in layoffs that began last May and are projected to be complete by mid-2017. “Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S.,” Krzanich said. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Helpfully, Krzanich quickly clarified what Intel intended to get out of the exchange with the seated man, who sat quietly, periodically casting restless glances out of the windows nearby. “We’re consistently one of the top five exporters in the country and one of the top two resource and development centers in the United States,” Krzanich said. “We’ve been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past, relative to the competition we have across the world.” It was not immediately clear what role, if any, the seated man played in the jobs, which appear wholly unrelated to the setting in which the news was announced.

Nanometer chips will be produced in an Arizona factory and will be "the most powerful computer chips on the planet," Krzanich said at the White House after meeting with President Donald Trump. The investment will go to the completion of the Fab 42 facility that is expected to be the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world, according to a statement by Intel. The factory is expected to be completed within three to four years. "Our factories support jobs -- high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located," Krzanich said in the statement. Trump thanked Krzanich in a Twitter message and noted "A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS!"

Intel Announces $7 Billion Arizona Based Semiconductor Factory February 8, 2017February 8, 2017 by CloudBuzz 25shares Intel Corp (INTC.O) chose the Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a $7 billion investment in a new Arizona semiconductor factory, a plant it said would create 3,000 new jobs when it is up and running. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich announced the investment to reporters while standing behind President Donald Trump, a signal of how corporate America is adapting to a White House that is not reluctant to single out companies for praise or criticism. Trump said Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said Intel has been working on the factory – its third in Arizona – for several years. He said he wanted to announce it at the White House as a sign of support for the “tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” The company said in a release that the plant would be completed in three or four years.Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, campaigned on a promise to push for companies to keep or create jobs in the United States, rather than sending them abroad.

Krzanich, speaking Wednesday at a briefing in the Oval Office, called the investment an expansion of Intel’s presence in Chandler that will enable a plant capable of advanced 7-nanometer chip production. The partially built Fab 42 facility will be completed in 3 to 4 years and create about 3,000 company jobs, Intel said in a statement following the meeting at the White House. Intel builds most of its chips in the U.S. at factories in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico. It also has plants in Ireland, Israel and China as well as test and assembly facilities in China, Malaysia and Vietnam. The chipmaker, one of the founding companies of California’s Silicon Valley, has held onto its 15 percent market-leading slice of the $300 billion chip industry through outspending rivals on research, development and plants over the years. The Santa Clara, California-based company said last month it plans to boost spending in 2017 on new plants and equipment to about $12 billion, an increase of about $2 billion from last year. Intel has about 106,000 employees around the world. Trump tweeted out his support of the annnouncement: Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel.

Intel announced the factory, which will employ up to 3,000 people, will be built in Chandler, where the company has two other plants. The company said the new plant will add another 7,000 jobs with indirect impact. Krzanich told CNBC the company had been considering building the factory for several years but said the president's planned tax cuts and plans to roll back some federal regulations prompted them to push ahead with the plans. "The people of Arizona will be very happy. It's a lot of jobs," Trump said at the White House. The new facility will build 7 nanometer chips, a new generation of ultra-small circuitry. "This factory will produce the most powerful computer chips on the planet," Krzanich said. The plans will complete a previous plant, Fab 42, that was started and then left vacant. "America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation," Krzanich said in a statement. "Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located." Intel was among 97 companies to file a legal brief late Sunday opposing Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States and invested $12.1 billion in 2015 in research and development, according to a company release.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) WASHINGTON •  Intel Corp. chose the Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a $7 billion investment in a new Arizona semiconductor factory, a plant it said would create 3,000 new jobs when it is up and running. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich announced the investment to reporters while standing behind President Donald Trump, a signal of how corporate America is adapting to a White House that is not reluctant to single out companies for praise or criticism.

The company said in a release that the plant would be completed in three or four years.

Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power data centers and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.

Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said the semiconductor maker will invest $7 billion to complete a chip factory in Chandler, Arizona, becoming the latest company to use a meeting with President Donald Trump to tout spending and job-creation plans that were already in place. Krzanich, speaking Wednesday in the Oval Office, called the investment an expansion of Intel’s presence in Chandler that will finish a plant -- already under construction -- capable of advanced 7-nanometer chip production. The Fab 42 facility will be completed in 3 to 4 years and create about 3,000 company jobs, Intel said in a statement following the meeting at the White House. The chipmaker took a page from what has become a familiar playbook for technology and other companies: making a splashy announcement on investment and job additions after a high-profile huddle with Trump, who has threatened punishment for companies that shift operations overseas. Intel already builds most of its products in the U.S., at facilities in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico, and part of the spending will come out of the chipmaker’s previously disclosed budget for new plants of about $12 billion this year.  In December, IBM Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said she planned to hire about 25,000 people in the U.S. and invest $1 billion over the next four years -- an announcement made on the eve of a meeting of technology industry leaders with Trump. The president, in the run-up to his inauguration, also sought credit for Sprint Inc.’s commitment to create or bring back 5,000 jobs that the telecommunications company said are part of broader U.S. hiring plans previously announced by Japan-based parent SoftBank Group. Heavy Automation The massive facilities required to make advanced semiconductors in an economically competitive way don’t require heavy staffing. Chip plants are among the most automated factories on the planet. Their immense cost -- more than $5 billion for a state-of-the art facility -- comes from the expense of equipping them with that automation. Intel, like other chipmakers, typically locates its factories in areas where it can get tax breaks to offset some of the outlay. "We’ve been working on this factory for several years. We’ve held off actually on doing this investment until now,” Krzanich said from the Oval Office. “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The investment will also indirectly generate about 7,000 jobs in support of the facility, Intel said. The Chandler plant, when completed, will take its place among a worldwide network of Intel factories, which are also located in Ireland, Israel and China. The chipmaker, one of the founding companies of California’s Silicon Valley, has held onto its 15 percent market-leading slice of the $300 billion global chip industry through outspending rivals on research, development and plants over the years. Fab 42 has been celebrated by presidents before. In 2012, Barack Obama made a speech in front of the building, which was then going to benefit from $5 billion of investment. Echoing language Krzanich used in the Oval Office Wednesday, Obama called it “a factory which will turn out some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth.” “The factory being built here behind me is an example of an America within reach,” Trump’s predecessor called it at the time. “An America that attracts the next generation of manufacturing jobs.” Chip Demand Intel’s decision to complete work on the plant now is likely based on industry dynamics. The company is under competitive pressure to move to more advanced production, and the factory was already built and just needed to be equipped. “Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about Trumponomics,” said Neil Campling, the London-based head of global technology, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Securities. “In this industry, talk is cheap until the production ramps.” The Santa Clara, California-based company has about 106,000 employees around the world, with half of them located in the U.S. The chipmaker’s staffing levels have stayed roughly unchanged through acquisitions. In April last year Krzanich announced he would be eliminating 12,000 jobs, the company’s biggest cutbacks in a decade, prompted by slower growth amid a continuing slump in demand for personal computers, Intel’s biggest market.

The CEO of Intel, Brian Krzanich, met with President Donald Trump in the White House today and spoke to reporters from the Oval Office. With Trump sitting at his desk, Krzanich described the company’s new $7 billion investment which will create new American tech jobs. Following the publicized meeting, a CNN panel discussed the event, with CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger calling it a “semi-advertisement” while also noting that Krzanich seemed a “little uncomfortable” because he was likely waiting on a question surrounding his opposition to Trump’s travel ban. Meanwhile, political analyst David Gregory provided some sharp criticism of what they just witnessed. “The whole scene was bizarre,” he said. “I have never seen the Oval Office used for this kind of dog and pony show with the president seated and a very uncomfortable-looking CEO literally selling his wares.” Gregory did note that if you are a supporter of the president, you will see Trump as a “president of action” and “more good news.” Watch the clip above, via CNN.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times EST): 1:10 p.m. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is at the White House and bringing the kind of economic news that President Donald Trump likes to trumpet: a $7 billion investment in an Intel factory in Arizona. The CEO says in an Oval Office visit with Trump that Intel will be completing the factory and making "the most advanced" chips on the planet." The CEO says the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich says the announcement comes partly in response in part to Trump's tax and regulatory policies. Trump calls the product that Intel will be making is "amazing." ___ 12 p.m. The U.S. military is looking to rent space at Trump Tower for use when President Donald Trump is working in New York City. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle says the Department of Defense is looking for the space "in order to meet official mission requirements." It's not immediately clear how much it would cost the Pentagon to rent space in the 58-story midtown Manhattan tower owned by the Trump Organization. Trump lives in the three-story penthouse. He hasn't returned to New York since taking office on Jan. 20. His wife, Melania, and their young son, Barron, are living there for now. It's customary for the military to obtain space near a president's residence. ___ 11:50 a.m. Organizations opposed to President Donald Trump's executive order on government regulations are suing to block it. The order required federal agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed or issued. The suit contends the order exceeds the president's constitutional authority — and directs agencies to unlawfully repeal rules intended to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the environment. Filing suit are Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, the Communications Workers of America and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ 11:25 a.m. President Donald Trump isn't happy about Nordstrom's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories — and he's tweeting his criticism. Trump says his daughter has "been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom." The president says she's "a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Nordstrom said last week that it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter's brand. Nordstrom hasn't immediately responded to an email seeking comment. Ivanka Trump has formally stepped down from her leadership role with the brand. ___ 9:57 a.m. President Donald Trump is promising "zero tolerance" for violence against law enforcement officers. He tells a group of police chiefs that his administration will give their departments the resources to recruit and retain officers. Trump also says "no one in America should be punished" simply for growing up in a place where violence may be prevalent. And as he has done before, he's singling out Chicago, saying the level of violence in the city cannot be allowed to continue. He says "we've allowed too many young lives to be claimed." When it comes to people who may be living illegally in the United States and involved in criminal activity, the president wants law enforcement and the public to report them to the Department of Homeland Security. In his words — "I want you to turn in the bad ones." ___ 9:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is asserting that had the right to enact his travel ban. He tells a group of police chiefs that his immigration order was "done for the security of our nation." He says the provision supporting the order was written "beautifully" and was within his executive authority. Trump says "a bad high school student would understand this." A federal judge has put the ban on hold, and an appeals court is considering an appeal from the Trump administration. The order includes a temporary travel ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. While awaiting a decision, Trump says "courts seem to be so political." ___ 7:55 a.m. President Donald Trump is expected to have lunch Thursday with a group of moderate Senate Democrats who could play a key role in his legislative agenda. The lunch is expected to include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana. Trump faces a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and hopes to secure some support among Democrats for his agenda and the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. All four Senate Democrats face re-election in 2018. The lunch was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by the Senate offices. The White House did not immediately provide details on the lunch, which is also expected to include Republican lawmakers. __ 7: 24 a.m. President Donald Trump is tweeting that if he loses the pending court case over his travel ban, the country "can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled." The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of Trump's executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on those from seven Muslim-majority countries. The appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but it also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. The president tweeted early Wednesday, "If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!"

Seven nanometers is the next stop on the roadmap, and the company revealed today that it'll be pouring $7 billion into its Chandler, Arizona facilities to complete an entirely new foundry for production on that node. Intel expects that Fab 42, as it'll be known, will require three to four years of construction before it's complete. When Fab 42 comes online, Intel says it'll be "the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world." Intel's Chandler facilities Intel already lays down many of its cutting-edge chips in Chandler, Arizona using its 22-nm and 14-nm tri-gate processes. The company employs more than 11,000 people at those facilities, and it expects to hire 3,000 more as a direct result of Fab 42's operations. In total, the company expects that Fab 42 will support more than 10,000 jobs in the surrounding area.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Article :  Windows 8: Something for Everyone Kaminario Debuts Modular Approach to All-Flash Storage Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 08 Feb, 2017          |         |     Share The rate of storage technology innovation that now regularly occurs presents IT organizations with a challenge at a time when the I/O characteristics of applications are more likely to significantly change over time than ever. Aiming to give IT organizations some flexibility in terms of addressing those changing requirements, Kaminario today unveiled a modular all-Flash storage platform that makes use of the latest Broadwell series of processors from Intel, 25G Ethernet connectors, and a choice of 4TB solid-state drives (SSDs) to provide five times as much storage capacity and twice the performance of its previous offerings. Just as significantly, Shai Maskit, technology evangelist for Kaminario, says the sixth generation of the company’s K2 all-Flash array is upgradeable from 16-gigabit to 32-gigabit Fibre channel adapters, can be plugged into NVMe-based systems, and will be able to employ next-generation Intel 3D XPoint memory as these technologies become available. “We’re future proofing the platform,” says Maskit. In the meantime, Kaminario also revealed that it has developed a compression engine running on a dedicated card that plugs directly into a PCIe bus. Maskit says offloading the processing of compression from the core storage system will further improve capacity by 25 percent. To back that claim up, Kaminario is now increasing its pledge to guarantee data reduction levels will at least result in a 4:1 ratio improvement. Any customer that doesn’t see that level of improvement will receive free additional hardware from Kaminario to make up the difference. Maskit says the additional storage capacity provided in the latest K2 platform is achieved by doubling the number of shelves in a platform that can be configured with either 2 or 4TB drives to provide a maximum of 4PB per array. Thanks to the rise of NoSQL databases and elastic search technologies, Maskit notes that IT organizations need to provide access to low-latency storage in a way that can be independently scaled out. Traditional applications based on relational databases need to be able to access data alongside these other emerging applications. Those requirements are in turn driving a wave of storage technology innovations that should become more widely available in 2018, says Maskit. The challenge, adds Maskit, is to provide a means for dealing with the storage needs of today without precluding taking advantage of any of those innovations tomorrow.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. The White House had said earlier that Vice President Mike Pence would speak on Wednesday with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a member of Trump's business advisory council, whose companies had also signed onto the brief.

Lenovo Yoga 720 landing with Kaby Lake, GTX 1050 this month? by Jamie Hinks 08 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments Lenovo is planning to unleash a new Yoga convertible at MWC 2017 in Barcelona later on this month, apparently. The new Yoga 720 convertible notebook is the successor to the Yoga 710 series and Notebook Italia reports that both versions of the machine will be powered by Intel Kaby Lake processors. Two screen sizes are said to be on offer — 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch — and the range offers a slimmed down version of the Yoga 710 with a tiny bezel around the screen helping to add to the feeling that it has been putting in the hours on the mat. Kicking things off with the smaller sibling, the 13.3-inch Yoga 720 comes loaded with an Intel Core i5-7200U chip, 8 or 16GB of DDR4 memory and a 256GB or 512GB SSD. By sizing up to the 15.6-inch you get plenty more bang for your buck, with a bustier processor (Core i7-7700HQ), bulkier battery and the option of a GTX 1050 with 2GB video RAM – if that floats your boat. There are plenty of other features across the board, including a fingerprint reader, two 802.11ac Wi-Fi connectors, Bluetooth 4.1, a USB Type-C connector and up to four USB ports (two USB 3.1 and one or two USB 3.0 ports depending on the model). You can even get a backlit keyboard as an additional extra. It supposedly comes in a range of different finishes including Platinum Silver, Iron Grey and Rose Gold, although you have to take the smaller variation to get the pink colour way. It’s too early to know what price this will come in at, but considering that it is very much a mid-range machine and the Yoga 710 came in at around £800, we’re looking at a convertible that will start at well under the £1,000.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 February 2017 by Military News jetNEXUS Support Expansion and Deliver Advanced Load Balancing Solutions Globally with HPE OEM Marlow, United Kingdom, February 08, 2017 –(PR.com)– Combining the innovative load balancing capabilities of jetNEXUS with the power and flexibility of HPE servers, the agreement enables HPE customers and partners to deploy a fully integrated HPE stack featuring a highly efficient hardware ADC solution. The HPE load balancer is critical to improving the performance, scalability and reliability of applications for a superb user experience. The mission critical nature of jetNEXUS advanced technology, combined with significant changes in the application delivery controller market, has placed increased demands on hardware appliances and their CPU capabilities. The modern load balancer is a layer7 device that delivers a host of functionality beyond simple server redundancy, including traffic management, pre-authentication, application firewalling, encryption and application acceleration. “These features require the CPU processing power that only an advanced server can offer. HPE servers use the latest generation of Intel CPU that offers the Intel AES instruction set. This delivers a massive performance boost for encryption tasks and provides a robust, powerful and guaranteed platform for our advanced load balancing software,” Greg Howett, CEO of jetNEXUS explained. The new OEM agreement will accelerate jetNEXUS speed-to-market in target regions, including countries where engineering support resources aren’t present. Additionally, it will enable them to deliver exceptional service levels and break-fix support on a global basis. HPE has the ability to offer a same day fix in all areas that jetNEXUS operate and HPE appliances can recover without the need for human intervention should a disk be replaced. “It is this combination of HPE support and hardware that means jetNEXUS offers a speed and quality of service unbeatable by any competitor.” stated Howett. Neil Pringle, EMEA OEM Director for HPE commented, “The hardware landscape is rapidly transforming and HPE is at the forefront of this with vendors capable of maintaining this pace, delivering leading solutions for workloads that require fault-tolerant availability and massive scalability.” jetNEXUS load balancers are certified by leading technology partners and are deployed in resilient infrastructures around the world. In addition to the HPE ProLiant servers, jetNEXUS is also available on some of the new HPE HyperConverged platforms and is already integrating into the SDN strategy. By eliminating the need for external load balancers with an OEM that can be sold and supported globally, HPE and jetNEXUS are able to reduce the complexities and TCO associated with external load balancing solutions.

Februar 2017 15:00 - Quelle: PCGH Intel bereitet mit dem i5-7640K und dem i7-7740K zwei neue Kaby-Lake-Chips vor, mit denen sich der Hersteller gegen die kommende Konkurrenz durch AMDs Ryzen-Prozessoren wappnen will. Die Neuerungen im Vergleich zu den noch gar nicht so alten Vorgängern sind allerdings arg überschaubar - im Wesentlichen wurde der Basistakt um 100 MHz gesteigert. Nun wurden anscheinend neue Erkenntnisse zu Tage gefördert: Die neuen Intel-Chips werden nicht mehr der klassischen Desktop-Serie zugeordnet, die mit zumeist mit einem "S" gekennzeichnet wird, sondern gehören der Kaby-Lake-X-Baureihe an, die mit einer thermischen Verlustleistung von 112 Watt ausgezeichnet werden und nach einem LGA2066-Sockel verlangen. Es soll sich um (fast) die gleichen Dies wie bei den S-Modellen handeln - allerdings wird die GPU abgeschaltet.

Earlier on it was rumored already that Microsoft is planning to launch another version of Windows called Windows 10 Cloud.  Microsoft refused to comment, the rumors pointed to a heavily restricted version of the operating system aimed at competing with Chromebooks at the low-end of the market. Being early in development, there’s not really much to see at this point in time, in fact, Windows 10 Cloud is identical to other versions of Windows as far as the user interface is concerned. The biggest, and perhaps only notable thing you will notice exploring Windows 10 Cloud is that it will not run desktop applications. Speculation points towards the idea that this version of Windows is the resurrection of the Windows RT concept. One of the key differences however with this is that Windows 10 cloud is capable of running on both ARM based devices and traditional x86 Intel based devices reports mspoweruser.com: An early version of Windows 10 Cloud has been leaked online which gives us a tiny glimpse at what Microsoft is cooking up at Redmond. An ISO of a Windows 10 Cloud build was leaked by Twitter user @adguard, which you can actually install today. Needless to say, we wouldn’t recommend installing it on an actual machine, so make sure to install it on a virtual machine instead. What is quite interesting, however, is that you can actually download some Win32 apps from the Windows Store. These Win32 apps are in the Windows Store via Microsoft’s own Desktop App Converter that allows developers to bring their Win32 apps to the Windows Store but they are still being executed as a Win32 app behind the scenes. Therefore, you can’t actually run Win32 apps that you downloaded from the Windows Store. As this is just an early version of Windows 10 Cloud, I don’t think it would be ideal to claim that Windows 10 Cloud won’t allow users to run Win32 apps that were downloaded from the Windows Store. It’s possible Microsoft will allow this to happen in the near-future, but we’ll have to wait and see until Microsoft officially releases this new version of Windows 10. Windows 10 Cloud could be a very interesting version of Windows, to be honest. Windows 10 Cloud seems like Microsoft’s second take on Windows RT, which didn’t really succeed due to the Windows Store not having a lot of useful and powerful apps back then. In the case of the new Windows Store and the Universal Windows Platform, the story isn’t much different either — consumers, especially power users, would still want to be able to run the classic Win32 apps on their PC — even if they are from the Windows Store. However, Windows 10 Cloud may allow Microsoft to compete with Google’s Chromebooks by introducing cheaper Windows 10 devices while offering good performance and a smooth user experience.

Clouseau Maha Guru Posts: 1419 Joined: 2011-05-17 #5389423 Posted on: 02/06/2017 06:10 PM Why offer a full blown operating system if one does not have to? If all the majority of people need is a "stripped down" version then just offer that. Offer the additional functionality as an add-on if needed. This is the beginnings of modularizing Windows. If functionality is not compartmentalized then how will a subscription based model based on use function? The whole GUI is based on their uniform experience across all platform mantra. This is just the beginnings of bringing their subscription concept to market. Baby steps first; makes acceptance more palatable in the long run. schmidtbag Maha Guru Posts: 1215 Joined: 2012-11-10 #5389424 Posted on: 02/06/2017 06:11 PM So, it's basically an even more inconvenient version of Windows RT, and a crippled version of "Windows 8.1 With Bing".

Because UWP and Windows Runtime run "in a magic fairy aether powered by the fevered dreams" of winapi haters (and those heaters never wrote a single line of code in their life). Ding-gond, Windows Runtime is just an ABI over Win32 and COM. It is so win32 related that everything is rendered by D3D11 (by default), a win32 3d graphics API and every UWP window has it's HWND.

Have not rumors been that after Win 10 the OS will be subscription based as well? Nvidia already teased us with gaming on the basis that all the rendering is done on their servers and we are basically just streaming the game. Eventually all the software will be housed on servers that we will pay to have access to; just the very early pinging to achieve this.

Short sellers, though, may be keeping an eye on two of their favorite stocks in the days ahead. That’s because Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC), which are among the five most shorted stocks traded on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, recently hit new 52-week highs and have begun to retreat. After a nearly 22% reduction in Bank of America’s number of shares short in the previous period brought it to the lowest level since September, there was hardly any change between the December 30 and January 13 settlement dates. The more than 107.40 million shares short reported most recently still represented 1.1% of the money center bank’s float. The average daily trading volume increased in the period, but the days to cover remained at less than one. This bank posted better-than-expected earnings last month. Short sellers watched the shares rise around 4% in the short interest period, while the S&P 500 increased less than 2% in that time. But the shares have slipped more than 1% since hitting a new 52-week high of $23.55 more than a week ago. The most recent close was at $23.12, the 52-week low is $10.99 and the consensus price target is $24.79. Almost 76.05 million Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) shares were sold short as of the most recent settlement date. Short interest shrank more than 4% during the period to total 1.6% of the company’s float. Note that the number of shares short has topped 80 million only once since last May. As of the mid-January, it would take about four days to cover all short positions. Intel is expected to help lift the Dow this year, though its share price ended the two weeks up less than 2% from on the previous settlement date. However, since hitting a 52-week high of $38.45 in late January, the shares are down more than 4%, to close most recently at $36.27. Shares have changed hands as low as $27.68 in the past 52 weeks. The consensus analyst target is $41.15. Note that Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI), another highly shorted stock, is also trading near its 52-week high, and new short interest data is due later this week.

It is currently a core necessity in several manufacturing processes and has already been developed to a high extent in several of the developed nations in the world. The use of nanotech in advanced manufacturing is also one of the top agendas for top emerging economies such as China and India, putting a lot of focus on the development of nanotech over the coming years," states a TMR analyst. The global nano-magnetic devices market is simultaneously being driven by the growing demand for microelectronics in the production of microchips, solar cells, and flat panel displays, among others. The global nano-magnetic devices market is also being driven by factors such as the swiftly reducing scales of devices while conversely gaining an increase in resolution and characteristics. It is becoming increasingly possible to manufacture devices that are not only extremely small, but also more sophisticated than their predecessors. Nano-magnetic devices are a key component of building tomorrow's devices that are lighter, smarter, more power-efficient, and highly durable. This is also applicable to commercial electronics. Browse Press Release: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/nanomagnetics-market.htm High Costs Making Players Defer Research and Development  The top issue currently affecting not just the global nano-magnetic devices market, but also a lot of other nanotechnology fields, is the sheer cost of furthering research and development. The cost is high in research and development efforts, as well as the cost of raw materials. The high costs are creating difficulties for several countries, especially the emerging ones, to facilitate a faster rate of development and application for nano-magnetic devices. The cost of nano-materials is also exceptionally high due to the high volumes of effort and energy they need for production. At the same time, the manufacturing process of nearly all nano-magnetic devices is extremely complicated and requires the presence of highly skilled labor, something which is in short supply in several countries. "What current players in the global nano-magnetic devices market can do is to maximize their focus on non-IT applications, such as those in automobiles, homes, appliances, and wearables. More often than not, these application areas require low-energy devices and lower costing raw materials to gain commercial success and are therefore a motivational factor for players to generate funds for further research and development," adds the analyst. The information presented in this review is based on a Transparency Market Research report, titled, "Nano-magnetic Devices Market (Product Type - Sensors (Biosensors and Bioassays and GMR Sensors), Separation, Data Storage (Hard Disks and MRAM), Medical and Genetics, and Imaging; End User - Electronics and IT, Medical and Healthcare, Energy, and Environment) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2016 - 2024."
