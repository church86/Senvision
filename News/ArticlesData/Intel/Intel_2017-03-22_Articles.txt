Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Mar 22, 2017 at 9:22PM Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced last week that it would spend $15.3 billion to acquire Israeli computer vision and machine learning specialist Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) in a move that will take the company further into the field of autonomous vehicles. Mobileye developed machine-vision software that would detect obstructions or hazards that a driver might not see to employ "collision avoidance technology" -- all with a single camera. Its technology has evolved to employ a full set of cameras in pursuit of autonomous driving. Intel appears to be pursuing an end-to-end solution in self-driving cars, from software to hardware. This acquisition, along with several other recent moves by the CPU giant, indicate that the company is no longer content to cede the enormous potential of the artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous driving markets, and it is taking the fight to the one company that has the most to lose: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the industry leader in graphics processing technology, which has experienced staggering growth as a result of the AI revolution. NVIDIA GPU Hyperscale Accelerator. Image source: NVIDIA. PC market slowing Intel's CPUs have been the company's flagship product for years, but that market has been falling along with worldwide demand for personal computers. Shipments of PCs were down 6% in 2016, the fifth consecutive year of such declines. Successful penetration into new markets has been a priority for the company, which has made numerous acquisitions to bolster its AI credentials and allow the company to better compete in the market with NVIDIA. GPU Market booming In its most recent quarter, NVIDIA saw its data center revenue triple to $296 million from just $97 million in the prior-year quarter, largely because of the deployment of its GPUs in AI applications. The massive parallel processing capabilities of the graphics processors made them the early choice for AI applications. But Intel controls an estimated 99% of the non-AI data center market and is positioning itself to succeed in AI as well. AI Nervana Before this week's Mobileye acquisition, AI start-up Nervana was Intel's most high-profile move in the space to date. Nervana's unique approach was the development of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the Nervana Engine, which eliminated elements from the GPU not necessary for AI processing. Coupled with a reengineered memory, the company claimed it could achieve 10 times the computing power than what was currently available on GPUs. Intel believes this product, combined with its existing platforms, will be able to compete directly with NVIDIA in AI applications. Intel Unleashing the Next Wave of AI. Image source: Intel. Soon after acquiring Nervana, Intel announced several additional products tailored for AI. Its Lake Crest CPU chip was designed for the workloads necessary to train deep neural networks and increase its mathematics operations by 10 times. The next generation of the company's Xeon Phi processor, codenamed Knights Mill, was customized for deep learning, and it would produce four times better performance than the previous version. These products are scheduled to begin shipping in mid-2017.  Intel has made numerous other acquisitions in the AI space: cognitive computing company Saffron focused on deep learning and data analytics; Itseez, a software company specializing in autonomous driving, drones, and cameras; and Movidius, which provides system-on-a-chip technology used in computer vision and AI deep learning. These acquisitions further illustrate that Intel is intent on increasing its foothold in this nascent but growing industry. Final thoughts Much of NVIDIA's recent growth resulted from the adoption of its GPUs in AI applications. In its most recent quarter, revenue from its data center and auto segments -- where AI revenue is reported -- totaled $424 million, nearly 20% of the top line.  Intel doesn't break out revenue from AI or autonomous driving, so no apples-to-apples comparison is available. However, the company reported revenue of $16.4 billion in its most recent quarter, which illustrates that while similar gains from AI would only move the needle slightly for Intel, they would have a much greater impact on NVIDIA. So while the emerging technology represented by AI presents a long runway for growth and both companies stand to gain, depending on how things shake out, NVIDIA has much more to lose.

But it won’t tell the world what’s inside. The company calls this new creation 3D XPoint—pronounced “three-dee cross-point”—and this week, after touting the stuff for a year-and-a-half, Intel finally pushed it into the market. You can think of the new technology as a computer building block that can serve more than one purpose—a single thing that can replace several others. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 141.47 +1.62 +1.16% New York Times Co NYT = 14.25 0.00 0.00% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▼ 55.33 -0.52 -0.93% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 35.38 +0.34 +0.96% RELATED: Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived But the new tech also serves as a way for Intel to shift multiple markets in its favor. That’s probably why it won’t say what the memory is actually made of. Certainly, Intel doesn’t want others duplicating the technology, which it developed alongside hardware maker Micron. This chess game is worth watching because it could indeed change the way machines are built, most notably inside big internet companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies now build machines on a massive scale. They’re hardware markets unto themselves. And more than anyone else, they stand to benefit from Intel’s new technology. But a built-in tension exists here as well. Because they operate on such a scale, Google and Facebook don’t want their fate controlled by just one hardware supplier. They want choice, which brings efficiency by driving down prices. This dynamic is shaping the worldwide market for data center hardware. And Intel is pushing in the opposite direction. Traditionally, computers stored data in two ways. They stored most of it on hard drives, which could hold large amounts of information for long periods of time, even as machines were powered on and off—and do it pretty cheaply. But computers also used separate memory systems called DRAM to store the data they needed right now. This memory was much faster, but it was also more expensive and held less data. 3D XPoint can replace all those pieces—or so Intel says. “This is truly transformational,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich tells WIRED. “It allows architects—both at the PC level and the data center level—to rethink how they build the system.” Krzanich sees this technology redefining gaming machines and other personal computers. But that’s almost beside the point. A PC is a PC. Where this could really change things is inside the massive data centers operated by the internet’s biggest companies. As their online empires continue to grow, these companies always need faster and cheaper ways of storing ever-larger amounts of data. Over the past several years, they’ve already moved beyond hard drives to significantly faster flash solid state drives, or SSDs. Since even these drives aren’t fast enough in some cases, they’ve created a new breed of database that pushes massive amounts of data into memory. 3D XPoint could help in both those areas. According to Intel, it’s about 1,000 times faster than flash and can store about 10 times more data than DRAM. What Goes Inside But right now, neither of those numbers really apply. On Sunday, Intel released the first 3D XPoint product, a storage device marketed under the name Optane that can replace hard drives or flash SSDs. But this device is only about five times faster than flash SSDs—not 1,000—because of the standard interface that connects the drive to the rest of the machine. Eventually, Intel will offer products that plug straight into the heart of the machine, removing this bottleneck, but that won’t happen until at least the second half of the year. RELATED: Microsoft and Intel’s Decades-Long Alliance Has Started To Fray When that happens, the likes of Google and Facebook really could build new kinds of systems—systems that can hold data in memory even when powered down, that merge memory and storage or mix and match them in new ways—all in an effort to create vast networks of machines that can more efficiently juggle information. This is no small undertaking. If they significantly reorganize their hardware, they must also rewrite their operating systems and other software to accommodate the changes. According Krzanich, Intel is already working with “almost all of the big cloud service providers” to explore these possibilities. These companies, he says, have been testing sample hardware since early last year. Still, so many questions remain. Intel now says that 3D XPoint is only about one percent as fast as DRAM. Even if that improves, says Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective Analysis who follows the memory and storage markets, the technology only makes sense as memory if it’s significantly cheaper than DRAM. Whether it will be remains unclear. It’s also unclear when Intel will allow this technology to plug straight into processors offered by competitors—though Krzanich indicates it will. “We will always have options that can fix with anybody’s architecture,” he says. “With something as ubiquitous as memory, you’ve got to have it work with everybody.” What Krzanich does make clear is that Intel will not sell raw 3D XPoint memory to anyone else. “We won’t sell this in any other form but a finished product,” he says. Today, Intel is one of so many companies that sell flash, and that means its opportunities are slim. It wants to build a market for 3D XPoint where other options are scarce. Will the internet giants embrace that kind of arrangement? It’s an important question. As Google, Amazon, and Microsoft expand their cloud computing businesses, offering services where others can set up their own online empires without buying their own hardware, these internet giants will account for more and more of the worldwide hardware market. Increasingly, these are the main customers for parts suppliers such as Intel. In 2012, Intel vice president Diane Bryant told WIRED that Google bought more server chips from Intel than all but about four other companies. As Krzanich points out, Micron will also sell 3D XPoint hardware. So some competition will exist, eventually. And others are developing alternatives. It’s possible competition will push down prices, and the internet’s biggest companies will bite. But for now, the dance goes on to decide what really winds up inside.

Many people had expected the laptop/tablet hybrid to be released in April. Unfortunately, there are some reports that indicate the device will be released in October. This could be true as Tech Report says Microsoft may include the latest AMD Ryzen processor in the Pro 5, and those aren’t abundantly available now. “Our newest rumour about the Surface Pro 5 is an interesting one indeed. Despite plenty of talk about the device getting Intel’s latest Kaby Lake chips, it appears the Pro 5 might actually run on an AMD Ryzen processor instead. The theory has emerged due to a trailer for Alien: Covenant, which appears to show a Surface device” The article notes that the film is sponsored by Intel’s rival, and the description suspiciously reads, “Intelligence powered by AMD, Ryzen, and Radeon.” Most sources still have the Surface Pro 5 featuring Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor, better battery life, a rechargeable Surface Pen, and a new keyboard base. According to International Business Times, the Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. “HoloLens support was earlier reportedly not said to be included in the Surface Pro 5, since HoloLens is not a consumer device. But with the company rolling out the technology to more affordable VR headsets, the tablet is expected to offer HoloLens support.” The Surface Pro 4 already has a very high resolution screen. [Image by Daryl Deino] Other sources point to the Surface Pro 5 having a 4K screen. That may be overkill for some since a 4K screen (especially on a 12-inch device) may not be worth the extra battery power it requires. The current Surface Pro 4 has a 2736 x 1824 pixel resolution screen, which gives viewers an incredible 267 pixels per inch. Some people expressed their disappointment at the possibly delayed Surface Pro 5 on social media. So upset that @Microsoft isn't releasing Surface Pro 5 until October. Almost want to kill myself (not really, but you know what I mean) — Prince Rules (@PrinceMyBaby3) March 22, 2017 WTF? No new Surface Pro until OCTOBER? Go to hell #microsoft — Gillian (@gillianlemy1) March 23, 2017 Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 is their biggest hit in years. Cynics initially laughed off the Surface Pro, but the device has become the go-to laptop/tablet hybrid that other companies are trying to copy. Samsung, who released the TabPro S in 2016, came pretty close by delivering a 12-inch device, but one with a Super AMOLED screen — something that has barely been seen on a Windows 10 device. Though a lot of people loved Samsung’s device, they said the only thing keeping them buying a Surface Pro 4 instead was the fact that Samsung’s device was powered by an Intel Core M processor, which is known to be very slow. However, that is about to change with Samsung’s soon-to-be-released Galaxy Book. The 12-inch version of the Galaxy Book has an AMOLED screen. [Image by Kathy Willens/AP Images] As Trusted Reviews notes, the Galaxy Book will come in two flavors — a 10-inch (1080p) device and a 12-inch (Quad HD) device, with the latter including Samsung’s gorgeous AMOLED sceen. The 12-inch Galaxy book will now run a regular Intel Core i5 processor rather than a slow mobile one. It can actually reach speeds up to 3.1GHz, so those who want to edit photos and videos on the go will be able to without much trouble. However, those who do editing may want to get the version with 8GB of RAM instead of the cheaper one with 4GB RAM. The 10-inch version of the Galaxy Book runs a slower Core M3 processor, but could be good enough for those just looking to consume media or do office tasks. This will compete with the iPad and Microsoft’s regular Surface Tablet, which is hard to find due to being discontinued at the end of 2016. Which laptop/tablet would you rather have — the Surface Pro 5 or the Galaxy Book? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

Updated: March 23, 2017 @ 7:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Lawmaker proposes tax help for big manufacturing firms By BOB CHRISTIE Associated Press Mar 22, 2017 Updated 12 hrs ago 0 PHOENIX (AP) — A Republican lawmaker whose proposal to give computer chip maker Intel a new way to use millions of dollars in tax credits was rejected by the full House pushed another proposal to cut taxes on manufacturing firms through a House committee Wednesday. Chandler Rep. Jeff Weninger's new proposal extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. It also gives super-fast depreciation to Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. It indefinitely extends a current research and development tax credit that is supposed to be reduced next year. The depreciation portion will substantially cut the property tax and especially affect Intel, which plans to equip a new Chandler chip plant with billions of dollars of new equipment. Out are proposals letting companies cash in existing research and development tax credits that they hold but can't redeem because the Legislature has excluded much of the manufacturers' income from state taxes. There are more than $1 billion in unused R&D tax credits currently on the books. Also out is a provision returning half the income tax withholding from new workers and creating a new sales tax exemption for some supplies. "Basically this is a similar version to the one before while taking out all the things people had problems with," Weninger told the House Ways and Means Committee. The panel on which Weninger sits approved Senate Bill 1416 on an 8-1 vote, advancing it to the full House for consideration. If approved there, it will return to the Senate to approve the changes Weninger made using a so-called "strike-everything" amendment. The full House had rejected Weninger's earlier proposal on a 23-36 vote even after he removed provisions accounting for $5 million of the original $20 million cost. The depreciation part of the new proposal is estimated to cost $1.5 million in 2019 alone, Weninger told the panel. The costs of the extension of the existing jobs tax credit and the R&D tax credit proposal were not outlined. In other action Wednesday on tax incentives, a Senate panel rejected a proposal from Rep. T.J. Shope, R-Coolidge, that would have allowed financing companies to claim up to $30 million in tax credits if they invested $20 million in new or expanded rural businesses. The 2-5 defeat in the Senate Finance committee of House Bill 2530 came after members expressed concern that it would benefit an out-of-state company, Advantage Capital Partners, which was pushing the legislation. The same Senate panel approved another proposal allowing up to $10 million in tax credits for companies that invest in small businesses. The so-called "angel investor" proposal was added onto House Bill 2191 after the original proposal contained in another bill stalled in the House. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters. Host: Matt Grimes, User Advocacy Deck Questions: Submit questions for Frances during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. September 24, 2015: Should I Put it on Yammer? The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

But in 1987, Archimedes wasn't available to Torvalds in Finland, so he settled for the Sinclair QL. In the meanwhile, the Archimedes failed and disappeared from the scene, killing any chance for ARM chips to dominate PCs. Since then, multiple attempts to put ARM chips in PCs have failed. Outside of a few Chromebooks, most PCs have x86 chips from Intel or AMD. The domination of x86 is a problem for Linaro, an industry organization that advocates ARM hardware and software. Many of its developers use x86 PCs to compile programs for ARM hardware. That's much like trying to write Windows programs on a Mac. That fact doesn't sit well with George Grey, CEO of Linaro. "Linus mentioned this a little while ago: How do we get developers to work on ARM first? Why are will still using Intel tools?" Grey asked during a speech at this month's Linaro Connect conference in Budapest. A powerful Linux laptop or mini-desktop based on an ARM processor needs to built so developers can write and compile applications, he said. "May be we can take a Chromebook design and put more memory, get upstream Linux support on it, and use it as a developer platform for developers to carry to conferences," Grey said then. To further that idea, a group of ARM hardware enthusiasts gathered in a room at Linaro Connect to conceptualize a powerful ARM PC. The group settled on building a computer like the Intel NUC -- a mini-desktop with a powerful board computer in it. The free-flowing session was entertaining, with attendees passionately sharing ideas on the chip, memory, storage, and other components in the PC. The session, which is available on Linaro's site, also highlighted issues involved in building and supporting an ARM-based PC. There were concerns about whether ARM chips would deliver performance adequate to run powerful applications. There were also concerns about components and about providing a Linux user experience acceptable to users. Also important was building a viable ARM PC that would attract hardware makers to participate in such an effort. One worry was the reaction of the enthusiast audience, who might sound off if an ARM desktop didn't work properly, putting hardware vendors and chipmakers at the receiving end of criticism and bad press. "Based on a research and efforts today, building an ideal PC is going to be hard," said Yang Zhang, director of the technologies group at Linaro. Attendees quickly agreed that the ARM PC would need an expandable x86-style board with DDR4 memory DIMM slot, and NVMe or SATA slots for plugging in SSDs or other drives. Other features would include gigabit slots and USB slots. "Definitely, we need to be looking at something with real I/O, not some crappy mobile chipset with soldered-on 2GB of RAM," one attendee said. (Attendees aren't identified in the recording of the discussion.) Many ARM-based computer boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and Pine64 can be used as PCs, but have limited expandability and components integrated on the board. They aren't ideal for PCs handling heavy workloads. Also, Zhang pointed out that LPDDR4, which is used in such "mobile" chipsets, is slower than DDR4 memory, which is why the DIMM slots would be needed on the ARM PC. Next, the discussion shifted to the system-on-chip, and suggestions were made to use CPUs from companies including Marvell and Nvidia. Chips from Qualcomm, Cavium, and HiSilicon weren't suggested because those companies were uninterested in building a PC-style computer for development with Linaro. Ironically, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 will be used in Windows 10 PCs later this year. An interesting suggestion was Rockchip's RK3399, which is being used in Samsung's Chromebook Pro, which has PCI-Express and USB 3.0. Google and Samsung have been putting in a decent amount of work for Linux support on the chip. But it still is a mobile chip, and not designed for full-powered ARM desktop. "I have a 24-core Opteron right. To replace that I would need a 64-core Cortex A73 or something, which doesn't exist," said the attendee who suggested the RK3399. The discussion became a battle between server chips and mobile chips, which each had their issues. While the server chips boast good software support, they are expensive. The mobile chips are cheap but have poor Linux OS support. Software support would need to be added by independent developers, and that can be a considerable amount of work. In 2015, 96boards -- the ARM hardware effort of Linaro -- built a development board called HuskyBoard wth AMD's Opteron A1100 server chip, but that didn't go well. AMD has now abandoned ARM server chips and recently released the 32-core Naples chip based on its x86 Zen architecture. The initial PC will perhaps have a server chip with decent Linux kernel support. Standard interfaces, sufficient memory, and decent graphics will matter more, as will ensuring that standard components like heatsinks and memory DIMMs can be bought off the shelf. The purpose of the gathering was to get the ball rolling for the development of a real desktop based on ARM. The PC will likely be developed by 96boards, which provides specifications to build open-source development boards.

But in 1987, Archimedes wasn't available to Torvalds in Finland, so he settled for the Sinclair QL. In the meanwhile, the Archimedes failed and disappeared from the scene, killing any chance for ARM chips to dominate PCs. Since then, multiple attempts to put ARM chips in PCs have failed. Outside of a few Chromebooks, most PCs have x86 chips from Intel or AMD. The domination of x86 is a problem for Linaro, an industry organization that advocates ARM hardware and software. Many of its developers use x86 PCs to compile programs for ARM hardware. That's much like trying to write Windows programs on a Mac. That fact doesn't sit well with George Grey, CEO of Linaro. "Linus mentioned this a little while ago: How do we get developers to work on ARM first? Why are will still using Intel tools?" Grey asked during a speech at this month's Linaro Connect conference in Budapest. A powerful Linux laptop or mini-desktop based on an ARM processor needs to built so developers can write and compile applications, he said. "May be we can take a Chromebook design and put more memory, get upstream Linux support on it, and use it as a developer platform for developers to carry to conferences," Grey said then. To further that idea, a group of ARM hardware enthusiasts gathered in a room at Linaro Connect to conceptualize a powerful ARM PC. The group settled on building a computer like the Intel NUC -- a mini-desktop with a powerful board computer in it. The free-flowing session was entertaining, with attendees passionately sharing ideas on the chip, memory, storage, and other components in the PC. The session, which is available on Linaro's site, also highlighted issues involved in building and supporting an ARM-based PC. There were concerns about whether ARM chips would deliver performance adequate to run powerful applications. There were also concerns about components and about providing a Linux user experience acceptable to users. Also important was building a viable ARM PC that would attract hardware makers to participate in such an effort. One worry was the reaction of the enthusiast audience, who might sound off if an ARM desktop didn't work properly, putting hardware vendors and chipmakers at the receiving end of criticism and bad press. "Based on a research and efforts today, building an ideal PC is going to be hard," said Yang Zhang, director of the technologies group at Linaro. Attendees quickly agreed that the ARM PC would need an expandable x86-style board with DDR4 memory DIMM slot, and NVMe or SATA slots for plugging in SSDs or other drives. Other features would include gigabit slots and USB slots. "Definitely, we need to be looking at something with real I/O, not some crappy mobile chipset with soldered-on 2GB of RAM," one attendee said. (Attendees aren't identified in the recording of the discussion.) Many ARM-based computer boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and Pine64 can be used as PCs, but have limited expandability and components integrated on the board. They aren't ideal for PCs handling heavy workloads. Also, Zhang pointed out that LPDDR4, which is used in such "mobile" chipsets, is slower than DDR4 memory, which is why the DIMM slots would be needed on the ARM PC. Next, the discussion shifted to the system-on-chip, and suggestions were made to use CPUs from companies including Marvell and Nvidia. Chips from Qualcomm, Cavium, and HiSilicon weren't suggested because those companies were uninterested in building a PC-style computer for development with Linaro. Ironically, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 will be used in Windows 10 PCs later this year. An interesting suggestion was Rockchip's RK3399, which is being used in Samsung's Chromebook Pro, which has PCI-Express and USB 3.0. Google and Samsung have been putting in a decent amount of work for Linux support on the chip. But it still is a mobile chip, and not designed for full-powered ARM desktop. "I have a 24-core Opteron right. To replace that I would need a 64-core Cortex A73 or something, which doesn't exist," said the attendee who suggested the RK3399. The discussion became a battle between server chips and mobile chips, which each had their issues. While the server chips boast good software support, they are expensive. The mobile chips are cheap but have poor Linux OS support. Software support would need to be added by independent developers, and that can be a considerable amount of work. In 2015, 96boards -- the ARM hardware effort of Linaro -- built a development board called HuskyBoard wth AMD's Opteron A1100 server chip, but that didn't go well. AMD has now abandoned ARM server chips and recently released the 32-core Naples chip based on its x86 Zen architecture. The initial PC will perhaps have a server chip with decent Linux kernel support. Standard interfaces, sufficient memory, and decent graphics will matter more, as will ensuring that standard components like heatsinks and memory DIMMs can be bought off the shelf. The purpose of the gathering was to get the ball rolling for the development of a real desktop based on ARM. The PC will likely be developed by 96boards, which provides specifications to build open-source development boards.

Product awareness, product interest, product evaluation, product trial and product adoption - the five stages of cloud acceptance have already been negotiated. With Australian organisations now on board and now investing, cloud has moved past the hype and into the mainstream, creating new opportunities for partners as a result. Whether it be public, private or hybrid, implementations will continue to accelerate in 2017 as end-users seek to take advantage of the cloud’s economies of scale to build core applications. But as cloud becomes default, a default cloud channel strategy still ceases to exist. In association with Exclusive Networks, Fortinet, Storagecraft, Veeam, Westcon-Comstor and Zerto, this exclusive ARN roundtable assessed how partners can profit amidst a seemingly lucrative cloud world, outlining the new technologies coming to play, and the strategies required for ongoing success.

Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffIntelligence chairman sparks storm with Trump briefing FBI has info suggesting coordination between Trump aides, Russia: report Overnight Cybersecurity: House Intel chair says surveillance collected on Trump transition team MORE (D-Calif.) criticized Nunes for his surprise announcement earlier in the day that he had seen intelligence intercepts that showed authorities had incidentally gathered information on members of the Trump transition team during investigations that the chairman said were not related to Russia. Nunes made the announcement at a press conference, saying the information had been "widely disseminated" in an implicit criticism of intelligence community officials.  He then briefed the White House about his findings and appeared on CNN — without talking to Schiff, who knocked the chairman for not sharing the information.  "If accurate, this information should have been shared with members of the committee, but it has not been," Schiff said in a statement that criticized Nunes for a "profound irregularity" in how he had handled the situation. ADVERTISEMENT "The Chairman also shared this information with the White House before providing it to the committee, another profound irregularity, given that the matter is currently under investigation. I have expressed my grave concerns with the Chairman that a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way," he said. After making his announcement, Nunes said that President Trump was "to some degree" right about being surveilled by U.S. intelligence.   "I think the bottom line here is that ... President Trump, to some degree, is right that he did end up in some intelligence reports, and I don't think he knew about it," he told CNN, later clarifying that Trump is "not right" about the precise claim that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.   Schiff maintained that if Trump and his aides ended up in a lawfully compiled intelligence report, they were likely not the subjects of surveillance.   "As to the substance of what the Chairman has alleged, if the information was lawfully gathered intelligence on foreign officials, that would mean that U.S. persons would not have been the subject of surveillance," he said.     "In my conversation late this afternoon, the Chairman informed me that most of the names in the intercepted communications were in fact masked, but that he could still figure out the probable identity of the parties," he added. Schiff also said that it is "impossible" to evaluate the accuracy of Nunes's claim while reiterating that the committee does not support the president's wiretapping allegation. "Because the committee has still not been provided the intercepts in the possession of the chairman, it is impossible to evaluate the chairman's claims. It certainly does not suggest — in any way — that the President was wiretapped by his predecessor." Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy.

The free-flowing session was entertaining, with attendees passionately sharing ideas on the chip, memory, storage, and other components in the PC. The session, which is available on Linaro's site, also highlighted issues involved in building and supporting an ARM-based PC. There were concerns about whether ARM chips would deliver performance adequate to run powerful applications. There were also concerns about components and about providing a Linux user experience acceptable to users. Also important was building a viable ARM PC that would attract hardware makers to participate in such an effort. One worry was the reaction of the enthusiast audience, who might sound off if an ARM desktop didn't work properly, putting hardware vendors and chipmakers at the receiving end of criticism and bad press. "Based on a research and efforts today, building an ideal PC is going to be hard," said Yang Zhang, director of the technologies group at Linaro. Attendees quickly agreed that the ARM PC would need an expandable x86-style board with DDR4 memory DIMM slot, and NVMe or SATA slots for plugging in SSDs or other drives. Other features would include gigabit slots and USB slots. "Definitely, we need to be looking at something with real I/O, not some crappy mobile chipset with soldered-on 2GB of RAM," one attendee said. (Attendees aren't identified in the recording of the discussion.) Many ARM-based computer boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and Pine64 can be used as PCs, but have limited expandability and components integrated on the board. They aren't ideal for PCs handling heavy workloads. Also, Zhang pointed out that LPDDR4, which is used in such "mobile" chipsets, is slower than DDR4 memory, which is why the DIMM slots would be needed on the ARM PC. Next, the discussion shifted to the system-on-chip, and suggestions were made to use CPUs from companies including Marvell and Nvidia. Chips from Qualcomm, Cavium, and HiSilicon weren't suggested because those companies were uninterested in building a PC-style computer for development with Linaro. Ironically, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 will be used in Windows 10 PCs later this year. An interesting suggestion was Rockchip's RK3399, which is being used in Samsung's Chromebook Pro, which has PCI-Express and USB 3.0. Google and Samsung have been putting in a decent amount of work for Linux support on the chip. But it still is a mobile chip, and not designed for full-powered ARM desktop. "I have a 24-core Opteron right. To replace that I would need a 64-core Cortex A73 or something, which doesn't exist," said the attendee who suggested the RK3399. The discussion became a battle between server chips and mobile chips, which each had their issues. While the server chips boast good software support, they are expensive. The mobile chips are cheap but have poor Linux OS support. Software support would need to be added by independent developers, and that can be a considerable amount of work. In 2015, 96boards -- the ARM hardware effort of Linaro -- built a development board called HuskyBoard wth AMD's Opteron A1100 server chip, but that didn't go well. AMD has now abandoned ARM server chips and recently released the 32-core Naples chip based on its x86 Zen architecture. The initial PC will perhaps have a server chip with decent Linux kernel support. Standard interfaces, sufficient memory, and decent graphics will matter more, as will ensuring that standard components like heatsinks and memory DIMMs can be bought off the shelf. The purpose of the gathering was to get the ball rolling for the development of a real desktop based on ARM. The PC will likely be developed by 96boards, which provides specifications to build open-source development boards. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

But in 1987, Archimedes wasn’t available to Torvalds in Finland, so he settled for the Sinclair QL. In the meanwhile, the Archimedes failed and disappeared from the scene, killing any chance for ARM chips to dominate PCs. Since then, multiple attempts to put ARM chips in PCs have failed. Outside of a few Chromebooks, most PCs have x86 chips from Intel or AMD. The domination of x86 is a problem for Linaro, an industry organization that advocates ARM hardware and software. Many of its developers use x86 PCs to compile programs for ARM hardware. That’s much like trying to write Windows programs on a Mac. That fact doesn’t sit well with George Grey, CEO of Linaro. “Linus mentioned this a little while ago: How do we get developers to work on ARM first? Why are will still using Intel tools?” Grey asked during a speech at this month’s Linaro Connect conference in Budapest. A powerful Linux laptop or mini-desktop based on an ARM processor needs to built so developers can write and compile applications, he said. “May be we can take a Chromebook design and put more memory, get upstream Linux support on it, and use it as a developer platform for developers to carry to conferences,” Grey said then. To further that idea, a group of ARM hardware enthusiasts gathered in a room at Linaro Connect to conceptualize a powerful ARM PC. The group settled on building a computer like the Intel NUC—a mini-desktop with a powerful board computer in it.

Sign up now Menu ARN Microsoft is playing Windows hardball Microsoft is playing Windows hardball Lucky us. Microsoft will no longer be supporting older Windows on newer processors. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols (New Zealand Reseller News) 23 March, 2017 06:44 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft really wants all of us on Windows 10. And it's done asking nicely. For many users of Windows 7 and 8.1, upgrade cajolery just morphed into something that looks a lot like upgrade coercion. (It had already tried upgrade trickery.) I’m sick and tired of this. Windows 10 is OK, but I still prefer Windows 7, thank you very much. I’m not the only one. The Federal Digital Analytics Program (DAP), which gives the broadest and most accurate reading on operating system popularity, showed in mid-March that Windows 7, with 24.6 per cent of all users, is still far more popular than Windows 10, with which sits at 17.3 per cent while Windows 8.x comes in third, with 3.7 per cent. In short, there are still a heck of a lot more Windows 7 and 8.x users than there are Windows 10 users. But Microsoft has made it clear it wants everyone on a single operating system - namely Windows 10. Sure, Windows 7 will keep getting updates until Jan. 14, 2020 and Windows 8.1 will be supported until Jan. 10, 2023. That’s the good news. The bad news is that if you’re running either operating system on a PC with a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor or an AMD Ryzen Bristol Ridge CPU, your end-of-support date just became … today. Is that great news or what? We were warned this was coming. Microsoft told us last year that it wouldn’t keep supporting its older operating systems on AMD’s and Intel’s newest processors. Microsoft also won’t be supporting these operating systems on Qualcomm’s 8996 or newer processes. Read more ​Huawei pledges $400m to NZ innovation efforts Adding insult to injury, Microsoft got AMD and Intel to go along with this idea. An Intel spokesperson even said, “No, Intel will not be updating Win 7/8 drivers for 7th Gen Intel Core per Microsoft’s support policy change.” Thanks, AMD and Intel. We really appreciate you having our backs. Will Windows 7 and 8 even run on these hot new processors? I don’t know about AMD’s best and brightest, but I’ve had Windows 7 running on Kaby Lake. It runs just fine. There’s only one little problem. When Microsoft finally got around to releasing its latest patches, instead of getting them I got a message saying: “Unsupported Hardware — Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” Read more Ingram Micro brings NetEnrich to A/NZ Golly, Microsoft was serious. No soup — ah, old Windows for you! By the way, this latest patch package? It’s Windows’ largest ever and includes nine — count ’em, nine — critical patches. Thank you so very, very much, Microsoft. Is it reasonable of me to expect continued support? Well, when I look at Microsoft’s Windows Lifecycle support FAQ, I read, “All desktop operating system products, whether used for personal or business, receive a minimum of 10 years of support (minimum of five years Mainstream Support and minimum of five years Extended Support) at the supported service pack level.” But the relevant Microsoft Knowledge Base article states, “Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update.” Read more How IBM wants to bring blockchain from Bitcoin to your data centre Does anyone else see a little cognitive dissonance here? I see grounds for a lawsuit. If I were running a company that had paid Windows 7 and 8.1 licensing fees to keep getting support for a few more years, I’d be ticked. I’m not sure what the breakdown is for consumer versus business Windows users. But, given how conservative companies are, I’m sure most Windows corporate users are still running the tried and true Windows 7. Now that Microsoft is rubbing the enterprise’s nose into its refusal to support the most popular operating system on the fastest, newest hardware, I see this backfiring on Microsoft. Microsoft really, really wants to make Windows 7 and 8.x obsolete. Its customers, however, aren’t ready to let go of them anytime soon. If Microsoft doesn’t budge on this, I see corporate users giving Chromebooks and the Linux desktop more consideration. After all, neither of them will cut hardware support just to make you “upgrade” when you don’t want to.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel launches its first Optane SSD with 3D XPoint memory (for enterprise) 03/19/2017 at 1:04 PM by Brad Linder 15 Comments Almost two years after Intel and Micron unveiled a new type of solid state storage said to be up to 1,000 times faster than flash, Intel is finally launching a commercial product that uses 3D XPoint technology. It’s called the Intel Optane P4800X, and it’s a solid state drive designed for enterprise applications. It’s also got an enterprise price tag: the first version to ship will be a 375GB SSD that sells for $1520. Eventually we’ll probably start to see consumer-oriented Intel Optane SSDs, but not until prices fall. What makes 3D XPoint interesting is that it offers read and write speeds that rival what you’d expect from DRAM memory. But unlike DRAM, you can use 3D XPoint for long-term storage, since it’s non-volatile memory. In other words: anything saved in DRAM will disappear when you turn off the power. Like other SSDs, the Intel Optane P4800X can store data indefinitely without using power. The upshot is that not only can you do things like copy files and read data more quickly, but you can also use 3D XPoint as “virtual memory,” to get near-RAM speeds. AnandTech notes that customers currently have to pay extra for “Intel Memory Drive Technology” if they want to use Intel’s software for efficiently using its Optane SSD for virtual memory. While the first Intel Optane SSD to ship will feature just 375GB of storage, Intel plans to launch 750GB and 1.5 TB models later this year. via Tom’s Hardware Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 15 Comments on "Intel launches its first Optane SSD with 3D XPoint memory (for enterprise)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest BoloMKXXVIII Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

That already way exceeds the endurance of current SSDs, so that’s not likely to be a problem (even if you use it more like RAM, since there will be wear-leveling algorithms in place).

Wonder, also, what it would do to graphics cards with built-in RAM. The old ‘shared memory model’ (with all the swapping, caching) takes on a whole new meaning. Exciting… Honestly… $1,5k for 375gbs sounds pretty decent for an intro price.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. My guess is that using PCIe is a transitional stage to fit in with existing architectures. When this technology was announced a while ago much was made of the fact that there would need to be new connection and bus architectures for the full potential of this technology to be realised -particularly to take advantage of the potential speed of the new memory system.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. PCIe is a bottleneck, but like connecting an SSD to an old SATA2 interface you still get a lot of benefits. PCIe may limit absolute bandwidth but the low latency, high endurance characteristics are still a big benefit over NAND. None the less, the plan is to attach XPoint via DIMM slots in the future to break the limit of PCIe.

Well, that depends on the use case, but there is no doubt that whatever the solution, you will be able to full encrypt your data like you can do today — it will be built into the hardware.

High speed, cost-effective at small sizes, and better endurance than NAND mean it’d be a great disk cache. In fact the endurance alone might make it cost effective. In one solution I work with the server is spec’ed with 128GB SSD for the cache, but only assigned ~64GB at any time. The rest is there for wear leveling over the server’s 5 year life. If I can get a faster, more reliable 64GB Optane for a similar price to 128GB NAND, I’d be very happy.

Throw out the L2/3 cache, use it’s place to make a lot of registers. More registers make it easier to run multiple processes on the same core and make virtualization easier too. Cache on the other hand is only needed to prefetch from the relatively slow RAM, not needed anymore. Throw out branch-prediction, prefetch and long pipelines and ques, we only needed them to handle NOPs while waiting for memory, but not needed here. Use a simple RISC architecture. Instead make several cores that share the entire memory and hardware memory protection. RISC can do more instructions per clock. We need a new filesystem to go with this, since it’s both fast and non-violate it needs to be less robust, but instead of partitions it should work as a RAM-disk and should be resizeable… Read more » Vote Up1Vote Down  Reply 2 days 22 hours ago Guest James Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Totally agree. And this could be what makes or breaks Optane. Even PCIE m.2 SSDs would be more useful if the existing storage tier architecture changed. This is evident in the fact that they are x4-5 times faster than a SATA3 SSD and yet real world performance improvements are minimal. The architecture and OS just isnt set-up to make the best use of them. Whats probably most significant about Optane is that your can write to them with low latency, a byte at a time. Radically different from SSD’s high latency, page-based approach.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest The Mobileye acquisition is proof that AI needs guidelines Dr. Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, Israel Democracy Institute@tehillaaltshul1 March 22, 2017 12:10 PM Tags: ai, AR/VR Weekly, bots, chatbots, Intel, Israel Democracy Institute, machine learning, mobileye Image Credit: Shutterstock.com / chombosan The sale of Mobileye to Intel is not surprising when you consider that last year MIT Technology Review ranked the Jerusalem-based company as one of the 10 smartest companies in the world. Also not surprising is the joy, bordering on hysteria, being displayed by the Israeli government, which has declared its intent to cut taxes as a result of the deal (though it has not been clear exactly how). In addition, the government has used the occasion of Mobileye’s purchase by Intel as an opportunity to tout its success in the area of innovation. However, the story here is bigger than Mobileye. The real story is the relationship between government, society, and technology. The challenge presented by artificial intelligence (AI) is to get machines to solve problems that are uniquely the province of humankind: use of language, development of abstract thoughts and concepts, and, of course, self-improvement. This brave new world began with such technological leaps forward as personal assistants, continued with fundamental changes to the medical and legal systems, and is today on the verge of creating autonomous cars and weapons. Technological breakthroughs, along with major investments in research and the timely acquisition of companies, are bringing us closer to the day when these challenges will be addressed. It is likely that within a few short years, the AI revolution will enhance our lives and streamline the systems we’ve come to rely on. However, this revolution is not without challenges. Decision-makers tend to vacillate between an irrational fear of artificial intelligence — “What will happen when robots take over our lives?” or “What will happen once unmanned vehicles must decide whether to kill the person sitting inside it or that child who just ran out to the middle of the street?” — and euphoria and technological determinism, based on the belief that “you cannot stop technology.” These extreme reactions all lead to psychological discomfort that makes it difficult to deal with the real issues at hand. Based on the lessons of the past, we can learn that new technological realities, particularly with regard to the revolutions in information and connectivity of the past two decades, tend to be recognized too late by policy makers. Usually their reactions are heavy on euphoria but desperately lacking in basic digital literacy. One telling local example comes to mind, for me: The Israeli Ministry of Communications, preoccupied with taking over public broadcasting in Israel, has for years put off developing a set of standards for the Internet of Things. To avoid similar problems, the time has come to develop a set of guidelines to address the challenges presented by AI. This proposal can be categorized into four main areas of focus. First, we must tackle the broad policy aspects and potential impact of AI on the economy, society, and government, from the future of transportation to the fate of democratic forms of government in an era of tailor-made, accurate forecasting systems. Second, a paradigm shift regarding state regulation over matters related to machine learning must take place to ensure competition and deal with licensing, taxation, cybersecurity, and quality assurance. Third, we’ll need to protect human rights and create new standards in administrative law for smart systems, whether deployed as an effective and inexpensive substitute for the judgment of officials working in state bureaucracies or as a way to monitor systems in the private sector. Drilling down further on this particular focus, the autonomous systems being developed by Mobileye are based on the concept of reinforcement learning, whereby machines “learn” through experience after repeated exposure to driving videos. In this way, the system learns how to respond independently to situations that it has not previously experienced. With reinforcement learning being hailed as the technological breakthrough of 2017, we must develop ways to ensure systemic transparency, since even innovative programming systems’ developers cannot possibly know to where independent learning will lead. Fourth and finally, a comprehensive action plan to deal with such technological advances must be developed at the institutional and organizational levels within government. Experts who understand and can analyze the interactions between artificial intelligence technologies and social values will be necessary. And a cross-governmental dialogue on the subject must be initiated. While the blockbuster Mobileye deal is (and should be) a source of pride for all of Israel, in that it will make Israel the central address for automatic cars in the world and reinforces the perception that Israel really is the startup nation, the current challenge is to turn Israel into a startup society, too. The Mobileye deal proves that the future is now. Dr. Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler is director of the Government in the Information Age program at the Israel Democracy Institute.

On World Water Day and beyond, several companies are taking action to reduce their usage and promote sustainable water management within the communities in which they operate. Here are some of our favorite announcements and water management projects. Intel is installing a water recycling project at its Ronler Acres campus in Hillsboro, Oregon. When complete, the facility will have the potential to recycle over a billion gallons of water annually while also improving the quality of water that leaves the facility. General Electric today presented Intel with an Ecomagination Award for the project. These awards recognize the achievements of GE’s global industrial users and top customers that implement innovative solutions driving business value and environmental benefit. Once operational, the facility will recycle industrial water discharged from the manufacturing process for reuse in facility systems such as cooling towers, scrubbers and abatement equipment. Plus, the water discharged to the municipal wastewater treatment system will be cooler and cleaner. “Industrial water use is expected to grow 250 percent by 2030, which is nearly one-third of all global water use,” said Deb Frodl, global executive director, Ecomagination, GE. “Today, we only reuse about 4 percent of wastewater, so using technology and processes designed to minimize water use will be key to adapting to a water constrained world.” Intel’s water management strategy includes: Reduce: Investing in innovative water conservation practices within its global operations. Since 1998, Intel has conserved more than 52 billion gallons of water. In 2015, it saved 820 million gallons of water in Oregon through water conservation efforts. Return: Returning a significant portion of the water used back to local communities. In 2015, Intel returned 80 percent of the water its used in Oregon. Reinvent: Empowering others to reinvent water use by integrating smart technologies that drive conservation. Anheuser-Busch is celebrating World Water Day by kicking off its new “Water for a Better World” campaign to improve awareness around the issue of water scarcity and the importance of water stewardship. This campaign will promote water conservation across Anheuser-Busch’s facilities, and drive employee participation in the company’s efforts to protect the environment and enhance access to clean water through community-based watershed protection projects and water donations to key NGOs. For example, one of its brands, Stella Artois, is partnering with Water.org on the Buy A Lady A Drink campaign to sell limited edition chalices, pledging to provide five years of clean water for one person in the developing world for every chalice sold. Through this partnership, Stella Artois has already donated more than $3 million to Water.org to help provide more than 800,000 people in the developing world with access to drinking water. Additionally, Anheuser-Busch will partner with River Network to host more than 20 river and watershed protection projects for its employees and strategic partners across the country leading up to World Environment Day. Since 2010, the partnership has engaged nearly 10,000 local employee volunteers and community members in more than 130 watershed protection cleanups. Anheuser-Busch has cut water usage across its US operations by nearly 50 percent over the past 10 years, the company says. Banyan Water said it helped its customers — facility managers, property owners and real estate groups — save 300 million gallons of water in 2016, resulting in a new all-time total of 2.3 billion gallons of water saved. The company’s real-time monitoring technology also detected 432 leaks, preventing more than 58,000,000 gallons of water from being wasted. “Banyan Water has helped JVM save millions of gallons of water while maintaining healthy landscapes and making a positive impact on our budgets,” said Greg O’Berry, chief operating officer of JVM Realty in a statement. Cummins has increased its facility water goal to a 50 percent intensity reduction by 2020 from a baseline of 2010. The engine manufacturer says it beat its original water conservation goal — to reduce water use intensity by 33 percent by 2020 — in the third quarter of 2016, achieving a 42 percent intensity reduction or 18 percent on an absolute basis. The revised 50 percent intensity reduction goal represents a total water savings of 763 million gallons of water since 2010. At its facilities around the globe, the company has installed low-flow fixtures and efficient equipment, bioswales and regenerative dynos, low water use landscaping and stopped water leaks, among other efficiency efforts. In its water management program, Cummins uses assessment tools such as the Ceres Aqua Gauge, a global water risk screen and the “true cost” of water assessment that identifies water costs embedded in activities such as pumping, electricity and chemical use. To achieve the 50 percent reduction, Cummins will expand the work it does with its sites in water program management, including intensive engagement with higher water use locations, water balance creation and sub-metering. The company also has plans for high impact and showcase projects, such as an alternative bio-tech system for producing high quality treated wastewater for process reuse at one of its engine plants. Cummins uses regenerative dynamometers (dynos) throughout the company to capture the mechanical energy of engines in test cells. The dynos also reduce cooling load, which allows cooling systems to be smaller and use less water. Many Cummins buildings have specific features designed to conserve water. The bioswales at the new Distribution Business Unit headquarters in Indianapolis, for example, are part of a system designed to keep about 80 percent of rainwater on the site to use for landscaping. The bioswales collect and save water that would otherwise run into the city’s sewer system. There are plants in India and Brazil that recycle water for non-potable uses and several locations have features like low or no-water toilet facilities to help meet their water-use goals. By 2020, Cummins plans achieve water neutrality (offset the water it uses) at 15 facilities in water-stressed communities. This goal is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 for Clean Water and Sanitation. Ford implemented two new water-saving technologies at its Chicago Assembly Plant toward the end of 2016 that helped the facility reduce water usage by 13 million gallons last year. The automaker expects to that number to be significantly higher in 2017 after a full year of use. Read the full story here. And finally Stone Brewery is the latest — and possibly largest — craft brewery to make beer from recycled wastewater, aka sewage. became one of the largest names to lend its support to the use of recycled wastewater. While the California brewery only produced five barrels of Full Circle Pale Ale for a Pure Water event in San Diego, the company hopes to start selling the “toilet” beer in the future.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that President Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, should testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee as part of its probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. "Our investigation will not be complete if he does not testify. He should be subpoenaed," Swalwell, a member of the committee, said during an interview on MSNBC. Swalwell referred to a Wednesday report that revealed Manafort worked for a Russian billionaire a decade ago, during which he sought to advance work that he said could "greatly benefit" Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. ADVERTISEMENT “The dots continue to connect around Paul Manafort and his ties to Russia. And we are seeing that it's not just the deep personal political, financial ties that Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTillerson to embassies: ID groups for tougher screening US probes Manafort’s banking: report America must improve defense against Russia's information warfare MORE and his team has with Russia,” Swalwell continued. Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerOvernight Cybersecurity: House Intel chair says surveillance collected on Trump transition team Dem senator: House Intel chairman may have revealed classified info Dem senator wants Manafort to testify before Intelligence Committee MORE (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Tuesday that Manafort should also go before his panel regarding its probe of Russian interference in the election and ties to the Trump campaign. "We're already starting to interview individuals," Warner told CNN. Swalwell said on MNSBC that he wants to know whether Manafort’s connections to the Russian government also tied into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. “We want to now know, did these ties extend to helping Russia during the interference campaign?" he asked. "Are we seeing dramatic changes in foreign policy toward Russia because we owe Russia something because they helped these individuals?” Swalwell said Trump should not change U.S. foreign policy toward Russia until the investigation concludes. “Also, I'm calling on the president to suspend any foreign policy related to Russia … I believe we should not embrace Moscow anymore. We should not reduce sanctions. We should not do anything to threaten NATO’s check on Moscow," he said. "Until the president is cleared under this investigation, until the questions about Moscow's influence on the president and his team, I think we should put on hold any changes with policy toward Russia,” Swalwell added.

The AP reported that Manafort proposed the strategy as early as June 2005, ultimately signing a $10 million annual contract with Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska in 2006. ADVERTISEMENT Sen.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, have called for Manafort to come before their respective committees. Heinrich said he was "alarmed" by the AP's report. "The Trump Administration’s attempt to now distance itself from its former campaign chairman is indicative of how serious and disturbing these revelations are and raises serious questions about Russia’s relationship with the Trump campaign," he said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Manafort, a former chairman of the campaign, had a "limited role for a very limited amount of time." In a statement on Monday, Manafort denied any ties to or contact with the Russian government after the FBI confirmed it is investigating Trump allies' alleged links to Moscow.   Tags Martin Heinrich Mark Warner   View the discussion thread.

Toggle navigation Login Register RS Gathering Diaries × Toggle navigation House Intel Committee Chair: Trump Campaign Was the Subject of “Incidental” FISA Surveillance (VIDEO) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter House Intel Committee Chair: Trump Campaign Was the Subject of “Incidental” FISA Surveillance (VIDEO) Posted at 2:00 pm on March 22, 2017 by streiff Share on Facebook Share on Twitter House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes just gave a press conference. House Intel Chair: Intel community incidentally collected info about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition pic.twitter.com/KWRA76MWam — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 22, 2017 This is the gist via Politico: Members of the Donald Trump transition team, possibly including Trump himself, were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November’s election, House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes told reporters Wednesday. Nunes said the surveillance appears to have been legal, incidental collection and that it does not appear to have been related to concerns over collusion with Russia. Nunes is going to the White House later Wednesday to brief the Trump administration on what he has learned, which he said came from “sources.” Fox has more of the presser: Members of the intelligence community collected ‘incidental’ communications of the Trump transition team during legal surveillance operations, producing ‘dozens’ of reports which eventually unmasked several individuals’ identities and which were ‘widely disseminated,’ a top lawmaker said Wednesday afternoon. And the unmasking of a US person in a non-criminal intercept is a felony. I don’t think anyone, anywhere has tried to dispute that. In fact, both Comey and Rogers acknowledged that the unmasking of Flynn was criminal. Whoa. At presser, Nunes just revealed IC collected info about Americans associated w/ the Trump transition team—separate from Russia probe. — Eric Geller (@ericgeller) March 22, 2017 Trending Susan Rice Beats Irony to Death and Drags Mangled Corpse Behind Her Moped streiff And I think that last tweet sums it up. The operative phrasing here is “Members of the Donald Trump transition team, possibly including Trump himself.” If it had been singular, then we’d know they were talking about Mike Flynn. But this clearly is a plural and what is troubling is that the targets were obviously foreign diplomats talking to the Trump team. This is exactly what several FISA authorities have hypothesized. If we give any credence to the article by Louise Mensch (and I say “if” because everyone said she was a whackadoodle until this week when she became hostile to Trump and suddenly the same people are quoting her as a former member of Parliament”) that a FISA warrant was requested to cover Trump and some members of his campaign but it was declined, you have the obvious and illegal backdoor of surveillance of eligible FISA targets, i.e. any diplomat, when the real objective is who they are talking to. Specifically, this looks like it is directly related this March 1 New York Times article that related the efforts of Ben Rhodes and his merry band of morons to spread classified information far and wide under the pretense of preserving it. This doesn’t make Trump’s claim of being wiretapped on Obama’s orders more accurate — and as several people have noted, the denials have all been carefully worded to focus on “Obama ordered” — but it makes it very clear that for the first time in our history an incoming administration was placed under surveillance by its predecessor.

I’m going to say no to the new MacBook... Show More Microsoft really wants all of us on Windows 10. And it's done asking nicely. For many users of Windows 7 and 8.1, upgrade cajolery just morphed into something that looks a lot like upgrade coercion. (It had already tried upgrade trickery.) I’m sick and tired of this. Windows 10 is OK, but I still prefer Windows 7, thank you very much. I’m not the only one. The Federal Digital Analytics Program (DAP), which gives the broadest and most accurate reading on operating system popularity, showed in mid-March that Windows 7, with 24.6% percent of all users, is still far more popular than Windows 10, with which sits at 17.3%. Windows 8.x comes in third, with 3.7%. In short, there are still a heck of a lot more Windows 7 and 8.x users than there are Windows 10 users. But Microsoft has made it clear it wants everyone on a single operating system — namely Windows 10. Sure, Windows 7 will keep getting updates until Jan. 14, 2020 and Windows 8.1 will be supported until Jan. 10, 2023. That’s the good news. The bad news is that if you’re running either operating system on a PC with a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor or an AMD Ryzen Bristol Ridge CPU, your end-of-support date just became … today. Is that great news or what? [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] We were warned this was coming. Microsoft told us last year that it wouldn’t keep supporting its older operating systems on AMD’s and Intel’s newest processors. Microsoft also won’t be supporting these operating systems on Qualcomm’s 8996 or newer processes. Adding insult to injury, Microsoft got AMD and Intel to go along with this idea. An Intel spokesperson even said, “No, Intel will not be updating Win 7/8 drivers for 7th Gen Intel Core per Microsoft’s support policy change.” Thanks, AMD and Intel. We really appreciate you having our backs. Will Windows 7 and 8 even run on these hot new processors? I don’t know about AMD’s best and brightest, but I’ve had Windows 7 running on Kaby Lake. It runs just fine. There’s only one little problem. When Microsoft finally got around to releasing its latest patches, instead of getting them I got a message saying: “Unsupported Hardware — Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” Golly, Microsoft was serious. No soup — ah, old Windows for you! By the way, this latest patch package? It’s Windows’ largest ever and includes nine — count ’em, nine — critical patches. Thank you so very, very much, Microsoft. Is it reasonable of me to expect continued support? Well, when I look at Microsoft’s Windows Lifecycle support FAQ, I read, “All desktop operating system products, whether used for personal or business, receive a minimum of 10 years of support (minimum of five years Mainstream Support and minimum of five years Extended Support) at the supported service pack level.” But the relevant Microsoft Knowledge Base article states, “Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update.” Does anyone else see a little cognitive dissonance here? I see grounds for a lawsuit. If I were running a company that had paid Windows 7 and 8.1 licensing fees to keep getting support for a few more years, I’d be ticked. I’m not sure what the breakdown is for consumer versus business Windows users. But, given how conservative companies are, I’m sure most Windows corporate users are still running the tried and true Windows 7. Now that Microsoft is rubbing the enterprise’s nose into its refusal to support the most popular operating system on the fastest, newest hardware, I see this backfiring on Microsoft. Microsoft really, really wants to make Windows 7 and 8.x obsolete. Its customers, however, aren’t ready to let go of them anytime soon. If Microsoft doesn’t budge on this, I see corporate users giving Chromebooks and the Linux desktop more consideration. After all, neither of them will cut hardware support just to make you “upgrade” when you don’t want to.

Here’s what March Madness games look like in virtual reality. Photo via Turner Sports. Intel is upping its virtual reality game. The tech giant today announced a multi-year deal with Turner Sports and the NCAA to stream March Madness college basketball games in virtual reality, starting with this month’s NCAA men’s national tournament. Intel is building off its acquisition of virtual reality startup Voke last year. Before that deal, Voke partnered with Turner and the NCAA to broadcast the 2016 Final Four and National Championship in virtual reality for the first time. Now Intel, with help from Turner Sports, is doubling down. Starting with this weekend’s Sweet 16 and Elite 8 matchups, the company will stream six games — including the Final Four and National Championship — in virtual reality at two tiers of pricing that offer different functionality for the user. Via Turner/Intel. The “Silver” virtual ticket option costs $1.99 per game and gives fans access to a 180-degree courtside view with the same CBS commentary that viewers watching the traditional TV broadcast will hear. The “Gold” option runs at $2.99 per game (or $7.99 for all six games) and gives the fan more flexibility with the option to switch between seven cameras angles, from courtside to the student section to behind the basket. Or, they can sit back and watch professionally-produced VR coverage with dedicated game commentary — meaning reporters and analysts will call the action from the VR perspective. “We’re putting the power into the fans’ hands,” David Aufhauser, managing director of strategy and product for Intel Sports Group, told GeekWire. “They can determine how they want to experience VR.” Hania Poole. Photo via Turner Sports. This is the first time “virtual tickets” have been sold to March Madness games. Both ticket options will provide access to virtual brackets, scoreboards, stats, shot charts, and more. You can access the NCAA March Madness Live VR app through the Oculus store; you’ll need a Gear VR headset and a Samsung device to watch the games in virtual reality. Turner will also put out content via Facebook 360 Video on the NCAA March Madness Facebook page. Hania Poole, vice president and general manager of NCAA Digital (which Turner Sports operates), told GeekWire that the decision to expand virtual reality coverage and offer “virtual seats” is a natural evolution after the initial VR test last year. With more ways to control the viewing options and various camera angles, Poole compared the experience to NFL Redzone, the popular service that shows football fans every NFL scoring play on Sundays and offers an alternative to the traditional experience of watching entire games. While Turner Sports knows that Intel’s technology is robust and works well, it is still learning what type of new content fans will really embrace. “We are learning if fans like switching cameras and if they like controlling the experience themselves versus a fully-produced feed,” she noted. “This is aimed at testing that.” Intel is using camera pods that have 12 embedded cameras; there will be a total of 84 individual cameras covering the Final Four and National Championship games. Photo via Intel. Intel also today announced the formation of Intel True VR, its new VR brand that is the “official virtual reality provider of the NCAA.” Intel’s VR deal with Turner Sports will extend beyond basketball, too. The company is clearly bullish about virtual reality, particularly in sports. “Our vision is about creating an entirely new medium such that you can do things in VR that you cannot do when watching TV or in the arena,” Aufhauser said. Aufhauser, who worked for Voke before the Intel acquisition, said that he and his colleagues are in “acceleration mode” as far as developing more VR technology and inking partnerships with companies like Turner Sports and leagues like the NCAA. “This is definitely going to be the next wave of how fans interact with content,” he said. “…The adoption around VR is moving extremely fast.” As far as the “virtual ticket” idea, Aufhauser noted that Intel provides the technology to enable the new experiences while its distribution partners come up with their own way to monetize the content. For example, some partners use a sponsorship or advertising model and provide the VR streams for free to the user. “Because of the flexibility of our platform, we’re able to essentially enable our partners’ business model to succeed,” Aufhauser said. In addition to virtual reality, Intel will also utilize its 360-degree replay technology during the Final Four, using 28 5K ultra-high definition cameras inside the University of Phoenix Stadium next month. That’s a result of Intel’s separate acquisition last year of Israel-based Replay Technologies; we’ve seen the replays used by leagues like the NBA, MLB, and NFL. This is all part of Intel’s push into the sports world. The company dabbled in sports several years ago, and made a statement at its CES keynote in 2016, spending nearly half of the presentation on its partnerships with ESPN’s X Games, New Balance, and others. Then Intel established its Intel Sports Group this past fall, right around the Voke acquisition, and has continued building products and services with wearable computing, virtual reality, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports world. “Our job is to help fans or athletes,” James Carwana, general manager of the Intel Sports Group, told GeekWire in January. “By doing so, our belief is that we can create new value for folks like leagues or rights holders. Or, from an athlete perspective, how can we help athletes and teams perform at their peak level?” At its CES 2017 press conference in January, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich had attendees wear virtual reality headsets and guided them through a real-time demo of a live college basketball game, utilizing Voke’s technology to let people feel like they were actually inside the arena. Intel is not the only big tech company looking at the sports world for business opportunities. Microsoft is partnering with the NFL, with players and coaches using its Surface tablet on the sidelines; Amazon and Twitter are exploring live streaming opportunities; SAP sells services that help engage fans. There are also other tech companies looking to provide virtual reality services to sports leagues.

Amazon’s MARS attendees go gaga over Intel’s ‘droneworks’ by Alan Boyle on March 21, 2017 at 1:14 pmMarch 21, 2017 at 1:22 pm Comments   Share  51 Tweet Share  1 Reddit Email Early-bird tix on sale for the GeekWire Awards! Intel’s swarm of light-equipped drones arrange themselves to create an American flag in the sky above Amazon’s MARS conference. (Caleb Harper via Twitter) The synchronized drone display that accompanied Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl halftime show may have been recorded in advance, but a similar “droneworks” show wowed a crowd in real time at Amazon’s MARS 2017 conference in Palm Springs, Calif. “If you thought the Super Bowl drone light show was cool, this tops it,” Sasha Hoffman wrote in a tweet. Like the Super Bowl’s display, Monday night’s show was presented by Intel. The company’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, reportedly played a personal part in “bringing out the drones.” @intel CEO "bring out the drones" @amazon #MARS2017 💥 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/uEKGlZDKq2 — Caleb Harper (@calebgrowsfood) March 21, 2017 Intel’s light show makes use of hundreds of Shooting Star quadcopters equipped with LED displays. The drones can be pre-programmed to fly in complex trajectories and create multicolored patterns of light. Those patterns can form moving swirls, reminiscent of fireworks or laser shows, or pictures of American flags and corporate logos (like, um, Intel’s). During the MARS 2017 display, the drones formed the letters M-A-R-S to pay tribute to the conference’s four themes: Machine learning, home Automation, Robotics and Space exploration. Intel CEO unleashed 300 drones at night with lights. #MARS2017 pic.twitter.com/5bfZESveiF — Steve Rabuchin (@rabuchin) March 21, 2017 The invitation-only conference continued today with more presentations, including a talk on machine learning by Ali Farhadi, the CEO of Seattle startup Xnor.ai. GeekWire’s invitation must have gotten lost in the mail, but to follow the action, check the #MARS2017 hashtag on Twitter.

Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant's purchase last week of Mobileye, which specialises in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. "A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns," said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. "Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location." The price was about 21 times Mobileye's expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix , an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York's Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded. Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defence tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signalled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. "It's an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies," said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung's Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as the "startup nation", Israel is maturing into a "scale-up nation", said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said. Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar's Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent. Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies "going the distance" by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. AUTOMOTIVE CENTRE Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. "All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources," said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. "If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product." With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing centre for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised $681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been "making the pilgrimage" to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential acquirers "will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn't surprise me either," Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel's most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company's growth. "There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A," he said. Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centres in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D centres in Israel, including Intel. "Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level," he said. "It's a win-win for both companies."

The new memory tool is supposed to work both as a speedy SSD and as a RAM unit, while offering faster performance and longer life. Intel’s exceptional invention sounds amazing, but don’t get too excited. The new 3D XPoint memory device — the Intel Optane SSD P4800X — might not be available in any commercial products this year, at least not the kind that regular users would buy. Instead, the device will be used in servers that require plenty of computing power speed, though we can only hope Intel finds a way to bring it over to regular computers and even smartphones in the near future. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 leaks: The 10 biggest leaks you missed over the weekend Intel’s first 3D XPoint SSD will be available in a 375GB versions that costs $1,520. That’s cheaper than RAM memory, The Wall Street Journal explains, but significantly more expensive than traditional SSDs. According to Ars Technica, in the second quarter, Intel will release 750GB PCIe and 375GB U.2 models, while storage should go up to 1.5TB (PCIe) and 750GB (U.2) in the second half of the year. What’s exciting about the new memory technology is that nobody knows exactly how it works. “While DRAM and NAND use transistors etched in silicon to store electrical charges representing digital 1s and 0s, the new technology uses no transistors and stores no charge, Intel has said,” The Journal writes. “Instead, it uses electricity to make a physical change—like shifting between crystalline and amorphous states—in a proprietary material that Intel and Micron haven’t named publicly.” When it comes to performance, the 3D XPoint tech should be 1,000 times faster than traditional NAND flash memory found in a regular SSD, but current interfaces will only allow it to operate at speeds of five-to-eight times faster than NAND SSDs. 3D XPoint reaches just 80% of RAM speed, but that might not matter to companies looking to significantly expand RAM in their servers without breaking the bank — 3D Xpoint is cheaper than conventional RAM and requires far less energy to operate. One other significant advantage 3D XPoint has over NAND flash is that write processes won’t destroy the drive over time, which would obviously give them much more longevity than traditional SSDs. According to The Journal, Dell is currently testing the technology for an unspecified purpose. Alibaba Group will use Optane 3D XPoint drives for fast internet searches, and Harvard University will use it for cloud computing.

 A Wall Street analyst has some out-there ideas about the future of transportation Matthew DeBord Mar. 22, 2017, 12:43 PM 1,205 facebook linkedin twitter email print Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's in-house transportation futurist. CNBC via Yahoo Finance Morgan Stanley's lead auto analyst, Adam Jonas, is now also being described the bank as a "shared mobility" researcher — a clear signal that among Wall Streeters, he's continuing his campaign to be the most out-there student of the disruption currently going on in the transportation business. Jonas and his team cover General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Tesla, and rental car companies, among others. If Uber ever undertakes an IPO (perhaps with Morgan Stanley playing a role in, if not leading, the underwriting), then Jonas and his team will likely initiate coverage. In the past few weeks, Jonas has unleashed a flurry of research, on Ford and FCA. He's also shared some comments on Intel's stunning $15-billion acquisition of Mobileye. It's important to see these It's important not to see these notes in isolation, but rather as a part of an overall thesis that Jonas has been developing about the future of mobility. And while Jonas has focused a lot on how Tesla will change mobility, he more recently has honed in on the original equipment manufacturers or OEMs, which is the auto-industry term for the big car companies. For the record, Jonas is bullish on Tesla (although not as bullish as he was about a year and a half year ago), cautious on Ford, and relatively bullish on FCA. All about the data I do not know what the Enterprise cannot drive itself, Captain. Paramount Pictures On Intel's acquisition of Mobileye, Jonas argued that the deal "highlights the strategic value of the global auto sector at a time of unprecedented disruption." He added that "Tech firms are hunting for ever more data. Miles = data. The world’s cars travel 10 trillion miles per year. First Harman… now MBLY? Who’s next?" Data derived from the operation of networked automobiles — driven by humans or driving themselves — has become an immense area of exploration for both traditional automakers and upstarts. Ford CEO Mark Fields, for example, has begun to describe the 100-plus-year-old firm as an information company. The nexus has been sudden to develop and is currently not well understood, but no one wants to get left out. That's why Intel's move to buy Mobileye, an Israeli company that specializes in self-driving tech, and the Samsung-Harman deal that Jonas alluded to are noteworthy. Tech companies with zero transportation expertise are diving into the space so they can profit from large amounts of data. Jonas' view here represents an expansion of a theme he's developed around Tesla and its efforts to participate in the massive, Uber-powered evolution of ride-hailing and "de-owned" shared mobility. Repeatedly, he and his team have stressed that miles driven could be a superior metric when it comes to transportation investment, overruling legacy measures such as vehicle sales: sell the car once, harvest the data for the life of the vehicle. Ford's good-bad bet? Ford CEO Mark Fields. Ford In terms of the old-fashioned car business, Jonas is more worried about Ford than about FCA. His assessment is contradictory to the consensus of the industry itself, where FCA is considered most vulnerable to a downturn, encouraging CEO Sergio Marchionne to seek a merger partner (more on that later). Jonas is concerned about Ford's finance operations, specifically as they relate to the changing dynamics of what consumers have been buying. This is from his note on the topic: To Ford’s credit, the company made extraordinary cost reduction and global platform engineering efforts ("One Ford") beginning in 2006 that we believe enabled the firm to generate significant positive margins, possibly generating profit per unit in excess of $1,000 per passenger car in the US in the 2011 to 2014 time frame ... Cost reduction and engineering excellence made this possible, aided by a favorable balance of supply and demand for small and midsized cars during a time of $100 oil and $4 gasoline. As these conditions changed, we believe so did the desirability and profitability of these segments. Due to the sale of vehicles via financial instrument, we believe the full extent of this change may take several quarters to play out. For many observers, Ford's performance over the past two years has been impressive, as it has sold a huge number of pickups and SUVs in the booming US market. However, Jonas may be onto something by reminding investors that Ford might have created a problem for itself back before and during the financial crisis, when its financing operations continued while competitors such as GM went bankrupt.  The bottom line is that the Ford bet on smaller cars was smart, but only for a short period of time. Fortunately for the automaker, when the market swung back to SUVs and gas got cheap again, the carmaker had trucks to sell. But smaller, more fuel-efficient cars might not play the same role in the automaker's future.  FCA-VW merger GM CEO Mary Barra, with President Donald Trump and FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne. Getty Images When it comes to the ongoing circus of speculation around a possible FCA-Volkswagen merger, Jonas thinks the deal would greatly assist FCA in getting into the high-tech game: VW has expanded its technological capability as quickly as possible, and has now officially embraced an [electric vehicle] strategy for 2025 ... FCA seems to have made fewer such investments, and has been the only OEM to date to sign a data-sharing agreement with Google — when other OEMs remain wary of giving away that future control over automotive content. Although the potential slow-down in the application of stringent US CAFE standards could give FCA breathing room, we think it would not put FCA in a better position globally. Jonas has basically crossed the Rubicon when it comes to the future of transportation: he and his team see disruptive investments as not just potentially lucrative, but as an opportunity to join a radical change in the way we get around. Other analysts on Wall Street have begun to explore Jonas' themes, largely through Tesla and with an eye toward an Uber IPO and what GM is up to with its $500-million investment in Lyft. But Jonas continues to put himself pretty far out there — without over-committing. For example, he isn't optimistic that Tesla can move beyond being a niche carmaker (he probably now sees greater potential for Tesla as a mobility provider and data aggregator/manager).  It's a fascinating process to observe, and proof that although it's easy to be skeptical of sell-side analysts' motives, their arguments can be well worth following and following closely, as they construct themes about the future using companies as building blocks.

The natural companion for a high-end gaming build is Intel's latest-generation Core i7-7700K and we expect to see every top-tier system integrator putting forth this dynamic duo in a range of premium rigs. Never one to hold back, Scan Computers is quick off the mark with the 3XS Vengeance Ti. Priced at £2,100 and described as "ideal for high resolution and VR gaming," the Vengeance Ti is an early showcase of what the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition can do in an overclocked machine geared for enthusiasts. It's a good-looking piece of kit, with Scan opting to use Corsair's glass-laden Crystal Series 460X RGB chassis as the foundation, and all the core components you'd expect to find on the inside are present and accounted for. The Intel CPU gets ramped-up to a guaranteed 4.8GHz and is cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100i liquid cooler. 16GB of memory is provided by dual 8GB sticks Corsair Vengeance DDR4-3000 on top of an underlying Asus RoG Strix Z270H Gaming motherboard, and storage is twofold; a 512GB Intel 600p Series SSD for the system drive; a 2TB Seagate Barracuda for anything else. Scan's implementation, as you'd expect, is very neat and tidy throughout, with the engineers doing a particularly good job of managing the 460X RGB's excess cabling. Yet, while it's an impressive-looking machine, there are a few potential question marks at this price point. The chassis makes no attempt at sound-dampening, the default power supply is a 550W Corsair unit rated as only 80 Plus Bronze, and there's a surprising lack of internal RGB lights. Discotheque builds aren't for everyone, but given that this is an RGB chassis designed to show off lighting, we had expected a little more illumination. What's interesting from an industry point of view is the complete absence of anything AMD. The other chip manufacturer's Zen architecture has arrived to reasonable acclaim, yet we've seen no urgency from system integrators to send in a Ryzen-based machine. Most are waiting to see if gaming performance improves and it is telling that Scan doesn't offer a single AMD chip (CPU nor GPU) as an option on the 3XS Vengeance Ti's configuration page. Amid the available customisations, we'd be inclined to swap the chassis for something quieter and if you're going to be using a wired Internet connection, feel free to drop the Asus PCE-N15 wireless adapter whose bare, green PCB isn't in keeping with the rest of the build. There's an option to upgrade to a 650W fully-modular Corsair RMx power supply at a cost of £30, and for a further £30 the GPU can be overclocked as standard. We're not convinced the latter is worth considering on the hot-running Founders Edition, but we imagine a choice of custom-cooled partner cards will soon be added to the roster. Building a similar PC using off-the-shelf components is likely to cost somewhere in the region of £1,900, so Scan is adding a 10 per cent premium in exchange for a tidy turnkey solution that is backed by a three-year warranty from a reputable UK-based company.

The event was sponsored by SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics. SAN JOSE, California, and BELLINGHAM, Washington, USA (PRWEB) March 22, 2017 New extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment unveiled by ASML, announcement by Intel of eight EUV programs ready to be rolled out, and introduction by IMEC of the industry’s first comprehensive solution for EUVL-enabled high-volume manufacturing systems were among highlights at SPIE Advanced Lithography 2017 in San Jose earlier this month. Sponsored by SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, the annual event is the year’s primary forum for the industry. Attendance was up this year over last, with nearly 2,300 participating, and ran 26 February through 2 March. Speakers from ASML, Intel, KLA-Tencor, JSR Corp, IMEC, Samsung, and other organizations emphasized progress being made toward manufacturing computer chips using sub-10nm node lithography, sparking much discussion about when, where, and how — plus the occasional if — the next generation of lithography tools will enable high-volume and high-throughput manufacturing at an EUV wavelength of about 13.5 nm. Presentation recordings are viewable on the SPIE Newsroom on SPIE.org. Product System Engineer Mark van de Kerkhof reported on ASML’s NXE:3400B EUV scanner, which enables sub-10-nm-node lithography — ASML’s first scanner that can produce 125 wafers/hour, the throughput rate needed in production fabs. With ever-smaller feature sizes being designed, mask makers must continuously advance their technologies as EUV sources and other lithography tools advance, noted plenary speaker Frank Abboud, Vice President of Technology and Manufacturing Group at Intel, and General Manager, Intel Mask Operation. “Almost every module in the mask shop is touched," he said, including blank preparation, fiducial mark patterning, device patterning, black-border patterning, and metrology/characterization.” Plenary speaker Ben Tsai, Chief Technology Officer and Executive Vice President of Corporate Alliances at KLA-Tencor, spoke on the return on investment of defect detection. Inspection and metrology can involve 1,000 process steps for an advanced graphics processing unit, each requiring extremely high accuracy, he noted. In such a process model, if each step was 99.5% perfect, fewer than 1% of manufactured devices would work, illustrating the importance of investment in inspection and metrology to identify and resolve essentially all defects. Starting with a vision of drivers for next-generation computing such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the computational power required, Nobu Koshiba, President and CEO of JSR Corporation, pointed out the extent to which the information explosion trending for years is continuing, with estimated data traffic in 2020 being 7× greater than in 2015. The growth is stimulating AI advances, as are autonomous driving, precision medicine, genomic science, and cognitive computing, he said. In a keynote talk, Philippe Leray, IMEC Group Leader of Advanced Metrology, described development of the first comprehensive solution for EUVL enablement in high-volume manufacturing. The approach serves as a basis for industry requirements for power, performance, area and cost, and includes proposals for design rules, masks, photoresists, etching, and metrology and an extensive process variation assessment, Leray said. Donis Flagello, President, CEO, and COO of Nikon Research Corporation of America (NRCA), was presented with the 2017 Frits Zernike Award for Microlithography. Semiconductor pioneer Burn Lin (National Tsin Hua University) was honored on the 30th anniversary of the Optical Microlithography conference in recognition of his serving as the first chair of the conference in 1988, and of his outstanding contributions to the lithography community. Lin was the founding editor of the SPIE Journal of Microlithography, Microfabrication, and Microsystems (JM3). Six new Fellows of SPIE were recognized: Emily Gallagher (IMEC), Yuri Granik (Mentor Graphics), Qinghuang Lin (IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center), David Pan (University of Texas, Austin), Mark Phillips (Intel Corp.), and James Thackarey (Dow Electronic Materials). Bruce Smith, Rochester Institute of Technology, served as symposium chair, and Will Conley of Cymer, an ASML company, was symposium co-chair. SPIE Advanced Lithography included seven conferences on state-of-the-art lithographic topics, along with technical courses taught by experts from industry and academia, and a two-day exhibition. About SPIE SPIE is the international society for optics and photonics, an educational not-for-profit organization founded in 1955 to advance light-based science, engineering, and technology. The Society serves nearly 264,000 constituents from approximately 166 countries, offering conferences and their published proceedings, continuing education, books, journals, and the SPIE Digital Library. In 2016, SPIE provided more than $4 million in support of education and outreach programs. http://www.spie.org For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/03/prweb14173970.htm Latest News Mother’s Day Contest for the Nigerian Diaspora Hosted on the Facebook Community Page of TelephoneNigeria.com Fairview Microwave Releases 8-Bit Programmable Phase Shifters with 360 Degrees of Accurate Variable Phase Shift EUV Lithography Progress Emphasized at SPIE Advanced Lithography Skout’s Honor Now Available at Pet Supplies Plus Code Names Jeff Spridgeon as Director of North American Sales DragonPlate Expands Carbon Fiber Telescoping Tube Line Tindall Wins 2016 Virginia Chapter ACI Award for Stone Brewery RackN Delivers Fortune 500 Demands for Fully Upgradeable Kubernetes in the Open Source Community QOS Consulting’s Frank Cittadino to Speak on Network Virtualization at Channel Partners SunBlock Systems Announces Merger with Marquet International © 2015 SSUChronicle.

All Rights Reserved. Intel Has A Bold Plan For New Type of Computer Memory (And Keep It Under Wraps) Intel has come out with a new type of computer memory that can revolutionize the digital world. Big names in the business are slated to benefit more. by Luke Joye • Wed, 22 Mar 2017 09:50 am EDT Wed, 22 Mar 2017 09:50 am EDT in Tech Can this change the world of computer memory A new type of computer memory has just been unleashed by Intel and it is believed to be capable of fundamentally changing the way future computers are built. But Intel is keeping details of the product under wraps. 3D XPoint – the new type of computer memory Intel simply calls the new type of computer memory as 3D XPoint but with the X pronounced as cross and after touting the product for about 18 months, finally Intel pushed it to the markets this week. For now, you can imagine the new technology as a building block for computers which will serve multiple purposes with a singular thing replacing several others. But this technology could also be one way for Intel to move multiple markets to its advantage. That also probably explains why Intel is so secretive about what the new product is made up of.  Understandably, Intel cannot afford someone duplicating the technology that it has developed in association with Micron, the hardware maker. ADVERTISEMENT A game worth watching – the new type of computer memory When we consider the big names in the digital world like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, they all have one thing in common. They are their own hardware markets and build machines on a very large scale. While the new technology may apparently be juicy for the big brothers, it does come with a catch.  One hardware supplier controlling several big names is not business prudence.  Everyone wants options and that is one way to enhance efficiency through competitive pricing.  This is precisely what pushes the dynamics in the global market for data center related hardware. And, Intel is now pushing to take things in exactly the opposite direction. Biggest impact from the new type of computer memory The biggest impact from the new type of computer memory developed by Intel may not be felt at the PC level though the scope exists in abundance.  While it can impact gaming machines and PC the biggest change would come inside huge data centers run by the biggest names in the digital world. As these large empires grow at a steady pace, the need for cheaper and faster means of storing ever-growing volumes of data would be important.  For several years now, these businesses have already gone beyond conventional hard drives to flash solid state drivers that are significantly faster. However, in some instances, even these fall short of optimal efficiency and therefore a new variant of database has been created to push large volumes of data into memory.  3DXPoint is being positioned as a huge help to address both the situations. Intel says that is some 1,000 times faster compared to flash and capable of storing about 10 times the data compared to DRAM. ADVERTISEMENT   Plenty of ground to be covered yet for the new type of computer memory For now, the speeds discussed above remain theoretical.  In practice, Intel’s new product delivers just about 5 times the speed of flash SSDs as against the promised 1,000 times.  The reason, however, is the standard interface connecting the drive with the rest of the system. Eventually, Intel will bring out products that can be plugged straight into the machine’s heart.  But, this is expected to happen only sometime towards the third or fourth quarter of the current year. At that point in time, the likes of Facebook and Google can really benefit because they are the ones who will be handling mindboggling amounts of data day in and day out. Transition to 3DXPoint won’t be a cakewalk Even after Intel starts delivering a product or products that can be plugged in straight, at the user end, there will be plenty of work to be done before they can really get the full advantages from the product. For one, the hardware will need significant reorganization and even the OS codes as well as related software will need rejigging for accommodating changes.

In addition, the water discharged to the municipal wastewater treatment system will be cooler and cleaner. “In recognition of Intel’s sustainability initiatives and its commitment to protect our planet’s precious resources, we are pleased to present Intel with the GE Ecomagination Award,” said Kevin Cassidy, global leader, engineered systems—GE Water & Process Technologies. “This water recycling facility is a great example of how industry can use existing, integrated technology solutions to help further global sustainability and drive business value through water reuse.” Intel’s founders instilled a strong commitment to environmental responsibility, and the company has been pursuing sustainability through environmentally responsible operations and innovative technology solutions for decades. See Intel’s Corporate Responsibility Report, and for detailed environmental performance information at Intel’s sites, visit Explore Intel. GE’s Ecomagination Award recognizes the achievements of its global industrial users and top GE customers that implement innovative solutions driving business value and environmental benefit. GE presented Intel with the Ecomagination Award at today’s celebration ceremony, which was held in conjunction with World Water Day. “Water scarcity is an increasing challenge both globally and locally. Industrial water use is expected to grow 250 percent by 2030, which is nearly one-third of all global water use. Today, we only reuse about 4 percent of wastewater, so using technology and processes designed to minimize water use will be key to adapting to a water constrained world,” said Deb Frodl, global executive director, Ecomagination, GE. Sustainable water management is key to Intel’s continuing commitment to environmental responsibility. The company’s water strategy includes: Reduce: Investing in innovative water conservation practices within their global operations. Since 1998, Intel has conserved more than 52 billion gallons of water. In 2015, it saved 820 million gallons of water in Oregon through water conservation efforts. Return: Returning a significant portion of the water used back to local communities. In 2015, Intel returned 80 percent of the water its used in Oregon. Reinvent: Empowering others to reinvent water use by integrating smart technologies that drive conservation.

Regarding performance and features, Intel's Z270 chipset is the most advanced on the market, even beating Intel's X99 chipset regarding connectivity.   There is a lot of interest in Mini-ITX offerings. Since they are very small, users can build tiny systems packed with power. ASUS has always been very active in the Mini-ITX market, with multiple generations of ROG Mini-ITX motherboards at the top of their Mini-ITX offering. The STRIX Z270I Gaming is a ROG product.     While the traditional ROG Mini-ITX motherboard utilizes the Impact name, ROG STRIX products are targeted more towards gamers and enthusiasts rather than overclockers. That does not mean that the STRIX Z270I Gaming does not overclock, ASUS used high-quality components in the VRM to facilitate overclocking, and the UEFI is loaded with overclocking features.   Without further delay, let's take a gander at the ASUS ROG STRIX Z270I Gaming.     Specifications     The STRIX Z270I Gaming offerings both Intel LAN and ASUS Wireless AC for network connectivity, a 32Gb/s M.2 slot, high-end audio, and a USB 3.1 type-C front panel header.     Pricing   The STRIX Z270I Gaming costs around $180.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 22, 2017 at 8:30AM Chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced that it was going to spend $15.3 billion to buy computer vision specialist Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). The company signaled that it wants to become the top vendor of "end-to-end" self-driving car computer platforms and to do that, it needed to have the computer vision expertise that Mobileye brings to the table. Although only time will tell whether this purchase ultimately pays off, here's another thing -- aside from Intel's apparent loss of focus on its core businesses -- that really bugs me about this potential buy. Rewinding back to Intel's investor meeting At Intel's investor meeting, the company spent a great deal of time trying to convince investors that it has many large total addressable markets that it is currently going after. To put things into perspective, Intel's total revenue in 2016 was about $60 billion, and Intel said that the sum of the total addressable markets that it's going after will be on the order of $220 billion by 2021. If Intel's total addressable market estimates were anywhere close to the mark, then there should be a lot of room for the chipmaker to grow. What's even more interesting is that if we look at the breakdown of Intel's claimed total addressable market, we see that the portion of that total addressable market related to the Internet of Things (which is the segment that self-driving car technology would fall under) is "just" $30 billion -- the smallest of the segments that Intel identified. Image source: Intel. So, if Intel currently can address such large markets, then why did it need to buy Mobileye? An inflated TAM? The issue here is that the total addressable market numbers that Intel has given here are probably as accurate as can be this far out, but Intel appears to be implicitly overstating the portions of the total addressable market that it can address -- in other words, Intel's served addressable market is probably much smaller than its total addressable market. For example, Intel lists the $40 billion mobile silicon market as a growth opportunity, but let's be realistic here. There's no way that the entire $40 billion mobile chip market -- or even a large portion of it -- is open to Intel. Intel currently sells stand-alone modems, primarily to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and the company does some contract chip manufacturing work for mobile chipmaker Spreadtrum. That's some mobile-related revenue, but a drop in the bucket relative to that so-called $40 billion total addressable market. Intel might have some room to grow its revenues from mobile-related chips, but barring a dramatic shift in strategy as well as significantly more success as a contract chip manufacturer for the likes of Apple, I think the served addressable market for Intel is a small fraction of the stated total addressable market. Additionally, Intel cites non-volatile memory as a $55 billion total addressable market (Intel says that this figure combines both NAND flash and 3D XPoint memory), but here, too, Intel seems to be implicitly overstating the opportunity. For example, Intel doesn't have a substantial presence in consumer-oriented solid state drives, it doesn't participate significantly (if at all) in the market for raw NAND flash, and it doesn't sell NAND flash into mobile applications (smartphones/tablets). Intel mainly sells NAND-based and now 3D XPoint based drives into data center and high-end client PC applications. So, Intel's served addressable market is far smaller than the total addressable markets for these technologies, and even within those served addressable markets Intel faces fierce competition (so it's not likely to capture dominant portions of those served addressable markets). The point is this: Intel tried to sell investors on the notion that it's going after combined total addressable market that's multiple times larger than its current revenue base, but the reality is that it just went out and spent a huge amount of money on a small computer vision company on the expectations that the market for self-driving cars would be large in the future. Intel's bet may or may not pay off -- time will bear that out -- but in the here and now, it looks to me that Intel doesn't seriously believe that its current opportunities are as large as it says they are.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Here are 25 AI start-ups to watch out for in 2017 and beyond. There are literally hundreds of promising companies pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence and machine learning in Europe. We’ve included a number of Israel-based start-ups because they too fall into the sphere of influence of European investors. And, judging by recent acquisitions of Israel-based machine vision and AI companies by players like Apple and Intel, they are definitely producing the goods. There are quite a few Dublin and Northern Ireland companies in there too, carrying the torch sparked by forerunners like Movidius, acquired last year by Intel for a rumoured sum of $300m. If there was a time to be alive when the technology revolution is burning at its most fierce, it is now. The revolution has shifted from computers in server halls and at desks to delivering the power of supercomputing to the device in your pocket, on your wrist, in your car or in your building. Making sense of all the data are powerful artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms, turning technology from a request into a conversation. Intelligent chatbots can advise you on how to run your finances or your business, build better products, make better drugs or find a diamond of truth in the coal. Here are the start-ups to watch in all of these areas. Aigency Amsterdam-based Aigency helps start-ups to build algorithms, bots and other AI tools by acting as a kind of middle man. It earns revenues through a pay-per-use model using blockchain-based smart contracts, and takes a 10-20pc commission. Artomatix Dr Eric Risser and Neal O’Gorman, founders of Artomatix.

Slide: 1 / of 1. Caption: Peter Belanger/Intel Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Cade Metz. Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 03.22.17. 03.22.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Intel’s Bold Plan to Reinvent Computer Memory (and Keep It a Secret) Peter Belanger/Intel Intel just unleashed a new kind of computer memory it believes will fundamentally change the way the world builds computers. But it won’t tell the world what’s inside. The company calls this new creation 3D XPoint—pronounced “three-dee cross-point”—and this week, after touting the stuff for a year-and-a-half, Intel finally pushed it into the market. You can think of the new technology as a computer building block that can serve more than one purpose—a single thing that can replace several others. But the new tech also serves as a way for Intel to shift multiple markets in its favor. That’s probably why it won’t say what the memory is actually made of. Certainly, Intel doesn’t want others duplicating the technology, which it developed alongside hardware maker Micron. Related Stories Klint Finley Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived Cade Metz Microsoft and Intel’s Decades-Long Alliance Has Started To Fray Klint Finley Intel’s ‘New’ Factory Isn’t About Trump—It’s About Fixing Intel This chess game is worth watching because it could indeed change the way machines are built, most notably inside big internet companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies now build machines on a massive scale. They’re hardware markets unto themselves. And more than anyone else, they stand to benefit from Intel’s new technology. But a built-in tension exists here as well. Because they operate on such a scale, Google and Facebook don’t want their fate controlled by just one hardware supplier. They want choice, which brings efficiency by driving down prices. This dynamic is shaping the worldwide market for data center hardware. And Intel is pushing in the opposite direction. Traditionally, computers stored data in two ways. They stored most of it on hard drives, which could hold large amounts of information for long periods of time, even as machines were powered on and off—and do it pretty cheaply. But computers also used separate memory systems called DRAM to store the data they needed right now. This memory was much faster, but it was also more expensive and held less data. 3D XPoint can replace all those pieces—or so Intel says. “This is truly transformational,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich tells WIRED. “It allows architects—both at the PC level and the data center level—to rethink how they build the system.” Krzanich sees this technology redefining gaming machines and other personal computers. But that’s almost beside the point. A PC is a PC. Where this could really change things is inside the massive data centers operated by the internet’s biggest companies. As their online empires continue to grow, these companies always need faster and cheaper ways of storing ever-larger amounts of data. Over the past several years, they’ve already moved beyond hard drives to significantly faster flash solid state drives, or SSDs. Since even these drives aren’t fast enough in some cases, they’ve created a new breed of database that pushes massive amounts of data into memory. 3D XPoint could help in both those areas. According to Intel, it’s about 1,000 times faster than flash and can store about 10 times more data than DRAM. What Goes Inside But right now, neither of those numbers really apply. On Sunday, Intel released the first 3D XPoint product, a storage device marketed under the name Optane that can replace hard drives or flash SSDs. But this device is only about five times faster than flash SSDs—not 1,000—because of the standard interface that connects the drive to the rest of the machine. Eventually, Intel will offer products that plug straight into the heart of the machine, removing this bottleneck, but that won’t happen until at least the second half of the year. When that happens, the likes of Google and Facebook really could build new kinds of systems—systems that can hold data in memory even when powered down, that merge memory and storage or mix and match them in new ways—all in an effort to create vast networks of machines that can more efficiently juggle information. This is no small undertaking. If they significantly reorganize their hardware, they must also rewrite their operating systems and other software to accommodate the changes. According Krzanich, Intel is already working with “almost all of the big cloud service providers” to explore these possibilities. These companies, he says, have been testing sample hardware since early last year. ‘It allows architects—both at the PC level and the data center level—to rethink how they build the system.’ Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Still, so many questions remain. It is unclear, for instance, how fast 3D XPoint will be relative to DRAM. For Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective Analysis who follows the memory and storage markets, the technology only makes sense as memory if it’s significantly cheaper than DRAM. It’s also unclear when Intel will allow this technology to plug straight into processors offered by competitors—though Krzanich indicates it will. “We will always have options that can fix with anybody’s architecture,” he says. “With something as ubiquitous as memory, you’ve got to have it work with everybody.” What Krzanich does make clear is that Intel will not sell raw 3D XPoint memory to anyone else. “We won’t sell this in any other form but a finished product,” he says. Today, Intel is one of so many companies that sell flash, and that means its opportunities are slim. It wants to build a market for 3D XPoint where other options are scarce. Will the internet giants embrace that kind of arrangement? It’s an important question. As Google, Amazon, and Microsoft expand their cloud computing businesses, offering services where others can set up their own online empires without buying their own hardware, these internet giants will account for more and more of the worldwide hardware market. Increasingly, these are the main customers for parts suppliers such as Intel. In 2012, Intel vice president Diane Bryant told WIRED that Google bought more server chips from Intel than all but about four other companies. As Krzanich points out, Micron will also sell 3D XPoint hardware. So some competition will exist, eventually. And others are developing alternatives. It’s possible competition will push down prices, and the internet’s biggest companies will bite. But for now, the dance goes on to decide what really winds up inside. Update: This story has been updated to clarify that it is still unclear how fast 3D XPoint relative to DRAM. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Bloomberg quotes economist Modi Shafrir from Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, who said that Israel’s 10-year high 6.5 percent fourth quarter expansion took place thanks to the $6 billion renovation of Intel’s plant in southern Israel. Intel is the biggest private employer in Israel – 10,000, followed by Teva with 7,000. Advertisement Also, according to Bloomberg, Intel exported $3.35 billion in products from Israel in 2016, accounting for about 10% of the country’s hi-tech exports. It should be noted that Intel’s previous record in large acquisitions has been far from stellar, which suggests that the company has developed confidence in its Israeli operations. Early on, in 1999, Intel purchased DSP Communications for $1.6 billion, which it sold in 2006 to Marvell Technology Group for $600 million. It also regretted its $7.7 billion buy of McAfee, then dumped its 51% stake last year. David Rosenberg, writing in Ha’aretz, lamented the sale of Mobileye to Intel, saying the enormous, all-cash investment is puny compared with how much the chipmaker will make on it eventually. “Ten years from now, when you’re tooling around in your car (or actually, being tooled around by your car), it will be Intel inside – not Mobileye,” Rosenberg wailed. “The $15.3 billion price tag Intel put on Mobileye is a lot of money, but Intel wouldn’t be paying it without being confident its investment will earn it a lot more over the years. Intel will be the one that owns the patents and makes and sells the chips − earning profits while employing many thousands and spreading those benefits throughout the U.S. economy.” Advertisement SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleThe Diabolical PA/EU Plan for Area C Next articleLiquor Stash Belonging to WW1 British Soldiers Exposed in Central Israel JNi.Media http://JNi.Media JNi.Media provides editors and publishers with high quality Jewish-focused content for their publications.

(AP Photo/Olivier Fitoussi) ***ISRAEL OUT*** comments JERUSALEM — As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. "In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more," said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. "Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye." She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion's annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister's Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel's only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is "ripe for change." He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. "What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in," he said. Israel has long billed itself as "Startup Nation" for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. "This is far from a one-day or one-week story," Granoff said. "This is going to be a story for the next 10 years." Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google's more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. "The deal confirms Israel's global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies," said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. "The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups." There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel's autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. "This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak," he said.

Single page Print Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X opens new frontiers in datacenter storage 3D Xpoint bridges DRAM and NAND by Jeff Kampman  11:00 AM on March 19, 2017 Intel's high-performance 3D Xpoint (say crosspoint) memory technology promised far-reaching changes for storage, memory, and computer architecture when the company first took the wraps off the technology in mid-2015. Of course, big promises begot high expectations, and despite a hunger for more information, we've heard relatively little about how 3D Xpoint will perform in the intervening time. That all changes today. 3D Xpoint will power Intel's first Optane device, the SSD DC P4800X, and that device demonstrates the wide-ranging potential of Optane to change how we think about the balance between memory and storage in a system. Optane from the ground up The SSD DC P4800X launching today packs 375GB of 3D Xpoint storage on a PCIe add-in card form factor. Intel is keeping the physical details of its Xpoint media under wraps, but we do know some of the basics of the stuff now. The first Xpoint dies are being fabricated on a 20-nanometer process and can hold 128 Gbits each. Intel says that because the Xpoint medium itself relies on low-resistance and low-capacitance interconnects in the back end of the device, it can switch a thousand times faster than NAND. Consequently, Xpoint delivers much lower access times and much higher performance. 3D Xpoint also offers much finer access granularity than NAND. Instead of working on pages with many kilobytes of data as NAND does, Intel says the structure of the Xpoint device allows for bit-level access. Practically, that means Xpoint can work with words of data, so it's a natural fit for delivering cache lines like DRAM does. Even though it's not as fast as DRAM, Xpoint can be manufactured with 10 times the density of that memory, giving it NAND-class capacity. Intel also says that chip-for-chip, Xpoint is a thousand times more durable compared to 3D NAND. Of course, Xpoint is non-volatile like NAND, as well. Xpoint is just one piece of the puzzle for Optane products, however. Intel has developed a custom controller to take advantage of the unique properties of the Xpoint material. For the DC P4800X, the controller talks over PCI Express using the NVMe protocol. Like an SSD controller, Optane products use multiple channels with multiple dies per channel to exploit parallelism for greater performance. However, Optane's controller ASIC handles both data and commands exclusively in hardware to deliver the full performance of Xpoint media (at least the performance possible on the PCI Express 3.0 bus). The Optane controller can also spread a 4KB read operation over all of its dies, which Intel contrasts with the single-die read handling of NAND. Thanks to Xpoint's fine-grained access characteristics, Optane devices can also write in place on the underlying medium, unlike NAND's read-modify-write cycle at the block level. In turn, Xpoint should match its higher performance with high endurance. With a drive as fast as the P4800X, Intel believes that up to 30 drive writes per day is going to be adequate endurance for the types of applications it believes will benefit from Xpoint's performance. With a rated maximum of 12.3 petabytes written, that means the 375GB DC P4800X drive could endure 30 DWPD for three years of constant use by our calculations. It's worth noting that the projected endurance figures in the graphs above come from the 750GB P4800X, not the 375GB drive. Larger drives should enjoy a greater total petabytes written figure if Xpoint endurance scaling is similar to that of NAND. The best-case NAND endurance figure, on the other hand, comes from Intel's DC P3700 800GB and its 14.6 PBW figure, good for 10 DWPD. The 375GB P4800X uses a seven-channel controller with four dies of 3D Xpoint per channel for 28 dies total. Although Xpoint devices don't require overprovisioning like NAND SSDs, the P4800X still reserves some extra space for ECC, firmware, and reallocation of bad regions of its total storage pool.

After years of predictable and, arguably modest, advances, we’re beginning to witness an explosion of exciting and important new developments in the sometimes obscure world of semiconductors—commonly known as chips. Thanks to both a range of demanding new applications, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and more, as well as a perceived threat to Moore’s Law (which has “guided” the semiconductor industry for over 50 years to a state of staggering capability and complexity), we’re starting to see an impressive range of new output from today’s silicon designers. Entirely new chip designs, architectures and capabilities are coming from a wide array of key component players across the tech industry, including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Micron and ARM, as well as internal efforts from companies like Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Google and Microsoft. It’s a digital revival that many thought would never come. In fact, just a few years ago, there were many who were predicting the death, or at least serious weakening, of most major semiconductor players. Growth in many major hardware markets had started to slow, and there was a sense that improvements in semiconductor performance were reaching a point of diminishing returns, particularly in CPUs (central processing units), the most well-known type of chip. The problem is, most people didn’t realize that hardware architectures were evolving and that many other components could take on tasks that were previously limited to CPUs. In addition, the overall system design of devices was being re-evaluated, with a particular focus on how to address bottlenecks between different components. People predicting the downfall of semiconductor makers didn’t realize that hardware architectures were evolving and that many other components could take on tasks that were previously limited to CPUs. Today, the result is an entirely fresh new perspective on how to design products and tackle challenging new applications through multi-part hybrid designs. These new designs leverage a variety of different types of semiconductor computing elements, including CPUs, GPUs (graphics processing units), FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), DSPs (digital signal processors) and other specialized “accelerators” that are optimized to do specific tasks well. Not only are these new combinations proving to be powerful, we’re also starting to see important new improvements within the elements themselves. For example, even in the traditional CPU world, AMD’s new Ryzen line underwent significant architectural design changes, resulting in large speed improvements over the company’s previous chips. In fact, they’re now back in direct performance competition with Intel—a position AMD has not been in for over a decade. AMD started with the enthusiast-focused R7 line of desktop chips, but just announced the sub-$300 R5, which will be available for use in mainstream desktop and all-in-one PCs starting in April. Nvidia has done a very impressive job of showing how much more than graphics its GPUs can do. From work on deep neural networks in data centers, through autonomous driving in cars, the unique ability of GPUs to perform enormous numbers of relatively simple calculations simultaneously is making them essential to a number of important new applications. One of Nvidia's latest developments is the Jetson TX2 board, which leverages one of their GPU cores, but is focused on doing data analysis and AI in embedded devices, such as robots, medical equipment, drones and more. Not to be outdone, Intel, in conjunction with Micron, has developed an entirely new memory/storage technology called 3D Xpoint that works like a combination of DRAM—the working memory in devices—and flash storage, such as SSDs. Intel’s commercialized version of the technology, which took over 10 years to develop, is called Optane and will appear first in storage devices for data centers. What’s unique about Optane is that it addresses a performance bottleneck found in most all computing devices between memory and storage, and allows for performance advances for certain applications that will go way beyond what a faster CPU could do. Qualcomm has proven to be very adept at combining multiple elements, including CPUs, GPUs, DSPs, modems and other elements into sophisticated SOCs (system on chip), such as the new Snapdragon 835 chip. While most of its work has been focused on smartphones to date, the capabilities of its multi-element designs make them well-suited for many other devices—including autonomous cars—as well as some of the most demanding new applications, such as AI. The in-house efforts of Apple, Samsung, Huawei—and to some degree Microsoft and Google—are also focused towards these SOC designs. Each hopes to leverage the unique characteristics they build into their chips into distinct features and functions that can be incorporated into future devices. Finally, the company that’s enabling many of these capabilities is ARM, the UK-based chip design house whose chip architectures (sold in the form of intellectual property, or IP) are at the heart of many (though not all) of the previously listed companies’ offerings. In fact, ARM just announced that over 100 billion chips based on their designs have shipped since the company started 21 years ago, with half of those coming in the last 4 years. The company’s latest advance is a new architecture they call DynamIQ that, for the first time, allows the combination of multiple different types and sizes of computing elements, or cores, inside one of their Cortex-A architecture chip designs. The real-world results include up to a 50x boost in AI performance and a wide range of multifunction chip designs that can be uniquely architected and suited for unique applications—in other words, the right kind of chips for the right kind of devices. The net result of all these developments is an extremely vibrant semiconductor market with a much brighter future than was commonly expected just a few years ago. Even better, this new range of chips portends an intriguing new array of devices and services that can take advantage of these key advancements in what will be exciting and unexpected ways. It’s bound to be magical. Bob O’Donnell is the founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC a technology consulting and market research firm. You can follow him on Twitter @bobodtech.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 21, 2017 at 9:44PM Connected cars, location-based services, and wearable devices will create a multibillion-dollar revenue opportunity for certain semiconductor specialists. Research and Markets forecasts that the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) chip market will grow at 7.9% a year until 2022, when it will be worth $5.22 billion. One way to tap this growth is through chipmakers Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Here's how each company is trying to grab a slice of the GNSS pie. Qualcomm is at the top of the heap ABI Research puts Qualcomm at the top of the heap in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) chip market, a space the company has been leading for the past four years. And it is unlikely that it will loosen its grip any time soon as it is now targeting the world's biggest smartphone market with a key partnership. The smartphone-chip maker teamed up with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) last year to integrate its IZat hardware location platform into its Snapdragon chipset range. Qualcomm is using the Chinese internet giant's location and positioning techniques to provide low-power location-based services on applications such as Baidu Maps. Both companies are already engaged with multiple smartphone makers in China to roll out handsets based on their technology, which is great news for Qualcomm as Baidu's mapping service is widely used. In fact, it has over 300 million active users in China, and it controls around 70% of the country's search engine market. TechNavio forecasts that location-based services in China will gain huge popularity over the next three years -- growing at 50%-plus annual rates -- with Baidu being one of the key vendors. What's more, the company is now looking to take its mapping service international by entering 106 new markets, so Qualcomm could piggyback the Chinese company to sell more of its location chips both in China and abroad. The automotive market presents another big opportunity for the American chipmaker to push its GNSS chips. Earlier this year, Qualcomm launched a new iteration of its connected-car platform based on its GNSS platform that enables advanced location-based systems for vehicle tracking and location fixing. ReportLinker forecasts that the automotive telematics market will grow at over 29% a year for the next decade, so Qualcomm's early move into this space should reap dividends. Wearable devices could drive Broadcom Broadcom is the second-largest purveyor of GNSS chips after Qualcomm, though it has taken a different path to tap the opportunity. It launched a GNSS chip designed especially for mass-market wearable devices three years ago. It has made impressive progress and it is now into the fourth generation of this chipset. Broadcom's decision to move into wearables early has been a smart one as device sales increased to an estimated 102 million units last year from 79 million units in 2015, according to IDC. The industry will not run out of steam any time soon: IDC expects wearable-device shipments to more than double to 213 million units in 2020. This rapid growth rate should translate into higher semiconductor sales. Gartner forecasts that the wearables semiconductor market will more than triple to $4.61 billion in 2020 from 2015 levels, painting a bright picture for Broadcom's GNSS business. More importantly, Broadcom is working on next-generation GNSS technology to maintain its lead in this market. The company is partnering with the European GNSS Agency to bring a new frequency -- known as E5/L5 -- to the market. This frequency will support the existing E1/L1 capability of GPS receivers, leading to faster and more accurate location tracking that can be deployed in complex urban environments for automotive and smartphone applications. Intel "drones in" on the GNSS market Intel might not be as big as Broadcom or Qualcomm in GNSS chips, but it has a promising approach to take advantage of this opportunity. The company had bought its way into this market four years ago by acquiring the GNSS business of ST-Ericsson, and it looks like now it is using the technology in drones. Intel acquired German drone developer Ascending Technologies in January last year, following it up with the launch of its first commercial drone in October 2016. This is a smart move by the company as the commercial drone market in North America is expected to grow at almost 20% annually over the next six years. Image source: Intel. The good news is that Intel has already entered into a distribution deal to sell its Falcon 8+ drone system in North America. Therefore, the company could witness stronger shipments of its GNSS chips as the drone system is powered by a high-precision location-tracking system. Intel doesn't have much scope to sell its GNSS chips in smartphone space, where Qualcomm and MediaTek are the dominant forces, so it is doing the right thing by focusing on the drone market. In fact, the chipmaker has been aggressively buying its way into this space, with its acquisition of Movidius in October last year being one such move. Movidius is known for providing low-power computer-vision processing to leading drone manufacturers such as DJI. Additionally, Intel also acquired navigation and mapping-related algorithms from Movidius, indicating that it might be working on a comprehensive system to power drones. Intel, therefore, could end up becoming an enabler of drone technology going forward, apart from manufacturing drones in-house. This could improve the company's standing in the GNSS chip market as location plays a mission-critical role in powering drones. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Intel earlier on indicated that this platform would get 'only' 28 cores.  The results for the 165 Watt 32-core and 64-threaded processor are roughly 4000 points for a single core and 50000 points for the multi-core score. The base clock frequency per core would be 2.1 GHz, the results however indicate 2.3 GHz.     Purley is the successor to the Nehalem architecture, a platform based on motherboard chipset and thus the processor series. The processor platform will come enable six-channels DDR4, and AVX 512 instruction set and a new 100G OmniPath interconnect. Purley will support for no less than 8 processor sockets and will come with Cannonlake graphics and FPGA integration. The PCH is designed under code-name Lewisburg and it'll ship with new Ethernet controllers, these seem to be 10Gbps. The Purley platform is tied towards a Socket LGA 3647. This entails twelve DDR4 (384-bit wide) slots (no joke) considering this processor has a six channel memory controller.  Via hwi, Geekbench, Google. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ...

I know when i use Cinebench that it also gives "single" and "multi" threaded scores. And those scores scale fairly evenly with the addition of extra cores (like 125 single threaded and 790 for a 4 core 8 threaded CPU. So roughly 7-8x the single threaded score for a 8 thread CPU.). Why then with a 64 threaded CPU is the "multi thread" score only around 13x higher then the "single threaded" score on Geekbench? I admit tjis may be viewed as a "noob" like question but i don't really care. Can somone explain it to me? Thanks.

I have no idea what though, I don't use geekbench Synthetic benchmarks, like any other software, are not absolutes. Much not only depends on compiler and code optimization, but on how *well* the benchmark code itself is written--to the point of whether what is being measured by a particular benchmark is even relevant to the user's software environment ...

The trend towards small footprint machines continues, but perhaps not as quickly as one might have expected in the age of smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks. The ECS Liva Z we’re reviewing today is a new generation ultra compact form factor PC, following in the footsteps of the original Liva and Liva X. Like its predecessors, Its design goals are size minimization and affordability whilst delivering the power needed to run common PC tasks. Almost all of the major PC manufacturers have a line of ultra compact PC’s these days. In times past, even a basic PC for Grandma and Grandpa to send email and browse the net meant the purchase of the stereotypical beige box ATX sized PC and chunky CRT monitor. Computers have come a long way since then. There’s no need for a PC to take up the entire table.  Today, you can get a powerful desktop PC the size of a paperback book. The potential uses for a PC such as this are vast. Whether you need power thrifty, silent and low powered office machines, embedded signage or kiosk use,  a media server or NAS front end, a HTPC or just something to save space, then a tiny ultra compact PC could be the answer.   Specifications Below are the major specifications of the Liva Z. Our sample came equipped with the Celeron N3350 SoC which is a dual core with a base frequency of 1.1Ghz and a boost frequency of 2.4Ghz. the TDP is 6.0 w which means there is no need for any active cooling. This CPU belongs to the Apollo Lake family with its CPU cores code named Goldmont. Intel claims the new SoC improves CPU performance by 30% and graphics performance by 45% over the previous generation Braswell family. This should go a long way to addressing the somewhat lackluster performance of prior Braswell equipped models. Our experience with Bay Trail and Braswell was they they lacked a bit of CPU grunt. This architectural improvement, plus the native support for HEVC and VP9 codecs means the Apollo Lake family is much more compelling. The Intel 500 Graphics is clocked at 200Mhz with a boost clock of 650Mhz, though GPUz has not been updated with full recognition of the unit  at this time.   The system can take up to 2x4Gb of DDR3L so-dimm memory. Our sample came equipped with a single Kingston 4Gb module and also a 32Gb eMMC embedded drive, upon which we installed the OS. Other noteworthy specs include the ability to accept a M.2 drive (though only a 2242 sized drive which are far less common than 2280 sized drives), AC WiFi and dual Gigabit LAN.   A Closer Look The Liva Z come boxed in an attractive package which is refreshingly free of snarling beasts, RGB everywhere and warriors with lasers that many gaming focused PC products and packages are adorned with these days. Sometimes we want our PC’s to be neither heard or seen 😉     The Liva Z comes with the following accessories: A power brick, a VESA mount with accompanying screws and a power lead. The power adapter is made by reputable manufacturer FSP and is rated for 19V and 3.42A (for a total of 65w) meaning it has more than enough power to drive the Liva Z and its peripherals without any problem. The Liva Z itself comes with a stylish design that reminds us of a record. It is small enough to sit unobtrusively on a bookshelf or entertainment stack. The build quality is very good. The feel is solid and the internal construction leaves us with no concerns. Here we get a true indication of the tiny size of the unit when using the USB ports as a reference. Obviously we have the power button on the left (with a subtle LED light when powered on), three USB 3.0 ports and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. This is quite a good configuration allowing for a KB/Mouse (or dongle) plus external storage and a port leftover for something like a camera. On the far right we see a combo headphone/speaker and mic jack.   Moving around to the rear of the unit, we have a Mini Display Port, HDMI 1.4, dual Gigabit LAN and the DC in port. These are the ports that will have cables attached to them, so having them at the rear is important. The HDMI 1.4 port means that connected 4K displays will be limited to 30Hz. While this won’t be a problem for video playback, it does limit the HDMI to simple playback and not PC type tasks where 60Hz is the norm. Luckily, the DP port is suitable if 4K 60Hz is desired.   After we open up the unit, we can see the internal slots. On the left are the dual so-dimm ports that support up to 8Gb of DDR3L memory. On the right we see the slots with a Dual Band WiFi card with ac support and also an empty SATA III M.2 slot for connecting a SSD. Though this slot will only accept 2242 drives as opposed to the far more common 2280 drives. Just to the right of the memory stick is a Sandisk eMMC embedded chip, This gives the Liva Z its 32Gb of internal storage. Adding a SSD will really add to the usability of the unit as 32Gb is eaten up far too quickly once you add the OS plus updates and a few common programs.   Here is the other side of the PCB with the N3350 SoC sitting in the center.   BIOS The ECS Liva Z BIOS is very basic compared to even a entry level motherboard. The advanced tab is where the onboard devices can be configured. Many of these are simple on or off choices. though the CPU tab is where you’ll find some more advanced options like the power management options, C-States etc. The MIB tab shows simple CPU and memory information. There’s no overclocking as you’d expect. The boot menu is where you’ll select.. gasp… the boot options, but also the OS choice and UEFI/Legacy mode. There’s really not much else to talk about, but generally simplicity means less bugs, and everything is working as it should.   System Testing Firstly, we wanted to look at temperatures of the unit when under full load. a peak of 74 after 20 minutes of full load is a touch higher than we’d like, but remember it is a passive system. The maximum temperature for this CPU is listed as 105c by Intel. Measuring power consumption at the same time, we saw the following: 4.98W at idle, and only 9.27w under load. With thrifty power use like this, you’ll hardly see an effect on your power bill.     We could run a heap of benchmarks, but we know its not going to be a world beater. It’s not for gaming beyond something like your Facebook games, you won’t encode video with it or do  anything productivity wise. It will run office applications perfectly well and surf the internet with media rich applications, but it is no match for a proper desktop PC. On the flipside, a desktop is no match for the Liva Z’s minuscule power consumption and foot print. They are just not comparable. A quick test of the built in eMMC card doesn’t reveal many surprises. It wold be advisable to add a M.2 drive to the Liva Z as 32Gb is just enough to put the OS on, and not much more.   Given the Liva Z’s likely usage scenario will be as a media consumption machine, we ran a couple of demanding files to see how the unit would handle them. The results were excellent. The first file is a copy of The Martian, streamed over Wifi and played back via MPC-HC. It is a x264 encoded file with DTS MA audio. The average bit rate is 57Mbps and the total file size is over 60Gb, making this a tough one to play. The Liva Z played it back with no stuttering at all. The CPU usage is quite high at around 50-60% but this is fine given the low power nature of the CPU. We don’t have a high quality HEVC encode of this nature, but given the fixed function ability of Apollo Lake SoC’s to playback HEVC content, we’re quite sure this won’t present any problem.   The second file is a high bit rate encode of Inception weighing in at around 12Gb. CPU usage is lower at around 30-40%.   Finally we ran a test of the WiFi speed. Our router is located through a wall in the next room, so your speeds may vary. 26 megabytes per second is not too bad for an average WiFi card. Conclusion Tiny PC’s like the Liva Z will never win the performance war. It cannot run Crysis and you won’t be able to render a Pixar movie with it. What it will do is perform admirably in day to day PC tasks. Simplicity is the name of the game here. Its purpose is to do the basics with no fuss with the tasks most people use a PC for. Internet surfing, email, office apps, media consumption and app style gaming. With a price in the range of $180 USD for the tested version, considering this low price along with low power use, compact size, zero noise and we think the ECS Liva Z is superb value for money. Also bear in mind that many barebones units don’t come with internal storage or memory, whereas the Liva Z comes with both installed. If you have a specific task such as digital signage, media playback, an office machine, as a NAS front end, a digital kiosk, video surveillance, or as a basic Internet machine for grandma and grandpa, then the ECS Liva Z can serve these purposes and serve them very well. We tested the Liva Z as the front end of a NAS, and in this capacity it performed basically flawlessly. High bitrate 4k video over WiFi was no problem.

The games, viewable using the Oculus NCAA March Madness Live VR app for Samsung’s Gear VR, won’t be free. For $2.99 per game, or $7.99 for all six, fans will receive a courtside view from several virtual reality cameras, with a special audio broadcast. For $1.99 per game, fans will receive the view from one courtside VR camera, with audio from the CBS broadcast. The VR broadcasts start with Thursday’s West region semifinal games in San Jose, but don’t include games played in the three other regions. However, the networks, Intel and the NCAA have signed a multiyear partnership to use Intel’s True VR technology. Wall Street Markets take precipitous fall Stocks took their biggest loss in five months Tuesday as a health care bill backed by President Trump ran into trouble in Congress, which raised some questions about his agenda of faster economic growth spurred on by lower taxes and cuts in regulations. Banks plunged as bond yields continued to fall, which will mean lower interest rates on loans. Transportation companies including airlines, railroads and rental car companies dropped, and so did steel and chemicals makers. The dollar weakened. Small-company stocks, which stand to benefit the most from Trump’s policy proposals of lower taxes and looser regulations, fell more than the rest of the market. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index tumbled 29.45 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,344.02. That was its biggest drop since Oct. 11. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 237.85 points, or 1.1 percent, to 20,668.01. The Nasdaq composite surrendered 107.70 points, or 1.8 percent, to 5,793.83. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks plunged 37.55 points, or 2.7 percent, to 1,346.55. Four-fifths of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell. Retail Bebe may go online only Bebe Stores, the Brisbane women’s apparel chain with locations across the country, is reportedly planning to shut its stores and seek a turnaround as an online brand. The company is trying to close the locations without filing for bankruptcy, said people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the efforts aren’t public. However, Chapter 11 may be required if enough landlords aren’t willing to negotiate, they said. The company, known for selling trendy going-out apparel to young women, has been operating about 170 boutique and outlet stores. Bebe would become the latest retailer to shed brick-and-mortar stores and hitch its fortunes to e-commerce. Kenneth Cole Productions said in November that it would close almost all of its locations, concentrating instead on its online businesses. A consumer shift to the Internet has contributed to several retail bankruptcies this year. Unlike many retailers, Bebe has no significant debt. But it has lost about $200 million over the past four years, and negotiating with landlords to get out of leases may prove difficult. The company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Manny Mashouf, who founded the company in San Francisco in 1976, owns 57 percent of its stock. He remains chairman and CEO, but last year, Bebe sold half of its brand to Bluestar Alliance to develop a wholesale licensing business, a move that helped raise cash. The stock has fallen more than 80 percent over the past two years, though it began to rebound last month. Banking Wells ATMs to use phones Wells Fargo plans to upgrade all 13,000 of its ATMs next week to allow customers to access their funds using their cell phones instead of traditional bank cards. The announcement was made Tuesday by Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have announced similar upgrades to their ATMs, but they have not implemented the changes yet. Wells would be the first to offer the feature across the United States. To access their money, customers would get unique eight-digit codes from their Wells Fargo smartphone app, and enter the code into the ATM along with their PIN. The machines will accept debit cards as well. The codes will not work on the secure doors that many branches have for nonbusiness hours that require an ATM or debit card to gain entry. Wells Fargo said those secure doors are found at a small percentage of branches, mostly in major metropolitan areas. Earnings FedEx hurt by fuel costs Income and revenue rose during the peak holiday season at FedEx, but higher fuel costs helped keep profit below Wall Street’s forecast. Holiday-season package volume was the heaviest ever, and the big package-delivery company continues to benefit from the growth in online shopping. FedEx said Tuesday that it earned $562 million in its fiscal third quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier, and revenue increased 19 percent. Adjusted profit, which excludes costs related to the acquisition and restructuring of TNT Express, was $2.35 per share. That was well short of the $2.63 per share forecast by analysts. Third-quarter revenue of $15 billion was slightly higher than the analysts’ prediction of $14.96 billion. General Mills sees profit dip A decline in the sales of “light” yogurts hurt the bottom line in the third fiscal quarter, General Mills said, reporting a 20 percent dip in U.S. yogurt sales. Profit fell 1 percent to $357.8 million (61 cents per share). Adjusted for restructuring costs and nonrecurring costs, the company said that earnings came to 72 cents per share, a penny more than analysts had expected.

Devin Nunes, who is accused of sucking up to the White House Tim Molloy, provided by Published 5:31 pm, Wednesday, March 22, 2017 Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Joe Scarborough: ‘Remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman’ 1 / 1 Back to Gallery “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough called on Republicans to drop Rep. Devin Nunes as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee after a chain of events that suggested Nunes was sucking up to the White House instead of working in the interests of Congress. “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman,” tweeted Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida. The tweet continued the “Mean Girls”-pattern of friendliness and fighting that has characterized the Trump-Scarborough relationship for months. Last week, things got so tense that the president unfollowed Scarborough on Twitter. Also Read: President Trump Unfollows 'Morning Joe' Hosts on Twitter If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman. — Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 22, 2017 How did Nunes awaken Scarborough’s (and other people’s) Twitter fury? As The Hill explains, he announced that he had seen evidence that U.S. intelligence had come across information on members of President Trump’s transition team while conducting routine surveillance of foreign targets. Trump — who famously claimed, without offering any evidence, that President Obama had wiretapped his Trump Tower office — said he felt “somewhat” vindicated by Nunes’ statement about the surveillance. Also Read: Why Even Donald Trump Can't Save Twitter (Of course, Nunes’ statement Wednesday didn’t refer to Trump Tower, and he and FBI Director James Comey have said there’s no evidence such surveillance occurred. But in fairness, Trump only said he felt “somewhat” vindicated, not vindicated.) Nunes made his comment about the surveillance without consulting the top Democrat on his committee, Rep. Adam Schiff. Then Nunes went to the White House to brief the administration about them, which Democrats said was weird, and suggested Nunes was working for Trump’s team, not his own branch of government. “Today, Chairman Nunes shared information with WH still withheld from our committee. He cannot conduct a credible investigation this way,” Schiff tweeted. Nunes said the surveillance didn’t involve probes into Team Trump’s possible Russian ties. Scarborough has alternately been accused of being too cozy and too standoffish with Trump, though they’re currently in a less-friendly phase. Scarborough also retweeted a sharp Wall Street Journal editorial Wednesday that says Trump is clinging to his tapped-phones assertion “like a drunk to an empty gin bottle.” Read original story Joe Scarborough: ‘Remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman’ At TheWrap Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

In an interview on MSNBC with Chuck Todd, California Rep. Adam Schiff was asked about former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s recent statement that he had seen no evidence by the time he left office on Jan. 20 that Trump’s team had cooperated with the Kremlin. (RELATED: Obama’s Intelligence Director Says No Evidence Of Trump-Russia Collusion) “Reviewing the evidence that I have, I don’t think you can conclude that at all, far from it,” Schiff told Todd of Clapper’s recent remarks. “But you admit…all you have right now is a circumstantial case,” Todd replied. “Actually, no Chuck, I can tell you that the case is more than that. I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now,” said Schiff. “So you have seen direct evidence of collusion?” Todd asked. “I don’t want to go into specifics, but I can say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and that is very much worthy of investigation.” Schiff’s interview came just after Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes held two press briefings announcing that Trump’s personal communications may have been incidentally collected during routine surveillance of unnamed foreign targets. (RELATED: House Intel Chair: Trump’s Personal Communications May Have Been Captured By Obama Admin) Nunes also said that the Obama administration may have improperly unmasked the identities of Trump advisers whose communications were picked up during the surveillance. Like Schiff, Nunes declined to give more details about the information he has seen. Schiff criticized Nunes for giving the press briefings, saying that the Republican should have briefed other members of the committee on the new information. Instead, Nunes shared the information with reporters before going to the White House to brief Trump.

Wyden, who is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, added that "with respect to the substance of the claim, I don't have any idea what he is talking about." Nunes grabbed headlines when he told reporters earlier Wednesday that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of Trump's transition team and the information was "widely disseminated" in intelligence reports. The GOP chairman told reporters that the information was "legally brought to him by sources who thought we should know it," but declined to provide further detail. The California Republican also said he would brief the president on his findings, which Wyden quipped didn't meet the "textbook definition" of congressional oversight since lawmakers are investigating any potential contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall St mixed as Nike knocks Dow Margreet Dietz Thursday March 23, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street was mixed as a decline in Nike shares offset a gain in stocks of Apple and Intel. Investors were also cautious ahead of Thursday's vote in the House of Representatives on a Republican healthcare bill. "Even the mistiest-eyed optimist appears to be coming to the realisation that even on healthcare, where there is some form of consensus, reforms are likely to take a lot longer than realised," CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson wrote in a note, Bloomberg reported. "Any other programmes like tax and banking reform and infrastructure spending are likely to get pushed further out into the future." At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.71 points, or 0.03%, to 20,661.30. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.5% to 5821.64 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index edged up 0.2% to 2348.45. Tech companies accounted for the top four gainers in the Dow. Nike's 7.1% fall and Goldman Sachs' 1.6% drop outweighed gains in shares of Apple, up 1.1% and Intel, up 0.9%.  "What we're seeing today is buyers being opportunistic and trying to gain entry into the overall market," Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York, told Reuters. "That's why we're seeing tech and industrials stocks, which last a lot on Tuesday, lead today." Biggest one-drop in five months Shares steadied a day after the indexes logged their first 1% declines in five months. "Everyone has been waiting for a dip for so long that when you get some kind of a dip, for not just tech but large-cap value too, it's one of those opportunities to buy in," Mariann Montagne, a portfolio manager at Gradient Investments, told Bloomberg. "Maybe people are seeing a cue that things aren't deteriorating across tech land," Montagne noted. "The deterioration of tech wasn't due to fundamentals, it was just a function of pricing." However, Nike's stock dropped after the company's lower-than-expected quarterly sales bolstered concern it's losing ground to key rivals. "A lot of the concern about Nike is its growth in a competitive environment," Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough told Reuters. "Three to five years ago, a competitive environment (for Nike) was almost non-existent and the market was moving towards athleisure." US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, slated to speak on Thursday, might offer fresh clues on the pace of interest rate increases. Home sales retreat A National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index retreated 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million in February, from 5.69 million in January. Closings retreated in February because a lack of properties for sale and weakening affordability conditions stifled buyers in most of the country, according to Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. "Realtors are reporting stronger foot traffic from a year ago, but low supply in the affordable price range continues to be the pest that's pushing up price growth and pressuring the budgets of prospective buyers," Yun said in a statement. "Newly listed properties are being snatched up quickly so far this year and leaving behind minimal choices for buyers trying to reach the market." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.4% drop from the previous close. France's CAC 40 Index gave up 0.2%, Germany's DAX Index declined 0.5%, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index fell 0.7%. (BusinessDesk) Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman.— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 22, 2017 Scarborough was reacting to Nunes's decision to announce that he had seen evidence confirming that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of President Trump's transition team during routine surveillance of foreign targets. Nunes made the announcement on his own and without consulting the top Democrat on his committee. He then went to the White House to brief the administration on his findings, a move that Democrats said was highly unusual and suggested he was working for for the administration than Congress.  President Trump said on camera that he felt somewhat vindicated by Nunes's findings.  The House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating Russian efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, as well as Trump and his associates' potential ties to Moscow. Nunes said the surveillance had nothing to do with probes into Trump aides' potential ties to Russia. Scarborough, who hosts MSNBC's "Morning Joe," has been openly critical of the president and has engaged in public feuds with him that have played out over social media.  Tags House Intelligence Committee Paul Ryan   View the discussion thread.

 Trump: I feel 'somewhat' vindicated by House Intelligence Committee chair's revelations Allan Smith Mar. 22, 2017, 4:21 PM 21,119 facebook linkedin twitter email print Donald Trump. Getty Images President Donald Trump said he felt "somewhat" vindicated by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes' announcement on Wednesday that he had seen reports that the intelligence community had "incidentally collected" information about Trump's transition team. Asked at the White House if he felt vindicated, Trump said: "I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found. I somewhat do." Nunes, a California Republican, said during a brief press conference that the collection occurred on "numerous occasions" and was not related to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. "Details about US persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting," Nunes said. But in a later press conference outside the White House, where he had briefed the president on his findings, Nunes did not stand by Trump's claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped phones at Trump Tower — an accusation he has stuck by without providing evidence. "No, no, no, no," Nunes said. "That did not happen. I've said this for many, many weeks, including the day after, a couple days after, in front of the press. That never happened." However, he said he could not be sure whether Obama had ordered any surveillance of Trump during the transition period between November and January. He also said he had "no idea" whether the collection of information about the transition team was intentional spying on behalf of the government. "We won't know that until we get to the bottom of did people ask for the unmasking of additional names in President Trump's transition team," he said. In his earlier press conference, Nunes told reporters he believed the information was collected legally under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He said he did not know if the surveillance consisted of phone calls, but that the intelligence reports he had seen "clearly show" Trump and his team were "monitored." He added that the White House was unaware of the information he was providing to the media. Nunes, who was a member of Trump's transition team himself, is leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's effort to manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. During a hearing on Monday, FBI Director James Comey told the committee that the bureau had been investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government since late July. Comey also said the Department of Justice could provide no evidence to back up Trump's explosive claim that Obama wiretapped him. In his press conference outside the White House, Nunes was asked whether it was inappropriate to brief the president on information that could be related to an ongoing investigation into members of his administration and campaign team. Nunes said he did not believe so. "Because what I saw had nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with the Russian investigation," Nunes said. "It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities, and the president needs to know these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that." Nunes did not answer a question about whether he was trying to give the president "political cover" for the unproven wiretapping claim by making his revelations public. Nunes said he and Trump discussed the concerns "that I had with incidental collection and how it relates to his transition team." Nunes said he hoped to have more information on the subject by Friday. "I'm not drawing any conclusion," Nunes said. "I'm just telling the president what exists in the intelligence reports. "What I've read seems to me to be some level of surveillance activity, perhaps legal, but I don't know that it's right," he added. "But let us get all the reports. ... I think the president is concerned, and he should be. I think he'd like to see these reports." Evan McMullin, a former CIA operative who ran an independent presidential campaign in 2016, said that with Nunes saying the communications were "incidentally collected," the real question was "Who was Trump talking to?" "If what Devin Nunes says is true, Trump was communicating with persons of intelligence or criminal interest," he tweeted. "This is Devin Nunes doing President Trump and Congressional Republicans a favor by muddying the waters on the Trump/Russia investigation." John Weaver, the chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign, tweeted that it seemed as if Nunes "could be leaking classified information left and right" by discussing the intelligence reports publicly.

MSNBC security analyst Jeremy Bash noted that he served as counsel to the House Intelligence Committee in the past while pointing out that he “never heard of a chairman of an oversight committee going to brief the President of the United States about concerns he had about things he read in an intelligence report.” “The job of the committee is to do oversight of the executive branch,” Bash exclaimed. “Not to bring them into their investigation or to tip them off to things they may be looking at.” He continued, “I’ve gotta believe that other members of the committee are horrified at what they just witnessed. This is a chairman that’s supposed to be doing impartial, bipartisan investigations of the president’s inner circle and instead he basically goers and tells the president and his team everything he knows.” At the presser, Nunes was asked if he was providing “political cover” to Trump regarding the president’s tweets earlier this month that his predecessor wiretapped Trump Tower prior to the election.

According to the blog HotHardware, “Microsoft is blocking Windows 7 and 8 updates for Intel’s seventh generation Core i3, i5 and i7 (Kaby Lake), AMD’s Ryzen (Bristol Ridge) and Qualcomm’s 8996 processors.” What this means is that customers who might want to upgrade their processor, or who already have, will stop receiving updates and patches if they have Windows 7 or 8.1 installed. Microsoft maintains that Windows 7 and 8 was not designed to run on and take advantage of the newer architecture. However, many users have been running the operating systems with no problems on the latest chipsets. Despite the lack of reported issues, the software behemoth has gone ahead and added a processor check to Windows Update on Windows 7 and 8.1. TechSpot reports that the check prevents “users from download [sic] updates if their system contains a Kaby Lake or Ryzen CPU.” #Windows7 #Windows8 – Microsoft Windows 7 And 8 Will Not Run On Next Gen… https://t.co/2Fbo0dsmwG #WindowsOS pic.twitter.com/zlzv2g4BLO — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 17, 2016 So clients who have had no complaints previously using Windows 7 or 8.1 are now complaining of getting errors that state, “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows.” To be clear, Microsoft still supports Windows 7 and 8.1 and provides security patches and bug fixes to those operating systems, except for those running it on newer hardware. Furthermore, it seems that there is not even a technical problem to justify the new restriction. While Microsoft maintains, “Redesigning Windows 7 subsystems to embrace new generations of silicon would introduce churn into the Windows 7 code base,” nobody has complained or asked them to redesign anything as it all seems to be working fine. Customers just want the same support and patches that everybody else is getting. They feel that they should be able to decide if they want to take the risk of OS failure, and they resent the company forcing them into a product that they do not want by denying them future security protections. Some have good reason to wish to continue running 7 or 8 because there is still some legacy software that is not compatible with Windows 10, and many of these programs are used in businesses. Despite this, Microsoft feels that its customers will be bettered served by forcing them to upgrade. Many customers are very troubled by this move, especially as it follows what is viewed as a “malicious” trend that Gates and company have frequently employed. Early last year and in 2015, the company was forcing Windows 10 onto an unwilling section of the public in a push to meet OS migration goals. Blocking #Microsoft #Windows 7 & 8.xx updates for #Intel Kaby Lake, #AMD #Ryzen chips appears imminenthttps://t.co/hsZVwzuH3z #starwind pic.twitter.com/5jA8q5X7wp — Anton Kolomyeytsev (@RedEvolutionIX) March 18, 2017 Back in June of 2016, Microsoft was accused of using “malware tactics” to trick its base into upgrading to Windows 10. At that time, customers were bombarded with Windows Update popups nagging them to upgrade to Windows 10. While quite annoying, the popups apparently did not have the desired effect because the behavior of the popups changed so that closing the window constituted consent to the upgrade. In a further push, the close button was eventually removed altogether. When clients found that their computers were being upgraded without consent, they were furious. In some cases, the forced upgrades caused serious problems for businesses running mission-critical applications that were not compatible with Windows 10. At one point, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) was petitioned to investigate Microsoft for, among other things, “Tricking or forcing users into upgrading to Windows 10.” The EFF did not look into the items listed on this petition, but it has looked into past shady dealings with the company. According to the EFF, in 2012, the software giant used Hotmail to track down a thief who had stolen source code from the corporation. Normally, a warrant is needed to access a person’s email records, but since Microsoft owns Hotmail, they just looked into the matter themselves. When they discovered evidence of the crime, they turned it and the culprit over to authorities, thus violating his Fourth Amendment rights by proxy. While this was not a case of stepping on the freedoms of consumers to choose, it does illustrate the company’s willingness to play within the gray areas of the law. In a case that did have consequences on consumer choice, the New York Times reported that in 2000 Microsoft was ruled by a federal judge to be in violation of “antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior.” Remember the antitrust lawsuit filed against Microsoft in 1998? It all started on today's date http://t.co/Rzte4kk4wu pic.twitter.com/Qzurbwxd0U — ETC ComputerLand (@ETCCL) May 18, 2015 While the antitrust suit was not against actions taken directly against consumers, antitrust laws by their very nature are in place to protect the consumer’s right to choose a product. By violating these laws, the corporation was showing its disdain for the consumer’s right to choose. The company has repeatedly proven that it is not afraid to throw its clout around and step on the very customers that it claims to serve. So, the denial of upgrades to a subset of current Windows 7 and 8 users through the guise of compatibility issues that do not appear to exist should come as no surprise. The motivation for this action is clear as well. According to CNN, Microsoft stated in 2015 that it had a goal of having Windows 10 installed on one billion devices by 2017. Today, by the company’s own accounting, the operating system is installed on a total of 400 million devices worldwide. Microsoft has missed its goal for Windows 10 by 60 percent. No wonder there seems to be a renewed push to force users to install something that they do not want. Windows 10 has not even crested the hill yet. Microsoft may have good intentions for wanting users of newer hardware to switch to Windows 10. There may very well be security and compatibility issues that arise in the future. Wanting to protect their clients from this issues is noble, but denying them access to security patches for the software that they already have is not the noble way to go about it.

Chandler Rep. Jeff Weninger's new proposal extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. It also gives super-fast depreciation to Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. It indefinitely extends a current research and development tax credit that is supposed to be reduced next year. The depreciation portion will substantially cut the property tax and especially affect Intel, which plans to equip a new Chandler chip plant with billions of dollars of new equipment. Out are proposals letting companies cash in existing research and development tax credits that they hold but can't redeem because the Legislature has excluded much of the manufacturers' income from state taxes. There are more than $1 billion in unused R&D tax credits currently on the books. Also out is a provision returning half the income tax withholding from new workers and creating a new sales tax exemption for some supplies. "Basically this is a similar version to the one before while taking out all the things people had problems with," Weninger told the House Ways and Means Committee. The panel on which Weninger sits approved Senate Bill 1416 on an 8-1 vote, advancing it to the full House for consideration. If approved there, it will return to the Senate to approve the changes Weninger made using a so-called "strike-everything" amendment. The full House had rejected Weninger's earlier proposal on a 23-36 vote even after he removed provisions accounting for $5 million of the original $20 million cost. The depreciation part of the new proposal is estimated to cost $1.5 million in 2019 alone, Weninger told the panel. The costs of the extension of the existing jobs tax credit and the R&D tax credit proposal were not outlined. In other action Wednesday on tax incentives, a Senate panel rejected a proposal from Rep. T.J. Shope, R-Coolidge, that would have allowed financing companies to claim up to $30 million in tax credits if they invested $20 million in new or expanded rural businesses. The 2-5 defeat in the Senate Finance committee of House Bill 2530 came after members expressed concern that it would benefit an out-of-state company, Advantage Capital Partners, which was pushing the legislation. The same Senate panel approved another proposal allowing up to $10 million in tax credits for companies that invest in small businesses. The so-called "angel investor" proposal was added onto House Bill 2191 after the original proposal contained in another bill stalled in the House.

Following his earlier press conference where he announced that he had discovered that members of the Trump transition team had their communications “incidentally collected,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes held another presser after he briefed President Donald Trump on his findings. After being pressed on whether or not this new info vindicates Trump’s wiretap claims — Nunes gave mixed answers — along with why he was briefing the president but hadn’t spoken to the ranking member of the intel committee, the Republican lawmaker was asked if he was trying to help out Trump. “Legal collection, what is it that you find inappropriate about it?” a reporter stated, highlighting that Nunes had said this was all legally collected. “And are you attempting to give the president political cover for his wiretapping tweet?” The California Congressman (and former Trump transition member) brushed the “political cover” part of the question aside, instead stating that he’s doing this because there are “procedures in place” to “protect American citizens who are incidentally collected.” He then said he wasn’t sure if this was “intentional spying.” Earlier this month, Trump created a political firestorm by taking to Twitter to accuse his predecessor of illegally wiretapping him at Trump Tower prior to the election. Since then, the FBI director, Department of Justice and Senate and House Intel Committees have said they’ve found no evidence to back his claims. Watch the clip above, via MSNBC.

ADVERTISEMENT Khan, the first Muslim mayor of London, has been an outspoken critic of President Trump. Khan has called Trump "ignorant," asked for British Prime Minister Theresa May to cancel a planned Trump state visit to the United Kingdom and welcomed Americans interested in emigrating after Trump's election in November. According to multiple reports, police shot an alleged attacker outside of Parliament on Wednesday. A police officer inside the Houses of Parliament was reportedly stabbed, while a car struck multiple people on the Westminster Bridge. The City of London Police said they are treating the assault as a terrorist attack. The president told reporters at the White House that he had been briefed on the attack but declined to provide further comment. "I was just getting an update on London.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Nunes said that there have been “significant developments” in his committee’s investigation into any Obama administration surveillance of the Trump team. “I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition,” Nunes said. “Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.” Donald Trup at Trump Tower (Photo: DOMINICK REUTER/AFP/Getty Images) Nunes suggested that a source had provided new information showing that the Obama administration incidentally collected information on Trump and the Trump campaign. He also said that some of the Trump team members whose communications were picked up may have been illegally unmasked by the intelligence community. The California Republican added that he had confirmed that “additional names of Trump transition team members” were unmasked. None of the surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation into Russia’s activities prior to the election. “I’m really alarmed by the unmasking,” Nunes said. Nunes said that he was not sure if any communications from Trump Tower were picked up in the surveillance. He also added that he believed that the surveillance was conducted legally. “I believe it was all done legally. I think it was all obtained legally,” he said, while expressing greater concern for the unmasking of the people picked up in the surveillance. Nunes gave conflicting answers about whether he believes that Trump’s personal communications were picked up in the surveillance sweep. At the beginning of the press conference he said Trump’s communications had been picked up incidentally. But when asked for more detail, Nunes said it was “possible” that Trump’s correspondence was picked up. “From what I know right now, it looks like incidental collection, we don’t know how exactly that was picked up,” he said, noting that the information he saw was collected after Trump’s election and before the inauguration. The information picked up by intelligence agencies was also disseminated through “raw intelligence reporting channels.” Despite the new information, Nunes maintained that there is no evidence yet that the Obama administration ordered a wiretap on Trump Tower, as Trump claimed on Twitter earlier this month. Nunes recently said that Trump’s claim should not have been taken “literally.” Do You Believe Congressman Devin Nunes?   Yes         No         Not Sure Yet        Completing this poll entitles you to Daily Caller news updates free of charge.

Nunes also said that he will be briefing the White House later on Wednesday about the new information. “They need to see it, if they don’t have it, they need to see it,” he told reporters. Asked by reporters how to characterize the surveillance, Nunes declined to say whether he believed it could be defined as spying. “I guess it all depends on the definition of ‘spying,” Nunes said. “I’m not going to get into legal definitions here, but clearly I have a concern.” Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Devin Nunes, Donald Trump Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant's purchase last week of Mobileye, which specializes in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. "A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns," said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. "Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location." The price was about 21 times Mobileye's expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix, an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York's Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded. Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defense tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signaled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. "It's an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies," said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung's Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as the "startup nation", Israel is maturing into a "scale-up nation", said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said. Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar's Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent. Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies "going the distance" by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. AUTOMOTIVE CENTRE Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. "All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources," said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. "If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product." With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised $681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been "making the pilgrimage" to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential acquirers "will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either," Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel's most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company's growth. "There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A," he said. Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centers in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D centers in Israel, including Intel. "Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level," he said. "It's a win-win for both companies."

Harshal Agrawal and Arsh Banerjee will bring their winning projects to Los Angeles in May to compete in the Intel Science and Engineering Fair as Hudson County delegates. Agrawal, of McNair, has been working on his project "Harmful Algae Bloom Prevention using Stropharia Mycofiltration" for two years. He began experimenting as an eighth grade student at Academy One Middle School. His early work done at the Jersey City reservoir in the Heights was "elementary testing" with mushrooms, he said. He plans to continue his research in two more phases. When asked how he felt when he received the call he was named a delegate, Agrawal said he was "speechless. "It's always been a dream to go to Intel," the sophomore said. The 59th annual expo was sponsored this year by Jersey City Medical Center in partnership with New Jersey City University. Other sponsors for this year's expo included Comcast, Liberty Savings Federal Credit Union, with support from PSE&G. Banerjee, of Bayonne High, developed a computer app that help diagnosis the Zika virus through a retinal scan. The freshman swimmer consulted with researchers in Brazil as part of his project. Though he's competed in the STEM showcase as a student at Nicholas Oresko School, winning the high school division as a freshman is "exciting," Banerjee said. He's now focused on preparing for May's international competition. "I'm basically going to present my project however I can," he said. At Bayonne High School on Wednesday morning, the nearly two dozen students who competed at the STEM Showcase were treated to a celebratory breakfast with their teachers and school officials. Cisco Espinosa, left, and Arsh Banerjee celebrate their Hudson County STEM Showcase gold medal wins at a breakfast at Bayonne High School. Caitlin Mota | The Jersey Journal   The school also recognized junior Cisco Espinosa, who earned a gold medal at the showcase for his research in ADHD. This is the third straight year Espinosa has won gold and is hoping to be only the second Bayonne student to win four in a row. Banerjee said Espinosa helped and supported him through the showcase this year. Teachers and administrators at both schools lauded their students' work. Jeremy Stanton, a chemistry instructor at McNair and Agrawal's research teacher, said he remembers judging the now sophomore's work when he was in elementary school. Agrawal, he said, spent long hours at school researching and enhancing his projects. "Harshal cares deeply and is motivated not just for the glory of prizes, but to innovate and make the world a better place than when he started his work," he said.  Science teachers at Bayonne High School said it's great to see the hard work their students have done get recognized on a prestige level.  "I think it really drives home a point that there is hidden potential in a lot of these kids," said Alex Kuziola, a biology teacher at Bayonne High School.  A full list of high school medalists will be published tomorrow.  TOMORROW: The STEM Showcase high school medalists FRIDAY: The STEM Showcase elementary/middle school medalists SATURDAY: The STEM Showcase special awards Caitlin Mota may be reached at cmota@jjournal.com.

Businesses are increasingly waking up to the insider threats that pose a risk to data and business security. A recent survey of security professionals conducted by Intel and McAfee found that internal individuals were responsible for 43% of all serious data breaches experienced by their businesses. Of these, just over half (22% of the total) were caused by intentional, malicious actors; the rest (21% of the total) were caused unintentionally. 68% of these breaches were serious enough to have a negative financial impact or require damaging public exposure. 68% of data breaches were serious enough to have a negative financial impact. Additionally, the 2015 U.S. State of Cybercrime Survey found that 45% of respondents believed the damage they received from insider attacks was more severe than those that originated outside the organization. Although a data leak caused by an inside threat has much the same effect as an outside hack – information ends up where it shouldn’t, and your business is subject to fines and remediation costs – the result can be worse. The perpetrators often have significant access and the ability and knowledge to do more damage to your business than outside attackers. In the case of employees with a personal grudge, they may also be more motivated. The other key difference between insider and outside threats comes in how you prepare for and prevent the threat. With almost half of all these threats caused accidentally, training and procedures take on a new importance in protecting your organization. Non-IT roles, such as HR and management, also have a bigger role to play, since the threats are employees and team members within your organization. Sometimes a threat will be averted by an eagle-eyed employee noticing odd behavior, rather than through examining server logs. What Threats Are You Up Against? Insider threats cover a broad range of different activities and can come from anyone in your organization. The crimes are not necessarily technologically sophisticated in nature and do not have to come from someone in your IT department: the cleaner who steals a laptop and sells your data can be just as damaging as the disgruntled IT professional who steals data from your servers. Broadly speaking, malicious attacks will fall into three categories: Theft of data – including customer data and intellectual property. Acts of sabotage – in which insiders misuse your own IT to hurt your business. Fraud – in which your data is modified, changed or stolen for that individual’s own profit – such as in the case of credit card fraud. Unintentional threats are similarly diverse: Losing physical records and equipment – including negligent behavior that results in them being stolen. Accidental disclosures – in which information is given to the wrong people, either by email, mail, or personal communication. Succumbing to social scams (phishing) – when access or information is gained by an outside individual under false pretenses. Protecting Your Business Against Insider Threats Most insider threats are preventable with the right training and procedures. This guide provides essential steps that will help prevent insider attacks in your organization. 1. Establish a Cross-Departmental Team Responsible for Implementing Your Insider Threat Security Policy Protecting your organization from insider threats goes far beyond your IT team, often requiring information and input from HR, Legal, IT, Data Owners, Security, and Senior Management. Organizations face two main challenges in this area. The first is the incorrect assumption that your IT team have total responsibility for data security when a cross-departmental effort is far more effective. The second is that many of departments hold information that could be useful for detecting and preventing insider attacks, but that information is stuck in silos and not shared. The solution is to form a team representing several departments who together share information and take responsibility for updating and implementing your insider threat security policy. The benefits of such a team are clear. Consider the following example: an employee’s behavior is brought to the attention of HR, who discover that he is under extreme financial hardship and stress due to his spouse’s recent job loss. The employee is in a position that enables them to access credit card information that could be either sold or used fraudulently, so the consequences of an attack are very high. In response, the insider threat team examines their current and past activity to ensure that there is no evidence of wrongdoing. Without a team sharing information, this risk may not have been uncovered. Of course, proper procedures must be put in place by HR and legal to ensure that confidentiality and privacy are assured – many potential risks will not develop into true threats. Action Points: Break down silos by creating a cross-departmental team responsible for responding to insider threats. Your team should ensure compliance with your security policies at all times and in all areas of the business. Provide a confidential system that allows whistleblowers to raise concerns. Work with HR and legal to protect the privacy and rights of any individuals suspected of being an insider threat. Prepare for future data leaks and put that plan into action should a threat materialize. Coordinate security training across the organization. 2. Work With HR to Reduce Risk Through Effective Training and Recruitment Insider threats are unique in that they are (intentionally or not) created by your co-workers. This makes your HR department a very important part of protecting your organization, as they are the team most likely to be informed if someone starts acting out of character or is experiencing personal circumstances that might make them a higher risk to your organization. This unique role played by HR can protect your business through the employee’s complete lifecycle at your business – during the hiring process, through their career, and during the leaving process. HR’s role begins during the hiring process when they should be using background checks to verify their identity and past employment (including for any competitors, which could increase the risk of corporate espionage), check their credit (money problems could increase the risk of fraudulent behavior), and check any criminal convictions. Once an employee has been hired, HR provides two main functions relating to data security. The first is to ensure, in conjunction with management and IT, that employees follow the security policy and are strongly encouraged to improve if they fall short. It is important that small breaches and bad habits are not overlooked since this will only encourage employees to continue to flout policy. The second function is to report on behavior that indicates an increased risk of becoming an insider threat. This behavior may be linked to an employee’s personal circumstances, their attitude towards work, or how they interact with their colleagues. Finally, HR has an important role to play in coordinating the transition of staff members from employment to post-employment and ensuring their access to secure data is removed. Depending on the circumstances of the employee leaving and the data they have access to, their permissions may need to be removed before the event occurs, to prevent any chance of an act of retribution. It is not uncommon for employees to be escorted by security to ensure the safety of the business. Action Points: Use the unique skills and knowledge of HR to spot and prevent insider threats. Use background checks and the interview process to check for possible signs a person may be a risky hire. Check local law before conducting background checks – you may be legally obligated to inform the interviewee that you are doing so. HR professionals must ensure that security policies are followed and bad habits are discouraged. Coordinate with IT to ensure post-employment employees do not pose a risk. 3. Don’t Forget Physical Security With so much emphasis put on protecting businesses against hacking it can be easy to forget that physical security is just as important for your information security as your firewalls and passwords. The information held on your servers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and USB drives are all easier to extract with physical access, and physical documents are particularly vulnerable. Physical security is made harder by the fact that most facilities are designed with functionality in mind, with security rarely being a design priority. Just because someone is employed doesn’t mean they should have physical access to every asset the company owns. Smart cards can provide access security, although as these can be hacked or cloned, they should not be your sole defense. CCTV and a well-trained staff team who know to look out for suspicious behavior will go a long way to preventing physical threats. Action Points: Ensure only appropriate employees have physical access to servers and computers holding valuable data. Use CCTV to protect sensitive areas. Provide employees with lockable filing cabinets for storing data and IP. Discourage employees from taking home unsecured USBs or documents that could be lost or stolen. 4. Consider Threats Across Your Entire Supply Chain An insider can be anyone who has access to your network or data and isn’t limited to your employees. Businesses are increasingly using contractors and forming close partnerships with other companies, opening whole new avenues for an insider attack. These and other business associates are a growing risk, especially because most will need some level of network access to perform their role adequately. Businesses must find a balance between quick onboarding and an appropriate level of security to reduce risk. Just as vitally, businesses must maintain a solid offboarding process, removing access to data once it is no longer needed. Many recent insider threats have been caused by former employees or contractors whose access privileges have not been revoked months or even years after they left. Security should also be a factor when choosing businesses to partner with. How safe are their systems? What safeguards do they have in place? Your security may be tight, but infiltrating a business you partner with may give a malicious individual the opportunity to damage your organization or steal your data. Action Points: Perform background checks and security checks on contractors, consultants, and business partners as you would on your own. Put processes in place to ensure secure onboarding and offboarding. Non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements will help you start the legal process in the event of a problem and discourage malicious individuals. During a merger, perform checks on acquired employees as if they were in your hiring process. 5. Catalog and Risk Assess Your Most Critical Assets With so many potential threats, securing your organization against insiders can seem like an impossible task, particularly for smaller businesses with fewer resources. Cataloging and risk assessing your critical assets is an essential task for any business and can help smaller ones focus on the biggest risks to their organization. Your most critical assets are those that if stolen or destroyed would have the biggest negative impact on your business’s ability to carry out essential functions. For most typical businesses, this is customer data or intellectual property such as proprietary software or processes. Action Points: Catalog your critical assets and the people who have access to them. Assign a risk level to each one according to how critical it is. Assign resources as appropriate to provide the business with the best possible protection (prioritizing if insufficient resources). Perform ongoing monitoring of your assets, adjusting risk level as necessary. Use your risk assessment to guide future spending on security. 6. Provide Regular Training For Employees Often when we discuss insider threats, it can make it sound like every employee is a potential threat. While that is theoretically true, the clear majority of employees want your business to succeed and would not dream of hurting the business – although they still might do so accidentally. Providing high-quality insider threat security training for your employees is one of the best ways to reduce your risk and help employees protect the business they work for. Not only will accidental threats – which make up almost half of all insider threats – be reduced, but you’ll also have your regular employees trained to watch for signs of malicious insiders. Anyone in your organization considering an inside attack may also think twice when they see how serious your business is about protecting its assets. Although it is unlikely that an employee will witness an insider attack first-hand, they may spot behavior that indicates an increased risk – an employee intentionally flouting security procedures, bragging about the data they could steal, or inappropriately using business resources to their own end. Action Points: Start training employees to spot insider attacks (including accidental ones). Educate employees about the financial and legal risks that insider threats pose. If resources are slim, prioritize teams with access to your critical assets, such as Finance. Create a security culture by beginning training during the onboarding process. Establish procedures for anonymous whistle-blowing. 7. Enforce Privileged Account Best Practice A large proportion of hacks stem from a malicious individual gaining access to a genuinely privileged account, which gives them access to some of your most sensitive information. In the case of an insider attack, that individual either already has their own account and chooses to misuse it, or gains access to a co-worker’s account. When an outsider accesses one of these privileged accounts the attack essentially becomes an inside attack – they are using your own tools and systems to fulfill their own objectives. The solution to both these cases is the diligent management of your privileged accounts. It is not uncommon for a business to have far more privileged accounts than necessary, many of them of no use. Often executives and other senior personnel are given privileged accounts despite not ever needing them in their daily job. When asked, many businesses may not even be unable to identify all their accounts. Privilege creep is another serious issue: when a long-term employee picks up more and more privileges as they move around the organization, without losing those that are no longer relevant. Should these employees become malicious, the damage they can do is significant because of their broad access to your systems. Unless these accounts are identified, controlled, and tracked they could be used at any time to access, steal, or destroy your business’s most critical data. Action Points: Use PAM software to track all your privileged accounts. Regularly audit accounts and remove privileges when no longer needed. Give new users the least privileges necessary to perform their role. Monitor privileged accounts for unusual behavior. 8. Monitor and Compare Behavior Against “Normal” Insider threats abuse their everyday workplace privileges in ways they shouldn’t and wouldn’t normally if they are just doing their job. By tracking behavior, particularly of digital accounts, and establishing a “normal” pattern, system admins can spot and investigate unusual behavior. With the right software, this isn’t hard. You can track how each device and user interacts with others, establish a pattern, and then spot anomalies. During a normal period of work a workstation will interact with only a few other devices – domain controller, print server, email server, etc. – and users will be using a select few devices, from specific locations, at quite regular times. But logging this information is not enough: you need to use it in real-time. By the time you’ve analyzed the data, the individual concerned could have caused significant damage. This is possible with the latest technology, utilizing machine learning to make automatic decisions to block or limit access for users according to circumstance and predefined rules. For example, a contractor may be automatically blocked from accessing all but the most basic of services when connecting from outside the office, or at a time outside their normal work hours. This granular access management is the best way to maximize both security and usability for your system. Action Points: Use granular access management to govern access to your system. Fine-tune access according to individual roles, locations, and more so that unusual behavior is flagged and blocked. Track behavior for evidence in legal and disciplinary proceedings.

Posted 23 Mar 2017 00:30 The logo Israeli driverless technology firm Mobileye is seen on the building of their offices in Jerusalem March 13, 2017. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A TEL AVIV: Intel's US$15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector's other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to US$2.9 billion in 2016 from US$2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant's purchase last week of Mobileye, which specialises in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. "A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns," said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. "Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location." The price was about 21 times Mobileye's expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry's three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for US$1.15 billion. That same year, Wix, an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York's Nasdaq, raising US$127 million seven years after the company was founded. Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost US$18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defence tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signalled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. "It's an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies," said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised US$30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung's Catalyst Fund, bringing to US$70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as the "startup nation", Israel is maturing into a "scale-up nation", said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said. Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar's Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent. Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies "going the distance" by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. AUTOMOTIVE CENTRE Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. "All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources," said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. "If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product." With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing centre for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised US$681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been "making the pilgrimage" to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential acquirers "will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either," Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised US$30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel's most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company's growth. "There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A," he said. Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centres in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D centres in Israel, including Intel. "Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level," he said. "It's a win-win for both companies."

I would assume just a proof of purchase thing since it would be not worth it to send back your old hardware just to some a few bucks back or a slight savings on new hardware. I probably answered my own question but was not 100% on it. If it was a send the old hardware in kind of thing that would be a loss since I do the hand me down type thing with my older stuff when I get new stuff. Even then where ever the old hardware ends up is still better than what 90% of the people have in their retail store bought system’s lol.

Lelisevis I don’t know, when I last checked the rebate just took the price down to about the same as everyone else was charging for similar spec GPU’s.

That page revealed five AM4 motherboards in total; two based upon the X370 chipset, and three on the B350. Now MSI has detailed seven new AM4 motherboards for your delectation, making it twelve AM4 motherboards in total from the firm. Furthermore, MSI has revealed a convenient DDR4 memory timing feature, dubbed A-XMP, which will be coming to all its AM4 motherboards in BIOS updates. The existing and new* motherboards can be checked out but clicking through the links in the bullet point product list below. Hint: if you are interested in Micro-ATX AM4 motherboards you will find they are named with an 'M' suffix behind the model number, otherwise they are full ATX boards. Currently MSI is only making Micro-ATX form factor motherboards with the B350 chipset.

Intel XMP lets you to load optimised tested memory OC profiles via your OS or BIOS. It simply allows your Intel motherboard based memory subsystem to work at the top claimed speeds with RAM kits from memory makers - without any hassle. MSI's A-XMP basically does the same as Intel XMP but for AMD AM4 motherboard based systems. It is described by the firm as the "world’s first 1-second DDR4 performance and stability feature". Single-click memory timings and speeds are set in the MSI 'Click BIOS utility, as shown above. The MSI A-XMP feature will be rolled out "soon" and be activated via BIOS updates for the full range of MSI AM4 motherboards.

Herbert Mensah was rumored to continue from where Mr Odotei Sowah left off but the football administrator has categorically denied those claims. “The world of football is fantastic, full of action and stories and rumours as well,” he said “I received a call that I am making a return to football in a big way- that I am joining Hearts of Oak but I told the person that I am not. “Definitely I am not joining Hearts, I think Hearts is a great club and that they have a future which the owner will determine which way to go.” Herbert Mensah is currently the President of the Ghana Rugby Association and has pledged his support to the new GOC President, Ben Nunoo Mensah.   TAGS hearts Herbert job mensah rules SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet ghanamma RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Persistent injuries had Asamoah Gyan considering retirement Maxwell Konadu rejects reports of Kotoko offer Ghana League Cypher: The final case for Samuel Sukah before his crucifixion Vardy Gets Death Threats …Over  Ranieri Sacking Ministry Indiscipline, Cause Of NSA Debt Isaac Opeele tips Randy Abbey for Hearts job LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Log in to leave a comment EVEN MORE NEWS NDC Was More Divided Than NPP Ahead Of 2016 Polls- Yaw...

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware  ⋮  Leak AMD Ryzen 4 Core / 8 Thread ‘Raven Ridge’ First Performance Numbers Leaked – Comparable Performance To Intel Core i5 6600 In Fritz Chess Benchmark By Usman Pirzada Mar 21, 2017 358Shares Share Tweet Submit I have something rather interesting today: what appears to be the first benchmark of the AMD Raven Ridge 4 core/ 8 thread configuration as well as an x86 name we rarely hear: VIA, or more accurately in this case, Zhaoxin. The benchmarks in question were actually published on the official Zhaoxin page but have since been removed (not before we got a copy of them though). Since the benchmark is from the company’s official page, there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of this leak. Zhaoxin rolls out competitive x86 lineup on the 28nm and 16nm node – pits them against unreleased AMD Raven Ridge 4 core 8 thread APU This particular leak is actually about the Raven Ridge platform, which is basically a Zen 4 core / 8 thread configuration APU with a Vega GPU side. That said, the performance of this chip would be pretty similar to the Ryzen 4C 8T counterpart (at same clocks), so it is a fairly accurate metric to get an estimate from. The benchmark however, isn’t the best choice and represents a very very limited sample size and leaves a lot to be desired. That said, beggars cannot be choosers and without any further ado, here is the exclusive first look at AMD’s Raven Ridge platform (as well as some mighty powerful competitors from Zhaoxin, lets not forget about the impressive underdog!): Related AMD Pinnacle Ridge CPUs and Raven Ridge APUs Detailed – High-Performance Pinnacle Ridge To Feature 8 Zen 2 Cores, Raven Ridge Comes With 4 Zen and 11 Vega GPU Cores   While the color key is hard to read, the CPUs are listed in the order that they appear which makes it easy to figure out which bar belongs to which CPU. The benchmark image is of a very low quality and the color codes are hard to distinguish so I have taken the liberty of transcribing them onto the table below. As you can see, the Raven Ridge counterpart offers performance that (in Fritz Chess benchmark at the very least) is on par with Intel’s Core i5 6600 offering. What is perhaps even more impressive, is that the Zhaoxin ZX-E 8 core processor is well within the same tier of performance (and fabricated at a comparable 16nm FinFET node at that!)

Of course, you should never take a single data point to be representative of the entire sample space but it goes without saying that the first real benchmark does give us a very solid idea about what kind of performance range we can expect from these processors. Unfortunately however, the company did not mention the clock speed the Raven Ridge APU was running at (probably because it was under NDA) which would have allowed us to further narrow down the kind of performance we can expect depending on the core clock of this engineering sample. Let’s also talk a bit about the Zhaoxin processors in these benchmarks. There are 4 different flavors here, the Zhaoxin ZX-C, ZX-D and ZX-E categories. The ZX-D category is further divided into a 4 core and an 8 core tier. To my knowledge, Zhaoxin processors do not employ any kind of SMT so the core count should be equal to the thread count. As I mentioned however, the company has come a very long way. Their 8-core is now actually offering competitive performance to Intel and AMD counterparts – which was unheard of in the recent past. This is something that can only be good for competition. Related NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080 Ti Reviews Are Out – Blazing Fast 4K 60 AAA Performance, 1600 MHz OC Benchmarks and More Now the current processors are actually a mutual collaboration between Zhaoxin and VIA and are supposed to bring competitive x86 performance to the Chinese market. VIA was granted the x86 license by Intel for a period of 10 years in 2003, during which it could make x86 based processors and sell them. However, while that period expired in 2013, Intel had also included a 3 year grace period during which negotiations to renew the contract could be had. Anyone without a math handicap would notice that this grace period expired in 2016. The current status of the licensing agreement between VIA and Intel is not known but if VIA is helping Zhaoxin roll out x86 processors then either the former has renewed its license or the latter has received a new one from Intel. Previously, VIA’s (technically, Centaur Technology’s) processors have been at the 28nm process – but this particular gem is actually based on TSMC’s 16nm FinFET node. It features up to 8 cores on a single die and is probably based on a custom derivative of VIA Isaiah by Zhaoxin. It supports all instruction sets upto AVX 2.0 and should be able to handle just about any modern application you care to throw at it. Its worth mentioning that currently VIA does not list the processor on its website.

The world's largest chipmaker agreed to pay $15 billion for Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV, a maker of semiconductors and software for driverless cars – the most ever paid for an Israeli tech firm. The deal comes after economists including Modi Shafrir at Mizrahi Tefahot Bank said Israel’s unexpected 6.5 percent fourth quarter expansion – the fastest pace in at least ten years – was in part driven by Intel’s $6 billion renovation of its plant at Kiryat Gat in southern Israel. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, employs 10,000 people in Israel – the most among the country’s largest exporters. Next-ranked Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, has close to 7,000 staff in the country. While other global tech giants including Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. have research and development centers in Israel, their investments pale in comparison to Intel’s. The company exported products worth $3.35 billion from Israel last year, or nearly a tenth of the high-tech sector’s overseas sales. Although it's difficult to quantify, Intel’s influence goes beyond exports and direct employment, according to Rafael Gozlan, chief economist at Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. Former Intel workers are also using their experience to start their own tech businesses, he said, and the Mobileye deal could give the finance ministry extra room to cut taxes. All of this should be good news for the government, who said in a report last year that the tech industry that had fueled Israel’s economy for the past two decades was stagnating. Though it grew faster than gross domestic product nearly every year between 1998 and 2009, in the five years following it surpassed national growth only once, in 2012. “Intel's impact is significant in terms of growth,” Gozlan said. “Aside from its traditional chipmaking operations, you have to account for its contribution to the tech industry and to startups. It's true of other major companies of the world like Google and Facebook, who also have R&D centers in Israel. But the scope of Intel's investments is on a different level.”  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

News & Analysis Samsung Edges TSMC in 10 nm Alan Patterson 3/22/2017 00:01 AM EDT 4 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet INDIANAPOLIS — Samsung appears to be about a quarter ahead of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) with the ramp of 10-nm process technology, according to a veteran chip analyst. Earlier this year, Samsung and TSMC said that they would launch 10-nm foundry services during the second quarter this year for customers such as Qualcomm, Mediatek, and Huawei’s semiconductor subsidiary, HiSilicon. Somewhat ahead of schedule, Samsung last week announced that it has shipped 70,000 wafers of 10-nm LPE (low-power early) chips, independent analyst Andrew Lu noted in a report for intelligence provider Smartkarma. “The 10-nm schedule for Samsung seems to be ahead of TSMC's 10-nm ramp-up for MediaTek (after numerous design-win cancellations by MediaTek's 10-nm customers) and Huawei/HiSilicon,” Lu said in the report. Previously, it was widely believed that TSMC was ahead of the competition, according to Lu. Samsung and TSMC are several quarters ahead of Intel, which will do 10-nm foundry work for Altera/Intel, Netronome, and LG Electronics, according to Lu. Samsung, TSMC, and Intel are in a three-way race to garner profits from the leading-edge technology. Samsung is using the 10-nm process to make its own Exynos 8895 SoC as well as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. Assuming that the Exynos 8895 and the Snapdragon 835, with die sizes of about 150 square millimeters, have reached a yield rate of 70%, Lu said that Samsung should have shipped 19.2 million 10-nm SoCs in the year to date and is likely to start selling the Galaxy S8 before the end of May this year. The Galaxy S8 will be Samsung’s first major smartphone following the recall of the disastrous Galaxy S7, which was plagued by exploding batteries last year. The Galaxy S8 may be released as early as March 29th, according to media reports. Plugging the Gaps Samsung Electronics has also announced the addition of 8-nm and 6-nm process technologies to its current roadmap for 10 nm and 7 nm. Samsung's 8 nm and 6 nm will cut off TSMC's mid-node lead, Lu said. Unlike other foundries, TSMC has often introduced mid-node technology like 12 nm in between 10/16 nm and 22 nm between 20/28 nm to gain a competitive edge in performance and cost. Samsung’s introduction of mid-node technology leaves less room for TSMC to gain a competitive edge, Lu said. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times. He is based in Taiwan.

Also, Samsung has nothing to match TSMC's 22nm, or 12nm, which would give TSMC the edge.  "Assuming that the Exynos 8895 and the Snapdragon 835, with die sizes of about 150 square millimeters, have reached a yield rate of 70%, Lu said that Samsung should have shipped 19.2 million 10-nm SoCs" A 70% yield is way too low for a foundry to go into production (should be 90%+). This leads me to believe that Lu's back-of-napkin calculations are wrong.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Other 10nm resistion   3/22/2017 9:33:40 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate It also needs to be pointed out that there are other 10nm versions coming up, 10LPP and 10LPU, maybe those will be the ones that actually win the real orders.

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) is not the least bit satisfied with Director Comey’s appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. x My takeaways: Donald Trump is a liar & the FBI Director still has no credibility. He needs to also explain HIS interference in the election.Ã¢ÂÂ Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) March 21, 2017 Waters released a scorching statement demanding answers from Director Comey about why he chose to release a letter about Hillary Clinton’s email, that contained ZERO new information about her email and did not utter one word about the FBI’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. It’s a fair question and the American people deserve answers. In her statement below, she also blasted the conduct of House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes and Republicans in the hearing yesterday, saying they demonstrated they "cannot be trusted to investigate.” Read every word: I think the American people now understand one reason why I believe FBI Director Comey has no credibility and why I’ve said that we need an independent commission to uncover the truth. Today, in publicly confirming the FBI is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the Kremlin’s possible coordination with individuals associated with the Trump campaign, Director Comey also disclosed that the investigation has been ongoing since July 2016. Director Comey needs to answer one question: If he had information about the extent of Russia’s efforts to hack Donald Trump’s political opponents last July, why would he effectively advance their efforts by releasing a letter confirming a review of “newly uncovered” Clinton emails from an unrelated investigation in October that turned out to reveal no new information? Why did special circumstances in that instance warrant the FBI Director publicly commenting on Clinton emails but not the fact that Russia was waging an attack on our democracy, possibly in coordination with individuals associated with the Trump campaign? I believe that Director Comey bears some responsibility, along with the Russians, in adding to the confusion and misinformation campaign that led to the election of Donald Trump. Now, Director Comey presides over an FBI under a Department of Justice headed by an Attorney General who lied under oath, and both serve under a President who has shown he will stop at nothing to obstruct and distract from any credible investigations of his campaign’s ties to Russia. Even more troubling, based on the House Intels Republicans’ exclusive focus during today’s hearings on the leaks and not the Russian cyberattacks, it is clear to me that the House Intelligence Committee under the leadership of Chairman Nunes cannot be trusted to thoroughly investigate this matter. In fact, the Republicans’ questioning was more in line with President Trump’s incendiary tweets than the actual intelligence the members received from the public servants charged with ensuring our national security. Republicans must remember that Russia is not our ally and they better believe that the Russians and Putin would order a cyberattack on Republicans if it suited their geopolitical goals. Given the political motivations driving the White House and Republicans in Congress, we need a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the Russian interference in our election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.  Bravo, Maxine Waters! Keep persisting. The American people deserve the truth. The whole truth and nothing but the truth.  191 Comments Share this article 403 403 403 191 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Five people were killed, including the assailant, and 40 others were injured in what Prime Minister Theresa May condemned as a "sick and depraved terrorist attack." Lawmakers, lords, staff and visitors were locked down after the man was shot by police within the perimeter of Parliament, just yards (meters) from entrances to the building itself and in the shadow of the iconic Big Ben clock tower. He died, as did three pedestrians on the bridge, and the police officer. A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had "catastrophic" injuries. Three police officers, several French teenagers on a school trip, two Romanian tourists and five South Korean visitors were among the injured. Police said they were treating the attack as terrorism. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley said police believed there was only one attacker, "but it would be foolish to be overconfident early on." He said an unarmed policeman, three civilians and the attacker died. Forty others, including three police officers, were injured. ___ AP Exclusive: Before Trump job, Manafort worked to aid Putin WASHINGTON (AP) — Before signing up with Donald Trump, former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly worked for a Russian billionaire with a plan to "greatly benefit the Putin Government," The Associated Press has learned. The White House attempted to brush the report aside Wednesday, but it quickly raised fresh alarms in Congress about Russian links to Trump associates. Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to benefit President Vladimir Putin's government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. "We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success," Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, "will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that President Trump had not been aware of Manafort's work on behalf of Deripaska. ___ Manafort has served top US pols and a sketchy cast abroad WASHINGTON (AP) — Pick any decade over the past half-century, and Paul Manafort has had a starring role in the rise (and maybe fall) of somebody big. This lobbyist/political operative/hired gun has been there for prominent American politicians including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, George H.W. Bush and, more recently, Donald Trump. He's also been at the service of a global cast of sketchier characters like Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos, Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and, more recently, leaders of Ukraine's ruling pro-Russian political party. Manafort, 67, was fired as Trump's campaign chairman in August after word surfaced that he had orchestrated a covert lobbying operation on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. The Associated Press reported Wednesday that Manafort also represented a Russian billionaire a decade ago with the goal of advancing the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The latest disclosure adds new intrigue as the FBI investigates whether Russia attempted to influence last year's U.S. presidential election in favor of Trump, and whether the Trump campaign cooperated in such an endeavor. ___ Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe WASHINGTON (AP) — Private communications of Donald Trump and his presidential transition team may have been scooped up by American intelligence officials monitoring other targets and improperly distributed throughout spy agencies, the chairman of the House intelligence committee said Wednesday — an extraordinary public airing of often-secret information that brought swift protests from Democrats. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes' comments led the committee's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, to renew his party's calls for an independent probe of Trump campaign links to Russia in addition to the GOP-led panel's investigation. Schiff also said he had seen "more than circumstantial evidence" that Trump associates colluded with Russia. In back-to-back news conferences at the Capitol and then the White House — where he had privately briefed the president — Nunes said he was concerned by officials' handling of the communications in the waning days of the Obama administration. He said the surveillance was conducted legally and did not appear to be related to the current FBI investigation into Trump associates' contacts with Russia or with any criminal warrants. And the revelations, he said, did nothing to change his assessment that Trump's explosive allegations about wiretaps at Trump Tower were false. Still, the White House immediately seized on his statements in what appeared to be a coordinated public display. ___ Gorsuch to Democrats: No return to 'horse and buggy' era WASHINGTON (AP) — Assured of support from majority Republicans, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch wrapped up two days of Senate questioning Wednesday to glowing GOP reviews but complaints from frustrated Democrats that he concealed his views from the American public. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, refused repeated attempts to get him to talk about key legal and political issues of the day. But he did tell Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who worried that Gorsuch would vote to restrict abortion, that "no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days." The Supreme Court itself threw one surprise Gorsuch's way when it ruled unanimously Wednesday in a case involving learning-disabled students, overturning a standard for special education that Gorsuch had endorsed in an earlier case on the same topic. The decision prompted sharp questioning from committee Democrats in the second of two days of testimony that spanned 20 hours. "Why in your early decision did you want to lower the bar so low?" Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois asked. ___ Facebook rape stirs questions about witnessing crimes online CHICAGO (AP) — The case of a 15-year-old Chicago girl who authorities say was raped while around 40 people watched on Facebook raises questions that have come up before in other attacks: What's the obligation of bystanders who see a crime unfolding? And why do they not intervene? None of those who watched the sexual assault involving five or six men or boys called police. The girl knows at least one of her attackers, and investigators reported making good progress toward identifying the others. A closer look at what laws in the United States say about people who witness crimes: ___ THE LAW IN GENERAL There is no all-encompassing legal obligation in the United States that a bystander who sees an act of violence must intervene or call police. But there are exceptions to that idea, dubbed the no-duty rule. Many states have laws requiring intervention when the victim of an ongoing attack is a child. The relationship of the witness to the victim is also a factor in assessing criminal or civil liability: Bosses may have a duty to intervene on behalf of employees, teachers for students and spouses for spouses. ___ Leaders need votes for health bill on eve of House showdown WASHINGTON (AP) — The top Republican legislative priority in peril, President Donald Trump dangled possible changes to the health care bill Wednesday aimed at placating conservatives threatening to torpedo the legislation. The White House seemed to make progress after GOP opposition had snowballed a day before a showdown House vote. Trump huddled at the White House with 18 lawmakers, a mix of supporters and opponents, Vice President Mike Pence saw around two dozen and House GOP leaders held countless talks with lawmakers at the Capitol. The sessions came as leaders rummaged for votes on a roll call they can ill-afford to lose without diminishing their clout for the rest of the GOP agenda. Most GOP opponents were conservatives asserting that the legislation demolishing former President Barack Obama's health care law did not go far enough. They were demanding repeal of the law's requirements that insurers pay for specified services like maternity care, prescription drugs and substances abuse treatment. Late Wednesday night, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., met with moderate Republicans from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maine and New York as well as members of leadership. Any changes on essential health benefits would likely trigger an immediate backlash from patient advocacy groups and doctors. In early meetings with Trump and Pence and later discussions with the White House, talks focused on language addressing conservatives' concerns that those coverage requirements drive up premiums. Details were unclear, but members of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-line group spearheading the opposition, were expected at the White House early Thursday. ___ Police: White sword killer went to NY to attack black people NEW YORK (AP) — A white U.S. Army veteran from Baltimore bent on making a racist attack took a bus to New York, the "media capital of the world," randomly picked out a black man who was collecting bottles on the street and killed him with a sword, police said Wednesday. James Harris Jackson turned himself in at a Times Square police station early Wednesday, about 25 hours after Timothy Caughman staggered into a police precinct bleeding to death. "I'm the person that you're looking for," Jackson told police, according to Assistant Chief William Aubrey. Jackson, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, told police he'd harbored feelings of hatred toward black men for at least 10 years, authorities said. He traveled to New York on March 17 and had been staying in a Manhattan hotel. "The reason he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement," Aubrey said. ___ LAPD: Latinos report fewer sex crimes amid immigration fears LOS ANGELES (AP) — The police chief of Los Angeles, a city that is half Latino, found himself in the middle of the national immigration debate on Wednesday after saying there's a correlation between the Trump administration's call for stiffer immigration policies and a drop in the number of Hispanics reporting sexual abuse and domestic violence. "Imagine your sister, your mother, not reporting a sexual assault for fear that their family will be torn apart," LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday. Since the beginning of this year, sexual assaults reported by Latinos in Los Angeles have dropped 25 percent, and domestic violence reports by Latinos have decreased by 10 percent compared to the same period last year. Crime statistics show there were 164 sexual assaults reported by Latinos in the first two months of 2016, compared to 123 in the first two months of 2017. There was also a decrease of 118 reports of domestic violence during the same periods among Latinos. Beck said there was a "strong correlation" between the timing of the decreased reporting and fears about President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S. ___ Serial numbers, game photos may help verify Brady jerseys BOSTON (AP) — Now that authorities believe they have recovered the jersey stolen from Tom Brady's locker following the Patriots' Super Bowl win last month, the next step will be determining whether it is in fact the MVP quarterback's missing grass-stained garment. So how exactly does that happen? Old-fashioned detective work. Experts in the sports memorabilia industry, including one that has worked directly with NFL teams, say it is a tedious process that involves comparing photos and videos that captured degradation to the jersey during the game. They also compare the jersey to team-issued serial numbers and other player-specific customizations that authentic jerseys typically have. "Every jersey is like a fingerprint. No two jerseys are alike," said Barry Meisel, president of the MeiGray Group, which has authenticated game-worn sports memorabilia since 1997. "They're hand-stitched, full of dirt, mud, helmet stains, turf skids and burns. When you look at jersey after a game it's unique."

ADVERTISEMENT In nearly 20 hours of grilling over the course of two days, Gorsuch declined to answer questions on issues ranging from the Second Amendment, to President Trump’s authority to defy congressional bans on warrantless wiretapping and enhanced interrogation, to whether the constitutional ban on accepting gifts from foreign powers would apply to the president’s real-estate empire. The strategy left Senate Democrats frustrated as they repeatedly failed to draw out answers on hot-button political issues. But Gorsuch’s strategy may backfire — Democrats are beginning to point to his lack of candor and transparency as a potential reason to filibuster his nomination. “He looked like he was playing dodgeball with the Senate Judiciary Committee, bending over backwards to avoid revealing anything that might constitute a judicial philosophy or give hints about how he’d approach the legal issues of our day,” Senate Democratic Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerWhat the GOP’s plan to kill essential health benefits means Freedom Caucus, Trump reach 'agreement in principle' on healthcare Gorsuch hearings: A referendum on Originalism and corporate power MORE (N.Y.) said from the floor Wednesday. While Supreme Court nominees going back to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 have drawn a line against sharing personal views on legal issues to avoid the appearance of prejudice in future cases, Gorsuch took it to a new level this week. Supreme Court nominees have become increasingly cautious in their testimony to the Senate since Robert Bork’s unguarded and candid remarks before the Judiciary Committee helped sink his nomination in 1987. Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to set a new standard for blandness 11 years ago that Gorsuch now seems to have surpassed.  He refused to comment on his personal views of three landmark cases: Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned school segregation; Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right of married couples to use contraception; and Eisenstadt v. Baird, which established the right of unmarried couples to use contraception. When Sen.

Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) asked Roberts whether he agreed with the court’s conclusion in that case, Roberts unequivocally responded, “I do.” And in 2010, Elena Kagan, a nominee under President Obama, warmly embraced the Brown v. Board of Education decision. “I hope and I know that the principles of Brown v. Board are still relevant today,” Kagan told the Judiciary panel at the time. “The idea of equality under law is a fundamental American constitutional value.” Blumenthal continued to press Gorsuch during a second round of questioning Wednesday on the landmark desegregation decision, demanding to know, “Why will you not say you agree with the result?” Gorsuch finally relented, saying, “We’re on the same page on Brown v. Board of Education, senator. It’s a great and important decision.” He also criticized the court’s 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the doctrine of “separate but equal” and was overturned by Brown, as “a dark, dark stain” on the court’s history. Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne FeinsteinGorsuch rewrites playbook for confirmation hearings Live coverage: Day three of Supreme Court nominee hearing Dems land few punches on Gorsuch MORE (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she doesn’t understand why Gorsuch would criticize Plessy but not endorse Brown, labeling him less forthcoming than other recent nominees. “You can carry that too far,” she warned. She argued that speaking about his judicial philosophy “would help people understand that he is open for the ability for growth to happen in the law.” At least one Republican said he, too, wanted Gorsuch to share his thoughts on specific cases.  “Some have criticized my friends on the other side for asking you how you would rule in specific cases, and I don’t think that’s an appropriate question,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said. “But if I’m going to be honest, I have to say I’d love to know the answer to that, too, because we live in a real world.”  Kennedy said a number of his constituents voted for Trump because of the type of judge he promised to name to the Supreme Court. If Gorsuch is confirmed and starts siding with the more liberal members of the court, Kennedy said those voters won’t be pleased. “I don’t want the fact that I’m still asking you questions to be misunderstood, but this is a big deal,” he said.  Other Republicans, however, said Democrats were demanding answers from Gorsuch that they did not seek from nominees of past Democratic presidents. The Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group running a $10 million advertising campaign in support of Gorsuch, seized on that and has launched a video highlighting 70 times Ginsburg, who was nominated by President Clinton, declined to answer questions. Panel Republicans argued that it would be wholly improper for Gorsuch to reveal any personal views. “If we’re going to vote against a nominee because they won’t tell us things that we want to hear about issues important to us, then the whole nominating process has become a joke,” Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey GrahamGorsuch rewrites playbook for confirmation hearings Dem senator: House Intel chairman may have revealed classified info The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE (R-S.C.) argued. But Gorsuch’s strategy may become a liability with Democrats as Republican leaders try to round up the needed votes. Senate Democratic Whip Dick DurbinDick DurbinGorsuch rewrites playbook for confirmation hearings Gorsuch: I'm 'sorry' for ruling against autistic student Mattis on defense budget boost: 'America can afford survival' MORE (Ill.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, told CNN on Wednesday that “we have no idea where Judge Gorsuch is on Roe v. Wade, on women’s healthcare and critical issues.” When asked if he agreed with the result of Griswold and Eisenstadt, Gorsuch said those cases have “been settled for 50 years” and he did not “see a realistic possibility that a state would pass a law attempting to undo that.” But when asked simply if he agrees with the results, Gorsuch would only say: “I give you the same answer.” But a decade ago, Roberts said he agreed with the court’s conclusion in Griswold. And Justice Samuel Alito similarly told the Judiciary Committee that there is a constitutional basis for the finding in Griswold and explained he felt “an ability to comment” because the right to contraception was unlikely to be relitigated. Alito plainly said 10 years ago, “I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt.” Gorsuch further declined to personally embrace the ruling in Lawrence v. Texas that struck down laws that made sex between gay couples illegal, only acknowledging it as “the precedent of the United States Supreme Court.” Blumenthal said those answers leave doubt in a lot of minds. “Your declining to be more direct and give the same answer about these cases as you did Brown leaves doubt in the minds of millions of Americans that rely on privacy rights,” he warned. Gorsuch argued that stating agreement with even a widely accepted decision would trample on his impartiality as a judge. “My personal views have nothing to do with my job as a judge,” he said, his voice rising as he debated with Blumenthal. “I’ve drawn a line that I think is required of a good judge to be fair and respect the separation of powers,” he added.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) said he had learned from a source that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally collected information on members of Trump’s transition team and then “widely disseminated” the information internally. ADVERTISEMENT Democrats on the committee were blindsided, as were many Republicans. By the end of the day Wednesday, Nunes was still the only committee member to have seen the intelligence in question, according to the committee’s top Democrat. The move outraged Democrats and threatened to plunge the committee into open partisan warfare. “The unprecedented comments of Chairman Nunes are an act of diversion and desperation,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement. “The Chairman’s highly irregular conduct with the White House raises serious questions about his impartiality, especially given his history as part of the Trump Transition team. “Chairman Nunes is deeply compromised, and he cannot possibly lead an honest investigation.” Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team’s executive committee and has in the past raised eyebrows with his apparent willingness to follow White House requests. In February, Nunes agreed to a White House request to call a reporter to dispute a report that the FBI had uncovered contact between Russian officials and the president’s campaign. He had already made a similar statement publicly. Nunes defended his decision to go directly to the president with the information because “what I saw has nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with the Russia investigation.” “It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities, and the president needs to know that these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that,” Nunes said. But alleged surveillance of the Trump campaign became part of the committee’s investigation after the president’s claim early this month that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower — making Nunes’s decision to cut out members of his own committee unusual. Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffIntelligence chairman sparks storm with Trump briefing FBI has info suggesting coordination between Trump aides, Russia: report Overnight Cybersecurity: House Intel chair says surveillance collected on Trump transition team MORE (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said Nunes’s action “impedes our ability to do this investigation the way we should.”  “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or if he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House — because he cannot do both,” Schiff said. “If the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman,” MSNBC host Joe Scarborough tweeted. The exact nature of Nunes’s pronouncement remains unclear. Yet it closely tracks with the longstanding contention of Republicans that the “real story” when it comes to the Russia investigation is the “unmasking” of individuals caught in surveillance and the leaks of sensitive information to the press. Nunes, who described himself as “alarmed” by what he had learned, said that the collection had been perfectly legal — but raised questions about who requested that the names of Trump associates be “unmasked.” Under U.S. surveillance law, intelligence agencies may legally use information gathered on Americans as long as it is intercepted “incidentally” — meaning that the U.S. person is not the target of the surveillance.  But personally identifying information is supposed to be hidden to protect the identities of U.S persons, unless officials request that those names be exposed internally.   During a marathon public hearing Monday on the Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, Republicans repeatedly pressed FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers on who has that authority. In one exchange, Rep. Trey GowdyTrey GowdyIntelligence chairman sparks storm with Trump briefing FBI Director Comey hearing a dud for Democrats THE MEMO: Five takeaways from Comey’s big day MORE (R-S.C.) ran through a list of senior Obama administration officials, demanding to know if they had access to unmasked names — appearing to suggest that they may have been the source of media leaks about the Trump campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. Democrats have tolerated the Republican focus on leaks — but that patience may be short-lived after Wednesday. Last week, Nunes and Schiff together said that they were pressing the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency for information on Trump associates who may have been incidentally spied on and whose names were later unmasked and the intelligence details leaked to the media — such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But on Wednesday afternoon, committee member Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) called Nunes’s announcement “political theater.” Some committee Republicans backed the beleaguered chair. Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) told reporters that the discovery “raises very serious questions” about the unmasking and dissemination of names. According to Nunes, the intercepted communications had “little or no apparent foreign intelligence value” and had nothing to do with either Russia or the FBI’s eight-month-old probe into coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both Nunes and Schiff maintained that the discovery — whatever it entails — does not substantiate the president’s claim that Obama wiretapped him.  Trump said Wednesday that he felt “somewhat vindicated” by Nunes’s statement.  The White House has tried to argue that Trump meant “wiretap” as in surveillance generally, though Republicans and Democrats have largely rejected that assertion. Comey on Monday rebutted those claims, part of a one-two blow to the White House that day. He also confirmed the FBI’s investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.  The timing of Nunes’s announcement did not escape Democrats.  “I’m not sure what the point of this extraordinary process is and I have to hope this is not a part of a broader campaign by the White House aimed to deflect from the director’s testimony earlier this week,” Schiff said.

Devin Nunes: WATCH PreviousPrevious StoryTrump Has a ‘Shadow Government’ of Appointees to Watch Cabinet Officials NextNext StoryBlondie Releases ‘Long Time’, Written by Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes: LISTEN by Andy Towle March 22, 2017 | 8:34pm Share176 Comments The FBI is getting a clearer picture of information that indicates that associates of Donald Trump coordinated with Russian during the 2016 campaign, CNN reports: This is partly what FBI Director James Comey was referring to when he made a bombshell announcement Monday before Congress that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, according to one source. The FBI is now reviewing that information, which includes human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings, according to those U.S. officials. The information is raising the suspicions of FBI counterintelligence investigators that the coordination may have taken place, though officials cautioned that the information was not conclusive and that the investigation is ongoing. Rep. Adam Schiff this afternoon told Chuck Todd this afternoon that the case was now “more than circumstantial:” “I can tell you that the case is more than that. And I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now. I don’t want to go into specifics, but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of investigation. So that is what we ought to do.” Schiff on collusion btw Trump associates and Russians: "I can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now" pic.twitter.com/JvPv74ROiM — David Mack (@davidmackau) March 22, 2017 Schiff’s remarks came after a whirlwind afternoon during which his counterpart, House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes took information directly to Donald Trump — the subject of the investigation — which should have been shared with members of the intelligence committee first. Nunes then held a breathless press conference about what he did: Nunes’s shocking action shows that a credible non-partisan investigation into the connections between Trump and Russia is impossible and reveals that Nunes’s motives are purely political. Many are today reiterating calls for an independent investigation. Trump says he feels “somewhat” vindicated by Nunes: “I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found”. pic.twitter.com/PwuEaICG2q — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 22, 2017 Still unclear are the contents of the intercepts that Nunes shared with Trump. Schiff released a statement: “This afternoon, Chairman Devin Nunes announced he had some form of intercepts revealing that lawfully gathered intelligence on foreign officials included information on U.S. persons, potentially including those associated with President Trump or the president himself. If accurate, this information should have been shared with members of the committee, but it has not been. Indeed, it appears that committee members only learned about this when the chairman discussed the matter this afternoon with the press. The chairman also shared this information with the White House before providing it to the committee, another profound irregularity, given that the matter is currently under investigation. I have expressed my grave concerns with the chairman that a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way. “As to the substance of what the chairman has alleged, if the information was lawfully gathered intelligence on foreign officials, that would mean that U.S. persons would not have been the subject of surveillance. In my conversation late this afternoon, the chairman informed me that most of the names in the intercepted communications were in fact masked, but that he could still figure out the probable identity of the parties. Again, this does not indicate that there was any flaw in the procedures followed by the intelligence agencies. Moreover, the unmasking of a U.S. person’s name is fully appropriate when it is necessary to understand the context of collected foreign intelligence information. “Because the committee has still not been provided the intercepts in the possession of the chairman, it is impossible to evaluate the chairman’s claims. It certainly does not suggest — in any way — that the president was wiretapped by his predecessor.” He also spoke to CNN about Nunes’s actions. Said Schiff: “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both,” Schiff said. “Unfortunately, I think the actions of today throw great doubt into the ability of both the chairman and the committee to conduct the investigation the way it ought to be conducted.” Rep.

Here is the story from Politico: Nunes said the monitoring appeared to be done legally as a result of what’s called “incidental collection,” but said he was concerned because it was not related to the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election and was widely disseminated across the intelligence community. “I have seen intelligence reports that clearly show that the president-elect and his team were, I guess, at least monitored,” Nunes told reporters. “It looks to me like it was all legally collected, but it was essentially a lot of information on the president-elect and his transition team and what they were doing.” Nunes described the surveillance as most likely being “incidental collection.” This can occur when a person inside the United States communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be kept secret — but can be “unmasked” by intelligence officials under certain circumstances. Nunes created a firestorm with this information because it led to all manner of speculation and incorrect information being bandied about on social media. Nothing helpful came from what he did, despite protests to the contrary. In the end, it looks like nothing more than Nunes giving cover to the Trump administration after the hearings on Monday went very badly for them. In that vein, here are four reasons why this little stunt by Nunes just created an even bigger mess than before. 1. There was no purpose for releasing the information in question – Nunes said it was all “legally collected.” But he also notes there was information in the reports about the transition team. Do you know who was on Trump’s transition team? Devin Nunes. Also, he held the press conference and provided the information he received without giving it to fellow members of the Intelligence Committee. That comes off as highly irresponsible on his part. Finally, the Intelligence Committee is an oversight committee. The intelligence community is headed up by the executive branch of government and yet here was the Chairman of the committee that has oversight over the executive branch, skipping off to the White House to inform the President of information he had before other members of the committee. Jeremy Bash, a former counsel to the Intelligence Committee, had this to say: Ex-House Intel counsel: Nunes briefing Trump is a “breakdown in the entire oversight process,” other committee members likely “horrified” pic.twitter.com/aRn8dB3Ia6 — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 22, 2017 2. Saying the Trump team was placed under surveillance, wiretapped or spied on is not correct – Words mean something and the word “incidental” is key here. Attorney Gabriel Malor said the following: "Incidental collection" is when communications by U.S. citizens are intercepted bc they went *to* a foreign surveillance target. — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) March 22, 2017 Incidental collection under FISA sec. 702 has repeatedly been upheld as constitutional. https://t.co/11fpmdALUI — Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) March 22, 2017 Trending Neil Gorsuch Reacts Perfectly To Al Franken's Nonsense, For America Andrea Ruth Nunes said he didn’t see evidence anyone was conducting surveillance on the Trump team. So everybody saying, “The Trump transition team was spied on!” are not correct. Use a personal example. Say you have a friend who works in a pizzeria. You call that friend on the phone to ask about plans for the weekend. Unbeknownst to you and your friend, the owner of the pizzeria, is under a federal investigation for money laundering. Your conversation is collected as a result. It doesn’t mean you were spied on nor does it say that you were placed under surveillance. More from John Schindler: "Incidental collection" is not surveillance if you're not a SIGINT target. I've explained this too many times already. So did DIRNSA Monday. — John Schindler (@20committee) March 22, 2017 It means Team Trump was in contact with legitimate FI targets who were being monitored totally legally via SIGINT.https://t.co/0Xb9cVSrTM — John Schindler (@20committee) March 22, 2017 3. Contrary to what a lot of people are saying the “unmasking” of people in these reports is not illegal. – For those that aren’t sure, when a U.S. intelligence agency conducts surveillance of a foreigner inside the U.S., it will sometimes include the name of an American that the foreigner is speaking to or about. When it happens, analysts hide or “minimize” the name of the American in question. People all over are saying the “unmasking” of Michael Flynn was illegal. That is not true. The leaking of his name was unlawful. One national security expert and lawyer confirm the legality of unmasking. The nat/sec expert I spoke to said the following: Unmasking is a normal, if pretty rare, IC procedure….unmasking within classified channels is SOP — the LEAK was the illegal part Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institute answers the question:  “There is nothing inappropriate about unmasking when it is appropriate to unmask,” said Benjamin Wittes, a senior Brookings Institution fellow and editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. In the context of the Flynn example, Wittes said, the U.S. is surveilling a foreign target — in this case Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The target, Kislyak, is contacted by an American who is the incoming national security adviser in the new administration — Michael Flynn — and that American is discussing the future administration’s policy. Wittes says it is easy to see where identifying this American is important to foreign intelligence. “I don’t think there’s anything surprising that it got unmasked,” Wittes said. What is at issue is the leaking of the name to the public: The “unmasking” of Flynn’s name is routine, Wittes said. But, he said, sharing Flynn’s name publicly “is both shocking and inappropriate.” It is a crime to disclose or “leak” classified information. The contents of intelligence collected under the authorities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, are classified. Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak was collected under these authorities and therefore classified. Even Sean Spicer recognizes the difference. In a statement about Flynn, he said the following: “Michael Flynn was unmasked and then illegally, his identity was leaked out to media outlets,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday. 4. It gives Donald Trump and his supporters to say he was right about his screwball tweets from two weeks ago – Sure enough, when I tweeted that’s what Nunes stunt would do, I was met with “And he’s right!” replies. Naturally, Trump is not correct, but it doesn’t matter. It goes back to what I said about driving to Philadelphia. If I drove instead to Baltimore, I could say my claim was “right” because I was driving north. It is SOP for Trump make an outrageous claim and then claim vindication when some entirely unrelated information is tied back to what he said. It’s garbage. Bradley Moss, an attorney, specializing in national security issues tweeted the following: The number of people in my TL right now saying Trump's claims were accurate is astounding. His accusations were way off mark. — Bradley P. Moss, Esq (@BradMossEsq) March 22, 2017 This charade will continue until there is an independent investigation carried out. What Nunes did was a disgrace and an embarrassment to the Republican Party. What he did was not in the best interests of the public but the best interest of Donald Trump.

But just days ago, FBI Director James Comey heralded CrowdStrike as a "highly respected private company" before the Senate. Grant Ferowich — Long before they were fingering Russia as the culprits in the US hack, the firm, CrowdStrike, was alleging Russia had used malware to destroy Ukrainian weapons – another conclusion that has left experts scratching their heads.  Data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ (IISS) was manipulated to support CrowdStrike’s explosive assertion that Russian cyber operators hacked into Ukrainian howitzer artillery units to target other Ukrainian ground forces.  "The CrowdStrike report uses our data," the IISS London Press Office told Sputnik, "but the inferences and analysis drawn from that data belong solely to the report’s authors." The accusation that Russia got Ukrainian weapons to fire at each other would be a bombshell, "except for the fact that the malware doesn’t ask for GPS location data," writes Jeffrey Carr, a cybersecurity expert who has taught at the US Army War College.  The CrowdStrike report on Ukraine also quoted "exaggerated figures of an 80 percent loss rate of Ukraine’s D-30 artillery caused in part by a variant of the same malware used in the DNC hack," Carr said.  "Open source reporting," the CrowdStrike Global Intelligence Team wrote, showed that "Ukrainian artillery forces have lost over 50 percent of their weapons in the two years of conflict and over 80 percent of D-30 howitzers."  © AFP 2017/ JEFF KOWALSKY JEWEL SAMAD Ex-US Intel Operatives Demand Smoking Gun Evidence of ‘Russian Hacking’ – If It Exists According to the Artillery Land Forces of Ukraine, however, the number of "artillery weapons lost" are lower than what CrowdStrike suggested, "and are not associated with the specified cause." CrowdStrike’s assertions constituted a conclusion IISS never suggested, "nor one we believe to be accurate," the British think tank said in a statement to Sputnik. The decline in artillery assets cited by CrowdStrike is more properly attributed to a transfer of those assets to air force teams, not their outright destruction.  Fancy Bear, the subject of CrowdStrike’s report, is the same malware that CrowdStrike said was used to infiltrate the DNC’s servers.  "The fact that they would be tracking and helping the Russian military kill Ukrainian army personnel in eastern Ukraine and also intervening in the US election is quite chilling," CrowdStrike Chief Technology Officer Dimitri Alperovitch told the Washington Post in December. Chilling, maybe. But based on real evidence? That looks less likely. Six months after the FBI alleged that "Russian hackers" breached the Democratic National Committee, the FBI still had not bothered to request permission to access the breached servers, a DNC spokesman said in January.  Pixabay Anti-Logic: FBI Blind to DNC Servers Before Accusing Russia of Cyberattack "CrowdStrike is pretty good," an intelligence official said that month, adding that there was no reason to believe CrowdStrike’s report wasn’t accurate.  Agencies like the FBI, Justice Department and the US Attorney General’s Office requested DNC cooperation, but the FBI "never requested access to the DNC’s computer servers," DNC deputy communications director Eric Walker said in January. Instead, law enforcement officials relied on a CrowdStrike analysis as a pretext for allegations that Russia had attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections.  In January, Sputnik pointed out the obvious fallacy in such reasoning: Just because CrowdStrike’s credibility had not been disproven does not therefore prove the opposite point, that CrowdStrike possesses credibility. The argumentum ad ignoratium fallacy, or "the argument from ignorance," is now rearing its ugly head as reports emerge that CrowdStrike may not be as infallible as officials at the DNC, intelligence agencies and US government at large previously believed.  ...

How come Crowd Strike were commissioned to the White House and also the FBI used them, because the DNC would not give the FBI access to their computers, but, were happy to let the FBI use Crowd Strike. Funny how the Republican Party had no problems with their computers and servers. There again, they did not let Crowd Strike near them.

Millions of tax dollars paid to an agency that is part of a company that strongly supported the Clinton campaign. With a mainstream media that's not interested in investigating this, it's kind of a perfect crime for a president with bipartisan support for anything aimed against Russia. No scrutiny no problem. Reply John Twining 08:12 23.03.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete Excellent piece. Without other, rival cyber security expert witnesses in the House Intel Committee's hearings, the conclusion drawn by CrowdStrike that Russia hacked the DNC is likely to maintain its remarkably unchallenged hold on the minds of the whole of the US Intel community and all the left-leaning media outlets. That's just plain unhealthy, and I'm at a loss as to how the Intel Committee's Republican members appear to have agreed to this dreadfully unbalanced selection of witnesses. But now perhaps, thanks to Sputnik, more expert witnesses will be added before it's too late (unless they've totally blinkered themselves to any and all Russian news reporting). Reply Mitach2002 08:36 23.03.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete So just another American company that has incompetent experts, morons or liars. Either way it comes down to non professional and unreliable.

The news today throws that logic out the window and confirms that some of the top PC vendors are planning to raise prices in 2017. If Apple gets away with it, then why can't they, right? Apple has led the way in pricing for success for some time now and more PC vendors are going to follow that model.   According to a supply chain report today, in order to reflect continual hikes in component costs, including display panels, DRAM, SSDs, Li batteries, PC vendors including Apple are likely planning to raise retail prices when new models equipped with revised Kaby Lake processors launched in Q3 2017.   Intel is planning to release upgraded Kaby Lake processors in Q3 and PC vendors are expected to release new products with increased prices to target back-to-school demand.   At an analyst conference in February, Lenovo COO Gianfranco Lanci stated that PC component shortages have not improved and the company will raise its PC prices in order to reflect some of the increased costs.   Asustek Computer CEO Jerry Shen also recently noted that the company's biggest challenges in 2017 are exchange rate fluctuations and component price hikes. To minimize the impact from the component pricing, Asustek is also planning to increase the prices for its new products.   The component shortages are also expected to create more pressure on small PC vendors, as big vendors placing bigger amounts of component orders will be given priority by their suppliers.   With Apple considered a premium vendor, they're likely to lead the way in premium pricing again this year. While many thought that the latest MacBook Pro was too expensive, Apple's Phil Schiller shruged off such talk. He stated back in October 2016:   "Affordability is absolutely something we care about. But we don't design for price, we design for the experience and the quality people expect from Mac. Sometimes that means we end up at the higher end of the range, but not on purpose, just because that's what it costs."   With a statement like that, it would seem that Apple will use the current price increases of components to justify their next price increases – and this time premium PC vendors are likely to follow Apple's lead.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, is “deeply compromised” following his public announcement that the U.S. intelligence community incidentally gathered information about Trump transition team members. “Chairman Nunes is deeply compromised, and he cannot possibly lead an honest investigation.  Congress must create a comprehensive, independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth of the Trump-Russia connection,” Pelosi said in a statement. Nunes on Wednesday announced that the intelligence community collected surveillance on members of the Trump transition team "incidentally" — meaning that transition team members were captured by surveillance focusing on people outside the transition. ADVERTISEMENT "I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community collected information on U.S. individuals involved in the Trump transition," the congressman told reporters.  Nunes went to the White House on Wednesday to brief Trump about the documents, which he said show information about transition team members had been collected and disseminated throughout the intelligence community. Nunes also said the information collected was not part of an investigation into Russia and that he believed it was obtained legally. Pelosi called Nunes’ actions “unprecedented” and “an act of diversion and desperation.” “Chairman Nunes’ actions are disrespectful of Ranking Member Schiff and the bipartisan membership of the Intel Committee,” she said in the statement. “Republicans are grasping at straws because the FBI Director confirmed that President Obama did not wiretap President Trump, and affirmed an investigation of coordination between the Russians and individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign in the election.” The House Intelligence Committee is currently investigating Russia’s interference in the United States presidential election, along with President Trump’s claim, presented without evidence, that former President Barack ObamaBarack ObamaDem rep: Nunes ‘betrayed’ Intelligence panel’s independence Why Trump should support CBC priority Trump defends several unsubstantiated claims in interview MORE wiretapped Trump Tower.

Linux kernel 4.10.5 is not a major update, but it's not a small one either. According to the appended shortlog, a total of 69 files were changed in this release, with 587 insertions and 268 deletions. Most of these changes are various networking improvements, both for the driver stack and core networking. There's also better support for Intel chipsets and a few hardware architectures were improved as well. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.10.5 kernel. All users of the 4.10 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.10.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.10.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git;a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. All users need to update their systems to Linux 4.10.5 immediately Looking at the things that received attention in Linux kernel 4.10.5, we can notice an updated networking stack with various improvements to Bridge, DCCP (Datagram Congestion Control Protocol), IPv4, IPv6, L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol), MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching), Open vSwitch, packet scheduler, SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), and STRParser. The networking improvements continue with updated Ethernet drivers for AMD 10GbE (amd-xgbe), Mellanox, as well as the use of ETH_MAX_MTU as max mtu for bonding. The Intel i915 driver also got some attention, and Linux kernel 4.10.5 adds better support for the x86, ARM64 (AArch64), and PowerPC (PPC) hardware architectures. If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution powered by the Linux 4.10 kernel, we recommend updating to version 4.10.5 as soon as possible. The Linux 4.10.5 kernel sources are now avaiable for download from kernel.org. #Linux kernel 4.10.5#Linux 4.10.5#Linux kernel#Linux 4.10#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news It's Official: Linux Users Can Now Watch Netflix Movies Using Mozilla Firefox GNOME 3.24 Desktop Environment Officially Released, Here Is What's New Entroware Launches Ubuntu-Powered Kratos Laptop with Nvidia GTX 1050, Kaby Lake Stellarium 0.15.2 Open-Source Astronomical Observatory App Has over 100 Changes Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook New Galaxy S8 and S8+ Press Shots Surface, Together with Official Teaser Super Mario Run is Now Officially Available on Android Phones Qualcomm Prevented Samsung From Selling Its Exynos Chipsets Google Updates Duo With Audio-Only Calls, Allo Can Now Share Files Apple Patent Shows Accessory That Transforms An iPhone or iPad into a MacBook Target to Offer Freebies for Galaxy S8 Pre-Orders, Leaked Ad Shows    Linux kernel 4.10.5 released New Linux Apps Clonezilla LiveCD: A Debian-based Live CD that allows you to clone hard disks without installing any software GoboLinux: A free Linux operating that is quite different from other similar operating systems OSMC (formerly RaspBMC): An Open Source and free Debian-based Linux distribution that brings XBMC to Raspberry Pi Univention Corporate Server: A server Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux and designed for big corporations Shotwell: A photo organizer and image viewer for the controversial GNOME desktop environment Ruby: An object-oriented programming language for GNU/Linux and UNIX-like operating systems Opera: Surf the Internet in a safer, faster and easier way with the Opera browser for Linux Reader comments Linux Kernel 4.10.4 Released with MIPS Improvements, Updated USB Drivers more on: Linux kernel 4.10.4 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The CBO estimated the law would lead to 14 million more uninsured in 2018, and 24 million by 2026, compared to the status quo.  House Speaker Paul RyanPaul RyanTrump to meet Thursday with House Freedom Caucus members Healthcare fight pits Trump against Club for Growth High drama for ObamaCare vote MORE, however, pushed back by framing the AHCA as the first of a “three-pronged approach” for reform. In the wake of the CBO scoring, Ryan defended his bill. “It’s important to note,” Ryan wrote, “that (the CBO’s) report does not take into consideration additional steps Congress and the Trump administration are taking that will further lower costs and increase choices.” ADVERTISEMENT Ryan’s point has merit. Should Republicans follow through on their three-stage reform and replace strategy — passing the AHCA through budget reconciliation, enacting regulatory reforms through Secretary Tom Price that give additional flexibility to states and insurers, and passing legislative reforms that allow insurers to sell plans that consumers actually want to buy — the ultimate impact on coverage could be much more positive than CBO’s analysis of standalone AHCA.  (Of course, it’s not CBO’s job to score hypothetical policy reforms, so this is not a criticism of CBO.)   In addition, there are a few other pragmatic changes to the AHCA (or that could be passed in follow on legislation) that could significantly improve Republicans’ efforts, reassure wavering Senate Republicans, and (perhaps) even attract support from a few moderate Democrats.  The key is to allow the market to offer coverage that meets the needs of different populations. ObamaCare struggled with reforming the individual insurance market because it tried a one-size fits all approach to a market that’s far from homogenous.  There are low-income and/or high cost patients with serious medical conditions, who simply can’t access affordable coverage without help, and price-sensitive uninsured who are basically healthy and looking for catastrophic coverage in the event of a serious illness or accident.   One size doesn’t fit all. ObamaCare’s combination of high-cost insurance with a weak mandate for buying coverage pushed price-sensitive middle income and younger enrollees out of the market.  As a result, exchanges are heavily skewed towards poorer and sicker enrollees, insurers are dropping out, and premiums are skyrocketing (up an average 22 percent last year). Insurers should have more flexibility to adjust prices for younger people (which the AHCA starts), but more has to be done.  The good news is that the AHCA contains a $100 billion Patient and State Stability Fund that states can use to help stabilize the market through tools like high risk pools or reinsurance. Both are essentially strategies for taking the highest cost patients out of the insurance pool, lowering premiums for everyone else. This is the right approach, although the stability fund probably has to be bigger to be most effective — and the need for reinsurance/risk pools in this market isn’t going away. Adding means tested tax credits with HSAs would also provide low income patients with the help they need to really make the best use of insurance when they need it – addressing a serious criticism of Republicans’ current approach, which only allows tax credits to vary with age. The “Manager’s Amendment” released early this week nods in this direction through an expanded deduction for health expenses, but it is not means tested and won’t help individuals without tax liability.  The issue will likely come up again in the Senate.    Finally, many Americans resent ObamaCare’s individual mandate.  A different strategy is to simply allow everyone who buys and keeps it to avoid being re-risk rated in the future.  Dropping coverage would allow insurers to price risk back in for a period — perhaps half the time the patient was uninsured, with a minimum penalty of at least 6 months or a year.   This is a stronger guardrail than the AHCA, which currently only allows insurers to only charge a one year, 30 percent premium if enrollees drop coverage for more than 63 days.            If Republicans get the basic framework right, insurance costs for younger and healthier enrollees should fall closer to the pre-ACA market price.  Remember: different prices aren’t a bug of the insurance market, they’re a feature.  We want healthy people to buy in, get coverage, and keep it.   The lower prices fall, the less money taxpayers will have to kick in. Speaker Ryan is right that Republicans reform efforts won’t be done in a single vote — or even this year.  Republicans should also focus on reforming medical education (dropping the time and cost it takes to become a primary care physician), promote provider competition (through reforms like competitive bidding and reference pricing for common procedures), and rigorous state and federal antitrust enforcement to prevent anti-competitive hospital and insurer mergers. The pre-ObamaCare market wasn’t perfect, and going back isn’t an option.  Republicans are committed to market-based reforms, and they have to follow through.   This is just the first act in a three part drama.

Scott Applewhite House Intel Chair: Some Surveillance of Trump Team 'Appears Inappropriate'WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The recent findings of US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes concerning surveillance of President Donald Trump do not prove the latter's claims that former President Barack Obama ordered that Trump be wiretapped, Congressman Adam Schiff said in a press release on Wednesday. "Because the Committee has still not been provided the intercepts in the possession of the Chairman, it is impossible to evaluate the Chairman's claims," Schiff, a Democrat and ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, stated. "It certainly does not suggest — in any way — that the President was wiretapped by his predecessor." "The chairman also shared this information with the White House before providing it to the committee, another profound irregularity, given the matter is currently under investigation," Schiff stated. "If you have a chairman who is interacting with the White House… when people around the White House are the subject of the investigation," Schiff told reporters on Wednesday. "It throws a profound doubt whether that can be done credibly." ...

"There is nothing that suggests that that was the case," Spicer stated when asked whether Manafort tried to push pro-Russia position on any issue. Spicer added that Trump was not aware of Manafort's business contracts with Russia's RUSAL aluminum company.

Manafort was hired to supervise the Trump campaign's delegate operation and was a part of the president's team for less than five months, Spicer clarified.

Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that significant development in the committee’s investigation revealed “that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.” (RELATED: House Intel Chair — Trump’s Personal Communications May Have Been Captured In Sweep) Sean Spicer (Getty Images) Reporters asked Spicer if the White House was “concerned” about the optics of Nunes’ meeting with the president on the findings, a meeting which might be construed as White House interference in an ongoing investigation. Spicer responded in the negative — clarifying that it was Nunes not President Trump who requested the meeting — before blasting a double standard in the media. WATCH: “Let me get this straight,” Spicer continued. “Number one, two weeks ago, we said this is the appropriate venue. Number two, you have asked over and over again why aren’t we meeting with certain individuals.” “One of the chairman wants to share his findings on what he knows. I think that is exactly how we talked about this working but would leave it to Congressman Nunes to come up and to brief.” “I don’t know what his plan is,” the White House press secretary conceded. “He briefed the media before he briefed us. He went down and talked about what he found.” Sean Spicer (Getty Images) “It was interesting, I didn’t see any complaints from you guys when he went down and held a press conference for the umpteenth talking about his findings. There’s no complaints from the media when he shares what he’s found with you guys, but when he wants to come up here and tell us this is where the investigation stands, this is what I’ve learned, there seems to be a little bit of an interesting double standard.” “You’re asking me questions — he has not briefed us, he has not briefed the president,” Spicer clarified. “He actually went down and spoke to media before he shared this with us.” It should be noted that President Trump told Tucker Carlson last Wednesday there will be “some interesting things [regarding his surveillance claims] going to the forefront over the next few weeks.” (RELATED: Trump Sits Down With Tucker Carlson) Follow Datoc on Twitter and Facebook Tags: Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

360-Degree Videos at an Exceptionally Higher Quality than Ever Before and even Zoom in to Achieve full 12K Resolution News provided by Visbit Mar 22, 2017, 14:19 ET Share this article SUNNYVALE, Calif., March 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Visbit, virtual reality (VR) and 360-degree video streaming company, announced today at IEEE VR Summit 2017 a technical breakthrough it had in research and development that proves streaming in 12K 360-degree VR video is now possible for the first time ever – even when using today's available hardware with regular Wi-Fi or LTE (a demo video can be seen here).  "Today, 360-degree videos are mostly streamed at 1080p and occasionally at 4K. You rarely hear of 6K video streaming, so 12K, a resolution that is very close to the acuity of 20/20 human vision, is unheard of, especially when streaming on today's regular Wi-Fi and LTE conditions," said Visbit Co-Founder and CEO Dr. Changyin (CY) Zhou. "There have been advancements in networking technology, such as Intel and Ericsson's recent demo of a 5G prototype to support 8K VR live streaming from a local server at Mobile World Congress this year, but average consumers won't have 5G at home for years to come. With our Visbit View-Optimized Streaming technology, 12K video in 360-degrees can run on today's networks with existing hardware, meaning that viewers can now zoom in and focus on granular details with today's 2.5K HMD screen and achieve a viewing experience equal to 12K. This unlocks a whole new user experience for viewing 360-degree VR video, as well as new possibilities for content creation." This huge milestone and technological breakthrough will enable a more immersive experience and allow VR video content creators and publishers to produce and distribute higher than 6K resolution VR video content. Using Visbit's View-Optimized Streaming (VVOS) technology, users can zoom in and focus on specific details, such as the plays or jersey number of an athlete during a sporting event, the names of storefronts in a city tour video or on minute details in a surgery being studied. By simply double-tapping the control panel and zooming in, viewers can also increase the feeling of interaction and mobility, getting one step closer to the engaging experience they crave with Mobile VR. Visbit's streaming service is currently available in closed beta for use on mobile VR platforms, including the Samsung Gear VR powered by Oculus and Google Cardboard. The open beta version is expected to launch later this year. For more details go to www.visbit.co. About Visbit Visbit, Inc. is a visual technology company enabling 360-degree video and VR content creators to deliver the highest possible quality streaming and viewing experiences to consumers across multiple VR platforms.

March 22, 2017 09:51 ET Institutional Analyst Inc. Initiates Coverage on Vystar's Vytex Better, Cleaner Latex ATLANTA, GA--(Marketwired - Mar 22, 2017) - Institutional Analyst Inc. has initiated coverage of Vystar Corp. (OTC PINK: VYST), with a report in "Biotech Stock Review" detailing the market opportunity for Vystar as the exclusive creator and licensor of breakthrough patented processes that remove virtually all proteins and non-rubbers that cause latex allergies and odor from latex to create Vytex® natural rubber latex (NRL) that can be used in over 40,000 products. The report is available on Vytex.com/blog/ and InternetStockReview.com "The coverage initiated by the Biotech Stock Review comes at an excellent time for potential investors as we now have a network of highly capable suppliers on a global basis to produce Vytex natural rubber latex," stated CEO William Doyle. "It has been a long journey to perfect our breakthrough patented processes that remove virtually all proteins and non-rubbers that cause latex allergies from latex to create Vytex®, which is a technically superior, sustainable, biodegradable, more durable and more ecofriendly product than traditional latex and petrochemical-based materials. We are fortunate to have enlisted Institutional Analyst Inc. to provide ongoing coverage via "Biotech Stock Review" as we roll Vytex out to our three initial target markets: foam for the home furnishings market, adhesives for the apparel market and latex gloves for the medical market." Roland Rick Perry, Editor of Biotech Stock Review, stated, "Now that the process has been perfected, Vystar has a viable 'Intel Inside' business model whereby established producers of natural latex can create and sell cleaner, better latex which, most importantly, can be done with their existing processing equipment with minor modifications and processing costs associated with the Vytex deproteinization kit and licensing. With approximately 1.2 million metric tons of natural rubber latex purchased every year, Vystar is in the enviable position of garnering a small fee on each pound produced without the need to build plants and factories and the capital required to build them. They can instead work with established producers who can now offer their end purchasers a better latex and simultaneously expand natural latex into markets which, until now, were hampered due to allergy concerns -- the best example being medical gloves." In a November 2016 report by Allied Market Research titled, "Global Disposable Gloves Market" based on key trends tracked, it is anticipated that the market is likely to be valued at $17.2 billion by 2022, registering a CAGR of 12.6% from 2016 to 2022. The report states "The natural rubber gloves segment accounted for around three-fifths revenue share, in 2015 and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period." Vytex natural latex gloves allow surgeons and healthcare professionals to enjoy the superior tactile sensitivity and strength of latex gloves virtually without risk of developing or experiencing allergic reactions. Vystar management believes that by reducing the risk of latex allergies, Vytex gloves may displace the weaker, less tactilely sensitive and less durable polyethylene, vinyl and nitrile gloves that many institutions transitioned to as a result of latex allergy concerns. Vytex was recently featured on ION TV's "New to the Street."  Click here to watch it.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Serdar Yegulalp Senior Writer, InfoWorld | Mar 20, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: Joan Campderrós-i-Canas More like this InfoWorld's 2017 Technology of the Year Award winners Book Review: JBoss Weld CDI for Java Platform Python 3.6 is packed with goodness The more cores you can use, the better -- especially with big data. But the easier a big data framework is to work with, the harder it is for the resulting pipelines, such as TensorFlow plus Apache Spark, to run in parallel as a single unit. Researchers from MIT CSAIL, the home of envelope-pushing big data acceleration projects like Milk and Tapir, have paired with the Stanford InfoLab to create a possible solution. Written in the Rust language, Weld generates code for an entire data analysis workflow that runs efficiently in parallel using the LLVM compiler framework. [ Download the InfoWorld quick guide: Learn to crunch big data with R. | Sign up for InfoWorld's Big Data Report to stay atop all the latest news and developments in the field. ] The group describes Weld as a "common runtime for data analytics" that takes the disjointed pieces of a modern data processing stack and optimizes them in concert. Each individual piece runs fast, but "data movement across the [different] functions can dominate the execution time." In other words, the pipeline spends more time moving data back and forth between pieces than actually doing work on it. Weld creates a runtime that each library can plug into, providing a common method to run key data across the pipeline that needs parallelization and optimization. Frameworks don't generate code for the runtime themselves. Instead, they call Weld via an API that describes what kind of work is being done. Weld then uses LLVM to generate code that automatically includes optimizations like multithreading or the Intel AV2 processor extensions for high-speed vector math. InfoLab put together preliminary benchmarks comparing the native versions of Spark SQL, NumPy, TensorFlow, and the Python math-and-stats framework Pandas with their Weld-accelerated counterparts. The most dramatic speedups came with the NumPy-plus-Pandas benchmark, where the work could be amplified "by up to two orders of magnitude" when parallelized across 12 cores. Those familiar with Pandas and want to take Weld for a spin can check out Grizzly, a custom implementation of Weld with Pandas. It's not the pipeline, it's the pieces Weld's approach comes out of what its creators believe is a fundamental problem with the current state of big data processing frameworks. The individual pieces aren't slow; most of the bottlenecks arise from having to hook them together in the first place. Building a new pipeline integrated from the inside out isn't the answer, either. People want to use existing libraries, like Spark and TensorFlow. Dumping that means getting rid of a culture of software already built around those products. Instead, Weld proposes making changes to the internals of those libraries, so they can work with the Weld runtime. Application code that, say, uses Spark wouldn't have to change at all. Thus, the burden of the work would fall on the people best suited to making those changes -- the library and framework maintainers -- and not on those constructing apps from those pieces. Weld also shows that LLVM is a go-to technology for systems that generate code on demand for specific applications, instead of forcing developers to hand-roll custom optimizations. MIT's previous project, Tapir, used a modified version of LLVM to automatically generate code that can run in parallel across multiple cores. Another cutting-edge aspect to Weld: it was written in Rust, Mozilla's language for fast, safe software development. Despite its relative youth, Rust has an active and growing community of professional developers frustrated with having to compromise safety for speed or vice versa. There's been talk of rewriting existing applications in Rust, but it's tough to fight the inertia. Greenfield efforts like Weld, with no existing dependencies, are likely to become the standard-bearers for the language as it matures. This story, "MIT-Stanford project uses LLVM to break big data bottlenecks" was originally published by InfoWorld.

"With more than 650 executives in attendance at CONNECTIONS™, we will shine the spotlight on new partnerships and share new business models, technology innovations, and monetization opportunities."

March 22, 2017 09:51 ET Institutional Analyst Inc. Initiates Coverage on Vystar's Vytex Better, Cleaner Latex ATLANTA, GA--(Marketwired - Mar 22, 2017) - Institutional Analyst Inc. has initiated coverage of Vystar Corp. (OTC PINK: VYST), with a report in "Biotech Stock Review" detailing the market opportunity for Vystar as the exclusive creator and licensor of breakthrough patented processes that remove virtually all proteins and non-rubbers that cause latex allergies and odor from latex to create Vytex® natural rubber latex (NRL) that can be used in over 40,000 products. The report is available on Vytex.com/blog/ and InternetStockReview.com "The coverage initiated by the Biotech Stock Review comes at an excellent time for potential investors as we now have a network of highly capable suppliers on a global basis to produce Vytex natural rubber latex," stated CEO William Doyle. "It has been a long journey to perfect our breakthrough patented processes that remove virtually all proteins and non-rubbers that cause latex allergies from latex to create Vytex®, which is a technically superior, sustainable, biodegradable, more durable and more ecofriendly product than traditional latex and petrochemical-based materials. We are fortunate to have enlisted Institutional Analyst Inc. to provide ongoing coverage via "Biotech Stock Review" as we roll Vytex out to our three initial target markets: foam for the home furnishings market, adhesives for the apparel market and latex gloves for the medical market." Roland Rick Perry, Editor of Biotech Stock Review, stated, "Now that the process has been perfected, Vystar has a viable 'Intel Inside' business model whereby established producers of natural latex can create and sell cleaner, better latex which, most importantly, can be done with their existing processing equipment with minor modifications and processing costs associated with the Vytex deproteinization kit and licensing. With approximately 1.2 million metric tons of natural rubber latex purchased every year, Vystar is in the enviable position of garnering a small fee on each pound produced without the need to build plants and factories and the capital required to build them. They can instead work with established producers who can now offer their end purchasers a better latex and simultaneously expand natural latex into markets which, until now, were hampered due to allergy concerns -- the best example being medical gloves." In a November 2016 report by Allied Market Research titled, "Global Disposable Gloves Market" based on key trends tracked, it is anticipated that the market is likely to be valued at $17.2 billion by 2022, registering a CAGR of 12.6% from 2016 to 2022. The report states "The natural rubber gloves segment accounted for around three-fifths revenue share, in 2015 and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period." Vytex natural latex gloves allow surgeons and healthcare professionals to enjoy the superior tactile sensitivity and strength of latex gloves virtually without risk of developing or experiencing allergic reactions. Vystar management believes that by reducing the risk of latex allergies, Vytex gloves may displace the weaker, less tactilely sensitive and less durable polyethylene, vinyl and nitrile gloves that many institutions transitioned to as a result of latex allergy concerns. Vytex was recently featured on ION TV's "New to the Street."  Click here to watch it.

For some 5 hours, they testified before Congress, saying very little in the public forum. They had few facts to offer as most of the questions revolve around classified material and ongoing investigations. However, we did learn a couple of things. First, there is an ongoing probe into possible links between the Trump campaign, including some former staff members and some individuals who were never part of the campaign, with the Russian government. Secondly, Comey, himself, said that most of the leaked information that has been appearing in various news reports is ″dead wrong″. He also stated that neither the FBI nor the Justice Department had any evidence of the Obama administration ordering surveillance on Donald Trump. Of course, he could not comment if any member of Team Trump was recorded resulting from surveillance on foreign nationals by other spy agencies, which seems to be the case for Michael Flynn. Perhaps the most interesting moment during the 5 hours of testimony was the apparent lack of resolve by Comey and the FBI to investigate who has been leaking potentially classified information to the News Media. Congressman Peter King (R-NY) raised the matter of the January 6, 2017 intelligence briefing of President-Elect Donald Trump by Comey, Rogers, as well as CIA Director John Brennan and National Intelligence Director James Clapper. Within a few hours after that meeting at Trump Tower, details about the meeting were leaked to the press. When asked by Rep. King, Comey refused to offer any names of others who may have been in the room, such as staff aides for the Intel directors. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) also pushed Comey for details about who was leaking, to no avail. Dowdy concluded that for some of the material leaked, perhaps only two dozen Obama appointed officials may have had access to the material. Comey refused to comment on whether any of these people have ever been questioned about the leaks. Such leaks are felony offenses under the Espionage Act, punishable by 10 years in federal prison. For his part, Admiral Mike Rogers confirmed that the NSA had no evidence that the outcome of the 2016 election was tampered with by the Russian hacking efforts. Both the FBI and NSA had no direct evidence that there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The ongoing FBI probe seems to be centered on a short list of a few former campaign staffers, as well as a couple of individuals who were Trump supporters but not employed by the campaign. Aside from Michael Flynn, who may have allegedly forgotten to list all of the foreign national companies and agencies he may have represented in the past, only a few other people stand out as possibly having legal issues. So, as predicted here, this whole Trump-Russia thing has been little more than Fake News. As far as the Obama-Trump surveillance story, that may as well be Fake News, originating from reports by the New York Times and others. Which is par for the course! Just look at how The Media and the Democrats have tried to tag Donald Trump with the whole Obama-birth certificate thing. That story did not originate with Trump, nor even with Conservative Media, such as talk radio. The ′Birther′ story originated from the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign via Mark Penn and Sidney Blumenthal. It was the major reason why Obama did not allow Hillary to hire Blumenthal for her team at the State Department. Naturally, The Media is focusing on the ′wiretap′ aspect of yesterday′s testimony by James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers. Despite the hysteria, this may have worked out much to the benefit for President Donald Trump, as his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, got essentially a free ride during the first day of his Senate confirmation hearing. Comey′s testimony about how most of the leaked information to The Media is ″dead wrong″ also supports President Trump′s views about the Fake News Media. Of course, these committee hearings on the Russia hacking will continue. Who knows, maybe somebody will start asking questions about ties between the Clintons and the Russians? There are plenty of those! Aside from that, the biggest news item is that James Comey hates “Patriots”! That is, the NFL team, the New England Patriots. He’s a New York Giants fan.

Disparaging Great Britain, Australia and acting like a petulant child with Merkel. So I turn on Fox and Friends and who is on? Kellyanne Conway, who has been effectively banned from any other show because she has lost any semblance of credibility. So they go right along with the same nonsense. Wiretap? No big deal. Accusing your predecessor of a felony? Huh? Changing the GOP platform to benefit Russia? What? So what is the real problem? Reporters and leaks. All the other stuff that has irreparably damaged our standing in the world? Fake news. As General Hayden said this morning, “This is the biggest W for any foreign espionage effort in history, better than anything we did and we tried for decades.” All they needed was a willing stooge. The one out he left was is it malice or incompetence? Of course these issues may pale when compared to eliminating heating assistance for the poor or Meals on Wheels or cutting funding for jobs training. The auto companies are even complaining that they can’t fill jobs because working at an auto factory is no longer putting a bolt on a car (and I put bolts on Dodge Darts), but sure, let’s cut any semblance of job training. But hey, at least the top 1% are getting a tax break and we are going to rebuild our decimated military. We spend more than the next seven countries combined and it is decimated? Perhaps that should be looked at. 2 Andrew Zarowny Says: March 22nd, 2017 at 8:30 am Blah, Blah, Blah, Buzz! I suppose you didn’t catch that James Comey admitted that the FBI has been investigating the Trump campaign since last July? About the same time those rumors about a FISA court request was made. How does one investigate without interviewing ‘suspects’ or getting warrants to access documents? I guess they must use a crystal ball or something, huh? Just keep pitching, Buzz! One day, you might toss one in the strike zone. 3 buzzbee Says: March 22nd, 2017 at 11:57 am There are few people that agree with the constant lies that emanate from this buffoon’s mouth and I am surprised that you are one of them. 4 Andrew Zarowny Says: March 23rd, 2017 at 7:20 am LOL, Buzz, that’s rich! Amazing that you accept the vast number of dummies who believed all of the lies daily coming out of the Obama administration. Practically every day, they told some sort of fib. Of course, as we learned yesterday, Trump was not lying about being under surveillance.

It does not matter whether they developed and owned the next big thing in technology, or they got the backing of renowned venture capital (VC) funds, or niche sales networks. The majority will inevitably fail, and the lucky few will manage to survive just a little longer. The very small minorities statistically seen as the outliers become so epic that they disrupt and change the world. Bill Gates once mentioned that he was not afraid of large companies coming up with new technologies, but of small entrepreneurs working from their garages trying to cook up disruption after a series of failures. The world has seen those outliers mostly born in Silicon Valley in the U.S. Israel is another tech center that had many failures. But those failures led the very few exceptional startups across the chasm and become disruptive. Yozma Group, an Israeli VC, examines whether startups' founders and their teams had experienced failure before investing in them, Yozma Group Korea CEO Lee Won-jae said. "We look at that as one of the most important key criteria simply because we strongly believe failure breeds success," Lee said in an interview at Yozma office in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. Yozma's investment strategy has so far worked. More than 80 Israeli startups Yozma's VC funds invested in went public on the NASDAQ in the U.S. This is the second highest after Chinese companies' NASDAQ listing. The country is home to more than 200 research and development (R&D) centers of multinational tech companies including Intel and Google. Israel's history of failure, conflict and risk is what made it a startup nation. Disruptive land Surrounded by Arabic countries and facing persistent conflict with Palestine, most people recognize Israel as a war zone rather than land of entrepreneurs. Many relate Israel to a country that has to endure constant threats from its neighbors; a country with Mossad agents and Special Forces to counter these threats; or the Holy Land depicted in the Bible. About 70 percent of Israel is desert. It had no resources to sustain its economy, other than oil shale it discovered in recent years. In the 1990s in the aftermath of the Gulf War, the Middle East energy crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's economy was in deep turmoil. It had an extremely high youth unemployment rate and debt. People's anxiety was running high, and confidence was running low. It needed to find a breakthrough. The solution was using its history and culture of risk-taking and countermeasures to embrace innovation and reinvent Israel. Due to continuing regional conflicts, Israel's defense technology is top of the line. It encouraged those who served in the military to start business with its defense technology. "This led to the creation of the world's first car phone by a military officer. Israel's radar-guided missile technology was used in health care for the development of capsules," Lee said. The country's innovative ecosystem quickly expanded with hospitals and universities getting involved to further develop it into a startup nation. Lee noted that it was not easy in the beginning up to the establishment of Yozma Group in 1993. "There were concerns and opposition. People and politicians were saying there is no money to set up a VC fund," Lee said. After much debate, Israel passed a bill to provide 40 percent of Yozma's $265 million fund. The rest came from the U.S. and European VCs. "What was notable then was that the Israeli government said this fund should be managed and operated by the private sector. The state only wanted to get involved to coordinate in case it failed," Lee said. "Yozma would like to bring its experience and share it with Korean startups as the two countries share similarities," he added. Reinventing Korea Like Israel in the 1990s, Korea faces uncertainty as it has a high youth jobless rate and keeps on depending on debt to maintain the economy. Not only is its population aging, but also its industries, some of which are going through restructuring to stay afloat. Also, South Korea constantly finds itself in dispute with China, Japan and North Korea. Lee, who came to Korea three years ago from Israel, said Yozma is set to help Korea reinvent itself with a 50 billion won fund for high-tech startups. It has been busy establishing networks and ecosystems with local universities and state agencies over the past three years. The fund will be launched in May. Its ecosystem will enable potential startups to grow and achieve growth through various stages. For instance, Yozma has a crowd funding platform that will help startups make their business ideas into commercial reality. Its incubation and acceleration programs will provide mentorship in areas such as finance, legal, sales and marketing to systematize their business. Yozma's VC fund will come in the third stage where it will invest in startups to further help them grow in the market. Then, it will invite other VC funds or private equities via Yozma's global networks to invest in those startups. The last stage will enable startups to go public or be sold to multinational companies, which will provide an exit for investors. This may be easier said than done, especially in Korea where there is some animosity toward selling a company to a foreign buyer. This is why Lee said Yozma will only invest in startups that have the potential to grow overseas. "As we look at startups' technology potential and their teams' past failure experience, Yozma will also evaluate whether they have a global business mindset," Lee said. "The days are gone when we used to think that if you succeed here, you can succeed overseas. That aged formula no longer works in the new age because markets and technologies change faster than we know." Taking into account Yozma's history of its investment and exit strategies for Israeli startups, all of its successfully invested companies either went public on the NASDAQ or were sold to global tech heavyweights like Google, Intel, Qualcomm and Cisco. "Israeli startups that were sold to global companies turned into their key R&D centers. That is why there are more than 200 R&D centers there," Lee said, noting that Samsung Electronics has two R&D centers in Israel through mergers and acquisitions. "We are going to help Korean startups go global first, and help them list on the NASDAQ or sell to bigger companies in the long term. We have no interest in companies that only seek to grow, list or sell locally," Lee said. Fashion followers In order to achieve this, Lee said Korean entrepreneurs need to change not only their mindset, but also become what he calls "fast fashion followers." They have to be highly aware of global IT trends, and move fast to immediately adopt them for global ventures, he said. Koreans are fast, they are highly aware of what's hot and what's not and even bring in the newest fashion from Italy and New York much faster than Japan, Lee said. In the tech sector, it is the same. There were Pandora TV, Cyworld and Dialpad in Korea before there were YouTube, Facebook and Skype. But Korean startups lack the capacity to venture and see opportunities first beyond borders as they still adhere to old ways of thinking and doing. Waze and Loc&All are both startups that developed and launched navigation apps around the same time. But Waze was an Israeli startup that was sold to Google for $1.15 billion. Loc&All's Kimgisa, which means "Driver Kim" in Korean, was sold to Kakao for about $55 million. Kakao's acquisition of Loc&All was recognized as one of Korea's biggest startup M&As, but not quite from a global perspective. "The big difference was that Waze focused on the U.S. and European traffic markets from the very beginning, while Loc&All only focused here," Lee said. Should Loc&All's Kimgisa ventured abroad like Waze did, it would have been worth at least $670 million, he noted. High-tech companies Yozma will be eyeing Korean startups in biotechnology, health care, financial technology, cybersecurity and materials. "As said before, we look at their technology potential as one of key criteria for investment. This is because they would have the competitive advantage to venture overseas without facing any intellectual property issues," Lee said. In materials, Yozma is particularly keen on investing in startups applying graphene technology, which scientists say has the potential to revolutionize practically all areas including energy, biotechnology, aviation and automobiles. The Israeli VC fund is set to select about 30 startups via its programs every fiscal quarter. "Yozma has been doing this for more than 20 years. We will use our vast networks and information pool to provide the support needed for startups here to go global like Israelis," Lee said. hyongki@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter [LIVE] Sewol emerges from water after 1073 days Seoul ranks No. 3 among cities with worst air pollution Mobile carriers fined for wooing expats with illegal benefits [LIVE] Sewol seen above water after 1073 days Park could face up to 45 years in prison Park under interrogation over corruption scandal N.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD has a fix coming for Ryzen bug that hard-locks PCs AMD has a fix coming for Ryzen bug that hard-locks PCs By Joel Hruska on March 22, 2017 at 7:46 am Comment Not long after AMD launched Ryzen, a group of forum users at HWBot.org began noticing something strange. A benchmark designed to measure a CPU’s performance in floating point operations (FLOPS) that made use of the FMA3 instruction set was hard-locking on Ryzen systems. The application typically hung when it reached the “Single-Precision – 128-bit FMA3 – Fused Multiply Add:” section of the test. Given that the test is open-source and hosted on GitHub, there’s no reason to suspect bad faith or improper coding, and AMD has actually confirmed that there’s a problem. The good news is, this isn’t the kind of problem that’s going to cripple the CPU’s performance or be a permanent, ongoing problem the way the original Phenom’s L2 TLB bug was. The bug, according to the HWBot thread, is tied to AGESA — the AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture, which handles the bootstrap protocol and initializes system devices. This piece of software initializes CPU cores, memory, and likely AMD’s Infinity Fabric as well, though that’s speculation on our part. BIOS updates are said to be in the works for all major board vendors; ExtremeTech recommends keeping an eye out for new updates as they become available. The likelihood of encountering this bug in the wild is rare; I’ve personally tested applications like Prime95, which uses FMA3 instructions and executed for an hour on Ryzen with no problem. And problems with FMA3 aren’t exactly novel, either. Intel had its own issues with FMA3 code with Skylake, as we reported last year. For those of you wanting a more technical explanation: FMA stands for Fused-Multiply-Add. FMA3 instructions are supported by both AMD and Intel and have three operands. The classic example operation is d = round(a × b + c). In FMA3, “d” must be the same register as a, b, or c. FMA4, which only AMD supports (in Bulldozer and later processors) allow a,b,c, and d to all be stored in different registers. FMA3 is considered to be simpler to implement and to reduce code length, while FMA4 offers more flexibility. Not many applications critically depend on FMA3 because the majority of CPUs in the market today (as opposed to new chips being sold) don’t support it. Intel’s support for FMA3 only dates to Haswell, and AMD’s FMA4 never gained much traction. Given that this bug appeared in a low-level benchmark specifically designed for FLOPS testing, and we aren’t aware of any problems in any shipping applications, we’d keep an eye out for a motherboard update. But we aren’t pulling our general recommendation of the chip. All three Ryzen CPUs released to date and all known motherboards do suffer from this bug, however.

Blockchain has near-universal applicability as a distributed transaction platform for securely authenticating exchanges of data, goods, and services. IBM and the Beijing-based Energy-Blockchain Labs are even using it to help reduce carbon emissions in air-polluted China. At the IBM InterConnect conference in Las Vegas today, IBM and Energy-Blockchain Labs announced a blockchain-based trading platform for "green assets" that's based on the Linux Foundation's open-source Hyperledger Fabric (which the foundation recently promoted from incubator to active status and elevated to version 1.0). A beta of the carbon trading platform will be released in May, the companies said, and the product will be commercially available later this year. According to Cao Yin, Chief Strategy Officer of Energy-Blockchain Labs, the company estimates that the platform will use smart contract-based transactions to significantly shorten the carbon assets development cycle and reduce the cost of development by 20 to 30 percent. The blockchain-based exchange will let enterprises in China generate carbon assets more efficiently, in accordance with China's Carbon Emission Reduction (CER) quota and its 2020 reduction goals in keeping with the Paris Agreement. Blockchain's immutable ledger also makes it easier and less expensive for regulatory authorities to audit and oversee the carbon market. China accounted for a whopping 28.2 percent of the world's carbon emissions in 2016 according to Statista. The US was second at 16 percent. China has a long way to go to reach its clean energy goals and to drastically improve air quality in its major cities and metropolitan areas, but tracking carbon assets on blockchain is a start. What is Hyperledger? Of the numerous blockchain standardization efforts out there, Hyperledger is the biggest and the one with the most industry support. The open-source initiative, which is overseen by the Linux Foundation, is working to create a standardized framework and code base for building blockchain-based ledgers across different industries. Hyperledger's members are a good representation of the industries it's trying to unify. You've got tech companies (Cisco, IBM, Intel, Red Hat, Samsung, VMware, and more), big banks and financial institutions (JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and so on), blockchain startups (such as Bloq, Blockstream, and Symbiont), global manufacturers and device makers, and even insurance giants like Kaiser Permanente. The organization, which formed in 2015, tool several existing standards and stitched them together into what is now Hyperledger Fabric, the initiative's first open-source project to make it out of incubation (and underpin a commercial offering like IBM Blockchain). Hyperledger Fabric is designed to allow blockchain deployments from different industries—be it finance and baking, Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain, manufacturing, and other technologies—to be interoperable with one another. For example: if American Express, German automaker Daimler, Chinese smartphone giant Huawei, and Japanese IT manufacturer Fujistu (all Hyperledger members) were involved in a complex global transaction, all of their blockchain-based ledgers would be able to talk to one another. Because each company's private blockchain platform is built on the same Hyperledger Fabric framework, the ledgers can securely share transaction data. It's an oversimplified explanation, but that's the general idea. IBM Bolsters BaaS With New Enterprise Tools In addition to the new version of IBM Blockchain based on the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric version 1.0, IBM also unveiled new open-source governance and automation tools for its enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. The company announced new governance and deployment tools, and a new open-source developer tool called Fabric Composer. IBM has so many overlapping, interlocking cloud platforms that it's worth taking a moment to explain what the revamped blockchain service is actually built upon. At the base is IBM Cloud, the company's Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform. The blockchain infrastructure itself (meaning, the standards by which the blockchain network itself is created and managed) is built on the Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 framework, which enables a rate of more than 1,000 blockchain-based transactions per second. The developer tools and services are offered through IBM Bluemix. IBM packages it all up with its IBM LinuxONE enterprise server infrastructure for added security. Bottom line: The service gives developers tools to build and host enterprise blockchain networks on IBM Cloud. The new blockchain governance tools are now commercially available; they are geared toward setting up roles and permissions within a blockchain network. Members can set rules and manage compliance guidelines from a single dashboard. IBM's newly announced Fabric Composer is a tool that assigns each network a "Network Trust Rating" of 1 to 100 when setting up a blockchain deployment. Fabric Composer is a developer automation tool that speeds up the time it takes to build a blockchain network on the Hyperledger Fabric. It includes a quick user interface (UI) creation tool and builds application programming interfaces (APIs) that integrate the blockchain network you're building with an enterprise's existing system of record. This first commercial deployment of the open-source Hyperledger Fabric is now available through a beta program on IBM Bluemix. Blockchain: Moving and Shaking In addition to the IBM and Hyperledger announcements, there's a lot happening in the blockchain space right now. Google, a tech giant that, until now, hasn't had much to say on the subject, revealed that it's using a private blockchain ledger to help its DeepMind AI ensure the privacy of confidential health data. After a new academic report citing "inexcusable" oversight and transparency errors in DeepMind's handling of confidential medical data from the UK's National Health Service (NHS), the company needed a better way to ensure data trust and compliance. Blockchain may be it. We also saw a great deal of research and innovation news come out of last week's DC Blockchain Summit. The Chamber of Digital Commerce, the blockchain trade association that hosted the summit, announced the formation of the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council (BIPC), which aims to balance open-source innovation with protection of proprietary information as more companies begin to file blockchain patents. The council's inaugural members include blockchain startups (including Blockstream and Bloq), companies such as Microsoft and Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and Overstock's t0 platform. Bloq also announced the launch of BloqLabs, an effort to foster open-source blockchain development projects combined with enterprise innovation. Bloq CEO and bitcoin pioneer Jeff Garzik likened BloqLabs to a Bell Labs-type "idea factory" for the blockchain space. The DC Blockchain Summit also served as a stage for the launch of the Blockchain Research Institute, a multimillion dollar research effort into blockchain use cases, opportunities, and implementation challenges that will span the next two years. The institute's founding members range from tech companies (Accenture, IBM, SAP) and finance institutions (Nasdaq) to blockchain startups, global corporations (PepsiCo), and even the government of the Canadian province of Ontario.

Intel is planning to release upgraded Kaby Lake processors in the third quarter and PC vendors are expected to release new products with increased prices to target back-to-school demand. Lenovo COO Gianfranco Lanci, at an analyst conference in February, said that PC component shortages have not improved and the company will raise its PC prices in order to reflect some of the increased costs. Asustek Computer CEO Jerry Shen also recently noted that the company's biggest challenges in 2017 are exchange rate fluctuations and component price hikes. To minimize the impact from the component pricing, Asustek is also planning to increase the prices for its new products. The component shortages are also expected to create more pressure on small PC vendors, as big vendors placing bigger amounts of component orders will be given priority by their suppliers.

Credit: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Microsoft More like this Windows Server on ARM laptops is for Azure only AMD tries to drum up support for 32-core Zen server chip Microsoft and ARM look to topple Intel in servers Video CW@50: 50 years of storage The tech world went a little crazy last week over the news that Microsoft was conducting internal tests of Windows Servers on ARM processors. Microsoft isn't saying what it plans to do beyond its internal use, and with good reason. The low-power CPU has been a failure on the server. While the blogosphere has been rife with speculation of what Microsoft may do, like containers or PaaS, the history of low-end chips in servers is one of market rejection. There have been multiple attempts at both ARM and Atom-based servers and none of them have gone anywhere. For some time there's been an effort to bring ARM to the server. And that meant a lot of work. ARM is designed for embedded use and was up until recently a 32-bit processor, meaning it was limited to 4GB. No one wants to go back to the bad old days of 4GB servers, where you had almost no overhead once the OS was loaded. So ARM and licensees have been playing a frantic game of catch-up, first porting the cores to 64-bit, then building the ecosystem around it, for things like memory management and ECC and other features needed in a high availability server but not a smartphone. In that time, Intel has only furthered its lead and AMD is finally getting back in the game. The highest-profile example of ARM for servers was Calxeda, which aimed to make ARM-based server processors. In 2011 it announced plans for a 480-core server in development, consisting of 120 quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 CPUs. In 2013 it crashed and burned, effectively shutting down. It assets were acquired by a company called Silver Lining Systems. How often do you hear about them? [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] HP had an ARM server project called Redstone, as part of a bigger effort known as Project Moonshot, launched in 2014. If you look at Moonshot now, the servers are running AMD Opterons and HP Enterprise no longer talks about the ARM effort. Finally there was SeaMicro, which came out with an ultra-dense 10U server packed with Intel Atom processors. They made the same pitch as the ARM people: low power draw, greater price-performance than Xeons, can be used in applications where you don't need that big honkin' Xeon drawing so much power. AMD acquired the company in 2012 for $334 million and unceremoniously shut it down in 2015. They didn't even bother to try and sell it -- there was no value in it. They just killed the whole line. I asked them why they didn't try to sell it and they said there was no interest. In talking to analysts about these failures, they said something interesting. The low-power chips had scalability issues, which is to be expected, so that limited their overall application. But more importantly, early adopters found that they could just partition up powerful Xeons through virtualization and get the same use, if not better. So why go with the new, unproven platform when you have a solid, mature platform available to you? Thanks to advances in virtualization software, it became more feasible and easier to just take a two-socket or four-socket Xeon server running Xeons with 10, 14, 18 and even 22 cores and partition them up just like you would a server running a bunch of Atoms or ARMs -- only here, if you need the horsepower, you could switch off the partitions and bring the full CPU to bear as needed. And Xeon is not a platform work-in-progress like ARM server tech is. It's mature and solid and well-supported. There are some Atom-based servers out there. SuperMicro has a bunch of servers based on the Atom, but they are for very specific low-end use, like file and print servers. I suspect Microsoft will quickly realize what Calxeda, HP and AMD realized. There is very little market or application for low-end processors on a server.

Aibiying translates as ‘welcome each other with love,’ which is the kind of reception that Airbnb may require to compete with local platforms such as Tujia and Xiaozhu. A number of tech companies targeting the Chinese market have had to make adjustments to their traditional business models, including by setting up joint ventures with local partners to gain market access. Qualcomm said last year it was setting up a server chipset design and sales unit with the investment arm of the Guizhou provincial government. Hewlett Packard Enterprise sold a majority stake in its server, technology services and storage business in China to a Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary to boost sales of HPE's enterprise products in the country, while Intel said in 2014 it was planning to invest in local chip companies for the design of mobile phone chips. Ride-hailing company Uber decided the best way in China was to cooperate rather than compete with a large local player Didi Chuxing. It said in August that it had struck a deal with Didi Chuxing, which would acquire all assets of Uber China, including its brand, business operations and data. Didi Chuxing would also acquire a minority equity interest in Uber. In 2015, two investors - China Broadband Capital (CBC) and Sequoia China - were brought in by Airbnb to help it continue to navigate the Chinese market and create a localized presence for the company. That plan is being continued now with a brand name that locals can relate to, and which sounds similar to its global brand. The company, which recently received a fresh infusion of US$1 billion of funds, also announced the expansion of its Trips and Experiences service in China, which tries to go beyond the usual tourist experience by offering app users access to a list of interesting activities such as local handicrafts and cuisine. It also said it was increasing the number of engineers at its engineering center in the country, which is the only one outside the U.S. Airbnb has also worked on the integration of local payment methods such as Alipay and sign up options such as WeChat, besides providing 24 X 7 customer support in Mandarin. It has also sought partnerships with cities, having signed memoranda of understanding with Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chongqing and Guangzhou. Airbnb has about 80,000 listings in China and has seen nearly 1.6 million guest arrivals at these listings. The company has more than 3 million listings in more than 190 countries around the world. The company had so far focused largely on outbound Chinese tourists. Subscribe here for up-to-date channel news Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

And that's the way China's government wants it 22 Mar 2017 at 08:26, Simon Sharwood Microsoft's supremo for China has told state-owned China Daily that Redmond's ready roll out version of Windows 10 with extra security features demanded by China's government. "We have already developed the first version of the Windows 10 government secure system. It has been tested by three large enterprise customers," Alain Crozier, CEO of Microsoft Greater China told China Daily. China used Edward Snowden's revelations to question whether western technology products could compromise its security. Policy responses included source code reviews for foreign vendors and requiring Chinese buyers to shop from an approved list of products. Microsoft, IBM and Intel all refused to submit source code for inspection, but Redmond and Big Blue have found other ways to get their code into China. IBM's route is a partnership with Dalian Wanda to bring its cloud behind the Great Firewall. Microsoft last year revealed its intention to build a version of Windows 10 for Chinese government users in partnership with state-owned company China Electronics Technology Group Corp. There's no reason to believe Crozier's remarks are incorrect, because Microsoft has a massive incentive to deliver a version of Windows 10 that China's government will accept. To understand why, consider that China's military has over two million active service personnel, the nation's railways employ similar numbers and Microsoft’s partner China Electronics Technology Group Corp has more than 140,000 people on its books. Not all of those are going to need Windows, but plenty will. That China's gently backed its own cut of Ubuntu, dubbed Kylin, also makes it plain Microsoft could face competition in the middle kingdom. Windows-watchers have also found Crozier's words significant, because it's felt Windows Red, as The Register may call this cut, was being developed in parallel to the Windows 10 Creators Update. And if Windows Red is ready, perhaps the Creators Update isn't far behind. The Register has asked Microsoft to explain the security features of Windows Red, but had not received a reply at the time of writing. You know the drill: we'll update this story if Microsoft sends any information. ® Tips and corrections 32 Comments More from The Register SimpliVity does meet-in-the-channel type deal with Huawei Huawei hyper-converged infrastructure appliances running SimpliVity software.

Aibiying translates as ‘welcome each other with love,’ which is the kind of reception that Airbnb may require to compete with local platforms such as Tujia and Xiaozhu. A number of tech companies targeting the Chinese market have had to make adjustments to their traditional business models, including by setting up joint ventures with local partners to gain market access. Qualcomm said last year it was setting up a server chipset design and sales unit with the investment arm of the Guizhou provincial government. Hewlett Packard Enterprise sold a majority stake in its server, technology services and storage business in China to a Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary to boost sales of HPE's enterprise products in the country, while Intel said in 2014 it was planning to invest in local chip companies for the design of mobile phone chips. Ride-hailing company Uber decided the best way in China was to cooperate rather than compete with a large local player Didi Chuxing. It said in August that it had struck a deal with Didi Chuxing, which would acquire all assets of Uber China, including its brand, business operations and data. Didi Chuxing would also acquire a minority equity interest in Uber.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Mythic raises $8.8 million to put AI on a chip Bérénice Magistretti@bmagistretti March 22, 2017 12:01 AM Tags: dfj, funding daily, Mythic Above: The Mythic team outside their Austin, Texas office. Image Credit: Mythic While there’s no shortage of hype surrounding artificial intelligence, there’s also no shortage of companies seeking to harness its potential. Mythic is one of them, and it claims to be taking a different approach. The Austin, Texas-based startup wants to move away from the cloud and a dependence on network connections by putting AI-on-a-chip inside smart devices, like security cameras and health wearables. DFJ believes in the potential of this approach to AI and led an $8.8 million round into Mythic that was announced today. The startup has developed both software and microchips to make its AI smarter and faster. Today, artificial neural networks need big server racks powered by graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle complex algorithms. Mythic wants to bypass this by boiling down the processes onto a single microchip. Other startups, like Intel-acquired Movidius, have already taken a stab at this. But Mythic’s founder and CEO, Mike Henry, claims to be taking a unique approach. “If you look at any microchip out there running AI, you typically have memory and processors,” he told VentureBeat in an interview. “We found a way to eliminate the processors and do all the computation inside the memory.” By leaving the binary world of microchips, Mythic is solving the latency component that other cloud solutions are facing. Take Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri for example. Both run on the cloud, so there is a time lapse in their response. “Our dream is to take a Siri or an Alexa and be able to have a conversation where they’re instantly responsive,” said Henry. Mythic’s approach also addresses issues like device battery life and hacking. A single chip consumes far less energy than cloud-based computing processes. Also, these Mythic-powered devices are inherently more secure because they bypass the cloud. “When the AI is local, it’s trusted and secure,” said Henry. “It’s not leaving the device.” Mythic has tapped some early adopters (which it would not disclose) to field test the technology. The startup is looking to bring its chips to smart-home devices, cameras, health wearables, security cameras, and drones. Henry sees many other applications down the line, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality. The startup plans volume shipments of its microchips in mid-2018. Its chip sizes vary depending on the industry and can go from a shirt-sized button for health wearables to the equivalent of a pack of cards for drone cameras. Prices depend on the application. Founded in 2012, Mythic came out of stealth mode today. The startup, formerly known as Isocline, changed its name for several reasons, Henry said, the most notable of which is easier spelling and pronunciation. The new name also carries dramatic effect. “When competition hears about what we do, it’s going to appear like it’s impossible,” said Henry. “One step above epic.” When asked whether AI-powered devices could evolve into Westworld-type bots that develop a conscience, Henry was skeptical. “We’re not quite in a Westworld environment yet, and I’m not going to claim that I’m Anthony Hopkins!” he told us. Just like humans faced billions of years of evolution, AI will also need time to evolve. According to the CEO, AI is currently at a pattern-matching style intelligence rather than human-like intelligence. Steve Jurvetson, a partner at DFJ who has led investments in several machine learning companies, such as Intel-acquired Nervana and Tesla, also sees AI evolving. “When you start to see these hints that we re-create evolutionary biology in a computer, you get the same basic building blocks, the same developmental milestones,” he told VentureBeat in an interview. “It’s kind of spooky!” When discussing Mythic, Jurvetson compared the startup to Minecraft and its complex constructions. “They’ve figured out a way to do the maths that underlines all machine intelligence in a standard flash memory chip,” he said. DFJ was joined by Lux Capital, Data Collective, and AME Cloud Ventures in this round, which initially closed at $5.8 million. But after receiving several unsolicited investments, Mythic accepted notes worth an additional $3 million, which will convert into a Series B round in the future. Mythic plans on having a team of 20 by this summer across its headquarters and its office in Redwood City, California. Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

Yep, with Nvidia GeForce Now Airbnb will rebrand its short-term home rental service in China as “Aibiying” and triple the size of its workforce in the country as it tries to woo a large but complex market for foreign tech companies. Aibiying translates as ‘welcome each other with love,’ which is the kind of reception that Airbnb may require to compete with local platforms such as Tujia and Xiaozhu. A number of tech companies targeting the Chinese market have had to make adjustments to their traditional business models, including by setting up joint ventures with local partners to gain market access. Qualcomm said last year it was setting up a server chipset design and sales unit with the investment arm of the Guizhou provincial government. Hewlett Packard Enterprise sold a majority stake in its server, technology services and storage business in China to a Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary to boost sales of HPE's enterprise products in the country, while Intel said in 2014 it was planning to invest in local chip companies for the design of mobile phone chips. Ride-hailing company Uber decided the best way in China was to cooperate rather than compete with a large local player Didi Chuxing. It said in August that it had struck a deal with Didi Chuxing, which would acquire all assets of Uber China, including its brand, business operations and data. Didi Chuxing would also acquire a minority equity interest in Uber. In 2015, two investors - China Broadband Capital (CBC) and Sequoia China - were brought in by Airbnb to help it continue to navigate the Chinese market and create a localized presence for the company. That plan is being continued now with a brand name that locals can relate to, and which sounds similar to its global brand. The company, which recently received a fresh infusion of US$1 billion of funds, also announced the expansion of its Trips and Experiences service in China, which tries to go beyond the usual tourist experience by offering app users access to a list of interesting activities such as local handicrafts and cuisine. It also said it was increasing the number of engineers at its engineering center in the country, which is the only one outside the U.S. Airbnb has also worked on the integration of local payment methods such as Alipay and sign up options such as WeChat, besides providing 24 X 7 customer support in Mandarin. It has also sought partnerships with cities, having signed memoranda of understanding with Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chongqing and Guangzhou. Airbnb has about 80,000 listings in China and has seen nearly 1.6 million guest arrivals at these listings. The company has more than 3 million listings in more than 190 countries around the world. The company had so far focused largely on outbound Chinese tourists. To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

But if there’s one near-term issue they are all grappling with is getting access to integrated DOCSIS 3.1-based gateways that enable the in-home network to match the speeds that are entering the home from the network and eliminating those potential bottlenecks. The availability of DOCSIS 3.1 gateways is a “little behind” where Mediacom Communications would like it to be, JR Walden, SVP of technology and CTO of Mediacom, said here at Light Reading’s Cable Next-Gen Technologies & Strategies conference. In fact, in-home WiFi testing is becoming a major focus for DOCSIS 3.1 rollouts, added Cyrille Morelle, president and CEO of test and measurement firm VeEX. “Having a very powerful WiFi device is critical” for DOCSIS 3.1, agreed Damian Poltz, VP of technology strategy and networks at Shaw Communications. Comcast is trying to address this with the XB6, a full-featured DOCSIS 3.1 gateway that will also integrate speedy WiFi, ZigBee and other connectivity technologies. For its initial D3.1 deployments, Comcast has been pairing stand-alone modems with a separate gateway to serve “thousands of customers.” While acknowledging that such a set-up is not ideal, Jorge Salinger, VP of access architecture at Comcast, confirmed that Comcast is building versions of the XB6 that use Broadcom and Intel chipsets. He said Comcast is completing employee trials shifting toward customer trials and on to commercial deployments, which are expected to begin in the next month or so. RELATED: Comcast Taps Arris, Technicolor for ‘XB6’ Gateways: Sources Vendors such as Hitron Technologies are building and developing DOCSIS 3.1-based gateways and network extenders to help bridge that gap. Hitron, said company CTO Greg Fisher, has about 30 D3.1 gateway trials underway around the world. RELATED: Rogers Rolling Out Hitron’s DOCSIS 3.1 Gateway Short-term gateway issues aside, MSOs are pleased with the performance they’ve seen from DOCSIS 3.1 in the early going. DOCSIS 3.1 is working “really well” regardless of now clean the HFC plant is or the size of the node sizes that are serving customers. “It [DOCSIS 3.1] works better than 3.0 in noisy plant,” said Walden. Mediacom has already upgraded its entire HFC network to support DOCSIS 3.1 and is in the process of deploying D3.1-based broadband services. RELATED: Mediacom Goes Big With DOCSIS 3.1 Walden said the economics of D3.1 has been a major driver for Mediacom after it analyzed assumed broadband capacity demand and how much it would cost to stay with DOCSIS 3.0 to keep up with it, or start to shift to D3.1. (DOCSIS 3.1 modems are hybrids in the sense that they can support both D3.0 and D3.1-based traffic.) He said Mediacom expects to get better economics for all tiers of service, not just billboard 1-Gig services. Mediacom isn’t pinpointing how many subscribers are taking the MSO’s fastest offered speed tier, but Walden offered a range that 3% to 10% of new subs are taking 1-Gig. Salinger said DOCSIS 3.1’s ability to support multiple modulation profiles is a “significant benefit” as Comcast continues to expand its reach. RELATED: Comcast Sets DOCSIS 3.1 Expansion, Launches 1-Gig in Detroit “It’s in full swing of execution,” he said of that deployment. “The idea is to have gigabit service everywhere.” Salinger also talked about the importance of an MSO having its own speed test tools to show or demonstrate that D3.1 is performing at the right levels as some subscribers don’t have in-home equipment that can support 1-Gig.

Shenzhen-based ZTE's recent settlement with the US government over its violation of long-standing trade sanctions on Iran and North Korea reflects how vital the American supply chain means to the Chinese company. The importance extends to US companies like Qualcomm Technologies, which provides chips used in smartphones, as well as Xilinx and Intel subsidiary Altera Corp for their chips used in mobile base stations. But ZTE is not the sole Chinese technology company that depends on integrated circuits from foreign suppliers. Lenovo Group, Huawei Technologies and smartphone maker BBK Electronics are huge buyers of foreign technologies. These three companies were ranked among the world’s 10 largest customers of semiconductor products last year, spending a combined US$28.55 billion, up from US$23.65 billion in 2015, according to Gartner’s data. The US sanctions case may have given ZTE an opportunity to step up its own research and development efforts, supporting the Chinese government’s aggressive push to accelerate the expansion of a home-grown chip industry. The company’s goal is to provide itself with more key components to replace those that it buys from foreign suppliers, according to Jefferies equity analyst Edison Lee. The firm’s strategy in designing chipsets used on smartphones, for example, is focused on technology leadership, Lee said. “These chipsets, however, are lower-end products,” he said. “They will need more research and development to be able to design chipsets for high-end handsets.” ZTE declined to comment for this article. The company, through subsidiary ZTE Microelectronics Technology Co, designs chipsets deployed in base stations used by telecommunications network operators to support wireless access over multiple frequency bands. It also develops semiconductor products used in smartphones and other mobile devices destined for the mainland as well as to Brazil, Indonesia and Russia. Contract chip manufacturers build these products for ZTE. This ZTE business has more than 2,000 research and development staff on the mainland and the US. It’s currently developing chips with so-called 28-nanometre technology. A nanometre, equal to a billionth of a metre, is the unit of measurement for a specific chip fabrication process. Jefferies’ Lee said efforts by ZTE and other mainland companies to advance their semiconductor capabilities are in line with the priorities of China’s 13th Five-Year Plan, which targets global leadership status for the country in chip design and manufacturing, software development and in building the core components of mobile broadband equipment. In 2015, the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund invested 2.4 billion yuan (US$347 million) in ZTE’s semiconductor business in exchange for a 24 per cent equity stake. The fund was established in 2014 to help finance and push forward the central government’s policy to build an advanced domestic semiconductor industry.

The school’s Dragon BBS, which is managed by nine student system operator, is in its third year of operation. “We have had a huge response from students,” said the school’s technology coordinator, David Elliott. “We thought of it initially as a project for technically oriented and advanced students but it has become a community resource for teachers and students. It is highly motivational.” There are about 1300 users of the International School’s BBS – about a third of the student population of 650 use it while the rest are parents and outside users. The most obvious educational application of the Dragon BBS is in its conference set-up, where students and teachers communicate on curriculum subjects in purpose-built files. Students can pass ideas to their teachers for comment and receive assignments using the system. Many students also use the conference facility to bounce ideas off each other. Popular recent topics have included issues related to Amnesty International, the environment and the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China The BBS is linked to the school’s electronic library facilities stored on CD-ROM and carries thousands of non-copyright files for users. Through its Fidonet function, users can access other BBS services around the world. There are plans to expand the facilities offered on the Dragon BBS – one of the next services added will be Intel, which is currently running on a pilot scheme accessible only by teachers. The BBS runs on the school’s Novell network which links the three computer rooms. There are about 1000 log-ons per day. The system has 10 lines and is comfortable with up to 50 users logged on simultaneously but, despite this, it suffers from peak period congestion. Peak hours tend to be between 5pm and 9pm during the week and 11pm and midnight on weekends – there is an elaborate messaging function which provides much of the social side to the BBS. International school is keen to encourage more widespread use of BBSs in schools. “It would be great if other schools in Hong Kong would take the plunge,” Mr Elliott said. According to the International School, telephone lines are one of the main costs involved in setting up a BBS. The labour involved in caring for the updating the system is mostly free – and fun – for the nine system operators involved. Senior student and system operator Randolph Chung said it was time well spent. “We learn a lot of technical things. Sometimes we have to write programs for specific tasks. I think I have learned a lot.” Operators also gain interpersonal skills dealing with BBS uses and each other in maintaining and updating the system. On the broad educational front, language is one area where the BBS has shown noticeable results. Mr Elliott said teachers had noticed marked improvement in students’ language skills since the BBS was introduced. Many students practice foreign languages on the BBS and there is the added reinforcing aspect of everything they write being public. According to Mr Elliot, the teacher of one modern language estimated that writing program was about twice as rapid for students using the BBS. System operator Eddie Tom explained: “Writing on-screen is faster. It is more smooth and you don’t have to be held up like you are writing with a pen. And it is easier for the teacher to read.” Free time was important for students to take full advantage, Mr Elliott said. International School gave students an average of one free period a day which many used to log on to the BBS.  Proficiency in English is another prerequisite, but it is not a problem at schools like Hong Kong International. Other local schools have hesitated to introduce BBS because students have tended to regard using English-based systems as an assignment rather than fun. Mr Elliott said this represented a challenge to BBS supporters to bring users not fluent in English on the system at a different level. Some schools have a BBS run by students at home without the institution’s support. The International School BBS people believe the school’s support is vital. They said it is important to have a heavy component of student management in the system, regardless of the level of support from the school. Fear that the BBS would be used to encourage pornography, piracy and non-educational chatting could be behind some resistance among schools to the idea, the International School students said. The first two evils, at least, are policed out of the Dragon BBS. Non-educational communications proliferate on the BBS but Mr Elliott said the social side of the BBS was inseparable from the educational. One fear less easy to calm was fear of computers, which Mr Chung said was a big factor in resistance to BBS use. The spread the message that BBS can be valuable in education, yet set up at relatively low cost, members of the CLASS link system are organizing a convention to be held in June where school principals and teachers will be able to get some hands-on experience with the service. CLASS link – it stands for computerized Linked Association of Students and Schools – has 15 school-based BBS users as members.   Most Popular Viewed 1 How China’s overseas property dream turned into a nightmare 2 Chinese QR code scams shine spotlight on consumer security 3 Tillerson warns of US military strike on North Korea 4 MTR to offer 3 per cent fare rebates and retain price formula 5 Hong Kong bans imports of Brazilian meat amid safety scandal Shared 1 How China’s overseas property dream turned into a nightmare 2 Chinese QR code scams shine spotlight on consumer security 3 MTR to offer 3 per cent fare rebates and retain price formula 4 Singapore, Hong Kong ranked world’s most expensive cities 5 Hong Kong bans imports of Brazilian meat amid safety scandal Commented 1 Will the next chief executive be gutsy enough to tackle the mainland invasion? 2 Activist Ken Tsang to vote for Hong Kong’s next leader from jail 3 No mutual trust between Lam and us, 24 pan-democrats claim 4 MTR to offer 3 per cent fare rebates and retain price formula 5 Japan or China?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile TSMC’s 7nm Risk Production Will Start In April; 7nm+ Will Use EUV, With 1.2x Logic Density & 10% Performance Boost Over 7nm By Ramish Zafar Mar 20, 2017 24Shares Share Tweet Submit The talk of 2017 is 10nm. The advanced manufacturing technology will make its way to processors for flagship smartphones and will outperform its predecessor. The main focus for 10nm will be power efficiency, rather than performance. In fact, Qualcomm hopes that 80% of the Snapdragon 835’s load will go through the low power performance cores. 7nm however, will mark a true jump in performance. TSMC recently talked about its advances with the processor. Take a look below to find out more. TSMC Will Use EUV On Advanced Versions Of 7nm – First Generation Risk Production Will Commence Next Month After Samsung, now Taiwanese fab TSMC has shared a lot of details for progress on 7nm. The highly risky nature of the tech industry allows no room to slow down. Even as one product is going out, the next is under significant R&D. It’s 7nm’s turn for the spotlight today. TSMC claims a lot of improvements made on its plans for the process. The manufacturer reports 76% yields on 256Mbit SRAM modules manufactured on 7nm. The manufacturer also claims that an ARM Cortex A72 processor in the node exceeded 4GHz in frequency. Related TSMC Will Decide To Build U.S. Fab Next Year, According To Spokesman; Plant Estimated At $16 Billion Following this progress, TSMC will commence risk production for first generation 7nm process next month. The fab will generate a total of 20 tapeouts for this year. The Cortex A72 processor which exceeded 4GHz, utilized the company’s 7nm HPC platform. This is an upgraded form of 7nm and features high performance transistors that guarantee a 5% speed gain over basic 7nm. 7nm in general will deliver 3.3x increased router gate density and a trade-off between 60% less power or 35% processing speed. 10nm & Outlook: “Bulk semiconductor technology has been enhanced for 30 years and is used by Intel and Samsung,” the world’s two largest chip makers. FD-SOI will always be the technology of the future said Mark Liu, TSMC’s co-chief executive. The fab will also release an ultra-low power variant of its 12nm FinFET. This will carry consumption of 0.5V and will enter risk production by June. TSMC’s got a lot of ambitious plans and a lot of variants of its processes. Advertisement The company is also bracing fully to support Apple’s requirements for 10nm. An executive believes that 10nm wafer volume will exceed 16nm this year, with a total of 400,000 wafers expected in the same time period. According to TSMC, the 10nm wafer will have a trade off between 10% increased speed or 25% improvement in power consumption. Finally, the company also expect 5nm volume production to commence in 2020. 5nm will be the next big jump after 7nm, as processors continue to shrink nodes. Related AMD Ryzen 5 Mainstream Processors Confirmed For April 11th Launch – 6 Core Ryzen 5 1600X To Cost $249, 4 Core Ryzen 5 1500X To Cost $189 7nm+ With EUV: The big announcement is TSMC’s decision to use EUV for advanced 7nm variants. The company achieved 125W using its EUV system on 7nm. With this, the fab hopes to achieve 250W on 7nm+, in 2019. 7nm+ with EUV will enter mass production by 2019. The major focus for next year will be 7nm, with manufacturers like Apple waiting in line for the annual technology upgrade cycle. 7nm+ will feature 1.2x times logic density and a trade-off between 10% speed increase or 15% power efficiency over its predecessor, 7nm. “We believe we will be the first one to use EUV in volume production.” according to an executive. Risk production will start by June 2018. With this, the company hopes to beat Samsung. The Korean tech giant promises EUV for fabrication by 2019. Finally, TSMC also elaborated on its unique InFO (Integrated FanOut) design. The company is developing multiple versions for InFO, including support for HPC with 65mm2 substrates. Finally, the company hopes to separate its processes on a functional basis, covering automobiles, smartphones, IoT and others separately. Thoughts?

Yet, in the words of the Journal, Trump “clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle.” And that’s only the tip of the iceberg, because the editorial calls Trump “his own worst political enemy” and says his falsehoods and credibility issues will continue to hurt him: If President Trump announces that North Korea launched a missile that landed within 100 miles of Hawaii, would most Americans believe him? Would the rest of the world? We’re not sure, which speaks to the damage that Mr. Trump is doing… Two months into his Presidency, Gallup has Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 39%. No doubt Mr. Trump considers that fake news, but if he doesn’t show more respect for the truth most Americans may conclude he’s a fake President. Trump will likely respond on Twitter, given how he’s slammed the Journal and its editorial board in the past: The @WSJ Wall Street Journal loves to write badly about me.

It does not matter whether they developed and owned the next big thing in technology, or they got the backing of renowned venture capital (VC) funds, or niche sales networks. The majority will inevitably fail, and the lucky few will manage to survive just a little longer. The very small minorities statistically seen as the outliers become so epic that they disrupt and change the world. Bill Gates once mentioned that he was not afraid of large companies coming up with new technologies, but of small entrepreneurs working from their garages trying to cook up disruption after a series of failures. The world has seen those outliers mostly born in Silicon Valley in the U.S. Israel is another tech center that had many failures. But those failures led the very few exceptional startups across the chasm and become disruptive. Yozma Group, an Israeli VC, examines whether startups' founders and their teams had experienced failure before investing in them, Yozma Group Korea CEO Lee Won-jae said. "We look at that as one of the most important key criteria simply because we strongly believe failure breeds success," Lee said in an interview at Yozma office in Pangyo, Gyeonggi Province. Yozma's investment strategy has so far worked. More than 80 Israeli startups Yozma's VC funds invested in went public on the NASDAQ in the U.S. This is the second highest after Chinese companies' NASDAQ listing. The country is home to more than 200 research and development (R&D) centers of multinational tech companies including Intel and Google. Israel's history of failure, conflict and risk is what made it a startup nation. Disruptive land Surrounded by Arabic countries and facing persistent conflict with Palestine, most people recognize Israel as a war zone rather than land of entrepreneurs. Many relate Israel to a country that has to endure constant threats from its neighbors; a country with Mossad agents and Special Forces to counter these threats; or the Holy Land depicted in the Bible. About 70 percent of Israel is desert. It had no resources to sustain its economy, other than oil shale it discovered in recent years. In the 1990s in the aftermath of the Gulf War, the Middle East energy crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's economy was in deep turmoil. It had an extremely high youth unemployment rate and debt. People's anxiety was running high, and confidence was running low. It needed to find a breakthrough. The solution was using its history and culture of risk-taking and countermeasures to embrace innovation and reinvent Israel. Due to continuing regional conflicts, Israel's defense technology is top of the line. It encouraged those who served in the military to start business with its defense technology. "This led to the creation of the world's first car phone by a military officer. Israel's radar-guided missile technology was used in health care for the development of capsules," Lee said. The country's innovative ecosystem quickly expanded with hospitals and universities getting involved to further develop it into a startup nation. Lee noted that it was not easy in the beginning up to the establishment of Yozma Group in 1993. "There were concerns and opposition. People and politicians were saying there is no money to set up a VC fund," Lee said. After much debate, Israel passed a bill to provide 40 percent of Yozma's $265 million fund. The rest came from the U.S. and European VCs. "What was notable then was that the Israeli government said this fund should be managed and operated by the private sector. The state only wanted to get involved to coordinate in case it failed," Lee said. "Yozma would like to bring its experience and share it with Korean startups as the two countries share similarities," he added. Reinventing Korea Like Israel in the 1990s, Korea faces uncertainty as it has a high youth jobless rate and keeps on depending on debt to maintain the economy. Not only is its population aging, but also its industries, some of which are going through restructuring to stay afloat. Also, South Korea constantly finds itself in dispute with China, Japan and North Korea. Lee, who came to Korea three years ago from Israel, said Yozma is set to help Korea reinvent itself with a 50 billion won fund for high-tech startups. It has been busy establishing networks and ecosystems with local universities and state agencies over the past three years. The fund will be launched in May. Its ecosystem will enable potential startups to grow and achieve growth through various stages. For instance, Yozma has a crowd funding platform that will help startups make their business ideas into commercial reality. Its incubation and acceleration programs will provide mentorship in areas such as finance, legal, sales and marketing to systematize their business. Yozma's VC fund will come in the third stage where it will invest in startups to further help them grow in the market. Then, it will invite other VC funds or private equities via Yozma's global networks to invest in those startups. The last stage will enable startups to go public or be sold to multinational companies, which will provide an exit for investors. This may be easier said than done, especially in Korea where there is some animosity toward selling a company to a foreign buyer. This is why Lee said Yozma will only invest in startups that have the potential to grow overseas. "As we look at startups' technology potential and their teams' past failure experience, Yozma will also evaluate whether they have a global business mindset," Lee said. "The days are gone when we used to think that if you succeed here, you can succeed overseas. That aged formula no longer works in the new age because markets and technologies change faster than we know." Taking into account Yozma's history of its investment and exit strategies for Israeli startups, all of its successfully invested companies either went public on the NASDAQ or were sold to global tech heavyweights like Google, Intel, Qualcomm and Cisco. "Israeli startups that were sold to global companies turned into their key R&D centers. That is why there are more than 200 R&D centers there," Lee said, noting that Samsung Electronics has two R&D centers in Israel through mergers and acquisitions. "We are going to help Korean startups go global first, and help them list on the NASDAQ or sell to bigger companies in the long term. We have no interest in companies that only seek to grow, list or sell locally," Lee said. Fashion followers In order to achieve this, Lee said Korean entrepreneurs need to change not only their mindset, but also become what he calls "fast fashion followers." They have to be highly aware of global IT trends, and move fast to immediately adopt them for global ventures, he said. Koreans are fast, they are highly aware of what's hot and what's not and even bring in the newest fashion from Italy and New York much faster than Japan, Lee said. In the tech sector, it is the same. There were Pandora TV, Cyworld and Dialpad in Korea before there were YouTube, Facebook and Skype. But Korean startups lack the capacity to venture and see opportunities first beyond borders as they still adhere to old ways of thinking and doing. Waze and Loc&All are both startups that developed and launched navigation apps around the same time. But Waze was an Israeli startup that was sold to Google for $1.15 billion. Loc&All's Kimgisa, which means "Driver Kim" in Korean, was sold to Kakao for about $55 million. Kakao's acquisition of Loc&All was recognized as one of Korea's biggest startup M&As, but not quite from a global perspective. "The big difference was that Waze focused on the U.S. and European traffic markets from the very beginning, while Loc&All only focused here," Lee said. Should Loc&All's Kimgisa ventured abroad like Waze did, it would have been worth at least $670 million, he noted. High-tech companies Yozma will be eyeing Korean startups in biotechnology, health care, financial technology, cybersecurity and materials. "As said before, we look at their technology potential as one of key criteria for investment. This is because they would have the competitive advantage to venture overseas without facing any intellectual property issues," Lee said. In materials, Yozma is particularly keen on investing in startups applying graphene technology, which scientists say has the potential to revolutionize practically all areas including energy, biotechnology, aviation and automobiles. The Israeli VC fund is set to select about 30 startups via its programs every fiscal quarter. "Yozma has been doing this for more than 20 years. We will use our vast networks and information pool to provide the support needed for startups here to go global like Israelis," Lee said. hyongki@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter [LIVE] Sewol emerges from water after 1073 days Seoul ranks No. 3 among cities with worst air pollution Mobile carriers fined for wooing expats with illegal benefits [LIVE] Sewol seen above water after 1073 days Park could face up to 45 years in prison Park under interrogation over corruption scandal N.

NSA Source Says He Will ‘Die In Prison’ For Russia Scandal Nathan Francis Donald Trump could be headed to prison at the end of his Russia scandal, with one intelligence official predicting that the president will “die in prison” after the case comes to fruition and charges are brought. The links between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials appear to be growing more clear each week, with evidence emerging that Trump and his team may have colluded with Russian agents to release damaging information on Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton. During the 2016 campaign, the site WikiLeaks published a number of damaging emails from both Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta, and the Democratic National Committee. The emails helped to drive a rift between Clinton supporters and those supporting Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, and were cited as factor in Trump winning the election. For months, there were reports that Donald Trump’s team was actively working with Russian agents to release the information. A dossier compiled by a former British MI6 agent claimed that the Russian government had been cultivating Trump for years, gathering compromising information to use as blackmail and offering Trump lucrative financial deals. The report also claimed that Trump worked with Russians to coordinate the release of the emails to WikiLeaks. There is now more evidence to support that idea. On Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, claimed that there is “more than circumstantial evidence now” showing active collusion between Donald Trump and Russia. “I can tell you that the case is more than that,” Schiff said in an interview on MSNBC (via Politico). “And I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now.” Top Intel Dem: Evidence of Trump team collusion with Russia is "more than circumstantial" https://t.co/cnqRLlIf8C pic.twitter.com/0BQwXx0PXC — The Hill (@thehill) March 23, 2017 This comes just two days after FBI Director James Comey confirmed that there is an active investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign actively worked with Russia. As CNN reported on Wednesday night, U.S. intelligence sources said that the FBI did have evidence of such communications. “The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, US officials told CNN,” the report noted. “This is partly what FBI Director James Comey was referring to when he made a bombshell announcement Monday before Congress that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, according to one source.” 'This is a bizarre situation:' McCain says Congress no longer has 'credibility' to conduct Trump-Russia probe alone https://t.co/VpXO1CjrmI — Business Insider (@businessinsider) March 22, 2017 The reports of the unraveling Russia scandal has led to speculation that Donald Trump could end up in prison for his role, a prediction that had already started to trickle out more than a month ago. Former NSA analyst John Schindler claimed that the intelligence community was ready to “go nuclear” in releasing evidence of Trump’s collusion with Russia in response to the president taking shots at the intelligence community over Twitter. “Now we go nuclear,” Schindler wrote on Twitter. “[Intelligence community] war going to new levels. Just got an [email from] senior [intelligence community] friend, it began: ‘He will die in jail.'” It is not yet clear if Trump or anyone from his campaign will face charges from the Russia scandal, and even less clear whether Donald Trump could actually be headed to prison. As of yet, the FBI has not officially divulged any actual details about the investigation, including whether the focus is on Trump or other campaign members. Trump and his campaign associates have denied any involvement with Russia.

According to a report from Pamela Brown, Evan Perez, and Shimon Prokupecz, anonymous U.S. officials said that the FBI is reviewing the following information as part of the investigation disclosed by James Comey this week: The FBI is now reviewing that information, which includes human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings, according to those U.S. officials. The information is raising the suspicions of FBI counterintelligence investigators that the coordination may have taken place, though officials cautioned that the information was not conclusive and that the investigation is ongoing. And including the last part above, there are several caveats and qualifiers in CNN’s report: One law enforcement official said the information in hand suggests “people connected to the campaign were in contact and it appeared they were giving the thumbs up to release information when it was ready.” But other U.S. officials who spoke to CNN say it’s premature to draw that inference from the information gathered so far since it’s largely circumstantial. The FBI cannot yet prove that collusion took place, but the information suggesting collusion is now a large focus of the investigation, the officials said. Sources also said, according to the report, that one of the “obstacles” here is that “communications between Trump’s associates and Russians have ceased in recent months.” This report comes hours after House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes publicly spoke about “incidental collection” of Trump team communications by intel agencies. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, criticized Nunes for his actions and said on MSNBC earlier that “there is evidence that is not circumstantial” on the Russia investigation. Sean Spicer said during Monday’s press briefing––following significant remarks from Comey––that people are continuing to “look for something that doesn’t exist” and that “investigating it and having proof of it are two separate things.” [image via screengrab] — — Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com Follow Mediaite Follow @mediaite Like us on Facebook filed under CNN, Donald Trump, FBI, Russia Around the Web Sign up for the Mediaite newsletter What's Popular ‘A Desperate Act’: Watch Skip Bayless Condemn Trump For Taking Shots at Colin Kaepernick During Rally Nobody Can Believe Sarah Palin Is Mad at Colin Kaepernick For Donating to Meals on Wheels Trump Lawyers Send Cease and Desist Order to Teen Who Operates Site That Shows Kittens Punching Him (UPDATED) ‘What You’re Saying Now Is Alternative Fact!’: CNN’s Don Lemon Clashes With Matt Lewis ‘Shameful’: Scarborough Blasts House GOP in Comey Hearing Tips Have a tip or story idea?

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Here launches Mobility On-Demand, a toolkit for developers building ride-hailing and food delivery apps. — Here handout pic via AFP-RelaxnewsSAN FRANCISCO, March 23 — Here, the automotive industry-owned mapping and location services company is launching a new set of tools that will let any developer easily build and launch an app that needs location-specific features. It means that if a small company or individual wants to build an on-demand delivery business or launch a ride-hailing feature, for example, they can now turn to Here instead of Google Maps. “Congestion, roadworks and bad addressing are a constant headache for companies operating in a complex market where every single minute makes a difference. Our new toolkit brings together a set of advanced location capabilities to help developers address these challenges and make their app stand above the rest,” said Leon van de Pas, Head of Internet of Things at Here. If developers choose to simply use the full suite of Here tools and host their service within the company’s existing consumer app, they can literally bring their app from idea to reality in a matter of days. All of the complex calculations, from figuring out where a delivery point or a customer really is, to navigating the most efficient route and building in contingencies for traffic flows, is taken care of. Once part of Nokia, Here was purchased by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015 in an attempt to put space between the auto industry and Google’s mapping and location services. Over the past 18 months Intel has also come on board and the company has started developing next generation 3D maps that will be crucial for autonomous vehicles. However, cars are just one element and the company wants to expand into all aspects of location and mobility, making connections between internet-enabled things as we enter a future of smart homes, connected cars and on-demand services. This wider view is also why car companies from Audi and VW to BMW and Ford are starting to reposition themselves as mobility service providers as much as car builders. VW expects to have 100 million customers by 2025 that are patrons of its connected services and apps rather than VW group car drivers. Even connected cars being built today are opening up 10 times as many potential revenues streams for carmakers than other vehicles that don’t have latest-generation infotainment or web services on board. Therefore the launch of this new developer kit should be seen as a very big first step towards this long-term goal. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Smartphone device can test sperm quality Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Montblanc just launched a smartwatch — here’s why it matters China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Google allows users to share their locations in mapping app Google Street Maps takes cameras into the bowels of the earth: Volcanoes Nur Jazlan: Waze, Google Maps help people more than terrorists Umno MP: Waze, Google Maps expose Malaysia to possible US, Israel threats Keep an eye on traffic with Bing maps Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 The House Intelligence chief just tossed a huge wrench into Trump-related investigations Allan Smith Mar. 22, 2017, 7:56 PM 31,813 facebook linkedin twitter email print Rep. Devin Nunes. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Rep. Devin Nunes on Wednesday threw a huge wrench into the middle of the investigations surrounding President Donald Trump, Trump's claims of being wiretapped by his predecessor, and Russia's meddling in the US election. And he now finds himself in a central role after making Republicans and Democrats alike scratch their heads over what appeared to be an unprecedented move. Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, called for a sudden 1 p.m. ET press gathering Wednesday, with its subject unclear. But once it began, he fired off what sounded like a bombshell revelation: The intelligence community, he said, had "incidentally collected" information on the Trump transition team during the transition period. The California Republican went on to say the collection occurred on "numerous occasions" and was not related to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. "Details about US persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting," Nunes said. The information he spoke of was collected legally, in his view, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and he said he did not know whether the surveillance consisted of phone calls but that the intelligence reports he had seen "clearly show" Trump and his team were "monitored." Another wrinkle: The White House, he said, was unaware of what he was describing to the press. So after the conclusion of his impromptu briefing, he went to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to alert the president and his administration. Following his White House meeting, Nunes stood outside for another press conference. While he said this information did not in any way prove Trump's inflammatory, evidence-free Twitter claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped phones at Trump Tower before the election, Nunes said he had "no idea" whether the collection was intentional spying on behalf of the government. "We won't know that until we get to the bottom of did people ask for the unmasking of additional names in President Trump's transition team," he said. A member of Trump's transition team, Nunes finds himself leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's effort to manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. It was during a hearing Monday in front of Nunes' committee that FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the bureau had been investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government since late July. Comey also said the FBI and the Department of Justice could provide no evidence to back up Trump's explosive claim that Obama wiretapped him. But Nunes, in his White House press conference, said he found nothing wrong with briefing the president on information that could be related to an ongoing investigation into members of his administration and campaign team. "Because what I saw had nothing to do with Russia and the Russian investigation," Nunes said. "It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities, and the president needs to know these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that." Many others didn't see it this way. Luke Russert, a former Capitol Hill reporter for NBC, said that the episode was "insane" and that in seven years covering Congress he "never saw something like this from" an intelligence chair. "This is very dangerous. I have trouble seeing somebody like Mike Rogers doing this," Russert tweeted, referring to the former chairman of that committee. "Intel Chairmen don't act like this." Evan McMullin, a former CIA operative who ran as an independent in the 2016 presidential campaign, said that with Nunes saying the communications were "incidentally collected," the real question was, "Who was Trump talking to?" "If what Devin Nunes says is true, Trump was communicating with persons of intelligence or criminal interest," he tweeted. "This is Devin Nunes doing President Trump and Congressional Republicans a favor by muddying the waters on the Trump/Russia investigation." Joe Scarborough, the former Republican congressman who hosts MSNBC's "Morning Joe," tweeted that Nunes' actions were cause for him to be removed as chair of the committee. And David Jolly, a former Republican congressman who has been fiercely critical of Trump in recent days, tweeted that Nunes and the entirety of the House GOP had "zero credibility now." "Blew it," he wrote. Rep. Adam Schiff of California, he continued, had become "the cerebral hero of this investigation." Rep. Adam Schiff. Win McNamee/Getty Images Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, seemed flabbergasted about Nunes' move during an early-evening press conference in which he essentially said Nunes' Wednesday moves soiled their panel's investigation. The California Democrat said he hadn't seen or heard of the reports Nunes spoke of before he discussed the matter with the media, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Trump. "The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he's going to act as a surrogate of the White House," Schiff said. "Because he cannot do both." He would not say whether Nunes had disclosed classified information, but he did call the disclosure "highly irregular and probably inappropriate." "Unfortunately I think the actions of today throw great doubt into the ability of both the chairman and the committee to conduct the investigation," he said. "I've expressed these grave concerns with the chairman." Schiff said the disclosure heightened the necessity for an investigation to take place by a fully independent body. He even went as far to suggest the move could be a part of a broader conspiracy. "I'm not sure what the point of this extraordinary process is, and I have to hope that this is not part of a broader campaign by the White House aimed to deflect" from Comey's testimony, he said. President Donald Trump. Getty Images Trump's allies took the Wednesday news as word that the president was vindicated for his earlier assertion about Obama, which earned him scorn across the political spectrum and led the sitting FBI director to publicly rebuke the claims. Fox News host Sean Hannity took to Twitter after the Nunes episode to declare victory over the "destroy Trump media" and asked whether anyone doubted that American journalism was "dead." "Devin Nunes confirms SURVEILLANCE VS @POTUS," he wrote. "Sara Carter, John Solomon, @seanhannity right again. Destroy Trump media wrong again." He later added, mentioning White House chief strategist Steve Bannon: "Any doubts journalism in America is DEAD? Alt left propaganda destroy @realDonaldTrump media is the opposition party. Bannon correct." Asked about the Nunes revelations after meeting with the intelligence chair, Trump expressed his appreciation for the California Republican rushing to tell him what he found. Did he feel vindicated for his widely panned claims? "I somewhat do," he said.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / The Waaayyyy Too Late March Newsletter The Waaayyyy Too Late March Newsletter Posted on March 22, 2017 by Sylva International LLC in Press Releases By Ross Silver, Chief Entertainment Officer (CEO) at Sylva Intl BEND, OR / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2017 / It is March 22nd and I have been hearing it from those of you who are subscribers asking me if I am still alive as the newsletter has not been published. I am still alive, I just have had an insanely busy month with too much travel and not enough time to write. The equity markets have been full of tells over the past couple of months and one of the tells is that small cap is out and large cap is in, meaning the dam is about to break and the market will move considerably lower, right? Small caps have always been a bellwether for the broad market and when small cap liquidity evaporates (as it has) and stock prices move lower (most have) that means trouble, right? I say wrong and before you conventionalists start throwing stuff at your screen, hear me out. In the past 365 days, the Russell 2000 (the “small cap index”) is up a modest 25% (that is a joke, a 25% return is not modest it’s amazing) and is it out of line to say people are profit taking? I mean, if I am up 25%+ in any position I am 99.9% of the time taking profit taking unless I have incredible conviction in that name and I view the 25% as being just the beginning. When it comes to small cap stocks as a group, you are not the sharpest tool in the shed if you are not taking profits on a 25% gain FOR AN INDEX in 365 days, that is not be giving advice, that is me writing about common sense. So, I believe this is profit taking and any panic selling (which I love) that occurs is an opportunity, so have cash, always have cash! Another tell I have noticed is just about every professional economist sees minimal downside risk and volatility for the foreseeable future. Well that is what they were saying in February and now some are revising their volatility prediction. I mean can these professional market experts blow any more in the wind with their predictions and “brilliance”? It seems like an economist putting their foot down and making a call is about as solid as a stack of feathers. I have stated that I am bullish and will remain a bull until equities as an asset (note the use of the word asset) class are less attractive than anything else. The Fed is working to make fixed income relevant again with rate hikes, like we saw last week, but until such time as rates are paying me at least 2% RISK FREE, how are you not in equities if you have investment income and only in equities? I am sure I will get some colorful emails from those of you reading this that are economics professors, economists and others that I argue with regarding this subject matter. For the record, I love the back and forth with those who think I have no idea what I am writing about, with that said the poking fun is always in fun but with a purpose to convince me. I can guarantee an email is being drafted right now by a prominent East Coast economics professor who believes fixed income remains an asset (again note the use of the word asset) class and one that needs to be invested in now per his thoughts as risk free yield is better than no yield. Sorry, minimal yield or anything less than 2% risk free (some would argue 3%) is negative yield in my book and anyone willing to invest in negative yields needs to be lobotomized. Random Musings I am becoming a politics junkie and it is mortifying. I find myself glued to the television any time our President aka the Donald speaks. To his credit, he called out our former President for spying on him and it looks like he was right. House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes today stated, “some of what I’ve seen seems to be inappropriate” as it related to Trump spying. Hello bombshell. I mean the political ramifications of espionage on Trump by the Obama White House are MASSIVE. The Democrats must be emptying the shelf of every store that sells heart burn medication. As for Russia and its interference in our election, can you name an election in any country that the U.S. or other countries have not tried to influence. I mean why are members of the media only focusing on Russia and why aren’t we looking at every Presidential election ever held in this country? I am more worried about lobbyists than Russia. Speaking of lobbyists, R.I.P to the EPA, those budget cuts were egregious in my view. NCAA tourneys are in full swing and man is the tourney a lot of fun because the games all matter but the basketball is awful. The NCAA should really think about its brand because the product is awful. Watching 18 and 19 year old kids jack up threes incessantly and only make 30% of them is not fun to watch. Kentucky and Wichita St. in their last game collectively shot 42 three point shots and made 15 of those shots in total. That is garbage basketball. As for my pick in the tournament on who wins, I will steal a line from my Dad and say my pick to win is the team holding up the trophy in a couple of weeks!

 'This is a bizarre situation': John McCain says Congress no longer has 'credibility' to conduct Trump-Russia probe alone Natasha Bertrand Mar. 22, 2017, 7:34 PM 20,393 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sen. John McCain Screenshot via MSNBC Sen. John McCain told MSNBC on Wednesday that Congress does not have the "credibility" to conduct an independent investigation into what connections, if any, President Donald Trump's campaign had to Russian officials during the election. McCain's comments came after House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes made the highly unusual decision on Wednesday to bypass his vice-chair, Rep. Adam Schiff, and brief Trump directly on a report he said he had been given that Trump's transition team had been legally surveilled after the election. "This is a bizarre situation," McCain told Greta van Susteren. "I'm calling for a select committee because I think this back-and-forth shows that Congress no longer has the credibility handle this alone. And I don't say that lightly." McCain is not the first Republican senator to call for a special, bipartisan investigation into Trump's Russia ties. Sen. Lindsey Graham said in February that he would be open to the Senate "forming a Select Committee to look at all things related to Russia." Nunes, a California Republican, held a press conference after he briefed Trump on Wednesday where he indicated to reporters that a FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrant had been obtained to monitor foreign agents on US soil, and that some of Trump's associates had been caught up in surveillance "incidentally." The collection occurred on "numerous occasions," he said, and was not related to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. Some have questioned whether Nunes, in appearing to confirm the existence of a FISA, disclosed classified information. Schiff held his own press conference afterward, expressing surprise over Nunes' decision to bypass him and go straight to Trump. "This is not the way an investigation should be conducted," Schiff said. McCain said the episode "shows a tremendous chasm between the two senior members of the House Intel Committee." Trump, who tweeted over two weeks ago, without presenting evidence, that President Barack Obama had had his phones "wiretapped" at Trump Tower, told reporters on Wednesday that he felt "somewhat" vindicated by Nunes' information. "I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found," Trump said. "I somewhat do." Nunes said later, however, that he still had no evidence to support Trump's claim that Obama had ever wiretapped him. "That did not happen. I've said this for many, many weeks, including the day after, a couple days after, in front of the press. That never happened," Nunes said. When asked about Trump's comment, McCain told van Susteren that he has ">long ago given up on trying to interpret the remarks of the President of the United States."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 March 2017 by Military News Software Defined Networking Market Set to Grow Exponentially During 2016 – 2026 Valley Cottage, NY — (SBWIRE) — 03/22/2017 — In this ever changing technological world, there is sharp inclusion of objects that are getting connected on day-to-day basis via public or private network. Traditional networking architecture are slow to response to demand generated by connected objects in a particular network. That’s where software-defined networking (SDN) comes into the picture. Software Defined Networking separates control layer of a particular network from infrastructure and application layer, so that a network operator can easily manage the data flow through a centralized console, without touching switches and routers. SDN allows network engineer and operators to response instantaneously to changing business demand. A traditional network generally uses special appliance such as firewall and load balancer, instead SDN usages a software application that usages the controller to manage data plane. In SDN, software control entire network and its physical devices. It’s about a software is integrated into networking hardware so that hardware can itself take decision about where to send data packets. It makes SDN next generation networking solution. Software Defined Networking usages northbound API to integrate control layer and application layer and uses southbound APIs to programmatically control data plane forwarding decision.

Improved tracking and 3D audio have also led to deeper levels of immersion and while far from flawless, the visuals are much more believable than they were in the early days. Despite all of the advancements, however, hardware makers and developers haven’t yet figured out the best way to interact with objects in the virtual world in a way that isn’t totally void of the real world. It’s an issue that many in the industry are working on including Disney Research. In a recent paper on the matter, Matthew Pan and Günter Niemeyer of Disney Research Los Angeles created a system that enabled them to accurately catch a real ball while fully immersed in a virtual reality environment. They used an OptiTrack Flex 13 motion capture system capable of tracking the motion of the ball and the catcher’s hands and head at 120 frames per second with a latency time of just 8.33ms. Also on hand was a respectable PC (Intel Xeon E5-2680, 32GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX 970 graphics card) running Windows 10 and an Oculus Rift for the experiment. To test the system’s effectiveness, they tossed the ball 140 times; it was caught 132 times. Catching a ball isn’t terribly exciting but the research could go a long way towards building practical systems for VR that help bring the real world into VR, something that’ll be key to boosting immersion.

How much does the company really stand to profit from the technology it helped pioneer? John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 22, 2017 at 6:07PM Three things seem pretty clear at this point in history: Self-driving cars will begin coming to market before long. They'll generate huge profits for some companies. Google has been a leader in developing self-driving technology. But does it follow that Google's parent, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), will reap the rewards of its technological leadership? Or put another way, are the potential profits from self-driving cars a reason to add Alphabet's stock to your portfolio?  A lot of commentators seem to think so, but I'm very skeptical. Here's why. Driverless "panda cars" were the public face of the Google Self-Driving Car Project for several years. Image source: Alphabet. Alphabet has what looks like a leadership position... Google began tinkering with self-driving cars way back in 2009, long before many investors began taking the technology seriously. The original team behind what became knows as the Google Self-Driving Car Project included several robotics all-stars who seemed ready to invent the future. The whole thing appeared to be decades beyond what the established automakers were doing.  For a while, it was. Of course, in the last few years, some automakers and auto-industry suppliers have invested heavily in the technology and made significant gains. But even so, Alphabet's self-driving unit, which was spun out of Google and renamed Waymo late last year, retains some big advantages: By at least one measure -- "disengagements," the number of times a human driver has to take control of a self-driving test car -- Waymo made major progress last year and appears to be ahead of most known rivals. Maps. The first self-driving cars to come to market will rely heavily on highly detailed maps as a backup to their sensors. Google has been mapping the world in ever-increasing detail for years; Waymo will have access to those maps, while its competitors will have to look elsewhere. Waymo has developed its own self-driving sensor hardware, including -- crucially -- LIDAR units that cost much less than current commercially available units.  Those are significant advantages. But there's a big question that might not be obvious to investors who don't have a deep understanding of the auto industry:  How will Waymo bring all of that to market?  Waymo's current test fleet was built in partnership with FCA, but the companies have disclosed no plans to collaborate on production vehicles. Image source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. ...but bringing it to market may prove complicated  Waymo's CEO, John Krafcik, is a respected auto-industry veteran who was hired to lead the project in September 2015. Krafcik brought a welcome dose of realistic transparency to the project when he made it clear that Alphabet has no intention of manufacturing its own vehicles. Instead, he said, Waymo would seek to bring its technology to market via partnerships with established automakers. There's just one problem: The automakers aren't exactly beating down Krafcik's door. In fact, the auto executives I've talked with feel that they have very good reasons to steer clear of a deal with Waymo, starting with control of the data generated by self-driving cars.  It's almost an understatement to say that automakers are very aware of the smartphone precedent. The phone makers that chose to adopt the Android operating system ended up making hardware on very slim margins. Alphabet ended up with most of the profits, because Android provided it with the (immensely valuable) users' data.  Auto executives don't want to end up in the same boat, and they know that they'll soon have alternatives that will allow them to keep at least some control of the data. At least one alternative, a partnership between Delphi Automotive (NYSE:DLPH), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), aims to have a self-driving system available to any automaker that wants it by the end of 2019. That partnership will allow automakers to retain much of the data, and auto executives see it as homegrown -- created largely by established industry suppliers, not by Silicon Valley hotshots.  Given that, why go with Waymo?  That said, a couple of big automakers have kicked the tires on Waymo's technology: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) worked with Google engineers last year to create the latest vehicles for Waymo's test fleet, based on the well-regarded Chrysler Pacifica minivan -- but there's no sign that the two will move forward on anything that could lead to a product for sale. Honda (NYSE:HMC) issued a somewhat odd announcement in December saying that it was "entering into formal discussions" with Waymo, though nothing (so far) seems to have resulted from those discussions. (I speculated at the time that Honda's announcement might have been about prodding other potential partners to take action. But at least as of right now, it's not clear exactly what was going on there.) Waymo may well find a profitable line of business in selling its sensors to other companies. And it's likely that some automaker, somewhere, will eventually give its self-driving system a try. But unless other research and development efforts hit roadblocks that Waymo is somehow able to skirt, it seems unlikely that it will be a dominant player in self-driving systems anytime in the near future.  The upshot: Don't buy Alphabet just for self-driving There are plenty of good reasons to consider adding Alphabet to your portfolio. But if you're looking for a targeted self-driving investment, Alphabet probably isn't it: As of right now, it's not clear that Waymo will ever add much to the search giant's bottom line.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) AP Lawmakers want details on Flynn's foreign contacts, payments By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAY Associated Press Mar 22, 2017 Updated 8 hrs ago 0 Evan Vucci FILE - In this Feb. 13, 2017 file photo, then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn arrives in the East Room of the White House in Washington. A House committee wants the White House and Trump administration officials to detail all the payments and contacts that Flynn had with foreign government representatives spanning the past three years. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in pressuring the Trump administration to surrender records of former national security adviser Michael Flynn's payments and contacts with foreign officials during the past three years. In a sign of deepening interest among congressional investigators, leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked for materials on Flynn's communications and payments from Russian, Turkish and other foreign sources since Flynn retired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014. The request came as a Flynn spokesman said the retired general filled out all of his security clearance paperwork, but did not sign a mandatory ethics pledge during his time as national security adviser. Also sought by the committee chairman, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, and the top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, is any available material on Flynn's security clearance, which would have been required to allow him access to highly classified government documents and information. The two congressmen made the requests in letters to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, FBI Director James Comey, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats. President Donald Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials about Flynn's postelection conversations with Russia's ambassador to the United States. The committee's move is significant because of the bipartisan front and the effort to gain broad information about Flynn's foreign-related work and communications for an extended period before Trump appointed him in January. Chaffetz and Cummings cooperated on a February inquiry that led to revelations last week that Flynn had been paid more than $33,000 by Russia's government-backed television network. Cummings said the goal is to learn whether Flynn "was untruthful on his security clearance forms, his vetting materials, and in other documents — conduct that could carry a criminal penalty — and we want to know what the White House knew when they hired him as national security adviser." The committee also wants to determine whether Flynn violated the constitutional prohibition against foreign payments to former military officials who could be called back into service. The FBI has interviewed Flynn about his Russia contacts as part of its inquiry into meetings, phone calls and electronic contacts last year between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials and others representing Russian interests. The House request comes a week after the committee released documents showing Flynn accepted more than $33,750 from the Russian government-backed RT network for a trip to Moscow in 2015, before he joined the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have described that network a propaganda arm of the Russian government. Cummings and Chaffetz cited Flynn's payments from RT in their letters as they sought information about the retired Army lieutenant general's responses to security clearance questions, as well as "any other security clearance applications, certifications, or requests for periodic reinvestigation." The letters also ask for any "investigative and adjudicative" files concerning Flynn's clearance. The lawmakers want to see "documents referring or relating to Lt. Gen. Flynn's contact with foreign nationals," including any direct or indirect contacts between Flynn "and foreign government officials, representatives, affiliates, or agents." Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said Flynn met the disclosure requirement for national security adviser. "Everything that was supposed to be included was included," Floyd said. He said Flynn last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016, and disclosed his trip to Russia to attend an RT event. Flynn also took a polygraph — required of someone with his level of security clearance — and passed, Floyd said. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 prohibiting political appointees from lobbying the government in any way for five years after serving in his administration. That same order instituted a lifetime ban on outgoing officials representing foreign governments. Floyd said Flynn "didn't have the opportunity to sign" the ethics pledge, "but he is going to abide by the pledge." Floyd said Flynn has not engaged in any lobbying work since leaving the White House that would have violated the pledge. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Wednesday that "all applicable employees have signed the ethics pledge." She did not answer questions about why Flynn had not. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to review those documents. The Daily Beast first reported on Flynn's failure to sign the pledge. In addition to his RT contacts, Flynn filed paperwork this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work between August and November last year may have aided the government of Turkey. Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist last year for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by a Turkish businessman. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. After Flynn's lawyers consulted Trump's legal team during the transition and after Flynn's appointment, he and his firm re-filed as foreign agents, a distinction that requires much more detailed documentation with the Justice Department. The owner of Inovo BV, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that Flynn and his firm did so due to pressure from Justice Department officials. The committee letters also ask for Flynn's "receipt of funds from any foreign source," as well as documentation of any efforts by Flynn to seek government approval for payments from foreign sources. The committee also asked the agencies for new documents relating to Flynn's work for Leading Authorities Inc., which handles Flynn's speaking requests.

A House committee wants the White House and Trump administration officials to detail all the payments and contacts that Flynn had with foreign government representatives spanning the past three years. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Posted: Wednesday, March 22, 2017 12:04 pm Lawmakers want details on Flynn's foreign contacts, payments Associated Press | 0 comments WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in pressuring the Trump administration to surrender records of former national security adviser Michael Flynn's payments and contacts with foreign officials during the past three years. In a sign of deepening interest among congressional investigators, leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked for materials on Flynn's communications and payments from Russian, Turkish and other foreign sources since Flynn retired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014. The request came as a Flynn spokesman said the retired general filled out all of his security clearance paperwork, but did not sign a mandatory ethics pledge during his time as national security adviser. Also sought by the committee chairman, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, and the top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, is any available material on Flynn's security clearance, which would have been required to allow him access to highly classified government documents and information. The two congressmen made the requests in letters to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, FBI Director James Comey, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats. President Donald Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials about Flynn's postelection conversations with Russia's ambassador to the United States. The committee's move is significant because of the bipartisan front and the effort to gain broad information about Flynn's foreign-related work and communications for an extended period before Trump appointed him in January. Chaffetz and Cummings cooperated on a February inquiry that led to revelations last week that Flynn had been paid more than $33,000 by Russia's government-backed television network. Cummings said the goal is to learn whether Flynn "was untruthful on his security clearance forms, his vetting materials, and in other documents — conduct that could carry a criminal penalty — and we want to know what the White House knew when they hired him as national security adviser." The committee also wants to determine whether Flynn violated the constitutional prohibition against foreign payments to former military officials who could be called back into service. The FBI has interviewed Flynn about his Russia contacts as part of its inquiry into meetings, phone calls and electronic contacts last year between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials and others representing Russian interests. The House request comes a week after the committee released documents showing Flynn accepted more than $33,750 from the Russian government-backed RT network for a trip to Moscow in 2015, before he joined the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have described that network a propaganda arm of the Russian government. Cummings and Chaffetz cited Flynn's payments from RT in their letters as they sought information about the retired Army lieutenant general's responses to security clearance questions, as well as "any other security clearance applications, certifications, or requests for periodic reinvestigation." The letters also ask for any "investigative and adjudicative" files concerning Flynn's clearance. The lawmakers want to see "documents referring or relating to Lt. Gen. Flynn's contact with foreign nationals," including any direct or indirect contacts between Flynn "and foreign government officials, representatives, affiliates, or agents." Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said Flynn met the disclosure requirement for national security adviser. "Everything that was supposed to be included was included," Floyd said. He said Flynn last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016, and disclosed his trip to Russia to attend an RT event. Flynn also took a polygraph — required of someone with his level of security clearance — and passed, Floyd said. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 prohibiting political appointees from lobbying the government in any way for five years after serving in his administration. That same order instituted a lifetime ban on outgoing officials representing foreign governments. Floyd said Flynn "didn't have the opportunity to sign" the ethics pledge, "but he is going to abide by the pledge." Floyd said Flynn has not engaged in any lobbying work since leaving the White House that would have violated the pledge. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Wednesday that "all applicable employees have signed the ethics pledge." She did not answer questions about why Flynn had not. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to review those documents. The Daily Beast first reported on Flynn's failure to sign the pledge. In addition to his RT contacts, Flynn filed paperwork this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work between August and November last year may have aided the government of Turkey. Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist last year for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by a Turkish businessman. After Flynn's lawyers consulted Trump's legal team during the transition and after Flynn's appointment, he and his firm re-filed as foreign agents, a distinction that requires much more detailed documentation with the Justice Department. The owner of Inovo BV, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that Flynn and his firm did so due to pressure from Justice Department officials. The committee letters also ask for Flynn's "receipt of funds from any foreign source," as well as documentation of any efforts by Flynn to seek government approval for payments from foreign sources. The committee also asked the agencies for new documents relating to Flynn's work for Leading Authorities Inc., which handles Flynn's speaking requests. Last week, the committee posted material from the firm, including copies of checks Flynn received from RT and two other Russian companies, as well as emails between Leading Authorities, RT officials, and Flynn and his adult son, Michael Flynn Jr., who accompanied his father on the Moscow trip. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report. ___ Submit reporting tips to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

One May morning, two young quarterbacks hoping to start on a major college team are throwing passes on a turf  eld outside a glassed-in conference room. Down a hallway, several NFL free agents are polishing off  their breakfast—carefully arranged plates of organic, locally sourced protein, fruits, and vegetables. In a 10,000-square-foot gym, Olympic runners and Arizona Coyotes are doing drills on exotic machines like the Keiser functional trainer, which uses pneumatic air instead of weights for resistance, and the Woodway Curve, a $6,000 treadmill that—because it’s human, not electric, powered—burns 30% more calories. There’s even a professional Indian Ping-Pong player working on whatever professional Ping- Pong players need to work on. And because Exos is the “primary human performance contractor” for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the previous week a team of elite commandos had been in the house the same time as a group of tattooed UFC fighters and, according to Exos VP Trent Wilfinger, had a jolly old time talking crap with them in the 55°F outdoor recovery pool. Such are the scenes you’ll find any- time here at Exos’ headquarters in the desert outside Phoenix—well, except in January, when the place is packed to the rafters with prospective NFL rookies who’ve come in droves to take part in the company’s famous draft combine preparation. Last year, a record 80 Exos-trained players were selected in the NFL draft—that’s 32% of all the players picked. Half of the first-round selections were Exos clients, including picks No. 7 through 14. Beyond football, Exos is also the official training partner of the German and Turkish national soccer teams; the Chinese Olympic team; Major League Soccer’s L.A. Galaxy, Portland Timbers, and Sporting Kansas City; the UFC; and many other professional baseball, basketball, and hockey teams that use Exos’ coaches and methods but prefer not to advertise that they’ve outsourced these things. On the “corporate  fitness” side, known as Exos Works, clients include the Mayo Clinic, Adidas, Intel, and more than 150 other companies. At one of them, Franklin Square Capital Partners, for example, employees eat meals made by Exos-trained cooks from a menu of Exos-approved foods (custom-tailored for and preordered by each worker in advance, from an app), then work out with Exos trainers in an Exos-designed gym. In 2015, the training operation was on track to bring in $140 million in revenue. It’s all wildly impressive—especially for a company most of us have never heard of. But that’s changing. Exos has been making a concerted effort to extend its influence beyond the shadowy corridors of power and into the fitness masses, doing things like offering personalized training and nutrition programs for the average guy online (and via the Exos Movement app) and even programming the workouts on your gym’s humble treadmills. It all raises the question: Just what in the hell is Exos, anyway? And what do its armies of “performance specialists” (Exos lingo for trainers), nutritionists, chefs, and researchers know that you don’t? How a Training Powerhouse Came to Be To some extent, former Washington State University linebacker and Exos founder Mark Verstegen may have been lucky. But he was definitely smart. After graduation, Verstegen stayed on at the school as a strength and conditioning coach, then got his master’s in exercise science at the University of Idaho and landed at Georgia Tech as assistant director of player development. There he met a shortstop named Nomar Garciaparra, who was so taken with Verstegen’s training methods that he kept seeking him out even after both went on to bigger things. Garciaparra, of course, became a star for the Boston Red Sox; Verstegen left in ’95 to create the International Performance Institute at the Nick Bollettieri Sports Academy in Florida. Bollettieri’s school had recently been swallowed up by IMG, whose affiliated sports agency then began to send its elite athletes—especially prospective NFL draft picks and MLB players— to train with Verstegen and his team. By then he was preaching a program based around core strength and a newfangled concept of “holistic fitness,” meaning he focused as much on mental strength, nutrition, recovery, and injury prevention as he did on proper form in strength training. In 1999, Verstegen decamped to Phoenix to open Athletes’ Performance, the world’s first one-stop shop for personalized  fitness and nutrition, where he could seamlessly integrate the many subject areas that elite athletes were pursuing on their own—off-season physical training, position-specific drills, psychology, nutrition, physical therapy—and o er everything they truly needed to become stronger, faster, fitter, and less injury-prone. “I wanted to bring the smartest minds from nutrition, movement, recovery, and mindset together under one roof,” he says, “to create a space where athletes could come to upgrade their performance.” And it would be all his. Clearly Verstegen was ahead of his time. He realized that athletes and agents were willing to pay a premium for what agent Michael Perrett, co-founder of Element Sports Group, calls a “turnkey” product. It was a radical concept at the time, Perrett says—a young player would arrive at Athletes’ Performance and suddenly a team of people would be asking him questions he’d never been asked before: “Where’s your nutrition?” “What do we need to work on for you?” “Are you gaining weight or dropping?” Says Perrett, “It was a laserlike focus on my client’s needs.” Even before Verstegen arrived in Arizona, his work with famous athletes like Garciaparra, Mia Hamm, and Curt Schilling—as well as his hypermanic, energetic personality—had made him a star of the elite fitness realm. But his global pro le exploded when then- German national team soccer coach Jürgen Klinsmann hired him in 2006 to overhaul his squad’s training for the World Cup, which would be played on that country’s home soil. Klinsmann lived in Newport Beach, CA, where AP had opened a small branch, and had become impressed with Verstegen’s individualized methods and early-adopter obsession with studying performance-related data. His trust in Verstegen paid off: Under his command, the 2006 German squad rebounded from years of underwhelming play to finish a near-miraculous third in the Cup. In 2004, Verstegen created Core Performance, a program that took the work he was doing for professional athletes and adapted it for regular guys. In essence, the Core program is a tune-up for your body’s “suspension system”: the torso, hips, shoulders, and back—all the muscles that control your flexibility, balance, and stability. So, rather than maxing out on the bench, Verstegen has you doing physioball exercises, cable work, rope stretches, and body-weight moves like hip crossovers, lunges with twists, and plyometrics. The accompanying book, Core Performance, was a runaway best seller. The corporate business exploded, too, and in 2012, AP and Core became Exos, a name Verstegen says is meant to evoke the exosphere (the outermost region of Earth’s atmosphere), exoskeletons (which provide support and protection), and—this being sports, after all—X’s and O’s. “Today, when an athlete comes to Exos, the place just blows him away,” says JP Major, head strength coach for the Arizona Coyotes. “Everything is taken care of: food, strength plan. The guy running the strength program talks to the dietitian and the chef. There are mindset components. As an athlete, you feel so taken care of.” When I track down Verstegen, now 47, by phone in Germany to ask about the principles on which Exos is built, he tells me that the “Exos philosophy” dictates equal attention to all four of the company’s “pillars”—Movement, Mindset, Nutrition, and Recovery. He says that all four pillars are constantly evolving, but the last two are more important than ever. Exos currently has about 50 registered dietitians, each of whom is assigned to a client to analyze diet and blood work to uncover trouble spots, allergies, and unhealthy habits. (See sidebar on previous page.) The kitchen staff  keeps a binder listing each athlete’s daily caloric needs, when those calories should be consumed, and in what forms. Some clients are on high-protein diets, some high-carb. Each is also prescribed a regimen of Exos’ supplements (including a.m. and p.m. multivitamins, omega-3s, and a probiotic) and an individually tailored recovery shake blended with blueberries and vanilla-flavored whey protein, to which is added both creatine and at least 2.2 grams of the branched-chain amino acid leucine (the most important component of protein, says Laura Kunces, Ph.D., R.D., the director of research for the supplement line). When it comes to athlete performance, Exos leaves no stone unturned. Teams that come in to train have something called “Tinkle Tuesdays,” when players’ urine samples are analyzed for hydration levels, according to nutrition and research VP Amanda Carlson-Phillips, R.D., C.S.S.D. As microbiome tests become more available, they may add stool samples to the program in the future. She says: “I can’t wait for Fecal Fridays.” How Exos Believes You (and Your Favorite NFL Player) Should Train Exos teaches everything, Verstegen says, strength training, endurance training, HIIT, you name it, with an emphasis on correct technique and proper form. It also pushes high-level sport-specific training—since a tight end’s needs are obviously different from a sprinter’s—but the fundamentals are basically the same. Every client starts out with a “Functional Movement Screen,” as Joel Sanders explains one evening as he takes me out onto the turf to show me the ropes. First is the assessment. Sanders has a small chart that lists seven simple exercises—the squat, hurdle step, pushup, leg raise, etc.— that have been chosen to test the body’s key movements and identify weaknesses and asymmetries that could lead to injury. “It allows you to introduce your body to me in 15 minutes or less,” he says. For each exercise I do, he rates me from 1 to 3. My score,a 16 out of 21,is “a B, teetering on B+,” he says. Anything under 14 and clients get sent to the onsite physical therapists to check for injuries they’re not aware of (or are hiding). If the problem’s minor, the PTs will assign them a series of exercises to address the problem; if it’s more serious, they’re probably going to be seeing an Exos-approved sports doctor. Next is the warmup, which Exos calls “movement prep”—some mini-band walks followed by “the world’s greatest stretch” (see sidebar, page 155), a multicomponent, yoga-inspired stretch that requires a fair bit of coordination to keep you from falling on your face. Sanders points out flaws—an arched back, a bent leg—and tells me that if I do only one stretch before a workout it should be this one, as it works all the major muscles in your back, butt, hips, legs, and core. Now we’re on to the main workout. Of course, my experience here is a little unusual, Sanders points out: One-on-one training isn’t standard practice at Exos. Here, whether you’re an NFL quarterback or a magazine writer, it’s all about group workouts. People work harder in groups, he says. But since it’s just me, he gives me a sampling of the sort of exercises I’d do in a group. First he gives me some cable work on the pneumatic Keiser machine to check my “power output”—after all, a star athlete’s going to be more interested in power and performance than size or definition. Next, it’s single-leg Romanian deadlifts, because they work strength, balance, and flexibility all at once—the kind of combination Verstegen always looks for in exercises. Then it’s on to the Woodway Curve manual treadmill. Every movement session includes portions that focus on speed, power, and strength, and Sanders likes to use the curved treadmill to work power. The best way, he says, is to sprint for .07 miles, then walk for .03. Basically, every tenth of a mile, you start your sprint. “It’s awkward,” he warns, but excellent at picking up flaws in a runner’s form. Finally, the workout ends with 30 minutes of ESD—short for Energy Systems Development, Exos’ term for cardio (apparently, every element of Exos needs a proprietary name). At Exos, ESD doesn’t mean lolling on a bike; it means pushing your heart and lungs—hard. Group ESD often includes a fun activity like “Ultimate Ball” (similar to Ultimate Frisbee, but with a Nerf ball) or soccer, because it tricks people into running hard at the end of a punishing workout when what they really want to do is go have a beer. That’s the easy out, though. ESD can be much worse—like if you’re put on the VersaClimber. “This is the No. 1 fat-burning tool, period,” Sanders says. “I call it the ‘unicorn of conditioning’ because you don’t  find it many places. It’s so freaking hard that it just gathers dust.” The VersaClimber works the upper and lower body simultaneously, adding “energy cost” because you’re standing, not sitting, and “blowing up your legs while setting your lungs on  re” without the load of a sled push (another Exos favorite, by the way). Whenever a client calls to say he’s too busy for a workout, Sanders asks if he can spare four minutes for the VersaClimber. “That’s all I’ll need,” he’ll say. That’s all he asks from me, as well— four of the longest and most exhausting minutes of my life, doing Tabata— 20-second bursts of sprint climbing with 10-second breaks in between. “---- this machine,” I say, panting, after just two rounds. Sanders laughs. “You’re swearing at me already? We have two minutes left!” When it’s over, I collapse onto the floor, literally gasping for air. I’ve climbed 361 feet. “Five hundred is considered good,” he says. “But it’s your first rodeo—there’s no way to prepare yourself for that.” How to Work Out with Exos Without Going Broke Many people at Exos now work at desks, figuring out how to spread an ever-growing bounty of expertise and data to a wider variety of people, including those who could never afford an Exos consultation personally. “We’re not just an elite athlete company anymore,” says Kevin Elsey, who leads the Performance Innovation Team. When I visited Exos last May, they were in the final stages of rolling out Speedo FIT, a water-workout training program that includes 60-plus short online instructional videos and a line of tools and gear made by Speedo. They’ve also launched Exos Presents, a four-hour online course ($125) that teaches trainers to better understand data for maximizing recovery. For weekend warriors who can’t make it to one of their dozen-plus locations (Phoenix; L.A.; San Diego; Frisco, TX; Norwell, MA; and Gulf Breeze, FL; to name a few), there are loads of individual training and nutrition programs (for $90/year) available at coreperformance.com. You can download the accompanying Exos Movement app to stream exercise techniques, get plugged into an eating plan, and track your goals, whether it’s as broad as “Performance Conditioning” or as specific as “Decrease Pain/Tightness.” Exos has spent 16 years training pros and soldiers, says Stefan Underwood, the continuous improvement manager at Exos. “Now our goal is to upgrade lives with no qualification for what kind of lives.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Health & Fitness Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website eight  −   =  7 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Keith Fitz-Gerald Every company reaches a "make or break" moment – meaning the precise instant in time when it will become a hero or a zero. I've spent the past few days hunkered down in my office poring over reams of information, and there's no doubt in my mind that's where we are with Ekso Bionics Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: EKSO). The conclusion I've reached may surprise you. It's an update neither you nor your wallet want to miss. The Wrong Perspective Could Cost You $1.38 Million Take a seat… please. Put your cell phone aside and set down the drink in your hand. I'm going to tell you a story that upsets a lot of investors and I don't want you to spill… or choke. I've spent 35 years in global markets as a consultant, analyst, and trader, and if there's one thing I've learned from evaluating thousands of companies, it's that every single one has a defining "make or break" moment. For some, like Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB), it's releasing a disruptive technology that catches the world by storm. For others, like Eastern Airlines, it's the moment they close the doors forever despite having been a trailblazer. And for still more companies, like Monster Beverage Corp. (Nasdaq: MNST) or Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), it's the moment where they transition from a startup to a mature player ready to dominate their industry. It's hard to tell which is which unless you know what to look for and how to frame what you find in terms that make sense. So, let me set the stage. Think back to 1997. Enamored by the prospect of making a gazillion dollars overnight because of the media circus surrounding the latest crop of "unicorns" and a bull market that roared to new highs despite overwhelming odds, many investors confused patience with genius. Twenty years ago, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) – yes, THAT Apple – was on the tail end of 18 consecutive months of financial losses. Its market share was a mere 4% of the PC market, and Club Cupertino was hemorrhaging more than a $1 billion a year. The stock had fallen more than 50% and the company's balance sheet was so bad that to call it a "loser" would have been an insult to actual losers. Rival PC maker CEO Michael Dell even went so far as to openly mock Apple, saying that if he ran the place he would "shut it down and give the money back to shareholders." Obviously, that didn't happen. Today, Dell is the one who's struggling and Apple is on the verge of becoming the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization approaching $750 billion. Investors who stayed the course despite overwhelming odds and dim prospects 20 years ago have turned every $10,000 invested then into $1.38 million today. It's the stuff of legend. Which is why you've got an important choice to make when it comes to Ekso. Are You a Speculator or an Investor? From the very first moment I walked in Ekso's door, I knew the company was on to something special, and I challenge you to think differently given what they've achieved by helping stroke victims and people with traumatic spinal injuries become mobile again. Watch these two videos if you're uncertain: Sascha Miami Valley Testimonial Dan Summit Alta Bates Testimonial The U.S. spinal cord and stroke rehabilitation segment all by itself is a $20+ billion market; overseas applications may double that figure. More than 71.4 million steps have been taken by people who otherwise would never take one again thanks to Ekso products used in more than 130 rehabilitation centers around the world at last count. Then, there's the $21 billion industrial and construction industry market where EksoWorks products are helping workers achieve more with less fatigue, better quality, and fewer injuries from high-frequency, long-duration tasks. This video from United Rental will give you a quick look at why they've become one of Ekso's largest customers very quickly. And, finally, the military robotics market may be $21.11 billion by 2020, which represents a compound growth rate of roughly 9.27%, according to MarketsandMarkets. Here's a video simulating the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit, or TALOS for short. I wouldn't want to be a bad guy when this thing comes through the door! Ekso has just had its best quarter ever, booking $2.3 million in revenue – $573,000 of which came from the industrial market. That's a 324% increase in 12 months for a market that literally didn't exist a year ago. I can easily imagine a series of doubles in the next 12 months if sales continue to grow at this pace. Further, the company has raised more than $100 million, holds 279 patents worldwide (of which 140 are issued and the rest are in prosecution or provisional), and is moving further into sales channels by leveraging early adopters like the Kessler Foundation, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Swiss Paraplegic Centre. Yet, Ekso's stock has dropped 50% over the past 18 months to $2.75, where it's trading as I write. So Now What? Ekso has to put some numbers "on the board" quickly or risk the wrath of increasingly impatient investors, just as Apple did 20 years ago. I won't mince words. This is Ekso's "make or break" moment. The company's latest 10-K report suggests they have enough cash on hand to survive through the end of the third quarter. I see three possibilities. First, the company raises more capital, broadens marketing efforts, and continues operations. The markets recognize that as it becomes profitable. Prices rise accordingly as revenue begins to match expectations. This is complicated by a shareholder base that is largely individual, short-term oriented, and fickle, as opposed to institutional, longer-term focused, and stable. I bring this up because most individuals think additional capital raises are dilutive when, in fact, companies do them all the time as a means of growing faster and more profitably than they would otherwise. Tesla Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA), not coincidentally, is getting ready to do the same thing. Second, the company sells to a much bigger player with deeper pockets that can capitalize the long-cycle sales process and development at the same time. This is a viable alternative for management and shareholders alike. It's also very typical for growing companies with the kind of valuable intellectual property like Ekso has that just need a little "umppph." Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Intel… between them they've probably purchased more than 100 smaller companies with attractive technology. And that's worked out well for long-term shareholders. I've long thought that Medtronic Plc. (NYSE: MDT) would be a suitable buyer, as was the subject of unconfirmed rumors last month. However, I could also envision a defense contractor moving in simply because so much of the intellectual property could easily cross over to military applications. Or even Google X, for that matter. Third, the company simply shuts down. Frankly, I have a hard time imagining this would happen. At this point, Ekso's intellectual property portfolio could be worth $75 million to $100 million, or roughly 30% to 80% more than the current market capitalization at $2.75 a share. Factor in the discounted cash flow associated with existing sales channels and the combined market potential of both the medical and industrial markets, and another few hundred million dollars isn't inconceivable. Now comes the tough part. You've got to decide if you're an investor willing to take a longer-term leap of faith based on extraordinary market potential and disruptive technology or a short-term trader willing to dance like a kite in a hurricane. As much as I'd like to, I can't make that decision for you because I don't know your individual risk tolerance, nor do I know your individual investment objectives. My preference, of course, is that you approach Ekso as an investor. If you're following along as directed, that means: a) limiting your investment to 2% of overall holdings to control risk and b) making sure that Ekso is part of a larger, disciplined investment strategy like the 50-40-10 portfolio we talk about frequently. Unbelievably, it also means you think very seriously about buying more Ekso stock. "Buy low, sell high" is how the game works, and the path to profits. If you're not yet fully invested – meaning that your Ekso position is less than 2% of your overall investable assets – then you can afford to "tank up" – meaning buy more shares – to the point where you reach the 2% threshold. Much the same way as dollar-cost averaging, this actually improves your profit potential even if the company ultimately blows up. If you've got more than 2% tied up in Ekso stock, then you're overexposed and taking on too much risk. In that case, consider unloading enough shares so that the amount of money you have at risk drops back under the 2% Rule of Thumb. And, if you're holding Ekso shares having already converted them to a "free trade" early on, then you've got nothing to worry about and don't have to do a thing. I know it's not easy; situations like this never are. Then again, neither was the decision facing Apple investors under very similar circumstances in 1997… …do I hold on or buy more? I will be with you every step of the way. Until next time, Keith The post Update: Ekso Bionics: "Make or Break" Moment appeared first on Total Wealth. Join the conversation.

I picked some up before the split and have seen it erode 50% or more since then.Have since bailed but it's on the watchlist. Reply Keith | March 21, 2017 Hello Mike and thanks for chiming in. I think your description is apt…a story stock indeed. We've had "show" and now we need "tell" which is, not coincidentally, something every company has to do when it hits the make or break moment. Best regards and thanks for being part of the Money Morning Family, Keith :-) Reply Glenn Timberlake | March 22, 2017 What about BNKL? Bionic Laboratories. About $.51. (What is this? bid 0.0500 and ask 80.00 at vol 17781?) Stock has been struggling, also. But has made some significant progress in a similar if not the same field. EKSO shows $3.34 today. Thanks. Love your research and reports. Reply Keith | March 22, 2017 Thanks for the heads up and, of course, the kind words as well. Let me take a look. As for the numbers, that's not atypical for a penny-stock trading in illiquid conditions when the bid/ask spread gets wide enough that you can drive a Mack truck through.

Stocks traded very near the break-even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could finish with either a small gain or a small loss for any or all of the indexes. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Wednesday was Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) which traded up 1.30% at $65.04.

A House committee wants the White House and Trump administration officials to detail all the payments and contacts that Flynn had with foreign government representatives spanning the past three years. | AP World / Politics Lawmakers on both sides seek details on Flynn’s foreign contacts, payments AP Mar 23, 2017 Article history Online: Mar 23, 2017 Last Modified: Mar 23, 2017 PRINT SHARE WASHINGTON – Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in pressuring the Trump administration to surrender records of former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s payments and contacts with foreign officials during the past three years. In a sign of deepening interest among congressional investigators, leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked for materials on Flynn’s communications and payments from Russian, Turkish and other foreign sources since Flynn retired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014. The request came as a Flynn spokesman said the retired general filled out all of his security clearance paperwork, but did not sign a mandatory ethics pledge during his time as national security adviser. Also sought by the committee chairman, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, and the top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, is any available material on Flynn’s security clearance, which would have been required to allow him access to highly classified government documents and information. The two congressmen made the requests in letters to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, FBI Director James Comey, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats. President Donald Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials about Flynn’s postelection conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The committee’s move is significant because of the bipartisan front and the effort to gain broad information about Flynn’s foreign-related work and communications for an extended period before Trump appointed him in January. Cummings said the goal is to learn whether Flynn “was untruthful on his security clearance forms, his vetting materials, and in other documents — conduct that could carry a criminal penalty — and we want to know what the White House knew when they hired him as national security adviser.” The committee also wants to determine whether Flynn violated the constitutional prohibition against foreign payments to former military officials who could be called back into service. The FBI has interviewed Flynn about his Russia contacts as part of its inquiry into meetings, phone calls and electronic contacts last year between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials and others representing Russian interests. The House request comes a week after the committee released documents showing Flynn accepted more than $33,750 from the Russian government-backed RT network for a trip to Moscow in 2015, before he joined the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have described that network as a propaganda arm of the Russian government. Cummings and Chaffetz cited Flynn’s payments from RT in their letters as they sought information about the retired Army lieutenant general’s responses to security clearance questions, as well as “any other security clearance applications, certifications, or requests for periodic reinvestigation.” The letters also ask for any “investigative and adjudicative” files concerning Flynn’s clearance. The lawmakers want to see “documents referring or relating to Lt. Gen. Flynn’s contact with foreign nationals,” including any direct or indirect contacts between Flynn “and foreign government officials, representatives, affiliates, or agents.” Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said Flynn met the disclosure requirement for national security adviser. “Everything that was supposed to be included was included,” Floyd said. He said Flynn last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016, and disclosed his trip to Russia to attend an RT event. Flynn also took a polygraph — required of someone with his level of security clearance — and passed, Floyd said. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 prohibiting political appointees from lobbying the government in any way for five years after serving in his administration. That same order instituted a lifetime ban on outgoing officials representing foreign governments. Floyd said Flynn “didn’t have the opportunity to sign” the ethics pledge, “but he is going to abide by the pledge.” Floyd said Flynn has not engaged in any lobbying work since leaving the White House that would have violated the pledge. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Wednesday that “all applicable employees have signed the ethics pledge.” She did not answer questions about why Flynn had not. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to review those documents. The Daily Beast first reported on Flynn’s failure to sign the pledge. In addition to his RT contacts, Flynn filed paperwork this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work between August and November last year may have aided the government of Turkey. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist last year for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by a Turkish businessman. After Flynn’s lawyers consulted Trump’s legal team during the transition and after Flynn’s appointment, he and his firm re-filed as foreign agents, a distinction that requires much more detailed documentation with the Justice Department. The owner of Inovo BV, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that Flynn and his firm did so due to pressure from Justice Department officials. The committee letters also ask for Flynn’s “receipt of funds from any foreign source,” as well as documentation of any efforts by Flynn to seek government approval for payments from foreign sources. The committee also asked the agencies for new documents relating to Flynn’s work for Leading Authorities Inc., which handles Flynn’s speaking requests. Last week, the committee posted material from the firm, including copies of checks Flynn received from RT and two other Russian companies, as well as emails between Leading Authorities, RT officials, and Flynn and his adult son, Michael Flynn Jr., who accompanied his father on the Moscow trip.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday hammered Republican House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes over his assertion there may have been “incidental collection” of President Donald Trump during the transition. “You said he could have been, but I don’t know what that means,” Tapper began in a lengthy and contentious interview, pointing out that the incidental collection of communications between Trump associates and Russian officials “doesn’t mean that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.” Nunes contended that there was “unmasking” of Trump officials during the transition—meaning the naming of American citizens in intelligence reports (as opposed to denoting “American A” or some other designation) which concerned him. “Just to be clear, there’s still no evidence that President Trump was wiretapped,” Tapper noted. Nunes agreed with Tapper, but remained concerned about the “unmasking” of U.S. citizens, arguing there “doesn’t appear to be a reason” for the unmasking. “Perhaps there is,” Nunes conceded. Tapper pressed Nunes about why he approached Trump with this information first, asking if it was fair for Democrats to “look at you going to the White House and delivering this information to President Trump” and question his “impartiality.” “It’s not fair for him not to know what’s in these reports,” Nunes replied. The House Intel Chairman clarified he has “no reason to think [the intelligence] wasn’t gathered legally,” later adding, “It’s probably fine, but we have to make sure. The president himself has to see this.” “Doesn’t President Trump already have access to all that information?” Tapper pressed. The CNN host later hammered Nunes on Trump’s claim that he felt “somewhat vindicated” but the House Intel Chairman’s report, leading Nunes to insist the president was correct in saying Obama wiretapped him. “How was he right?” Tapper asked. “You just said he was right.” “You can make what you want of it, but most people would say [the incidental collection of communications] is surveillance,” Nunes argued.

Micro Center has cut the price of the Ryzen 1700X to $370 The 1700X can bring lots of joy for an even cheaper price at Micro Center today. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 23 March, 2017 04:04 0 - - - - print email IDG AMD’s recently released Ryzen CPUs are all the rage at the moment, and if you live near a Micro Center store, you can pick one up right now at a discount. The retailer is selling the Ryzen 7 1700X for $370: That’s $30 off the current prices you’ll find elsewhere, since everyone else is still offering this part at MSRP. There's more to the deal, too. This processor also qualifies for a combo discount, so if you add a compatible motherboard to your purchase, Micro Center will drop $50 off the mobo’s current price. Most locations even have X370 boards in stock right now, though Denver and Virginia only have open-box offerings. (Both Houston and Dallas are completely sold out—sorry, Texans. You can still snag B350 boards, however.) The only downside of all these savings, if it wasn't already clear, is that this sale only applies for in-store pickup. That’s par for the course with Micro Center’s best deals, but it doesn't make it any less disappointing for the rest of us who don't live near one. The 1700X features a 3.4GHz clock speed and eight cores with a 95 Watt TDP. We haven’t published any benchmarks on the 1700X, but we were generally impressed with Ryzen as a whole. AMD’s CPUs aren’t quite as fast as Intel’s processors in gaming, but they’re still totally acceptable at it, and utter beasts at productivity and content creation tasks. Plus the pricing can’t be beat and today’s deal at Micro Center sweetens the pot a little bit more. If you do pick up a 1700X today, don't forget to also grab a CPU cooler. In its boxed form, this processor doesn’t come with a stock cooler (just like Intel's enthusiast chips). If you’re looking for a cooler on the cheap, we’re big fans of this gem from Cooler Master.

NBC10's Randy Gyllenhaal took a look at who the cuts will impact the most. (Published Sunday, March 19, 2017) Dale Lamphier, 97, never married and her closest living relatives―three nephews―live across the country. About two years ago, she moved to a senior housing complex in Westwood, New Jersey, a town she has lived in her whole life. She has been using the meal delivery service Meals on Wheels since her brother died about three years ago. "Meals on Wheels is important because I can't do much shopping―very little," she said. "And I can't carry things. There are a lot of people here that can't." Gorsuch to Democrats: No Return to 'Horse and Buggy' Era There is a Trader Joe's about a block from her complex, which she walks to, but not often. She relies on her daily meal delivery. Dale Lamphier, 97, says some days it's difficult for her to walk even down the block to the supermarket. She says she depends on her daily delivery from Meals on Wheels. Photo credit: Shannon Ho North Jersey is just one of the thousands of Meals on Wheels branches that could see cuts to its funding under President Donald Trump's proposed budget plan. Jeanne Martin, the executive director of Meals on Wheels North Jersey, said her program reaches about 220 senior citizens across 30 towns in northern Bergen County. If Trump's budget plan passes, her branch will lose about $32,000―10 percent of her annual budget―and potentially more money from other Department of Health and Human Services grants. As a whole, the national Meals on Wheels organization receives about 35 percent of its funding from the federal government. Trump is proposing to end the Community Development Block Grants, one of many federal grants that fund the program. Other cuts to Health and Human Services, the parent agency for Meals on Wheels, also could affect the program negatively, but the magnitude of those cuts is unknown.  Gorsuch Calls Trump's Attacks on Judges 'Disheartening' Martin has been the executive director of Meals on Wheels in North Jersey for 12 years. She said she has never seen a federal cut this large. "I don't see any room for us in that budget," she said. "I haven't seen any positive things coming from [the Trump administration] in the social services or the senior service so far." Banks Nosedive as Trump Health Care Speedbump Tanks Stocks "It is going to impact our program," she said. "We're not going to be able to offer the subsidies to our clients that they really need." Andre Sitbon, a Holocaust survivor in his early 90s, has been using Meals on Wheels for more than five years out of the Westwood seniors complex. Around three years ago Sitbon's wife died and he started having severe eye problems, which interfered with his love of cooking. He said the program "receives you with arms open," with extremely friendly staff and good food. On Monday he received meatloaf, mashed potatoes and mixed greens. Trump to GOP: Pass Health Care Bill or Seal Your Fate Another senior, a 65-year old mentally disabled man, had virtually nothing in his fridge except the two meals―one hot, one cold―that Martin delivered to him Monday morning. The only other parcels were an apple and a small carton of milk, which were given to him by Meals on Wheels the day before.

Photo credit: Shannon Ho Martin estimated that about 30 percent of the seniors in her program are no longer visited by family and, like Lamphier, are isolated. Martin said the 550 local volunteer drivers who deliver the meals are often the ones who report health problems and find fallen or sick seniors. Meals on Wheels, she said, is "more than just a meal." "We're helping people stay in their homes, which is where they want to stay," she said. "It's keeping people out of nursing homes. And they want to spend the rest of the time they have on this world in their homes and we're doing the best we can to give them that." Trump's Claims Crumble Under Sworn Testimony: Analysis When Martin became director there were about 100 seniors in the program. The number has more than doubled during her tenure, though she thinks that there are hundreds more seniors who need assistance but are too isolated or too worried about appearing needy to receive help. If Martin loses funding she would have to make changes to the program's model. The food is now prepared by four local nursing homes to meet federal guidelines. But if the program no longer receives federal funds, it would be free to receive donated meals from volunteers. Andre Sitbon receives a Meals on Wheels delivery from Westwood Mayor John Birkner Jr. on March 20. Sitbon has used the food delivery program for more than five years. He praises the service that has become his main source of nourishment since he contracted severe eye problems that have kept him from cooking for himself. Photo credit: Shannon Ho "It seems to me that all of the programs that support our most needy, vulnerable populations are the ones that are being jeopardized," said John Birkner Jr., the mayor of Westwood. He also said that recent comments made by Trump administration officials "trivialize" the importance of programs like Meals on Wheels. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s budget director, called Meals on Wheels a program that is "just not showing any results."  On Twitter, Trump Puts His Spin on Intel Hearing "We can’t spend money on programs just because they sound good," he said at a news conference last Thursday. "Meals on Wheels sounds great. Again, that's a state decision to fund that particular portion, to take the federal money and give it to the states, and say look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work." Martin called Mulvaney’s comments "insulting" and said he "couldn’t be more wrong." First Daughter Ivanka Trump Gets West Wing Office Supporters have cited studies to back their case. A University of Illinois review in 2013 of home-delivery programs for seniors found that they "significantly improve" the nutritional quality of diets, as well as increased chances for socialization and an overall "higher quality of life." Another study in 2015 by Brown University researchers found multiple benefits of Meals on Wheels for senior citizens, including reduced feelings of isolation and loneliness, an increased feeling of security and fewer falls and hospitalizations. Purple Heart Vet Receives Meals on Wheels A Purple Heart veteran feared his Meals on Wheels deliveries would vanish under the president's proposal. Angie Crouch reports for the NBC4 News at 5 Thursday, March 16, 2017.  (Published Wednesday, March 22, 2017) Martin said the cost of a year's worth of meals from her program was $1,500. She compared that to the cost of a one-day hospitalization.  "So, if we're keeping someone well-nourished and doing a well-check on them, we're saving the government money by keeping them out of the hospital," Martin said.  Comey: FBI Investigating Trump Camp-Russia Ties, No Wiretap Meals on Wheels has about 5,000 local and state delivery programs that supply food to isolated, disabled or poor seniors. In 2016, they served about 2.4 million people, including more than 500,000 veterans. Jeanne Martin, executive director of Meals on Wheels North Jersey, makes a delivery to a Westwood resident Mike Helm. Martin's branch of Meals on Wheels faces a 10 percent budget cut if the Community Development Block Grant is eliminated, like Donald Trump's 2018 federal budget outlines. She counters that the program is "more than just a meal," and acts as a vital service to the community. Photo credit: Shannon Ho National Meals on Wheels spokeswoman Jenny Bertolette confirmed to NBC that the program has seen a significant spike in donations since Mulvaney’s comments last Thursday. On a typical day, the nonprofit receives about $1,000 in individual online donations. Three days after the preliminary budget was released, Meals on Wheels had received about $140,000 in donations. On Tuesday, the nonprofit told The Associated Press that it had received an additional $50,000 donation from NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  How the Supreme Court's Broad Reach Touches Daily Life Bertolette said the organization was "thrilled about the public’s passionate support" but also said the additional donations could not replace what it gets from the federal government. Caring for the Elderly in Winter Weather In any snowstorm, it's important to remember to check in on elderly family and neighbors. In Massachusetts, there are several organizations that are making sure the elderly and disabled get the help they need during storms.(Published Wednesday, March 22, 2017) The portion of Meals on Wheels' budget that comes from the federal government is part of the Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, which falls under Health and Human Services. Trump is calling for an 18 percent cut to the department. Each state uses Community Block Development Grants differently, so the amount that funds Meals on Wheels per branch varies widely. For example, one program in the suburbs of Detroit could lose 30 percent of its budget; on the other end, New York City's Meals on Wheels is funded through other grants, so it is not affected by the potential loss of Community Block Development Grants. The program is also funded by private money. The littered kitchen of a Meals on Wheels recipient in Westwood, New Jersey. The woman who lives here, in her early 90s, lives in complete isolation and lost her life savings to a local politician's Ponzi scheme. She seldom leaves her chair and relies on Meals on Wheels deliveries to feed herself. Photo credit: Shannon Ho "Cuts of any kind to these highly successful and leveraged programs would be a devastating blow to our ability to provide much-needed care for millions of vulnerable seniors in America," Ellie Hollander, president and CEO of Meals on Wheels America, said in a statement. The cuts are no sure thing. Congress must pass the budget that Trump has outlined and there has already been support from both sides of the aisle for Meals on Wheels. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted that cuts to programs like Meals on Wheels "jeopardizes the health and safety of the poor." Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., told CNN he would "never vote to cut even one dollar" of Meals on Wheels. Since Mulvaney's comments last week, Martin has gained three more volunteers and an additional donor.  Even if the budget doesn't cut as much as the 10 percent that is currently threatened, to Martin "a cut is a cut."  Published at 4:43 PM EDT on Mar 22, 2017 | Updated at 7:27 PM EDT on Mar 22, 2017 Leave Comments TV Listings News Weather Politics Business Entertainment Sports Traffic Contact Us Connect With Us FCC Independent Programming Report FCC News and Information Programming Report NBC Non-Profit News Partnership Reports Send Feedback Terms of service Privacy policy © 2017 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.

A House committee wants the White House and Trump administration officials to detail all the payments and contacts that Flynn had with foreign government representatives spanning the past three years. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in pressuring the Trump administration to surrender records of former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s payments and contacts with foreign officials during the past three years. In a sign of deepening interest among congressional investigators, leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked for materials on Flynn’s communications and payments from Russian, Turkish and other foreign sources since Flynn retired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014. The request came as a Flynn spokesman said the retired general filled out all of his security clearance paperwork, but did not sign a mandatory ethics pledge during his time as national security adviser. Also sought by the committee chairman, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, and the top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, is any available material on Flynn’s security clearance, which would have been required to allow him access to highly classified government documents and information. The two congressmen made the requests in letters to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, FBI Director James Comey, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats. President Donald Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials about Flynn’s postelection conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The committee’s move is significant because of the bipartisan front and the effort to gain broad information about Flynn’s foreign-related work and communications for an extended period before Trump appointed him in January. Chaffetz and Cummings cooperated on a February inquiry that led to revelations last week that Flynn had been paid more than $33,000 by Russia’s government-backed television network. Cummings said the goal is to learn whether Flynn “was untruthful on his security clearance forms, his vetting materials, and in other documents — conduct that could carry a criminal penalty — and we want to know what the White House knew when they hired him as national security adviser.” The committee also wants to determine whether Flynn violated the constitutional prohibition against foreign payments to former military officials who could be called back into service. The FBI has interviewed Flynn about his Russia contacts as part of its inquiry into meetings, phone calls and electronic contacts last year between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials and others representing Russian interests. The House request comes a week after the committee released documents showing Flynn accepted more than $33,750 from the Russian government-backed RT network for a trip to Moscow in 2015, before he joined the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have described that network a propaganda arm of the Russian government. Cummings and Chaffetz cited Flynn’s payments from RT in their letters as they sought information about the retired Army lieutenant general’s responses to security clearance questions, as well as “any other security clearance applications, certifications, or requests for periodic reinvestigation.” The letters also ask for any “investigative and adjudicative” files concerning Flynn’s clearance. The lawmakers want to see “documents referring or relating to Lt. Gen. Flynn’s contact with foreign nationals,” including any direct or indirect contacts between Flynn “and foreign government officials, representatives, affiliates, or agents.” Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said Flynn met the disclosure requirement for national security adviser. “Everything that was supposed to be included was included,” Floyd said. He said Flynn last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016, and disclosed his trip to Russia to attend an RT event. Flynn also took a polygraph — required of someone with his level of security clearance — and passed, Floyd said. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 prohibiting political appointees from lobbying the government in any way for five years after serving in his administration. That same order instituted a lifetime ban on outgoing officials representing foreign governments. Floyd said Flynn “didn’t have the opportunity to sign” the ethics pledge, “but he is going to abide by the pledge.” Floyd said Flynn has not engaged in any lobbying work since leaving the White House that would have violated the pledge. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Wednesday that “all applicable employees have signed the ethics pledge.” She did not answer questions about why Flynn had not. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to review those documents. The Daily Beast first reported on Flynn’s failure to sign the pledge. In addition to his RT contacts, Flynn filed paperwork this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work between August and November last year may have aided the government of Turkey. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist last year for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by a Turkish businessman. After Flynn’s lawyers consulted Trump’s legal team during the transition and after Flynn’s appointment, he and his firm re-filed as foreign agents, a distinction that requires much more detailed documentation with the Justice Department. The owner of Inovo BV, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that Flynn and his firm did so due to pressure from Justice Department officials.

In a sign of deepening interest among congressional investigators, leaders of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee asked for materials on Flynn’s communications and payments from Russian, Turkish and other foreign sources since Flynn retired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in August 2014. The request came as a Flynn spokesman said the retired general filled out all of his security clearance paperwork, but did not sign a mandatory ethics pledge during his time as national security adviser. Also sought by the committee chairman, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, and the top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, is any available material on Flynn’s security clearance, which would have been required to allow him access to highly classified government documents and information. The two congressmen made the requests in letters to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, FBI Director James Comey, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats. President Donald Trump fired Flynn last month for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials about Flynn’s postelection conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The committee’s move is significant because of the bipartisan front and the effort to gain broad information about Flynn’s foreign-related work and communications for an extended period before Trump appointed him in January. Cummings said the goal is to learn whether Flynn “was untruthful on his security clearance forms, his vetting materials, and in other documents — conduct that could carry a criminal penalty — and we want to know what the White House knew when they hired him as national security adviser.” The committee also wants to determine whether Flynn violated the constitutional prohibition against foreign payments to former military officials who could be called back into service. The FBI has interviewed Flynn about his Russia contacts as part of its inquiry into meetings, phone calls and electronic contacts last year between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials and others representing Russian interests. The House request comes a week after the committee released documents showing Flynn accepted more than $33,750 from the Russian government-backed RT network for a trip to Moscow in 2015, before he joined the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have described that network a propaganda arm of the Russian government. Cummings and Chaffetz cited Flynn’s payments from RT in their letters as they sought information about the retired Army lieutenant general’s responses to security clearance questions, as well as “any other security clearance applications, certifications, or requests for periodic reinvestigation.” The letters also ask for any “investigative and adjudicative” files concerning Flynn’s clearance. The lawmakers want to see “documents referring or relating to Lt. Gen. Flynn’s contact with foreign nationals,” including any direct or indirect contacts between Flynn “and foreign government officials, representatives, affiliates, or agents.” Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said Flynn met the disclosure requirement for national security adviser. “Everything that was supposed to be included was included,” Floyd said. He said Flynn last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016, and disclosed his trip to Russia to attend an RT event. Flynn also took a polygraph — required of someone with his level of security clearance — and passed, Floyd said. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 28 prohibiting political appointees from lobbying the government in any way for five years after serving in his administration. That same order instituted a lifetime ban on outgoing officials representing foreign governments. Floyd said Flynn “didn’t have the opportunity to sign” the ethics pledge, “but he is going to abide by the pledge.” Floyd said Flynn has not engaged in any lobbying work since leaving the White House that would have violated the pledge. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Wednesday that “all applicable employees have signed the ethics pledge.” She did not answer questions about why Flynn had not. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to review those documents. The Daily Beast first reported on Flynn’s failure to sign the pledge. In addition to his RT contacts, Flynn filed paperwork this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work between August and November last year may have aided the government of Turkey. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered as a lobbyist last year for Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company owned by a Turkish businessman. After Flynn’s lawyers consulted Trump’s legal team during the transition and after Flynn’s appointment, he and his firm re-filed as foreign agents, a distinction that requires much more detailed documentation with the Justice Department. The owner of Inovo BV, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that Flynn and his firm did so due to pressure from Justice Department officials. The committee letters also ask for Flynn’s “receipt of funds from any foreign source,” as well as documentation of any efforts by Flynn to seek government approval for payments from foreign sources. The committee also asked the agencies for new documents relating to Flynn’s work for Leading Authorities Inc., which handles Flynn’s speaking requests. Last week, the committee posted material from the firm, including copies of checks Flynn received from RT and two other Russian companies, as well as emails between Leading Authorities, RT officials, and Flynn and his adult son, Michael Flynn Jr., who accompanied his father on the Moscow trip. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
