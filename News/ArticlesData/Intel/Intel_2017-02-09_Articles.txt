Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." - By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. -By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office.

It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Susan Walsh AP Photo 1 of 10 i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. Susan Walsh AP Photo 1 of 10 i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!"

Canaccord Genuity on Friday downgraded Intel to hold from buy given the potential for margins to compress as the chipmaker ventures into new markets to seek growth. "We agree with management's long-term decision to invest for growth; however, turning a battleship like Intel takes time and we believe other stocks we cover will generate more attractive returns during this period of prolonged transition …," equity analyst Matthew Ramsay wrote in a research note. He says Intel is likely to get "caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place" as the firm tries to overcome "peak" PC margins and margin compression in its data center group (DCG). "We concede Intel shares generate a strong yield and remain inexpensive, but we believe shares could remain range bound as margins stagnate and until investors see proof of new investments …," he said.

Of course, like any other Intel 200-series motherboard, the GA-B250M-Gaming 5 does support 6th Generation Intel ‘Skylake’ processors as well. The B250M-Gaming 5 motherboard comes equipped with what Gigabyte claims is the most advanced LED system in the market today. The RGB Fusion lighting offers users a choice of 16.8 million colors, two programmable sections, seven different lighting effects, and accent LED with interchangeable overlay.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." - By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. -By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. -By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. -By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

The financial arm of computing firm Intel is investing $250 million in autonomous vehicle technology, targeting three areas that the company’s leader believes will place Intel at the forefront of an approaching wave of change in transportation. “Just as oil has transformed our world over the last century, data is poised to transform our world for the next hundred years — and beyond,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a blog post on the company’s webpage, posted in November to coincide with the announcement of the investment. “When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, data is literally the new oil,” he said. “Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience: as consumers, as automakers, as technologists and as citizens of our communities.” BEST OF FEBRUARY iTECH: More stories, columns In a statement, Intel said the initiative is being handled by its Intel Capital financial division, which since 1991 has invested more than $11.8 billion in nearly 1,500 companies in 57 countries. Of those companies, 214 have gone public globally and more than 400 were acquired or included in a merger, Intel said. This autonomous vehicle initiative, Intel said, will “drive the development of technologies that push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more.” Drilling down into specifics, the statement highlighted the development of the Internet of Things, or IoT, in transportation; safety technologies that can help mitigate risk while also improving mobility and efficiency, and companies that harness data to improve the reliability of automated driving systems. 1 2 3 Next >> By the Information Technology & Logistics Council Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2017, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Update: AMD Ryzen chips won’t support Windows 7 after all 02/09/2017 at 9:51 AM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment AMD’s upcoming Ryzen processors are expected to be up to 40 percent faster than the company’s previous chips, giving Intel’s high-end desktop processors a run for their money. And, as we reported earlier this month, an article fom German site ComputerBase suggested AMD processors might also offer something Intel’s latest chips don’t: official support for Windows 7. But now AMD says that’s not true. PC World reports that the company did test its Ryzen chips with the older version of Windows, AMD only plans to release and support drivers for Windows 10. That’s consistent with reports from last year that said both AMD’s Zen chips and Intel’s Kaby Lake processors would only officially support Windows 10. While a growing number of Windows users are running the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system, about 39 percent of users were still running Windows 7 in November, according to Microsoft’s own numbers, even though mainstream support for the operating system ended in 2015. Microsoft does plan to continue offering extended support for Windows 7 for three more years, but most new PCs are sold with Windows 10 pre-loaded, which means the people most affected by the lack of official support for Windows 7 will be folks who either want to build their own computers or downgrade the OS on a pre-built system. The first AMD Ryzen chips are expected to ship in March.

The chipmaker is "investing heavily" in quantum and neuromorphic computing, said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during a question-and-answer session at the company's investor day on Thursday. "We are investing in those edge type things that are way out there," Krzanich said. To give an idea of how far out these technologies are, Krzanich said his daughter would perhaps be running the company by then. [ Further reading: The 8080 chip at 40: What's next for the mighty microprocessor ] Researching in these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is something Intel has to do to survive for many more decades. Shrinking silicon chips and cramming more features into them is becoming difficult, and Intel is already having trouble in manufacturing smaller chips. Smartphones, PCs, and other devices are getting smaller, faster and more power efficient thanks to Moore's Law, a 1965 observation loosely stating that the number of transistors in a die area would double every two years, causing performance to double while driving down the cost of making chips. Intel has been using Moore's Law as a guiding star to make faster and smaller chips and reducing the price of devices. However, it is widely agreed that Moore's Law is slowly dying, and Intel's manufacturing struggles are growing. For decades, Intel's business has been heavily reliant on its ability to make and deliver chips. But the process is slowing down. Intel used to advance manufacturing processes every two years, and that has now changed to three to four years. One way to resolve that crisis -- which all chipmakers face -- is to completely change the current computing model in PCs, smartphones, and servers. The current model -- known as the Von Neumann approach -- involves data being pushed to a processor, calculated, and sent back to memory. But storage and memory are becoming bottlenecks. The answer is to adopt new models of computing, which is where quantum computers and neuromorphic chips fit in. Quantum computers have the potential to be powerful computers harnessing the unique quality of a large number of qubits to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Neuromorphic chips are modeled after the human brain, which could help computers make decisions based on patterns and associations. Intel has made some advances in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips. But Krzanich's comments lend more credibility to the company's push to look at a future beyond today's computing models. Some short-term answers can resolve the bottlenecks based on Von Neumann model, including Optane, Intel's new form of super-fast memory and storage. It could unite SSDs and DRAM in systems, cutting one bottleneck. Intel is also embracing silicon photonics, which could resolve throughput issues in data centers. Both technologies have been researched for more than a decade and are now practical. The chipmaker has lived off the PC industry for decades but is now looking to grow in markets like data centers, the internet of things, automotive and high-performance computing. The new focus is bringing a gradual change to the way Intel makes chips. It's similar to the 1970s, when different types of chips like vector processors and floating point arrays were crammed together for complex calculations. For example, Intel is slapping together two separate functional blocks for applications like machine learning and autonomous cars. Intel envisions FPGAs combining with CPUs in autonomous cars. Later this year, the company will release a chip called Lake Crest, which combines a Xeon server CPU with deep-learning chip technology it picked up through its Nervana Systems acquisition. Intel is also merging an FPGA inside an Intel Xeon chip to carry out machine learning tasks. Intel is expecting a lot of data to be generated by sources like autonomous cars, which will need edge processing for tasks like image recognition, analysis, and map updates. Intel is pushing its wide roster of co-processors to the edge, and that is where the quantum and neuromorphic chips may fit. Quantum computer research is also being done by other companies. D-Wave recently released a 2,000-qubit quantum computer based on quantum annealing, while IBM has a 5-bit quantum computer accessible via the cloud. IBM is also playing with brain-like chips and has benchmarked its TrueNorth chip, which has a million neurons and 256 million synapses. Academic institutions like the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Stanford University, and the University of Manchester in the U.K. are also working on neuromorphic chips. HPE has shown a computer that emulates the human brain, and it intends to adapt ideas from that for servers.

Intel is reportedly targeting Optane at server platforms and small-capacity cache devices, rather than full-sized SSDs, on the desktop. We now have a better idea of how an Optane datacenter device might perform, at least. Tom's Hardware reports that several Chinese-language media outlets have obtained performance specifications for the purported P4800X device, a 375GB 3D XPoint PCIe SSD designed for data centers. The P4800X's peak sequential throughput is comparable to NAND NVMe devices, but the device's reported latency and endurance figures are a big step forward from existing SSDs. Source: Techbang.com Intel claims 2400 MB/s sequential reads and 2000 MB/s sequential writes for the P4800X, which are competitve but not revolutionary. Intel's current 400 GB P3700 drive achieves sequential speeds up to 2800 MB/s when reading and 2000 MB/s when writing. The 3D XPoint device's reported 550,000 4K read IOPS is another nice improvement, but it's not a huge leap over the 400 GB P3700's 460,000 figure, either. The 3D XPoint device shines when we examine some other specifications. The 375GB P4800X can reportedly achieve 500,000 4K write IOPS, compared to the P3700's more pedestrian 175,000. The P4800X's reported 10µs latency is half of the older drive's specification, too. The P4800X could also boast 30 drive writes per day of endurance. The P3700 touts a 17 DWPD figure, which is already quite high for a NAND SSD. Intel's previous-generation P3600 was rated for a scant 3 drive write cycles per day. The P4800X is reportedly run by an Intel controller and firmware. Pricing and availability were not a part of the leaked information, but we suspect Intel will demand a hefty premium for the improved latency and endurance the drives appear to have on tap.   Tags: Storage Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak AMD Ryzen Lineup & Prices Confirmed, 8 Cores For As Low As $320 By Khalid Moammer Feb 8, 2017 1873Shares Share Tweet Submit AMD’s entire Ryzen CPU lineup has been verified and pricing for its 8 core SKUs confirmed through various online retailers. Last week we finally got a look at the full Ryzen lineup comprised of 17 different CPUs that AMD will be rolling-out. Thanks to comments by AMD’s President & CEO Lisa Su at the company’s last earnings call, we know that that they’re officially launching Ryzen at the end of the month with expected on-shelf availability on March 2nd. It’s not entirely clear yet whether the March 2nd launch will include all 17 Ryzen SKUs. However, what is apparent is that at least three different CPUs will be available on day one. These include the Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X and Ryzen 7 1700. All three of these have been listed online and are available for pre-order on a number of online retailers. All three SKUs feature 8 cores and 16 threads. The most affordable of which, the Ryzen 7 1700 is up for sale with a list price of less than $320. The Ryzen Revolution – i7 6900K Class Performance For 1/3rd The Price & Less Than Half The Power Of the several online retailers that have listed Ryzen CPUs one in particular stands out. It’s shopblt.com, the very same retailer that accurately listed pretty much every AMD CPU right before release. Including the Athlon X4 845 and the Kaveri A10 7850K and A10 7700K chips. Not only that, but its prices were also spot on, exactly matching the official MSRPs at launch. Perhaps it has proven accurate time and time again because it retrieves product pricing data from the database of one of the biggest channel suppliers in the world. With that preface in mind, let’s dig into the details that you’ve all been waiting for. The three chips that have been spotted are all 8 core and 16 thread SKUs as previously mentioned. The 1800X and the 1700X are 95W chips and and the 1700 is rated at 65 watts. That’s right folks, AMD is launching an 8 core, 16 thread CPU with a boost clock of 3.7GHz and a TDP of 65 watts. That’s less than half the TDP of Intel’s 140W 8 core 16 thread i7 6900K, which features the same 3.7GHz boost clock speed. As if thosse figures aren’t mind boggling enough, this chip is listed at less than $320. Which comes in at one fourth the cost of its Intel rival, which regularly retails for over $1100. To put the enormity of this into perspective, you would practically be able build an entire high-end gaming machine around the Ryzen 1700 for the same money that would cost you just to get an i7 6900K chip on its own. AMD’s highest performing Ryzen CPU, the 1800X will retail for less than $499. A piece of information we made public nearly three months ago in our exclusive Ryzen report. So we know that much hasn’t changed since November. What was a bit of a surprise however is the fact that AMD’s 8 core flagship will boost to a whopping 4.0GHz right out of the box despite a frugal 95W TDP. AMD Confirms All Ryzen CPUs Are Unlocked & Overclocking Ready The third Ryzen chip is the 1700X and it comes in between the 1800X and the 1700 in terms of pricing and clock speeds. What you’ll notice is that Ryzen chips with the -X suffix are rated at 95W whilst their equivalents without the X at the end are simply more energy efficient variants with a lower 65W TDP. However, all Ryzen CPUs without exception feature fully unlocked frequency multipliers. And because pretty much all AM4 motherboards support overclocking, with the exception of the low-end A series chipsets, you can rest assured knowing that no matter which Ryzen CPU you pick up you will be able to overclock it to your heart’s content. That is if you choose to do so. Advertisement Ryzen In The Mid-range and Mainstream Segments Considering that in a month’s time you will be able to pick up a Ryzen CPU for $320 with performance that’s confined to the ultra luxury one thousand dollars+ segment of the desktop market today, it’s suffice to say that mid-range and mainstream segments of the market are about to witness the most profound shift we have seen yet in the CPU market. At less than $300 unlocked six core, twelve thread enthusiast Ryzen CPUs will compete with Intel’s unlocked and locked quad-core, four thread i5s. Quad-core 8 thread Ryzen CPUs will completely displace Intel’s lower-end i5s and the more expensive dual core i3s. Full quad-core Ryzen CPUs will go up against dual core Pentiums. At every given price point AMD’s Ryzen lineup is set to offer nearly double the cores and threads whilst maintaining similar single-threaded performance and power efficiency to the competition. AMD Ryzen CPU Cores/Threads TDP Base/Boost Clock Speed Price AMD Ryzen 7 1800X 8/16 95W 3.6/4.0Ghz $499 AMD Ryzen 7 1800 8/16 65W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 7 1700X 8/16 95W 3.4/3.8Ghz $389 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 8/16 65W TBA/3.7Ghz $319 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6/12 95W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6/12 65W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1500 6/12 65W TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1400X 4/8 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4/8 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 5 1300 4/8 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 3 1200X 4/4 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 3 1200 4/4 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AMD Ryzen 3 1100 4/4 TBA TBA/TBA TBA AM4 And The X370, B350, X300 And A300 Chipsets The company kicked things off at CES 2017 with a motherboard showcase featuring 18 different models from ASRock, ASUS, BIOSTAR, GIGABYTE and MSI. The motherboards on display ranged from high-end enthusiast class models with X370 chipsets in the heart of everyone of them to mid-range B350 based designs as well as entry level boards sporting the A320 and A300 chipsets. ASRock X370 Taichi, ASRock X370 Gaming K4, ASRock AB350 Gaming K4 & ASRock A320M Pro4 ASUS B350M-C BIOSTAR X370GT7, BIOSTAR X350GT5 & BIOSTAR X350GT3 GIGABYTE GA-AX370-Gaming K5, GIGABYTE GA-AX370-Gaming 5, GIGABYTE AB350-Gaming 3 & GIGABYTE A320M-HD3 MSI A320M Pro-VD, MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium, MSI B350 Tomahawk & MSI B350M Mortar Nvidia GTX 1070 Memory Issue To Be Addressed Via BIOS Update Ryzen compatible AM4 socket motherboards will come in four different chipset flavors. The X370 chipset is the high-end enthusiast focused contender with the latest and greatest technology and the most robust set of features. The B350 is the mid-range chipset where users will be able to get a lot of functionality and versatility at a more attractive price point. The A300 chipset is the entry-level chipset for more budget constrained computer builds. Then we have the X300, which is a new kind of chipset for AMD. It’s the company’s high-end offering for small form factor motherboards i.e. Mini-ITX and Micro-ATX form factor boards. That’s right, you will be able to cram an 8 core monster i7 6900K class CPU, in a tiny mini-itx board and build incredibly powerful small-form factor PCs with Ryzen. The Enthusiast X370 Chipset We know that many of you reading this will have already seen the demos and read up on the speeds and feeds and are probably interested in learning more about AMD’s newly announced high-end chipset. We’re pleased to say that it does not disappoint. It’s a truly modern chipset with support for the latest memory and storage technologies. Features of the X370 chipset include : Support for M.2 SATA SSDs NVMe 4 DDR4 memory slots (dual channel DDR4) 24 PCIe Gen 3 lanes (from the CPU). 16 PCIe Gen 3 lanes dedicated for graphics with support for up to 3-way CrossFireX & 2-way SLI. 4 PCIe Gen 3 lanes dedicated for storage (NVMe, SATA & PCIe storage) 4 PCIe Gen 3 dedicated for LAN & USB3.1 Gen 2 ports. 8 PCIe Gen 2 lanes (from the chipset) 10 USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (4 from the CPU and 6 from the chipset) 2 USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports 6 USB 2 ports. 6 SATA3 6Gb/s ports (2 from the CPU and 4 from the chipset) This is a huge improvement compared to the company’s current AM3+ and FM2+ stack. We’re talking DDR4 vs DDR3, native NVMe and M.2 support as well as USB 3.1 Gen2. Ryzen has been one of AMD’s most eagerly anticipated products and arguably its most important one in a decade. The new CPU breaks new ground for the Sunnyvale California based chip maker in many ways. It’s the company’s first ever microarchitecture to feature simultaneous multi-threading. It’s built on a process technology that’s as close as ever to parity with Intel since the days of the original Athlon in the early 2000s. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, it’s incredibly competitive. Whether its performance, power efficiency or features, Ryzen easily holds its own against Intel’s best.

AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn't standing still in the face of Ryzens impending release, Hexus reports. According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. Were still not certain which of AMD's new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you're Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you're a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn't your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements. © 2017 Jerusalem Post under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Apple, Google, Uber Fight Travel Ban Next Article > Verizon, T-Mobile Tie for Best Network, OpenSignal Report Finds By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 09 2017 Across the U.S., Verizon and T-Mobile are practically neck and neck in terms of mobile network speeds and performance, according to the latest findings from OpenSignal's crowdsourced monitoring. OpenSignal also found that 4G speeds continue to rise, with typical speeds in many cities surpassing the national average. Of 36 cities the company studied from October through December, 25 now have one or more mobile service providers that deliver average LTE speeds faster than 20 Mbps (megabits per second). The city with the fastest 4G speeds in the new study is Detroit, where both Verizon and T-Mobile average LTE download speeds of more than 25 Mbps. Minneapolis and Chicago also have at least one operator with average 4G speeds of 25 Mbps or greater. OpenSignal's results are based on some 4.6 billion crowdsourced datapoints measured through its mobile app, which is being used by nearly 170,000 people across the U.S. Verizon Retains Top 4G Availability -- for Now Compared to the results in its previous "State of Mobile Networks" report, released in August, OpenSignal found that Verizon had gained some ground over T-Mobile in its 4G speed rankings late last year. "Verizon has clearly taken exception to T-Mobile's recent attempts to steal the network spotlight," the new report noted. "Verizon is fighting back with 4G upgrades of its own, and as our latest results in the U.S. show it's doing so quite effectively. The two are again tied in network speeds in our tests, but T-Mobile continues to chip away at Verizon's vaunted lead in 4G availability." Tests showed that Verizon currently offers the highest 4G availability rates, with those speeds available 88.2 percent of the time. T-Mobile, however, is only two percentage points behind, "the closest we've seen that difference," OpenSignal said. T-Mobile: 'We're Pushing Industry' Overall, all four of the nation's top wireless carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint, realized "significant improvements in their 4G availability scores" over the past six months, according to OpenSignal. While Sprint remains in fourth place in terms of availability, it has improved its performance by nearly seven percentage points during that time, the OpenSignal report noted. The latest report also finds that a growing number of cities across the U.S. have access to faster 4G speeds: 25 now have access to LTE speeds of 20 Mbps or better, compared to the 18 identified in August's report. "Verizon recently began upgrading its networks with LTE-Advanced technology, which definitely explains some of the big jumps in Verizon's speed we’ve seen in the last six months in cities like New York and Orlando," OpenSignal analyst Kevin Fitchard noted in a blog post yesterday. "But we see speeds improvements from other operators as well as the industry goes through the methodical process of tweaking LTE performance across the country. For instance, AT&T and T-Mobile have been deploying LTE in new frequency bands and in many cases are using old spectrum they no longer need for 2G or 3G services." In a statement released yesterday, T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said the new OpenSignal report shows that his company's LTE network-building efforts have "pushed the industry to try to catch up."

Here's what we know about Intel's mystery 8th-gen processors so far. The juicy information was revealed during Intel’s annual investor meeting, with Intel execs teasing plenty of interesting information about where they’re expecting the company to go in the next 12 months. What is Intel up to? Let’s take a step back: why does this matter to you and the laptop or PC purchase you’re thinking of making this year? You may have heard of “7th-gen Intel Core”, otherwise known as Kaby Lake. This is the marketing name for the latest generation of Intel Core i processors you’ll find in new PCs and laptops, and represents the followup to 6th-gen Skylake. Related: Intel Core i explained This new 8th-gen chip? It's previously unknown to us and fits into a gap we didn’t know existed. This unnamed 8th-gen chip uses a 14-nanometre (nm) “process”. At its most basic, the smaller the process the more efficient the processor is, allowing you to squeeze more transistors onto the same-sized piece of silicon. Silicon is expensive, so fitting more of the ultra-important transistors onto them means you can make more efficient use of each little piece. The process of making smaller transistors is also expensive, so Intel has used this 14nm architecture for its 5th-gen Broadwell, 6th-gen Skylake and 7th-gen Kaby Lake products. This new product will use the same 14nm size and, like with all previous advancements, will take advantage of new technology to make the process even more efficient. Intel's strategy so far Here’s what we thought we knew about Intel’s processor road map: Early 2017: 14nm Kaby Lake 2017: 14nm Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X (Extreme, enthusiast chips) Late 2017: 10nm Cannonlake 2018: 14nm Coffee Lake Yesterday’s announcement seems to have turned that on its head. Barring the 'X' series enthusiast updates to Skylake and Kaby Lake, we weren’t expecting another 14nm chip in 2017, so to see one suddenly appear in the second half of this year is surprising. Intel says the new 8th-gen chips will be 15% more powerful than Kaby Lake, which in turn it claims are 15% more powerful than Skylake. That’s a decent boost, especially when you consider many people will own PCs and laptops with much older Intel processors on board. So is this the Coffee Lake mentioned above? We don’t know. Coffee Lake was rumoured to be a set of six-core processors. If this announcement was indeed Coffee Lake, you’d expect the gains to be somewhat more than 15% versus Kaby Lake. It also isn't "Cannonlake", because that architecture is based on a 10nm process while this new mystery one is, as we mentioned, still 14nm. Frankly, and we’re sure you’ll agree, this is all getting a bit ridiculous as – among other things – Intel has thrown a massive spanner in the works for people waiting for AMD’s hotly anticipated Ryzen architecture. How will it all stack up in the end? We just don’t know, but keep your eyes and ears open for more 8th-gen Intel news in the near future. If you're buying a new laptop or PC in the second half of this year, be sure to bookmark this page as we'll be adding all the details as we get them. We've reached out to Intel for clarification on its strategy and will update this piece if the company responds.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop By Joel Hruska on February 10, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Ever since Intel announced that it had created a new type of non-volatile memory in partnership with Micron, dubbed 3D XPoint, there have been questions about how the new memory would perform and what kind of systems might ship it in the future. The ostensible draw of alternative memory technologies like 3D XPoint (Intel markets its drives under the Optane brand) is that it can offer non-volatile storage performance at speeds more comparable to DRAM, but with better power consumption. Discussions on cost are less certain — right now, Intel and Micron are focused on introducing the technology and it’ll be fairly expensive for the near-term future. Long-term price is an unknown — the sheer economy of scale around NAND flash makes it difficult for any new storage technology to challenge in terms of cost-per-GB. Now, however, we have some idea how Optane will perform, at least in Intel’s initial data center SSD. Intel’s P4800X series is a 375GB drive with sequential read/write speeds of 2400MB/s and 2000MB/s respectively. Random 4KB IOPS are rated at 550K/s for reads and 500K/s for writes. Overclockers3D points out that this compares extremely favorably with Samsung’s 960 Pro SSD, which offers up to 330K IOPS for random 4KB reads and writes. Still, it’s worth bearing in mind that IOPS are substantially meaningless without a great deal of information about how the tests were conducted and how the workloads were designed. On their own, they don’t tell us much. One thing we do know, however, is that Optane can deliver excellent performance even with a queue depth of 1. Queue depth refers the number of commands that can be queued within a storage controller at the same time. A queue depth of 32 is commonly used when testing desktop applications and software, and as you can see, a queue depth of 1 produces poor performance on an SSD. Queue depth of 1 on the left, 32 on the right. CrystalDiskMark is a simple test, but it illustrates this issue well enough. The graph above is from my own system, using a spare SSD I’ve got installed. At a queue depth of 32, the SSD is 7.82x faster than with a queue depth of 1 in 4K random reads. The gap between write speed is less dramatic, but QD=32 is still 2.23x faster than QD=1. Typically, storage workloads stack up large queue depths and high-end hardware controllers can handle far more than the 32 queues specified in SATA — but if Optane can deliver excellent performance at low queue depths as well as high, it could prove a potent competitor in any workload dominated by such metrics. These are the first Optane drives, and they’re intended for data centers, not consumers. Intel does have plans to make Kaby Lake accelerators available to customers with a Z270 chipset, but pricing and availability have not been announced. Now read: How do SSDs work?

In the most surprising bit of news, Eassa confirmed that the next generation of Intel Core processors will once again be built on 14-nm technology. In a reply to Anandtech's Ian Cutress, he also reported that Intel's Vice President and General Manager of Client and IoT says that "process tech use will be fluid based on segment and what makes sense." Confirmed with Intel that 8th Gen Core will use updated/enhanced 14nm technology again -- basically 14nm++. — Ashraf Eassa (@TMFChipFool) February 9, 2017 @IanCutress Yeah, as Murthy referred to it at the event, process tech use will be "fluid" based on segment and what makes sense. — Ashraf Eassa (@TMFChipFool) February 9, 2017 Intel slide from Ashraf Eassa Those two bits of news don't seem to mesh all that well on their own, but Diane Bryant (Intel's Executive Vice President and General Manager of its Data Center division) displayed a slide with the statement "data center first for next process node" during the same presentation. That move could imply that rather than letting its Xeons lag an architectural generation during production on the same process as consumer parts, Intel could mean to fab Xeons on a higher-density process first to achieve higher performance and, in turn, higher selling prices and margins from customers thanks to those chips' favored status in its foundry roadmap. It would also imply that Intel's consumer chips will no longer follow a predictable "process-architecture-optimization" model. Attentive gerbils are no doubt already counting on their fingers, since this means the "8th-generation" Intel Core processors will be the fourth series to be fabricated on a 14-nm process. As we saw with Kaby Lake, Intel's process optimizations alone don't tend to offer large performance improvements over the previous generation. If the company isn't making significant architectural changes in the new chips, we might be in for another mild improvement. Alternatively, considering the statement regarding "fluid" process tech usage, we may be seeing some mixture of 14-nm and 10-nm process technologies across various product segments. Intel's product stack is already confusing, but it may soon become downright convoluted. Speculation aside, it seems unlikely we'll be seeing 10-nm desktop chips anytime soon.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Should you still buy this chipmaker after its near-500% rally over the past 12 months? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Feb 10, 2017 at 10:10AM Shares of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) recently surged after the chipmaker posted strong fourth quarter numbers, topped off with solid guidance. Revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion, beating estimates by $40 million. Its non-GAAP loss of $0.01 topped expectations by a penny, and represented a major improvement from its loss of $0.10 per share in the year ago quarter. For the first quarter, AMD expects revenue to rise 18% annually -- crushing analyst estimates for 2% growth. Image source: AMD. Those numbers look solid, but investors looking at AMD's 460% rally over the past 12 months might be wondering if most of that good news is already priced in. Let's take a closer look at AMD's recovery, and see if it's sensible to buy AMD at its highest price in over eight years. A closer look at AMD's growth AMD's quarterly revenue has risen annually for three straight quarters, marking a remarkable rebound from seven straight quarters of declines. Much of that growth was fueled by the EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit, which produces SoCs for non-PC products like Sony's PS4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. That demand is expected to rise this year as both companies launch upgraded consoles for 4K and VR gaming. Revenue from the EESC business rose 4% annually to $506 million last quarter, but operating income fell 20% to $47 million due to higher R&D investments. In the past, the strength of the EESC business offset the relative weakness of the Computing and Graphics unit, which produces x86 CPUs and GPUs. Both product lines have traditionally struggled against Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. But last quarter, AMD's Computing and Graphics revenue rose 28% annually to $600 million on robust sales of its new Polaris-based RX 400 series GPUs. At the time of its launch, the $200 RX 480 was the cheapest VR-capable card on the market -- making it possible to build Rift and Vive-ready desktops for under $1,000. The unit's operating loss of $21 million was also an improvement from its loss of $99 million a year earlier. The RX 480. Image source: AMD. The bull case for AMD Looking ahead, many AMD bulls believe that rising sales of PC and console-based VR headsets can simultaneously lift sales of its custom SoCs and discrete GPUs this year. They also expect AMD's next-gen CPU, Ryzen, to outperform Intel's top-tier i7 processors when they arrive in March, and that its high-end Vega GPUs will outperform NVIDIA's premium tier of Pascal-powered GeForce GPUs. If the Ryzen and Vega chips can achieve those lofty goals, AMD's Computing and Graphics unit could become the company's core growth engine again. AMD could also benefit from the upcoming expiration of a graphics cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA. Intel hasn't been keen on renewing that agreement, which boosts NVIDIA's revenue by $66 million per quarter, and rumors suggest that Intel could sign a comparable licensing deal with AMD instead. AMD also narrowed its losses, reduced its debt, and boosted its cash position in fiscal 2016. Those achievements all counter the bearish argument that AMD's losses will widen, causing it to collapse under its debt load as its cash flows dry up. Lastly, AMD stock remains fundamentally cheap after its massive rally in 2016. It trades with an EV/Sales ratio of 2.8, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. That valuation -- along with its enterprise value of $11.6 billion -- make it a potential buyout or merger target for larger chipmakers. The bear case against AMD Those potential catalysts all sound encouraging, but there are also reasons to avoid AMD. First, console sales could stall if consumer demand for 4K and VR games is weaker than expected. Early sales estimates for VR headsets suggest that demand for smartphone and console-based headsets is outweighing demand for PC-based ones. While that could boost AMD's EESC business, it could throttle demand for its VR-ready GPUs. Meanwhile, Nintendo's upcoming launch of the Switch, which is powered by an NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC, could also disrupt Sony and Microsoft's console sales as the original Wii did a decade ago. Lastly, too much of AMD's future relies on the Ryzen challenging Intel's GPUs and the Vega countering NVIDIA's. While the Ryzen might beat Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors, there's no guarantee that it can topple Intel's 10nm Cannonlake processors, which will launch in late 2017. Likewise, the Vega might beat NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal GPUs, but it could be crushed by NVIDIA's next-gen Volta, which is also expected to launch this year. This means that the Ryzen and Vega could respectively become top-tier CPUs and GPUs this year, but those victories might be short lived. My verdict: Start a small position... for now I believe that investors with a higher tolerance for risk could start partial positions in AMD at current prices. But I also believe that the chipmaker's future growth depends on it bowling a near-perfect game this year -- which could be very tough as Intel and NVIDIA launch their new competing chips.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Feb 10, 2017 at 10:05AM It doesn't matter where you've been; it only matters where you're going. That saying offers a useful starting place for comparing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Though Micron shares trounced those of Intel over the past 12 months, can investors expect a similar performance in the year ahead? INTC data by YCharts To get a better sense of how Intel and Micron Technology stocks compare today, let's run these two semiconductor giants through a three-part analysis to see whose shares are the better buy today. Micron Technology vs. Intel: Financial fortitude In terms of financial stability, Intel has a clear advantage over Micron: Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Micron Technologies $4.3 billion $9.6 billion $3.1 billion 1.7 Intel $32.3 billion $11.7 billion $19.1 billion 1.8 Data sources: Intel and Micron investor relations  Though it carries slightly more debt than Micron, Intel's ability to service its outstanding liabilities with either its cash and investments on hand or its cash from operations gives it far more flexibility than Micron in planning out its future. Debt is not a bad thing in and of itself -- in fact, it can be hugely beneficial under the right circumstances -- but Intel's lower debt level relative to its assets and cash flow make it less risky than Micron. But Micron looks stable enough. Though no hard-and-fast rule exists, the fact that it could, in theory, erase the majority of its liabilities with cash on hand and a year's worth of cash flow makes it leveraged but stable. In terms of the quick ratio, both companies are safe as well. Winner: Intel. Micron Technology vs. Intel: Competitive analysis Though the companies have a long history of working together, Intel and Micron are very different businesses. Most important, Intel enjoys a much stronger competitive position within its two core markets than Micron:  INTC Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts Intel's financial performance is fueled mostly by its two core operating groups: the PC client group and the data center group. Together, they account for about 85% of Intel's sales. Moreover, Intel's chips are the de facto standard in PCs and data centers worldwide. Market share estimates vary, but Intel is thought to control about 85% of the PC processor market and at least 95% of the server chip space. Its technological leadership in each market affords Intel a fair amount of pricing power, which it then reinvests into its business in the form of a massive research and development budget, creating a virtuous cycle and enabling Intel's continued technological leadership in both markets. This isn't the perfect business model, but it does make Intel a model of consistency and profitability, something that can't be said of Micron. Micron's tenuous competitive position is largely a function the memory market as a whole. Because memory is a commodity product, the industry is characterized by several large incumbents, of which Micron is the third largest, trying to match marketwide supply with demand. When supply exceeds demand, unit prices decline, which can lead to heavy losses among memory manufacturers. We saw this scenario play out in 2015 and 2016, triggering a painful sell-off in Micron shares. Now with that trend reversing, Micron should return to profitability, which has been the driving force behind the impressive rally its stock has enjoyed since mid-2016. Yet even so, Micron remains at the mercy of the broader industry dynamics of the memory market, which makes Intel the easy winner here, as far as competitive advantages go. Winner: Intel. Image source: Getty Images. Micron Technology vs. Intel: Valuation analysis Reconciling businesses outlooks with valuations makes for an interesting analysis here. Let's look at how three commonly used valuation metrics appear for Micron Technology and Intel. Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA Micron Technologies N/A 8.6 9.7 Intel 17.7 12.4 7.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  Comparing the two requires a bit of nuance. Micron's flip from loss to profit is captured in its current and forward earnings multiples. As we've seen, Micron is risky, but it's also cheap when viewed on a forward basis -- cheaper than Intel. The decision here comes down to a matter of preference. More aggressive investors might see Micron's volatility as an opportunity to profit. However, Intel still seems quite cheap, given the durability and profitability of its lead microprocessor franchises. Winner: Tie. And the winner is... Intel From a risk-reward standpoint, Micron has more of both. To me, investing in an enduring franchise in Intel is more desirable than the roller coaster-like cyclicality that drives Micron's performance. By winning two of the three categories outright and enjoying a more stable business model, Intel seems like the better stock to buy today. Andrew Tonner has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 10, 2017 at 11:42AM On Feb. 9, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hosted its annual investor meeting, during which the company went over its long-term strategies and business objectives in each of its core business units. Intel's second-largest business unit by revenue, and arguably its most important business for the long term, is its data center group (DCG). The business is attractive for a couple of key reasons. First, it's a large business that still has the potential to deliver meaningful growth. And, perhaps just as importantly, it's extremely profitable, with operating margins coming in at nearly 44% in 2016. Intel server chips. Image source: Intel. In her presentation, DCG chief Diane Bryant talked about how the company expects its profit margins in DCG to come down in the coming years -- something that was likely responsible for the drop in the company's share price in the wake of the investor meeting. Here, I'd like to go over the key reasons for why Intel expects that drop in DCG profitability and why investors shouldn't freak out about it. DCG gets the shiny new manufacturing tech first Historically, when Intel would introduce new manufacturing technologies, the first products to get them would be its personal computer processors. And, recently, it would be the very low-power chips aimed at slim notebooks and 2-in-1 devices that would get the latest technologies, with higher-performance personal computers getting them a bit later. That's all about to change going forward. According to Bryant, the first products to get new manufacturing technologies will be those produced by DCG. It's going to take a little while for DCG to "take the lead," but Bryant indicated that the company's server processors would be the first to adopt its third-generation 10-nanometer technology called 10-nanometer++ and then the follow-on technology known as 7-nanometer. The good news here is that since the chips that Intel's DCG produces are sold to customers willing to pay more for higher performance and additional features. Additionally, as competition heats up in the server market (a lot of companies want a piece of the action that Intel currently dominates), Intel is going to want every potential competitive advantage that it can get. However, this will come at a cost to the company. In the past, Intel would have the benefit of having run its easier-to-manufacture consumer chips on the new technology first, ironing out the kinks and improving manufacturing yields before DCG got to use it. Now, the processors produced by DCG will have to bear that burden -- negatively impacting gross profit margins and, ultimately, operating profit margins. A bigger operating expense burden Intel also indicated that another headwind to DCG operating margin going forward is that DCG will see an "increased allocation of corporate expenses." Remember that the bulk of Intel's research and development spending goes toward "shared" technology development -- that is, on technologies that are used by all of Intel's major business groups such as processors, memory controllers, and other intellectual properties. Since DCG is becoming a larger part of Intel's revenue mix, its share of those common research and development expenses will now go up, too. This increase in operating expenses attributable to DCG is naturally going to negatively impact operating profits and therefore operating margin. Ramp of non-CPU products Between 2017 and 2021, Intel expects that revenue from its server CPU business will grow at a 6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). It expects an overall revenue growth CAGR in the "low-double-digit" percentage range during that time, with the rest of the growth coming from non-CPU products. These non-CPU products, according to Intel, should carry lower gross profit margins than the CPU products do. So, although those products should boost DCG revenue and total operating profit, they should also dilute the average gross profit margin of that business, which in turn should lead to a reduction in operating margin. Don't panic It is clearly disappointing in the near term that Intel is expecting reduced profit margins in DCG. That, coupled with the company's new long-term revenue CAGR expectations in the "low-double-digit" percentage range (down from a previous goal of 15%), is certainly going to ding sentiment around this business. Nevertheless, the moves that Intel is doing here are the correct ones. DCG products should use Intel's latest manufacturing technology advances, particularly as competition heats up, and it's only fair that DCG take on more of the shared operating expense burden given that it's becoming a bigger part of Intel's business. And finally, while the shift in revenue mix from CPU to non-CPU products is clearly expected to dilute gross profit margin, the ramp-up of those products should add to total revenue and gross profit dollars -- it's generally better to have a slightly lower margin percentage on a much higher revenue base than to have a slightly higher-margin percentage on a significantly lower revenue base. In other words, relax -- Intel is making the right moves for the long term.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

clock menu more-arrow Chromebook Pro: life in beta The nightmare before the dream by Dieter Bohn@backlon Feb 10, 2017, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Let's talk about dreams. As a technology reviewer, I have weird ones — both literally and metaphorically. I spend a lot of time testing a wide array of gadgets, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. So the temptation arises to look at them and wish that this tablet could have that laptop's browser or this smartwatch could have that phone's connectivity features. The engineers at Google apparently dream the same way, because they have been spending the last six months or so bringing Android apps to Chrome OS. Android phones have a ton of great apps, but their web browsers pale in comparison to what you can get on a Chromebook. And vice versa: web apps are great, but there are times when it's just not enough, you need a "real" app. This new hybrid system that Google is creating is not a full merging of the two operating systems (which is starting to look less realistic and less desirable by the day), but it could provide all the benefits people dream of when they ask Google to merge Chrome OS and Android. The new Chromebook Pro is the convertible laptop that's supposed to be the first true manifestation of that dream. It's a $549, Intel-based device coming out in April. And maybe by then, it will be the dream made real. But because its software is still in beta right now, it's not a dream at all. It's the other thing. It's a nightmare. This is not a review of the Samsung Chromebook Pro. It's not a review because the Chromebook Pro is not ready to be reviewed yet. What you're about to read is just a story about what technology is like when you're living on the bleeding edge, a tale about software that will (hopefully) ever only be inflicted on tech reviewers and engineers. Beta software is a funny thing. The default advice I give people is to avoid it, but sometimes the siren call of something new and exciting is too much, and often betas are totally usable. Early betas of iOS are too unstable for daily use, but the later ones generally aren't that bad. Same applies for Android betas lately. And heck, once upon a time even stalwart apps like Gmail kept the beta label on for five years. For consumer use, there are good betas and there are bad betas. There are good betas and bad betas. This is a bad beta Another example of a pretty good beta is the software on the Chromebook Plus, the companion device to the one I'm writing about here. It, too, features Android software, but since it has an ARM processor that software is a little less buggy. And since the Plus is theoretically a lower-end device and getting released with that beta software, its foibles are slightly more forgivable. I've reviewed the Chromebook Plus in full here. I'm belaboring all this because what I'm about to describe to you is an experience that you will hopefully never have as a consumer — assuming Google gets its act together. Again, this Chromebook Pro isn't coming out until April, and between now and then Google has insisted to me that everything I'm about to describe is both a known issue and will be fixed. Luckily, Google is working off a very good foundation. Samsung has manufactured a great Chromebook. The Chromebook Pro has a gorgeous touchscreen, a thin metal frame, and an accurate trackpad. The keyboard is good — but sadly not backlit — and it comes with a stylus. The only real difference between the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus is that the Pro has a more powerful Intel processor. There's one cosmetic difference, too: the Pro will be black when it's released; the photos and video you see here are of a silver preproduction unit. Taken just as a Chrome OS device, running the Chrome browser and web apps, I think the Chromebook Pro is going to be great. It can handle running nearly 20 tabs before it starts to slow down, and has a battery that just won't quit. What slowdowns I have experienced have come because there are problems with the Android software that can sometimes affect the rest of the OS. So let's get into the Android app situation. The way Android on Chrome OS works is something like this: Android apps expect to see Android hardware, so Chrome OS acts as a software layer that provides those Android apps everything they need: Wi-Fi, RAM, time from the processor, etc. It's not really emulation, it's more deeply integrated than that. So, for example, Android notifications are fully integrated into Chrome OS's own notification tray. You can also copy / paste from Chrome tabs into Android apps and vice versa. Android can run on both ARM and Intel processors, but the vast majority of Android apps expect to have an ARM processor. That means that the more complex apps — like games — are optimized for ARM and have to be translated on the fly to run on Intel. Chrome OS does that work for them, but it's not really good at it yet. Google itself suggested we try out a game that is pretty commonly used to see if Android devices can display graphics well: 2013’s Asphalt 8. So I dutifully did and the Chromebook Pro dutifully did its best to run the game. But it couldn't keep up with the game engine. The game sputtered along with so many frame rate drops that I literally couldn't steer the car. I kept crashing in the game. The apps crashed, too. Games like Final Fantasy 7 simply wouldn't load. Other apps would open, hang, and die. There are some memory leak problems, too — which means that Android apps would go rogue and start taking up more RAM than they're supposed to, bogging the whole system down. I also ran into performance issues with a key new feature of the Chromebook Pro: the stylus. The input lag borders on unacceptable. It's not just that opening up the main app designed for stylus input — Google Keep — is an invitation to take a break and get a cup of coffee. It's that when you start writing or drawing, the digital ink can sometimes be as much as a second behind where your stylus is on the screen. Stylus input should be measured in milliseconds. Google is working on this, too, and will release a version that uses machine learning to mitigate that lag by predicting which pixels are getting drawn on the fly. The problems go beyond performance, though. There's also the user interface. Right now, Android apps can't be resized like other windows. They can only be displayed in one of a few different sizes: full screen, phone size, or tablet size. Switching between them is kind of a hassle, and I would spend agonizing seconds watching each app reposition and reorient itself. The reason behind the weird window size thing is that this beta is running the last version of Android, Marshmallow. Google is working furiously to get the latest version of Android, Nougat, running on Chrome OS. When it does, you'll be able to resize windows to whatever size you want — provided developers have updated their apps to support it. Once Nougat arrives, both Android apps and Chrome OS itself will be able to pull off tricks they can't now. The clearest example is tablet mode. Right now, when you flip the screen around every window automatically goes full screen. There's no way to put things in windows or into split screen. There's also a bug where Chrome windows don't remember where they're supposed to be on the screen when you reopen them after closing them. Will Android apps ever be good on big screens? I'd like to tell you that everything will be hunky-dory once Nougat arrives, but the problem goes much deeper than that. The real problem is that the thing we've been complaining about with Android apps on big screens for literally five years now is still a huge problem. Most Android apps — including many apps that are made by Google itself — look absolutely atrocious on a large screen. Again, Google is promising that this problem will be mitigated or fixed with Nougat, because there will be more tools for developers to resize their apps and because Google is making a big push to get them to do so. I'd like to believe Google on this, but I'm also five years into hearing these kinds of promises without results. Perhaps Chrome OS with Android will be popular enough to entice developers into doing it. But I’m not confident it will be. Last but certainly not least, Android apps were designed for a phone world, where resources are scant. There are a few standout apps that feel a little more desktop class than others (specifically, Microsoft's Office suite and a few of Adobe's newer apps), but most of them feel and act like what they are: phone apps on a laptop. If Google wants Chrome OS to take on cheap Windows laptops, it needs to do better. I spent an hour talking with the engineers behind Chrome OS about every single one of these and plenty of other issues. In every single case, they told me they were aware of them and actively working on them. I believe them, and because the Chromebook Pro isn't getting released until April, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this will all be resolved upon release. I'll give the Chromebook Pro a proper review then, so again, don't take this cavalcade of complaints as a indicative of what consumers will experience. What you should take away from this experience is that it's not always a great idea to put beta software on the devices you use and depend on every day. Also: that the merging of mobile apps and true desktop web apps may sound wonderful and maybe even inevitable, but, for lack of a better phrase, it’s complicated. I like cookie dough, but it can make you sick. Usually, it's better to wait until everything is fully baked.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's latest Xeon chips based on Skylake due next year AMD sets Ryzen up for a strong start as chip battle with Intel looms Qualcomm's new chip may be too late as ARM server market fades Video Thinnest-ever Apple MacBook hands-on No Intel chip has ever been as expensive as the new Xeon E7-8894 v4 server processor. The $8,898 Xeon chip has massive horsepower with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz. Intel said this is the company's fastest server chip, breaking enterprise application speed records. [ From Docker containers and Nano Server to software-defined storage and networking improvements, Windows Server 2016 is packed with great additions: Get the scoop on Windows Server 2016 from InfoWorld. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter. ] The company's next expensive chip after the E7-8894 v4 is its other 24-core processor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4, which is priced at $7,174. The chips have similar features except for the base clock speed. The new chip starts at 2.4GHz compared to 2.2GHz for the less expensive chip. The $8,898 chip even outprices Intel's fastest supercomputing chip, the Xeon Phi 7290F, which is priced at $6,401. It is also over four times more expensive than the costliest PC chip, the $1,723 Core i7-6950X for gaming desktops. Some price competition could come from AMD, which is reentering the server market with Zen-based chips in the second quarter. Its initial server chips code-named Naples have up to 32 cores. AMD has not revealed the target market for Naples, but it could be cloud providers. During an earnings call, AMD indicated Naples chips would be competitively priced, and downplayed its margins expectations. AMD is projecting Zen chips to be high performance, but the company is looking for volume shipments and may not participate in the low-volume market of servers with more than eight sockets. The Xeon E7-8894 v4, which is based on the Broadwell architecture, is priced high for many reasons. It is targeted at fault tolerant servers used by financial or retail companies which need highly reliable systems for transactions and fraud detection. These companies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if a server crashed. The new chip also has features not found in regular PC or server chips, like error correction and RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability), which can diagnose and troubleshoot issues without crashing servers. The chips also have high levels of I/O and networking integration. Right now server buyers don't have bargaining power with Intel, which has more than a 90 percent market share in server chips. Intel charges a hefty premium for the performance and adjacent technologies it bundles, including server and networking gear. The E7 v4 chips aren't high in volume shipments, and are made in smaller batches. But these are highly profitable chips and fuel revenue for Intel, which is now relying more on data center equipment than PCs for growth in the future. Server chips already have a high markup, but average prices have been going up in recent years and will continue to rise, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel, during a speech at a investor day meeting in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday. Prices have been going up due to new applications like machine learning and analytics and the growth of business cloud services, Bryant said. "Because they see value in our high-end products, they are buying up the stack," Bryant said. But server purchases have stalled after years of growth, and Bryant projected a 5 percent decline in server CPU shipments going into 2021. The company isn't expecting to grow from server CPU shipments, but from adjacent product shipments to telecom and cloud providers. Competition from AMD has been worked into the server chip price and shipment projections, Bryant said. Intel plans more potentially powerful and expensive chips this year. The company will ship a deep learning chip called Knights Mill and a separate chip called Lake Crest that will integrate Xeon with a deep-learning chip based on technology acquired from Nervana Systems.

Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-02-10 14:00:00 UTC Mashable Choice highlights the best of everything we cover, have experienced first-hand and would recommend to others. What's the easiest way to make an existing gadget new and refreshing? Just add a stylus. At least that seems to be the trend these days. Samsung's new Chromebook Plus and Pro are the latest computers to embrace the digital pen.  Priced at $449 and $549, respectively, Samsung's 2-in-1 Chromebooks cost more than your average Chromebook, but also offer far more utility. SEE ALSO: Samsung's new 2-in-1 Chromebooks now include a stylus I've been trying out the Chromebook Pro, which comes out in April, for the last few weeks and it's really incredible to see how far Chromebooks have come since their original launch so many moons ago. The Chromebook Pro has proven to be more than enough to replace my 13-inch MacBook Air — and that's mostly because of access to Android apps via the Google Play Store. But before we jump into that, let's talk about the hardware, because for $550, it's lovely and not at all cheap-looking or feeling (at least to me). Image: lili sams/mashable The aluminum body is as sturdy as it gets and doesn't flex the way so many plastic Chromebooks do. It's a handsome Chromebook, for sure. The 12.3-inch touchscreen flips a full 360 degrees and transforms into a tablet, and works in various modes in-between (i.e. "stand" and "tent"). Like Samsung's flagship mobile phones, the bright Super AMOLED display on the Chromebook Pro is just stunning with 2,400 x 1,600 resolution and vibrant colors that pop and make you want to reach out and just touch images. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE At least on paper, the Chromebook Pro is nearly on par with Apple's MacBook. It's got an Intel Core m3 processor and Intel HD Graphics 515. The Core m3 isn't the most powerful processor in Intel's arsenal, but for the Chromebook Pro it's more than enough to juggle a dozen tabs without slow to a crawl. The Chromebook Pro comes with 4GB of RAM, which is half as much as the MacBook, but since you're basically spending most of your time in Chrome and not running desktop-grade apps like Final Cut Pro X that tax the hardware, it's plenty.  Like on most Chromebooks, storage is pretty limited. The laptop comes with 32GB of internal storage, but you can expand that via the microSD card slot. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Samsung says the Chromebook Pro's battery lasts up to 10 hours, but the reality is more like anywhere between 6-8 hours of mixed usage (Chrome, music streaming in the background, watching YouTube videos).  As for ports, the Chromebook Pro has two USB-C ports, so you can charge and plug in an accessory, and a headphone jack.  Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE There are two key features that any good laptop needs to get right: the keyboard and trackpad.  Typing on the island-style keys feels mostly good with really comfortable, bouncy travel on each key, but my biggest complaint is the keyboard isn't quite full-sized, which means some of the keys like backspace, tab, and enter are a little smaller than the others and the entire typing experience feels a little cramped. It's a minor quibble that is annoying, but not a total deal breaker by any means. The trackpad, however, is superb. It's not as large as on some laptops like the 12-inch MacBook, but who cares: it's super smooth and responsive. I've said it many times before and I'll say it again: It's embarrassing that Chromebooks have better trackpads than so many Windows laptops.  Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Of course, the marquee feature, the stylus, is probably the reason why you're here.  Is it any good? The short answer is yes. The long answer is: Only if you don't expect Surface Pen or Apple Pencil-level pinpoint accuracy and pressure sensitivity.  Serious artists may not be as impressed, but casual doodlers will like it a lot, especially how it integrates with software. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE As soon as you pull out the stylus, a menu of tools pops up on the screen. You could use the stylus to capture a region of the screen, capture the entire screen, make a new note, switch on a magnifying glass to enlarge parts of the screen, or turn on the laser pointer mode. Notes and doodles are all stored in Google Keep. But the coolest part is that Keep has advanced hand-writing recognition so you can search hand-written notes. It's really impressive when it works, but can sometimes be a miss (like for recognizing cursive). Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Perhaps even more exciting than the stylus is support for Android apps via the Google Play store.  One of the main complaints about Chromebooks is that they're limited to web apps. For some people, Google's suite of services (Docs, Gmail, Maps, etc.) is all they need. But others, like myself, want and need more. Android apps on Chromebooks completely changes the game and gives these predominately cloud-based laptops access to the same app ecosystem on Android phones and tablets. Whether you need apps like Snapseed or Lightroom to edit images or just want to play some games, the Chromebook Pro can handle them. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Most Android apps work just like they do on Android, but your experience will vary depending on the app because not all of them are optimized with for keyboard and mouse. For instance, some apps like Slack appear to work well with mouse and keyboard, until you realize you can't send messages by pressing the "enter" key and have to lift your hand up to tap the send (paper airplane) button on the screen. The version of Google Play and Android apps I tested was still in beta, so things will definitely change come April, but even with some of the bugs, it looks very promising. Image: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE Chromebooks are great and fit the needs for many people these days, but the one thing I keep hearing over and over is that they wish their Chromebooks did more. While it's still not quite the equal to a Mac or Windows laptop, the Samsung Chromebook Pro offers more than any previous Chromebook before and lays the foundation for other Chromebooks to follow suit this year. If the Chromebook Pro is any indication, 2017 is the year Chromebooks really grow up and blossom into computers we can all take more seriously. Samsung Chromebook Pro The Good Sharp, bright screen • Handy, responsive built-in stylus • Excellent trackpad and touchscreen The Bad Stylus isn't as sensitive as Apple Pencil • Slightly cramped keyboard The Bottom Line With a stylus, Samsung's Chromebook Pro gives Chromebooks a much-needed creative boost.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop Intel releases specs for first Optane SSD, new drive should pack a wallop By Joel Hruska on February 10, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Ever since Intel announced that it had created a new type of non-volatile memory in partnership with Micron, dubbed 3D XPoint, there have been questions about how the new memory would perform and what kind of systems might ship it in the future. The ostensible draw of alternative memory technologies like 3D XPoint (Intel markets its drives under the Optane brand) is that it can offer non-volatile storage performance at speeds more comparable to DRAM, but with better power consumption. Discussions on cost are less certain — right now, Intel and Micron are focused on introducing the technology and it’ll be fairly expensive for the near-term future. Long-term price is an unknown — the sheer economy of scale around NAND flash makes it difficult for any new storage technology to challenge in terms of cost-per-GB. Now, however, we have some idea how Optane will perform, at least in Intel’s initial data center SSD. Intel’s P4800X series is a 375GB drive with sequential read/write speeds of 2400MB/s and 2000MB/s respectively. Random 4KB IOPS are rated at 550K/s for reads and 500K/s for writes. Overclockers3D points out that this compares extremely favorably with Samsung’s 960 Pro SSD, which offers up to 330K IOPS for random 4KB reads and writes. Still, it’s worth bearing in mind that IOPS are substantially meaningless without a great deal of information about how the tests were conducted and how the workloads were designed. On their own, they don’t tell us much. One thing we do know, however, is that Optane can deliver excellent performance even with a queue depth of 1. Queue depth refers the number of commands that can be queued within a storage controller at the same time. A queue depth of 32 is commonly used when testing desktop applications and software, and as you can see, a queue depth of 1 produces poor performance on an SSD. Queue depth of 1 on the left, 32 on the right. CrystalDiskMark is a simple test, but it illustrates this issue well enough. The graph above is from my own system, using a spare SSD I’ve got installed. At a queue depth of 32, the SSD is 7.82x faster than with a queue depth of 1 in 4K random reads. The gap between write speed is less dramatic, but QD=32 is still 2.23x faster than QD=1. Typically, storage workloads stack up large queue depths and high-end hardware controllers can handle far more than the 32 queues specified in SATA — but if Optane can deliver excellent performance at low queue depths as well as high, it could prove a potent competitor in any workload dominated by such metrics. These are the first Optane drives, and they’re intended for data centers, not consumers. Intel does have plans to make Kaby Lake accelerators available to customers with a Z270 chipset, but pricing and availability have not been announced. Now read: How do SSDs work?

According to reports in the media, Apple leaked the hardware specifications through its MacOS 10.12.4 public beta. The OS further hints at products that haven’t been released yet indicating that Apple could be having a new range of devices up its sleeves and could reveal them this year. According to Forbes report, Apple is working on its MacOS to accommodate the MacBook Pro’s update to Intel’s seventh generation chipset “Kaby Lake.” Intel has already started manufacturing these chips in large numbers and there is a strong possibility that Microsoft too is going to use these processors for its Surface Pro 5. Because MacBook Pro 2016 was released at a time when Intel was still working on Kaby Lake, Apple was forced to use Intel’s sixth generation chipset. However, with Intel now already mass producing Kaby Lake processors, MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to use them. For those who already own a MacBook Pro 2016, they wouldn’t really find a whole lot of difference in the MacBook Pro 2017 performance as Kaby Lake is only a minor upgrade of Sky lake. Beyond the slight performance improvement, we expect MacBook Pro 2017 to feature improved internal graphics as well as longer battery life and support for 4K displays. Overall, MacBook Pro lineup of Skylake processor will now be replaced Kaby Lake. The i5 6360U will be replaced by i5 7260U, the i5 6267U by the i5 7267U, the i7 6700HQ by the i7 7700HQ, and so on. You can check the complete details at Pike’s Universum. We expect MacBook Pro 2017 to be released later this year – sometime around Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference.

Intel Responds to AMD's Ryzen Onslaught with Core i7 and i5 Updates PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 10 2017 AMD is getting ready to roll out its new Ryzen CPUs, promising significantly improved performance not only over AMD's previous processor line but also in comparison to the best that Intel currently has to offer. AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn't standing still in the face of Ryzens impending release, Hexus reports. According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. Were still not certain which of AMD's new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you're Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you're a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn't your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements. © 2017 Jerusalem Post under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Apple, Google, Uber Fight Travel Ban Next Article > Verizon, T-Mobile Tie for Best Network, OpenSignal Report Finds By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 09 2017 Across the U.S., Verizon and T-Mobile are practically neck and neck in terms of mobile network speeds and performance, according to the latest findings from OpenSignal's crowdsourced monitoring. OpenSignal also found that 4G speeds continue to rise, with typical speeds in many cities surpassing the national average. Of 36 cities the company studied from October through December, 25 now have one or more mobile service providers that deliver average LTE speeds faster than 20 Mbps (megabits per second). The city with the fastest 4G speeds in the new study is Detroit, where both Verizon and T-Mobile average LTE download speeds of more than 25 Mbps. Minneapolis and Chicago also have at least one operator with average 4G speeds of 25 Mbps or greater. OpenSignal's results are based on some 4.6 billion crowdsourced datapoints measured through its mobile app, which is being used by nearly 170,000 people across the U.S. Verizon Retains Top 4G Availability -- for Now Compared to the results in its previous "State of Mobile Networks" report, released in August, OpenSignal found that Verizon had gained some ground over T-Mobile in its 4G speed rankings late last year. "Verizon has clearly taken exception to T-Mobile's recent attempts to steal the network spotlight," the new report noted. "Verizon is fighting back with 4G upgrades of its own, and as our latest results in the U.S. show it's doing so quite effectively. The two are again tied in network speeds in our tests, but T-Mobile continues to chip away at Verizon's vaunted lead in 4G availability." Tests showed that Verizon currently offers the highest 4G availability rates, with those speeds available 88.2 percent of the time. T-Mobile, however, is only two percentage points behind, "the closest we've seen that difference," OpenSignal said. T-Mobile: 'We're Pushing Industry' Overall, all four of the nation's top wireless carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint, realized "significant improvements in their 4G availability scores" over the past six months, according to OpenSignal. While Sprint remains in fourth place in terms of availability, it has improved its performance by nearly seven percentage points during that time, the OpenSignal report noted. The latest report also finds that a growing number of cities across the U.S. have access to faster 4G speeds: 25 now have access to LTE speeds of 20 Mbps or better, compared to the 18 identified in August's report. "Verizon recently began upgrading its networks with LTE-Advanced technology, which definitely explains some of the big jumps in Verizon's speed we’ve seen in the last six months in cities like New York and Orlando," OpenSignal analyst Kevin Fitchard noted in a blog post yesterday. "But we see speeds improvements from other operators as well as the industry goes through the methodical process of tweaking LTE performance across the country. For instance, AT&T and T-Mobile have been deploying LTE in new frequency bands and in many cases are using old spectrum they no longer need for 2G or 3G services." In a statement released yesterday, T-Mobile CTO Neville Ray said the new OpenSignal report shows that his company's LTE network-building efforts have "pushed the industry to try to catch up."

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Intel Responds to AMD's Ryzen Onslaught with Core i7 and i5 Updates PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 10 2017 AMD is getting ready to roll out its new Ryzen CPUs, promising significantly improved performance not only over AMD's previous processor line but also in comparison to the best that Intel currently has to offer. AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn't standing still in the face of Ryzens impending release, Hexus reports. According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. Were still not certain which of AMD's new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you're Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you're a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn't your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements. © 2017 Jerusalem Post under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Russian Hackers Get Burned in Deal Next Article > Salesforce Ties Its CRM into Quip Productivity Suite By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 09 2017 CRM giant Salesforce introduced several new features to its Quip productivity platform this week, including a new way to import CRM (customer relationship management) data directly into Quip documents and spreadsheets. The changes will help increase productivity and allow users to collaborate with each other more easily, according to Salesforce. "Quip is extending the power of Salesforce with a sleek, next-generation productivity solution designed for teams -- empowering everyone across an organization with the tools they need to collaborate more effectively, work smarter and supercharge their productivity,”" the company said in a statement. The Hyper-Connected Workplace Salesforce said Quip's new features come in response to the hyper-connected nature of the modern workplace, in which employees are forced to sort through disconnected email threads, to-do lists and applications to gather information they need while the work itself happens somewhere else. "According to IDC, knowledge workers spend 61 percent of their workweek answering email, searching for information and communicating internally," Salesforce said. "Additionally, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates companies can raise, through new technologies, the productivity of knowledge workers by up to 25 percent." To help achieve those numbers, the company introduced several new features to the Quip platform, including new integrations for Salesforce users, a new checklist and an improved user experience. Importing Salesforce Data into Quip The live data feature allows users to import CRM data from Salesforce, such as account values and service cases, to Quip documents. Once in Quip, the information automatically syncs with Salesforce. For example, with a single export, sales reps can generate forecasting spreadsheets that will be updated with the most recent Salesforce data, the company said. The Quip Lightning component, meanwhile, enables teams to link, access and create Quip documents, spreadsheets and task lists directly from within Salesforce. This allows users to find and collaborate on documents within the context of their businesses. For example, a sales rep will be able to quickly create a task list within an opportunity record to ensure the team is aligned on the final steps necessary to close the deal.

Trying Intel Kabylake Graphics With Civilization VI On Ubuntu Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 10 February 2017 at 06:30 AM EST. 1 Comment I was very surprised to find out that I was able to get Intel HD Graphics working with Aspyr Media's latest Linux game port, Civilization VI. Here are some benchmark results. Aspyr Media only lists NVIDIA graphics as officially supported, but I couldn't resist trying out the latest-generation Intel Kabylake graphics for this game. Yesterday I posted 14-way NVIDIA benchmarks of Civilization 6 on Linux while my RadeonSI results are coming up shortly... Using Mesa 17.1-dev + Linux 4.10 on an Ubuntu 16.10 box with Core i7 7700K HD Graphics 630, I was shocked that Civilization VI started up right away and appeared to be rendering correctly... The benchmark mode also worked. At least for the benchmark mode, the rendering appeared correct, so I ran a few benchmarks to see. Even with the lowest quality settings at a mere resolution of 1024 x 768, the Core i7 7700K system couldn't top 30 FPS. With higher quality settings? Not above 10 FPS. When pushing the i7-7700K Kabylake box with Linux 4.10 + Mesa 17.1 to 1080p, the frame-rate dropped from 26 to 21 FPS. Keep in mind that Civilization 6's benchmark mode is on the heavier side compared to actual gameplay. So while it was a surprise Intel Kabylake graphics on Mesa Git were rendering the game correctly, the performance is very, very slow. In actual gameplay it would probably be too choppy to be playable even with the lowest quality settings, but maybe when Kabylake Iris Graphics roll-out there will be more possibilities for Intel Linux gaming. Our NVIDIA results also show how heavy of a port Civ 6 is with its OpenGL implementation. The RadeonSI numbers for this game up next. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Digital Trends MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro gaming laptop review Fast yet thin, the MSI Stealth Pro is a sharp as any Blade Share DT Recommended Product MSI’s updated GS63VR makes a big leap up the gaming laptop food chain. MSI’s updated GS63VR makes a big leap up the gaming laptop food chain. MSI’s updated GS63VR makes a big leap up the gaming laptop food chain. Highs Solid CPU performance Handles games beautifully at 1080p Plenty of connectivity Display offers solid contrast ratio Lows Packed with bloatware Display’s gamma is inaccurate DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Recommended Product Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro gaming laptop review By Brad Bourque Posted on 02.06.17 (updated on 02.08.17) Research Center: MSI GS63VR 6RF Stealth Pro You’ve likely come across MSI’s GS60 if you’ve shopped for gaming laptops in the last ten years. Despite minor changes each year, the look remains the same — a thin, black chassis with a colorful Steelseries keyboard and whatever Nvidia discrete graphics option is trendy. But this time felt a little different. Intel’s mobile CPU offerings are more power efficient than ever, and Nvidia’s mobile line performs very similarly to the desktop chips. That could mean a bigger leap forward than normal for this year’s edition, which is just under seven tenths of an inch thick. More: Acer Predator 15 review To that end, MSI has picked the Intel Core i7-6700HQ, paired up with 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1060 for gaming. For storage, you’ll find a 256GB SSD and a 1TB HDD, and a 1080p screen, with a $1,700 MSRP that often falls closer to $1,550. Is this the year the GS60 finally rises from evergreen option to true competitor? A fuzzy bottom MSI’s GS63VR might look familiar. If it does, it’s because MSI builds these enclosures in-house, and then licenses them out to other manufacturers for rebranding. It’s a bland affair, but the bright side is a lower chassis that feels sturdy and svelte, whether tucked under your arm or out in a meeting. Turn off the RGB keys, and no one would guess you’re using a gaming laptop. The screen is a different story. It’s slightly flimsy, bending and curving a bit when you open or close the lid. MSI’s logo at the center of the screen on the bottom bezel is even worse, flexing dramatically at the slightest touch. It’s not an uncommon problem for smaller systems, although most higher-end models avoid it. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Strangely, the MSI has a fuzzy bottom – no joke! The underside is coated in a thin fabric. This is a design choice we’re not clear on. Theoretically, this helps keep any heat from radiating as badly into the user’s lap. It never seemed to get too hot around the bottom, so if that was the goal, it works as intended. It also keeps an otherwise slick laptop from sliding around on a desktop much, although most systems accomplish the same without getting warm-and-fuzzy. Rich set of plugs What the MSI lacks in looks, it makes up for with a healthy number of wired connections. Up the left side, you’ll find 3.5mm audio in and out, a full-sized SD card slot, Ethernet, and three USB 3.0 ports. Around the right side, there’s a full-sized HDMI port, Mini DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3, and an extra USB 2.0 for good measure. That’s a lot of connection options for such a slim machine, even among other gaming systems. Full-sized video outputs are always appreciated, particularly the inclusion of HDMI 2.0, for 60Hz 4K. That’s an option the best gaming monitors are frequently supporting. A familiar keyboard Like the system’s design, the MSI’s SteelSeries keyboard is one we’re very familiar with. It packs in a numpad, an increasingly uncommon feature on 15-inch laptops. It’s a bit narrow, a problem that expands to the whole keyboard. Thankfully, important buttons like “backspace” and both shifts are full-width, a blessing for gamers. Though bland, the chassis feels sturdy and svelte. Gaming laptops are typically fitted with comfortable, responsive keyboards, and what the MSI lacks in spaciousness, it makes up for with chunky switches that have a clear activation point and solid movement. They’re bolstered by full, bright back-lighting in RGB zones, allowing you to customize the look to your liking. The touchpad isn’t as exciting. The integrated buttons are a bit mushy, and there isn’t a clear indicator between the left and right click areas. It’s spacious, but not as wide or tall as some of the massive touchpads we’ve grown used to seeing in more expensive laptops. Deep contrast, hurt by gamma The MSI’s 15-inch, 1080p panel is the baseline resolution for gaming systems these days. More and more, high-end systems have reached for 1440p or 4K panels — unfortunately, mobile gaming hardware can’t always keep up with the latest games at native resolution. We have no problem with the MSI chosen here, and feel it’s a good match with the GTX 1060 graphics chip. While the GS63VR’s display isn’t impressive, it scores well enough across the board. Its maximum brightness and contrast are both right at acceptable levels, without really excelling in either category, particularly when faced off against recent OLED panels that have made their way into systems like the Alienware 13. Color gamut is average, so nothing to complain about there. The gamma is too low, resulting in slightly washed-out images, and color accuracy is off, but that’s not likely to matter too much. The result is a panel that fits all the needs of the gamer on the go. Contrast is one of the most important aspects when it comes to gaming, allowing for deep, dark blacks and brighter explosions and light sources. In that sense, the MSI’s display performs well, but you’ll typically have to tweak the in-game gamma to get the most out of it. Once you do, you’ll find a pleasantly deep image, even if it doesn’t keep up with newer OLED panels in terms of black levels. MSI GS63VR 6RF Stealth Pro Compared To Alienware 13 R3 Acer Predator 15 AVADirect Avant P750DM2-G Razer Blade (2016) MSI GS60 Ghost Pro Acer Predator 17 G9-791-79Y3 Alienware 15 (2015) Asus ROG G501 Digital Storm Triton Acer Aspire V15 Nitro Edition Alienware 17 AVADirect Clevo P157SM-A MSI Global GT60 Dominator Pro Lenovo IdeaPad Y500 Origin Eon 17-S Movies are less appealing, simply because there isn’t always an easy way to adjust the gamma back to standard levels. As such, you may find that darker scenes in media look overexposed, and washed out.  On the bright side, VLC allows easy adjustment for video files, making off-kilter gamma an easily solvable problem. Louder isn’t always better If there’s one thing the MSI’s speakers do well, it’s volume. They are loud. Yet turning the volume up all the way, even while playing music, is ill-advised, as the tone becomes a serious issue. Even at half volume, the GS63VR’s speakers crack and sputter, and bass is non-existent. Granted, most gaming laptop users are going to bring a pair of headphones, and audio quality is a sore spot for slimmer laptops. But the MSI performs worse than most. We’ve seen this chip before Our review unit was equipped with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ, the most common quad-core chip for laptops. It’s a familiar chip to us, as we’ve tested it in multiple systems over the last year. We didn’t expect any surprises. Apart from the AVADirect Avant’s desktop-grade CPU claiming several victories, the MSI’s Core i7-6700HQ is one of the stronger options we’ve seen in a gaming laptop so far. It claims victories over both the Acer Predator 15, and Surface Book with Performance Base. We have more systems to compare in our older Handbrake 4K video conversion test, and the MSI keeps up there too. It even beats out the desktop-grade AVADirect Avant’s CPU, at least in some of our test situations. More: Razer Blade (2016) review Of course, CPU isn’t the only thing that matters when it comes to gaming. Everything from the solid state drive to the graphics chip can make a huge difference in framerate and gaming quality. Life in the fast lane Our review unit came packed with two hard drives. The boot drive was a 256GB Samsung SM951 — a common PCIe SSD — with a 1TB data drive for some extra games or media. The NVMe SSD in the MSI screamed past the competition in terms of read speed. Not surprising, considering the only other comparable system we’ve tested with a PCIe SSD is the Razer Blade. Even in terms of write speed, where mid-tier NVMe drives tend to fall behind, the GS63VR’s offering holds a strong lead. It might not feel a lot faster than a SATA SSD moment to moment, but it makes a big difference in both longevity and SSD-intensive tasks. GPU test track This time around, the GS63VR is powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, the equivalent of last generation’s GTX 970M. It’s a powerful mobile chip, and one that should be more than capable of handling modern games at the system’s native 1080p resolution. The GS63VR trades blows with its closest competitor, the Acer Predator 15, in the synthetic 3DMark graphical tests. Both systems are remarkably similar, so it’s no real surprise that the difference between the two is never more than three percent. The AVADirect Avant’s GTX 1070 steals a win over both laptops, partially thanks to its full-power desktop Core i5, but mostly it’s the higher-end GPU that deserves credit. On the open road We’ve tested the GTX 1060 in several situations, and out on the open road, it handles 1080p gaming without breaking a sweat, and can even stay competitive when the resolution goes up. The MSI’s 75 frame per second average in Battlefield 1, with the settings cranked up, is a strong start, and the score is exactly where we’d like to see it. It should be more than capable of holding the 60FPS ideal spot. While the average framerate in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided might not look so sharp, it’s a very demanding game, and the MSI’s score is reasonably average. With a little tuning in the settings, you should have no issue pushing the game to 60 FPS or higher, which is all you can really ask from a slim gaming laptop. More: Alienware 13 R3 review All in all, the MSI’s performance in-game isn’t going to set any records. But it’s more than enough for gamers looking to take their evening of Overwatch into the living room, and it should be able to keep up at 1080p for at least a few years. Thin without sacrificing battery life There are two aspects to portability — size and battery life. In the former, the MSI excels, with a slim footprint and an efficient use of space that allows for a full-sized numpad and trackpad. At just under .7 inches thick, the GS63VR has a waistline.02 mm thinner than the Razer Blade. It feels great. Typically, a slim chassis means less room for batteries, and you trade backpack space for longevity. The MSI packs in a surprisingly mid-range 54Wh battery. Yet it manages to hit almost five hours in our video loop, which is good news for travelers and movie lovers. The MSI also manages to power through just over three hours of the Peacekeeper browser benchmark before collapsing from exhaustion, a score that either ties its competitors, or beats them by up to an hour. It doesn’t quite keep up with non-gaming systems, but among laptops with discrete graphics, it holds its own well. So very bloated While other high-end system manufacturers have worked hard to cut back on unnecessary bundled software, MSI has embraced the bloatware life with a swath of intrusive software of dubious utility. In fact, there was so much extra software on our review unit that the first thing we did was run a fresh installation of Windows 10, as we were having compatibility issues with our benchmarking software. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends It’s not a rare problem for gaming laptops, which often pack in extra software and optimization utilities. To have them be so bad that you need to reinstall the OS is another issue entirely. The upshot is that it’s an easy fix that doesn’t take very long. If the idea of installing your own OS is a completely foreign one, it’s worth noting you might struggle with the MSI right out of the box. Warranty MSI provides a one year warranty on all of its laptops. That’s fairly standard for laptops of any category, and right in line with the MSI’s competitors. As an added bonus, MSI also covers damage because of “drops, spills, electrical surges, or fire” and will repair or replace the system once within the first year. All you have to cover is shipping back to MSI. Our Take MSI’s GS63VR packs familiar components into a plain chassis, but that doesn’t mean it’s boring or useless. In fact, MSI manages to provide competitive gaming performance, paired up with a decent 1080p panel, in one of the slimmest designs we’ve yet to see from a gaming notebook. Is there a better alternative? While the gaming laptop world grows more crowded every day, the MSI GS63VR is now one of the slimmest on the market. If you don’t plan on using a gaming laptop as your daily driver, the AVADirect Avant or the Asus ROG G752 bulk up a bit, but offer better performance options. The DT Accessory Pack Razer DeathAdder Chroma gaming mouse $50 Sennheiser PC 373D - 7.1 surround sound gaming headset $249 Razer BlackWidow Chroma Clicky mechanical gaming keyboard $125 If backpack space is at a minimum, or you need to fly under the radar with your gaming, the Razer Blade is an option. Origin also offers almost the exact same chassis with its EVO-15, but expect to pay a couple hundred dollars more for it. Paying more for the Origin does net you better customer support, and provides additional customization options. How long will it last? With the latest generation Nvidia graphics and a PCIe SSD, now is a good time to pick up the MSI GS63VR in terms of longevity. The only knock against it is the 6th-generation Intel hardware, but MSI announced at CES 2017 that the GS63VR will move to the 7th-gen soon– so wait if that concerns you. The 1080p screen is limiting in some ways, but also ensures you have enough overhead to keep playing the latest games at native resolution for a few years. Should you buy it? Yes. This MSI doesn’t turn heads like an Alienware, but it’s perfect for weekend warriors looking to keep a low profile, while still churning out smooth performance in modern games. Plus, it’s well-priced, with a $1,700 MSRP that often falls under $1,600 fully tricked out, without making any major compromises, apart from needing to uninstall a bunch of bloatware. Previous models of the GS60 didn’t impress us, but this new version is a huge step in the right direction.

So what's next? According to Valve chief Gabe Newell, the future of VR is all power: lighter, more capable headsets that are hooked up to PCs much more powerful than what most people own right now. "VR is going to drive much higher computational and GPU loads than we see out of existing desktop games," Newell said recently.  "Like, I would argue that the smartest thing AMD and Intel and Nvidia could do is give away VR development systems to software developers, because we're going to consume the shit out of Intel and AMD CPUs! Much more so than high-end games are doing right now." Plus, he's confident that PC-powered room-scale VR will progress to "house-scale" VR in the near future, as it becomes possible to knit several "room-scale" VR spaces together into a single space. Of course, you'd need room-scale-capable wireless VR headsets too, but Newell believes they're a "solved problem" that are right around the corner. "My expectation is that [wireless] will be an add-on in 2017, and then it will be an integrated feature in 2018," said Newell, speaking during a recent press briefing attended by Gamasutra and other outlets. The conversations that ensued saw Newell and fellow staffers opening up a bit about the state of the company's VR hardware and software development efforts. More notably, for devs who are making VR games and want to continue making VR games for the foreseeable future, they spoke a bit about where they see the VR market going in the next few years -- and what steps the company is taking to try and nudge it forward. As we reported yesterday, Newell says Valve is currently developing three new "full" VR games, using both its own Source 2 engine and Unity. These are games Valve expects to charge for, games the company hopes will attract a lot of attention. Designing VR games with "mass appeal" "We're definitely trying to build stuff with mass appeal," Newell says, as opposed to the sort of prototypes and experiments (like The Lab) that have dominated Valve's VR software output to date. According to Newell, the folks at Valve have learned enough about VR development that they're willing to start making some bigger bets.   "We're pretty sure that all the game developers are going to learn positive or negative lessons from what we do, which is sort of where we think we need to be." "We have this theory: we think we can make three big games, we think that we know enough now to do that, and we're going to find out if that's the case. We're pretty sure that all the game developers are going to learn positive or negative lessons from what we do, which is sort of where we think we need to be," he said. "There will be really clear design choices that we're making, in each of these games. They're very different. Each game developer will be able to look at those and say, that was great, that was not as great. Which is part of, from our point of view, that's a useful charateristic of these three." Pushing VR game design forward is important to the folks at Valve because, according to Newell, there are some great VR experiences out there -- but not enough to justify millions of people buying PC-driven headsets. In Valve's eyes it's quality/quantity of available software, rather than price of entry, that's keeping a lot of people from buying into the VR market. "If you took the existing [PC-driven] VR systems and made them 80 percent cheaper, there's still not a huge market. There's still not a really incredibly compelling reason for people to spend 20 hours a day in VR," said Newell. "We actually think that if anything, most of the interesting stuff is going to be happening on the high end. That we're actually resolution-constrained, we're CPU-constrained, we're GPU-constrained. That's where the interesting stuff is gonna happen, not on the low end of the market. Once you've got it, once you've got something and you can say okay, this is the thing that causes millions of people to be excited about it, then you start worrying about cost-reducing."  "There's sort of an old joke that premature cost reduction is the root of all evil," he added. Building better VR hardware, informed by the needs of VR game makers Valve is also working to improve its VR hardware in conjunction with its VR game development efforts, a symbiotic arrangement that Newell likens to the way Nintendo handles game and hardware design. "One of the questions you might ask us, why in the world are we making hardware?" Newell said. "What we can do now is we can be designing hardware at the same time that we're designing software. This is something that Miyamoto has always had, right. He's had the ability to think about what input devices and the design of systems should be like, while he's trying to design games. And our sense is that that's going to allow us to actually build much better entertainment experiences for people." This has been the goal from the start, according to Newell. When it comes to the business of building VR hardware, Valve sees it as a valuable complement to its games and services businesses, rather than as an end in itself. "The idea isn't oh, we've suddenly thought we could make more money by building hardware," said Newell. "Hardware's actually traditionally been kind of a lousy, low-margin business. But in order to take what we think are interesting steps forward in terms of the kinds of experiences we design, we need the ability to be thinking more about everything the customer is doing." So how has that actually worked out, now that Valve has had Vive hardware on store shelves for nearly a year -- and been experimenting internally for far longer?  According to Newell, devs can see an example of how this process pays off by looking at the mockups of Valve's new VR controllers, which surfaced at Steam Dev Days last year and are far more akin to Oculus' Touch controllers than the wand controllers which come with the HTC Vive.  A (poor) snapshot of a prototype of Valve's new VR controller, which is meant to rest in the hand These new controllers "came from doing the first generation [of Vive controllers]; working on our games, people working on the games were like 'here's stuff we would actually use.' And then they'll mock it up, we'll do a hardware prototype, they'll go back and change the game. The process is iterative," said Newell. "And I think we have our own internal development process, and then we take it out to our development partners, other game developers, and say 'so this is what our thinking is.' So Robin Walker will sit down and say, 'this is why we think this is important for what we're developing. And this is how we express that in terms of the next generation of hardware design.' Then we ask other people, 'does that match what you're thinking, or not?' And we get feedback from that." This iterative process of making VR games, designing VR hardware around those projects, then taking it outside the company for feedback, seems to drum up a lot of excitement among Newell and his colleagues. It feels a bit like the way Oculus execs were talking about "hand presence" (via their Oculus Touch controllers, naturally) back in 2015 -- there's this sense of anticipation, like game makers will soon have a whole new, mature and multi-faceted method of input to explore, one distinct from gamepads, keyboards, and mice. "It feels like we've been stuck with mouse and keyboard for a really long time," Newell said. "And the opportunity to build much more interesting kinds of experiences for players were there; we just needed to sort of expand what we can do. But [for us] it's not about being in hardware. It's about building better games. About taking bigger leaps." Hoping VR is more like the DS than the Wii However, the folks at Valve are quick to point out that they may totally drop the ball -- that they are, in fact, trying to get comfortable with the notion that VR as a whole might still fail in spectacular fashion. Newell says he's optimistic about the future of VR, but admits he's been wrong before. "You can always be surprised, right. Like personally, I think the DS was kind of stupid, right? I was totally wrong. I thought Sony was going to crush Nintendo in that generation of handheld devices," said Newell. "I hadn't worked on it, I hadn't tried to design any games for it, and clearly the DS ended up being the winner. The flipside was, the first time I played Wii Sports -- just to continue using Nintendo as an example -- I was like oh my god, there's so much opportunity, there's so much potential here, that we're all going to go discover. And then it sort of turned out that Wii Sports pretty much nailed it. And that was it! Everything else just ended up....there was less sort of innovation, to mine, in that direction. So even when you're doing it, even when you have a really good instance where it seems like there's potential, you can still find out there isn't much there."   "Where we are today is way further down the road than we were a year ago, but it's just going to be this slow, kind of painful, fits and starts kind of thing." He went on to acknowledge that the VR market is still volatile, and it's yet unclear if/when it will see a significant expansion. We certainly saw the effects of that volatility last year, when some studios released VR games that became breakout successes -- Survios' Raw Data, Owlchemy Labs' Job Simulator, and Neat Corp.'s Budget Cuts spring to mind -- and many others released VR games that were "wildly unprofitable." "Yeah, the people who built VR, its sort of this trade-off," said Newell. "You say 'okay, how much risk am I taking on, and how much of an opportunity am I giving myself. How long is the runway gonna have to be before I really start to see explosive growth.' And each developer has to decide that." Going forward, Newell thinks most VR devs will continue to make VR games, the volatility of the market be damned. "I'm pretty sure there are almost no developers who are working on VR titles who are like saying 'Oh, I'm going to back off,'" he asserted. "They're all coming back and saying 'Oh, I'm gonna do more VR!'" However, he wants VR devs to appreciate and manage the risks that still plague the nascent VR game industry, and he reiterates that Valve is committed to working with developers to help them sort out funding concerns -- without any expectation of an exclusivity arrangement. "One conversation we have with some developers is around how they manage their risk, right. It's like you've got people building proprietary walled gardens who say be exclusive to us and we'll give you this bunch of money. And we're like, we hate exclusives. We think it's bad for everybody, certainly in the medium- to long-term, and I'd probably argue in the short-term as well," said Newell.  "But we're happy to say to people, look, you need to figure out how to manage your risk so you can develop the title you want to build. So let's have a conversation where we can help you manage your cashflow over the course of the development so you can go and build the thing you want. And get it out to market and start getting your money from where you should be, which is from your customers, rather than somebody else. We're perfectly willing to help people do that." "And then they say well, does that mean we have to be exclusive to Steam, or exclusive to the Vive, and we say oh hell no," he continued. "You guys should be making the best decisions for your customers, not having somebody else steer that. That's when we have conversations about that, it's usually around 'how do we pay the bills while we're building our next VR title.' And that's usually a pretty productive conversation. But it's really about smoothing out risk over the lifetime of VR investments." As we approach the one-year anniversary of the HTC Vive's debut, it's clear that Valve continues to view VR as less of a new platform (like, say, Steam Machines) and more of a new way of computing -- one that it's still intent on pushing forward.  The company is making a show of doubling down on VR game development, iterating on its VR hardware (devs should also expect an improved version of its Lighthouse tracking technology in the near future), and assuaging devs' fears about surviving and thriving in the fledgling VR market. "There's that little bit of tension between some people going out and saying oh there'll be millions of these, and we're like, wow....I don't think so," said Newell.  "Because I can't point to a single piece of content that would cause millions of people to justify changing their home computing at all. It's like a great thing for enthusiasts and hardcore people, and where we are today is way further down the road than we were a year ago, but it's just going to be this slow, kind of painful, fits and starts kind of thing."

Stock Jumped 13% Last Month What happened Shares of Mobileye N.V. (NYSE: MBLY) were surging last month, gaining 13% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . Image source: Mobileye. The self-driving car specialist benefited from a deal with BMW and Intel  in the beginning of the month and later jumped on an analyst upgrade. MBLY data by YCharts . So what Mobileye stock jumped out of the gate to start the new year, gaining 8% on Jan. 3 after announcing the deal with BMW and Intel. The three partners said they would put a fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles on the road by the second half of the year, and Mobileye is also planning with the car maker and tech company to bring autonomous vehicles to market by 2021. On the same day, the Israeli company announced a strategic partnership with NIO, an electric vehicle start-up. Later in the month, the stock continued to move higher as it got endorsements from several research firms and banks including Goldman Sachs , which lifted its rating on Mobileye to buy and gave it a $50 price target, saying the company was well positioned for upcoming opportunities in the autonomous driving space. Now what There’s no shortage of enthusiasm for autonomous vehicles on Wall Street. The consensus among tech companies, automakers, and others seems to be that at least partially autonomous vehicles will become commonplace within five to 10 years. However, for investors, Mobileye is one of the few pure-play stocks available. Shares of rival NVIDIA nearly tripled last year on growing possibilities in the industry. Mobileye’s partnerships across the spectrum of automakers seem encouraging, and the company is solidly profitable. No one knows for sure where autonomous vehicles are going, but Mobileye looks like a solid bet for investors itching for a piece of a potentially huge industry. 10 stocks we like better than Mobileye When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This will be the fourth consecutive year that Intel's main processor line will use 14nm technology. Intel are slowly progressing towards products built at 10nm, but it seems 10nm will not hit high-performance consumer parts first like in previous generations. Instead, Intel are focusing on data center parts "first for next process node", along with ultra-low-power consumer chips. While this news will disappoint PC hardware enthusiasts, the data center is a massive market and money-spinner for Intel, so it makes sense to focus their efforts there. According to Ashraf Eassa, who attended the Investor Day, Intel's VP and GM of Client and IoT, Dr. Venkata Renduchintala, said that process technology will be "fluid" based on the product segment. As such, it seems as though Intel's 8th-generation processor line will contain a mixture of architectures and nodes. It is currently believed the 8th-gen Core line will feature both Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake processors. Intel will use Cannon Lake, their 10nm die shrink of Kaby Lake, for ultra-low-power Y-series processors (Core M). Coffee Lake, the fourth line of 14nm processors with further process and architecture optimizations, will form the rest of the 8th-gen Core line-up from U-series ultraportable parts to S-series desktop parts. Intel expects 8th-generation processors to be upwards of 15 percent faster than Kaby Lake in some situations. Intel's 8th-generation line-up may end up being quite confusing, especially if a Kaby Lake U-series refresh is also included in the mix. Expect to hear more about Intel's plans closer to launch in the second half of 2017.

If the figures are accurate - and most sites believe them to be – it looks as if affordability will be one of the processors’ best features. Online store www.shopblt.com has leaked the prices of three Ryzen 7 Series SKUs - the Ryzen 7 1800X, Ryzen 7 1700X, and Ryzen 7 1700. All models come with 8 cores and 16 threads - the same as Intel’s $1049 Core i7-6900K. The Ryzen 7 1700, which has a TDP of 65 watts and boost clock speed of 3.7Ghz, costs just $317 - around 70 percent cheaper than Intel’s chip, which has the same clock speed and a TDP of 140W. The 3.4Ghz Base/3.8Ghz Boost Ryzen 7 1700X, meanwhile, has a TDP of 95 watts and costs $382. AMD’s flagship 3.6Ghz/4.0Ghz 1800X flagship chip costs $490. Shopblt has accurately listed the price of almost every AMD CPU before they were released, including the Athlon X4 845 and the Kaveri A10 7850K and A10 7700K, so these Ryzen prices are likely to be legit. Ryzen’s 5-series and 3-series CPUs will no doubt offer similar value for money and could make a dent Intel’s market dominance. In other Ryzen news, AMD has confirmed that its upcoming CPUs won’t be supported for Windows 7. Recent reports suggested that there would be Windows 7 drivers for Ryzen, but while AMD did test the processors on the older OS, there won’t be any support for what is still the most popular version of Windows. “To achieve the highest confidence in the performance of our AMD Ryzen desktop processors (formerly code-named ‘Summit Ridge’), AMD validated them across two different OS generations, Windows 7 and 10,” AMD told PCWorld. “However, only support and drivers for Windows 10 will be provided in AMD Ryzen desktop processor production parts.” Last year, Microsoft confirmed that Intel’s Kaby Lake would only be supported under Windows 10. Additionally, EE Times’ Rick Merritt reported that Ryzen CPUs would occupy less space and offer twice the amount of cache of Skylake chips. Even though both CPUs are build on a 14nm process, AMD's processors are about 10 percent smaller than Intel's and feature twice the L2 cache.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel’s 48-thread, 24-core Xeon superchip… Intel’s 48-thread, 24-core Xeon superchip will cost nearly $9,000 By Mark Coppock — February 9, 2017 3:38 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you If you're looking for the utmost in processing power for your server, then Intel has you covered with its new 24-core monster. There is plenty of debate over whether AMD’s Ryzen release represents a real challenge for Intel’s CPU business. Recently leaked information implies that AMD is so confident about Ryzen’s performance that it may not be relying solely on lower prices to combat Intel. That doesn’t mean that Intel doesn’t have any market segments where it can be fully confident of remaining the performance leader. Its Xeon line remains the stuff of servers and other high-performance applications today and Intel fully intends on maintaining its superiority with the new Xeon E7-8894 v4, according to The Tech Report. More: MSI posted the specs of eight upcoming Xeon E3-1200 v6 Series CPUs from Intel On Thursday, the Xeon E7-8890 v3 is Intel’s high-end option, running on the Haswell architecture and offering 18 cores and 32 threads with Hyper-Threading and a thermal design power (TDP rating of 165W). Now, Intel announced the E7-8894 v4, which manages to pack in 24 cores — running 48 threads given its Hyper-Threading support — at 2.4GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz, all of it staying within the same 165W TDP as the previous generation. Intel pegs the increase at “3.69 times faster” than the Westmere Xeon E7 8870 and, compared more directly against the E7-8890 v3, performance increases of 25 to 50 percent can be expected. Regardless, the E7-8894 v4 will be a monster when plugged into servers supporting up to eight sockets and 24TB of RAM per node. Of course, Intel’s new performance leader will be a price leader as well, coming in at a hefty $8,898. A fully stocked server with eight CPUs installed and plugging away crunching some serious numbers will, therefore, run more than $71,000 before any other system costs are considered. Intel likely justifies that pricing level given support for all of the usual Xeon goodies such as NetBurst microarchitecture, along with the fact that anyone who needs this kind of performance will be willing to pay for it. For those people, the new chips are expected to be available for purchase in the first quarter of 2017.

While we did not see a lot of extra performance on the IPC level when compared to Sky Lake, the additional core clock speed boosts when using the Kaby Lake Core i7 7700K clearly show an advantage. For the 200 Series launch, MSI has a plethora of motherboards that support Intel's 7th Generation Core series processor spread across a quartet of segments. First up, you have the Gaming Series that are targeted squarely at the enthusiast gaming segment. Here you would find any of the Gaming or Titanium branded motherboards. The Performance gaming segment is where you would find the Gaming Pro, Krait, and Carbon series boards. The Arsenal gaming segment has Military-themed board with names like Tomahawk, Mortar, and Bazooka. These boards feature beefed up heat sink packages, Military Class 5 components, and a wealth of Gaming-centric features. Last up is the Pro Series that the board I am looking at today belongs to. MSI's Z270 SLI PLUS is a board designed for max performance without all the flash you see on the Gaming series. Sporting features such as Twin Turbo M.2 slots, Click BIOS 5, Military Class 5 components, Steel Armor on the PCIe and DDR4 slots, VR Boost, Audio Boost 4, and so much more. Priced at $149 out the door, MSI's Z270 SLI PLUS offers up performance with an expansive feature set. Let's dig into what MSI has cooked up for its 200 Series products. MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: Whereas the Gaming Series screams out from the shelves with bright red coloring, the Pro Series is more subdued in the approach using a silver and black theme to get its point across. The front panel shows the product name, compatibility with Intel's 7th Gen Core series processors, and a few of the hardware technologies utilized on the board, such as an Intel network solution, Turbo M.2, and Lightning USB. The back side of the box walks you a bit deeper into the feature set with mentions of the Audio Boost 4, DDR4 Boost, and Multi-GPU technologies, along with MSI's own Military Class 5 components. Inside the box, you see pretty standard fare with the board in an anti-static bag and the accessory bundle in the lower section of the container. The accessory bundle consists of an I/O panel, manual, quick start guide, driver and software disc, and a pair of SATA 6Gbps data cables. Slim, but it's enough to get you going.       Pulled out of the packages, the MSI Z270 SLI PLUS, visually, mirrors the theme of the packaging, with a deep black PCB with silver accents. Built for use with an Intel 7th Generation Core series processor and based on the Intel Z270 PCH, it brings a bunch of new feature sets to the table. Visually, the layout is what we have come to expect from "mainstream" level ATX form factor motherboards. As such, the main components, such as the PCH, LGA socket, DIMM slots, and expansion slots, are all in roughly the same locations. Nothing wrong with it, because the layout just works. On the back side of the PCB, there is not much of note, but on the right side of the PCB you can see the Mystic LED lit border that isolates the Audio Boost components from the rest of the circuitry on the PCB. This lets the Audio Boost 4 sound solution act as if it was indeed a discrete audio solution. Strategically placed LED's light up to present a halo effect around the PCB.     The I/O panel on MSI's Z270 SLI PLUS is covered with a decorative shroud that really cleans up the area when the board is mounted in a chassis. From the left you have a pair of USB 2.0 ports managed by the Z270 chipset, a dual purpose PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, a single DVI-D port supporting a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1200, a pair of ASMedia ASM 2142 managed USB 3.1 ports (one Type A and one Type C), and an HDMI port that supports resolutions up to 4K @ 24Hz. Surrounding the HDMI port are four USB 3.1 ports managed by the Z270 PCH. Two of those are designed to be used with the VR Boost software to optimize the interface for use with VR components. An Intel I219-V managed Gigabit LAN port features MSI's LAN protect solution to prevent current spikes of up to 15KV from damaging the system. Gold plated connections are used on the rear analog audio ports for MSI's Audio Boost 4 High Definition 7.1 sound solution. Expansion comes in the form of three 16x PCIe 3.0 slots that run at 16x/0x/4x or 8x/8x/4x, along with three PCIe 3.0 1x slots. The upper two slots feature MSI's Steel Armor to keep the slot from bending under the weight of larger video cards while also preventing EMI intrusion. Using this configuration, multi-GPU strategies from both AMD (3-Way) and NVIDIA (2-Way) are supported. Between the ports are the Turbo M.2 headers that can be occupied by a pair of 2242 / 2260 / 2280 / 22110 form factor NVMe drives and Optane memory. This allows access speeds of up to 32Gb/s per drive. Both of these M.2 ports are covered in MSI's Steel armor for protection. In front of the expansion slots is the bulk of the shielded Realtek ALC 1220 High Definition audio solution. MSI is using a new design that is much like what we see on the ASUS ROG offerings, using an isolated set of circuits with separate layers for the left and right audio channels. Marking the border of the PCB and audio circuitry is an RGB LED border that works with MSI's Mystic Lighting software. The 120dB SNR / 32-bit rated EMI-shielded ALC 1220 High Definition audio processor comes with a built-in DAC. A headphone impedance sensing amplifier that sets the optimal impedance for your headphones (up to 600 ohm) is used for front panel audio. MSI chose Chemicon Audio capacitors due to their solid reputation for use in quality audio solutions.     Along the bottom of the board is a majority of the board connectivity. From the left is the front panel audio header, one of the six PWM controllable fan headers, and a header for use with RGB LED strips that can be controlled with MSI's Mystic lighting software. Next up is a serial header and parallel connection header, TPM header, a pair of USB 2.0 headers, and the front panel connection point.     Up the right side of the board is another of the six controllable 4-pin fan headers and the bulk of the SATA connectivity. There are a total of six SATA 6Gbps slots on this board that support Intel's Smart Response Technologies, RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 10. Four of the ports point towrd the side of the PCB, while two face upwards. A change from what I normally see on boards. Next to the SATA ports are a pair of USB 3.1 headers. One upright and the other laid down to fit under a performance discrete GPU. The 24-pin ATX power connection is in a standard location with another pair of 4-pin fan connectors. The uppermost connection is for use with the water pump in any of the current AIO liquid cooling setups on the market. These fan headers can be controlled in both standard DC mode or PWM mode in both the BIOS and in MSI's Command Center application. Between the ATX power connection and the lower fan header are the EZ Debug LED's that visualize boot issues with the DRAM, VGA, CPU, or boot drive, so you know where to start your trouble shooting if there are issues. Up to 64 GB of DDR4 memory at speeds of 3800MHz is officially supported using four DIMMs. Around each DIMM slot is MSI's Steel Armor that minimizes electrical interference at the slot. By using an optimized and isolated trace layout in the PCB, DDR4 Boost ensures memory compatibility and performance are not concerns. Across the top of the PCB there is not much to discuss, but the 8-pin CPU power connection and the top half of the digital power circuit cooling.       Cooling the Military Class V digital voltage circuitry are a pair of aluminum heat sinks that follow the silver and black theme of the board. The Z270 PCH is covered with a large, low profile heat sink that easily fits under any of the large video cards on the market, including MSI's own Gaming X offerings. MSI is using a combination of Dark Chokes, Titanium chokes that run up to 30% more efficiently, and lower ESR Dark Caps as part of its Military class strategy to improve longevity of the system and components. Even with the Dark Chokes and Dark Caps encroaching on the CPU socket, these components do not interfere with any of the heat sink combinations used in my testing.     The hardware is only part of the equation when you look at the entire package that makes up the MSI Z270 SLI PLUS. The software component, BIOS, and actual performance add to this equation so that you get a full picture of what MSI has to offer. --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Introduction & Closer Look2 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: Included Software3 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: The Bios4 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Specifications & Features5 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Setup & Overclocking6 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: PCMark 8, SiSoft Sandra, Cinebench R15, HWBot X.265 Benchmark7 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: AIDA 64, CrystalDiskMark, ATTO, iPerf, RMAA8 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Gaming9 » MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Introduction & Closer Look MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: Included Software MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Closer Look: The Bios MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Specifications & Features MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Setup & Overclocking MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: PCMark 8, SiSoft Sandra, Cinebench R15, HWBot X.265 Benchmark MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: AIDA 64, CrystalDiskMark, ATTO, iPerf, RMAA MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Testing: Gaming MSI Z270 SLI PLUS: Conclusion Related Products MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review Recent Articles MSI Z270 SLI PLUS Review NEST Protect and NEST Learning Thermostat Review OCC's Top 3 Video Cards of 2016 Watch_Dogs 2 Performance Analysis GTX 1070 Overclocking Guide Watch_Dogs 2 Review Intel 7th Generation Core i7 7700K Processor Review Shadow Warrior 2 Performance Analysis OCC's Top 3 Cases of 2016 Shadow Warrior 2 Review » all reviews Forum Posts Hackintosh G5 at long last Switching to NVIDIA Top Priority for Nintendo Switch Do i really need to upgrade my gpu?

Maybe it was purchased when John Howard was prime minister, or you ruined it was a spilled drink, or maybe you just have some money to burn and you'd like to blow it on Intel's new Kaby Lake microarchitecture. Whatever the reason, you're ready to upgrade your computer, and you're going to be left with a big choice. Do you spend the extra cash for the categorically faster i7 processor, or do you pinch a few pennies and go with the i5? Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo After running both processors (the 4.5GHz i7-7700K and the 4.2GHz i5-7600K) through the ringer in a computer that was otherwise the exact same, we can say, without a doubt, that you should save your money. For most people the i7 just isn't worth it. Intel's New Kaby Lake Processors: What You Need To Know Read more Intel introduced the i7 and i5 brands back in 2007 as a way of guiding customers. The i5 was for "mainstream" use and the i7 was for "high-end" and business use. Spend a little extra money and the i7 should do everything faster and better. The key to the i7's speed is not in its higher clock speed (the gigahertz number), but its ability to employ hyper-threading more efficiently. In the early days of personal computing, if you wanted to speed up your computer you'd add an additional CPU. Modern Intel processors have multiple cores — which your computer sees as additional CPUs. Hyper-threading takes advantage of those cores, allowing them to doing big fancy computations in parallel instead of systemically. The i7 processor is designed to be so good at hyper-threading that it can do twice as many processes in parallel as the i5. The catch is that this whizzbang tech only really comes into play when the CPU is extremely taxed. You're not gonna max out the guts perusing Trump tweets, but you might in processing enormous sets of complex data, and that only really happens if you're in a few very specific fields of work, like 3D design, engineering or filmmaking. The Professional Work In a professional setting, the i7 creamed the i5. (Lower is better.) If you ever want to see how fast the processor in your computer is you should try to get it to "render" a file. Converting big files, like a 3D project or an enormous video file, instantly taxes a computer — to the point that some professional have computers whose only job is to render media. The i7, with it's hyper-threading ability, is an absolute champ at rendering data, especially compared to the cheaper i5. When we rendered a 3D object in Blender the i7 accomplished the feat a full four minutes and 39 seconds faster than the i5, and when we converted a giant 4K movie file in Handbrake the i7 finished the job four minutes and five seconds faster than the i5. With that kind of speed the i7 is an absolute necessity for "pros". The Regular Work In synthetic benchmarks meant to simulate average work days, the i5 and i7 were incredibly close. (Higher is better.) But there are a lot of pros in the world that aren't rendering gigabytes of data every day. We're browsing the internet, cranking out spreadsheets and maybe doing some quick photo editing. And in everyday pursuits the i7 is only marginally faster than the i5. WebXPRT is a fantastic online benchmark that mimics everyday web browsing. It renders objects online, crunches data in spreadsheets, alter images and loads web pages. The i7 scored 564 on the benchmark, but the i5's 553 score was completely within the margin of error, which means the two processors handle web browsing, and basic computer tasks, virtually identically. The i7 and i5 do similar in Gizmodo's Photoshop test as well. They also resize RAW images and convert them to JPEG at nearly the same pace. We converted 20 large RAW files and the i7 was only three seconds faster. That's hardly worth the premium an i7 processor commands. The Games And after benchmarking a couple of games it's clear the i7 isn't worth it for most gamers either. With the i7's higher clock speed and its clearly superior rendering abilities it would seem like an i7 would be better for gaming than an i5. Yet it isn't the case, especially if you're comparing the processors in a machine with a discrete graphics card (which any gamer would have). When the i7 isn't having to render all the 3D objects of the game itself, instead offloading it to the GPU, then its superiority diminishes substantially. In the Civilization VI graphics benchmark, which records the time between frames and averages it, the two processors were just 1.4 milliseconds apart. Same in the Civilization VI AI benchmark, which scores how quickly a processor computes tasks set by the game's artificial intelligence. In the Rise of the Tomb Raider benchmark the i5 averaged 18.43 frames per second and the i7 averaged 18.33 fps. That puts the two just one tenth of a frame apart. These are the kind of differences that are imperceptible to the human eye. The kind of a difference that means the i7 is absolutely, positively, not worth it for gamers. In the end, while the i7 is fast, and an absolute necessity for film editors, engineers, architects and 3D designers, it's just not worth it for the rest of us. If you just plan on gaming or browsing the web, or doing a little photo editing, then save you money and get the i5 instead. It's more than enough speed for your needs. Comments beacham @beacham Feb 10, 2017, 5:43pm Hey Alex, I just wanted to point out that deciding between an i5 and an i7 chip for gaming is a little more nuanced than you’ve written. A particularly CPU dependant game can cause a bottleneck for your GPU if you are running with an i5 instead of an i7. Similarly if you’re planning on streaming (via Twitch, YouTube, etc.), you’ll want an i7 processor. (unless of course you have a dedicated streaming machine, but if you’re that far into streaming you know what equipment you need). Then there’s cooling. Kaby Lake i7s purportedly run hotter than normal, so you might want a beefier cooling solution if you’re going with one. Basically some games are more dependant on the CPU than others, so a little research goes a long way when it comes to deciding which one to go with. There is some wisdom in going with an i5 and spending the additional money elsewhere in the machine, but my personal opinion is that if you’re spending upwards of $2,000 on a machine, don’t skimp on your CPU. Reply 0 stan101 @stan101 Feb 10, 2017, 6:34pm I use 2 and 3d CAD and engineering programs and rarely have I used top of the range CPUs. Only with the largest 3d renderings do I ever consider needing a better cpu. My 10.6 inch travel laptop with Core I3 3217u can run AutoCAD2016 with multi unit 2d architectural and engineering construction plans without a hitch Along with a massive array of AutoCAD Lisps I run to speed up the processes. Dedicated structural engineering packages run fine on the little travel laptop. The trick is to have no startup applications running and no rubbish allways monitoring Antivirus in the background.. Turning off a few unused Windows 10 services also helps. Streaming is actually handled suprisingly well and all on 4GB of dual channel ram. The 4GB of ram is the bottlenext on running Photoshop CC. Lightroom 6 is handls suprisingly well with RAWs. My time is money so if I thought the need for a newer CPU on my travel laptop would be an improvement, I wouldn't hesitate. The truth is, that I haven't bothered. A very fast SSD is by far a more important component than faster / newer CPUs in the last generation for the majority of actual tasks. Reply 1 pawel04 @pawel04 Feb 10, 2017, 6:02pm Still blissfully sitting on my i5 2500k clocked at 4.5Ghz from all those years ago.. But yes, i'm slowly coming to that point where i will need to do a new built as all my parts are 4-5 gens old however i'd also mention here to those looking at buying new CPU'S to wait a month or two too see how AMD'S RYZEN performs. Reply 1 data-cain @data-cain Feb 10, 2017, 11:43pm +1 for the 2500k :D I only overclocked it (to 4.6) a few months ago when I picked up a 1070. Now, nearly every game I've tried runs at a constant 60+ fps (vsync) @ 2560x1440 with maximum settings. Reply 0 LordBluray Guest Feb 11, 2017, 4:03am Or at least wait until AMD's RYZEN arrives and pushs the price of intel chips down. Running a i7 4770k 16gb ddr3 Gtx 1060 (was a gtx 780ti but that bit the dust). Planing to upgrade for m.2 drives and rgb. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Feb 11, 2017, 1:45pm Good point about the AMD CPUs, it's been awhile since they've been truly great but the new Ryzen ones sound very promising. I'm starting to have hardware problems (motherboard is getting flaky) and I'm holding off until the Ryzen CPUs have proper reviews. I'd also suggest, that people really need to evaluate their requirements before trying to buy (if they're not tech savvy ask someone who is). The i3 CPUs are a pretty good alternative too. At least if you're just doing simple web browsing and a bit of office work (word/Excel) and you save quite a lot of money. Even using the CPUs built in video is fine as long as you're not trying to play anything more strenuous than solitaire. They may not be as good as an i5 or i7 (or Ryzen) but on a budget they're a real winner. Couple them with a decent mid range video card and you get a surprisingly decent gaming PC for 1080p or lower res. Reply 0 trishool @trishool Feb 10, 2017, 6:23pm The failure of the advise in this article that I see is that you also need to consider your future needs (ie how you think you'll be using it in the near future - want to stream 4k video from YouTube or other services? Then you might need an i7). You'll also need to consider how much you'll multi task on a computer as well which can also become write taxing. If there's only a $100 price difference I'd go the i7. Reply 0 zak @zak Feb 10, 2017, 6:39pm You're not gonna max out the guts perusing Trump tweetsBut you might max out your own guts. It may even be preferable to further perusal. p.s. your graphs are missing an axis label. Reply 1 hammer3339 @hammer3339 Feb 10, 2017, 7:38pm This is not even touching on you being able to get an AMD Ryzen CPU that is looking like a much better option at this point although the critical reviews have yet to hit the market. I say this as a person who generally only buys what they consider to be the best at the time of upgrading, for the last 6 years that's been Intel chips but, this year it's looking like AMD will take the mantle of best product so hold off until March before spending more money on a Kabylake CPU. Reply 0 2-short-planks Guest Feb 10, 2017, 8:19pm Well, I do run a lot of renders, so I'll be sticking with the i7s - I currently split the render load between two i7 systems, and it still takes a very long time. Reply 0 tatts @tatts Feb 10, 2017, 8:29pm Digital Foundry did a good vid on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XylVCItVhS4 Boils down to: There is a significant performance gain by taking the i7 over the i5 but, you're unlikely to ever see it unless every single thing is top of the line. If you're not getting a titan and 3000+mhz DDR4 RAM, your bottlenecks will be on the GPU or Memory. Though they did add that's okay, and some people prefer that. I'd prefer it. Good to future proof at least a bit. Last edited February 10, 2017 8:30 pm Reply 0 digitalpho3nix @digitalpho3nix Feb 10, 2017, 9:29pm OR... You could do the intelligent thing and not buy anything for a few weeks and wait for AMD Ryzen to drop at the start of March. If the early pricing leaks are to be believed, you will be very well served waiting for intel to drop their prices to compete with their rumoured '6900k performance for half the price'. THEN make a decision Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 7:43am What are you talking about? Ryzen is an octacore design, it's targeted at a niche market. Even DX12/Vulkan benchmarks don't properly utilise octacore designs with a single exception - Ashes of the Singularity. Clock speed is still king, and the ideal spot for cores is roughly halfway between 4C/8T and 6C. Ryzen may be appealing to people with intensive multithreading requirements but it's not a cost effective move for gaming. Aside from the fact it's more expensive than the competing 7700K, the Ryzen CPUs require a new motherboard thanks to the AM4 socket, plus either a new cooler or an adapter bracket because AM4 isn't compatible with previous socket coolers. Reply 0 digitalpho3nix @digitalpho3nix Feb 11, 2017, 10:02am Please re-read my comment; I was referring to the impending release of Ryzen putting severe pressure on Intel's prices. Reply 1 gravitas @gravitas Feb 11, 2017, 11:00am Out of interest, is the ideal spot for cores software based or due to physical or mathematical limits? Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 12:35pm Software-based. Though there are limits to how many threads you can break tasks into, and more threads means more handshaking and overhead required. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Feb 11, 2017, 1:53pm To be fair if you're buying a new CPU because your last one was bought "when John Howard was prime minister" you're going to be needing a new motherboard and cooler anyway. In fact unless you're upgrading from something only a couple years old you're probably going to be throwing away your mobo, ram and cooler. And there's not really going to be a noticeable performance difference if you're upgrading something 2 years old or less - so you'd be better saving your money for the next-next gen. Oh, and AMD have said they're shipping the Ryzen with it's own cooler (which is apparently decent). As for prices and price/performance, I'm reserving judgment until they're out and properly reviewing production models. Heck even if they're not quite as fast there's a good chance they'll drive intel prices down once there's more competition. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 4:18pm I suspect most people looking to pick up a $400+ CPU are enthusiasts that probably have hardware from the last 2 years already, but you're right that older boards might be a consideration. Still, I wouldn't. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Feb 10, 2017, 10:28pm Intel must have made some changes. Back in the day they used to claim a 15-30% gain from HT Graphics and rendering usually seem to have low effect from HT as a lot of work is now GPU based amd as for games clock rate is usually king as there is a limit to how many threads an application can simultaneously run. Hyper threading comes into its own for multitasking, running a bench mark for one application at a time won't give you a true picture of what it's capable of. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Feb 11, 2017, 7:49am Hyperthreading becomes more valuable in the current generation onwards thanks to DX12 and Vulkan making better use of multicore CPUs. I noted in a comment above but it has its limits, and the plateau seems to be half way between 4C/8T and 6C. 8C and 8C/8T gained nothing over 6C and in some cases lost performance. Reply 0 galtaforce @galtaforce Feb 11, 2017, 10:35am Didn't you get taught in maths class to always label and put scales on your axes? Reply 0 James @jamesh Feb 11, 2017, 4:11pm It's hard to get any useful information out of this article. Knowing that a benchmark completed 4 minutes sooner with one chip isn't particularly helpful if you don't know what the total time is. Is the improvement simply in line with the clock speed increase, or if the benchmark is actually benefiting from hyperthreading? Or is the improvement lower than expected, giving diminishing returns due to a bottleneck somewhere else in the system? Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log in Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Intel's priciest chip has 24 cores and sells for $9k Intel's Xeon E7-8894 v4 is a monster server chip with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 10 February, 2017 13:45 0 - - - - print email No Intel chip is as expensive as the new Xeon E7-8894 v4 server processor. The US$8,898 Xeon chip has massive horsepower with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz. Intel said this is the company's fastest server chip, breaking enterprise application speed records. The company's next expensive chip after the E7-8894 v4 is its other 24-core processor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4, which is priced at $7,174. The chips have similar features except for the base clock speed. The new chip starts at 2.4GHz compared to 2.2GHz for the less expensive chip. The $8,898 chip even outprices Intel's fastest supercomputing chip, the Xeon Phi 7290F, which is priced at $6,401. It is also over four times more expensive than the costliest PC chip, the $1,723 Core i7-6950X for gaming desktops. Some price competition could come from AMD, which is reentering the server market with Zen-based chips in the second quarter. Its initial server chips code-named Naples have up to 32 cores. AMD has not revealed the target market for Naples, but it could be cloud providers. During an earnings call, AMD indicated Naples chips would be competitively priced, and downplayed its margins expectations. AMD is projecting Zen chips to be high performance, but the company is looking for volume shipments and may not participate in the low-volume market of servers with more than eight sockets. The Xeon E7-8894 v4, which is based on the Broadwell architecture, is priced high for many reasons. It is targeted at fault tolerant servers used by financial or retail companies which need highly reliable systems for transactions and fraud detection. These companies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if a server crashed. The new chip also has features not found in regular PC or server chips, like error correction and RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability), which can diagnose and troubleshoot issues without crashing servers. The chips also have high levels of I/O and networking integration. Right now server buyers don't have bargaining power with Intel, which has more than a 90 percent market share in server chips. Intel charges a hefty premium for the performance and adjacent technologies it bundles, including server and networking gear. The E7 v4 chips aren't high in volume shipments, and are made in smaller batches. But these are highly profitable chips and fuel revenue for Intel, which is now relying more on data center equipment than PCs for growth in the future. Server chips already have a high markup, but average prices have been going up in recent years and will continue to rise, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel, during a speech at a investor day meeting in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday. Prices have been going up due to new applications like machine learning and analytics and the growth of business cloud services, Bryant said. "Because they see value in our high-end products, they are buying up the stack," Bryant said. But server purchases have stalled after years of growth, and Bryant projected a 5 percent decline in server CPU shipments going into 2021. The company isn't expecting to grow from server CPU shipments, but from adjacent product shipments to telecom and cloud providers. Competition from AMD has been worked into the server chip price and shipment projections, Bryant said. Intel plans more potentially powerful and expensive chips this year. The company will ship a deep learning chip called Knights Mill and a separate chip called Lake Crest that will integrate Xeon with a deep-learning chip based on technology acquired from Nervana Systems.

Intel: Cannonlake will be more than 15 percent faster than Kaby Lake Intel's upcoming Cannonlake chips will deliver a performance improvement as the company looks to gaming and VR Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 10 February, 2017 05:52 0 - - - - print email Upgrading CPU performance hasn't been a priority for Intel in many years, but that could be changing. Intel's upcoming Cannonlake chips will deliver a performance improvement of more than 15 percent compared to its Kaby Lake chips, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Intel didn't provide exact numbers at the company's annual investor day Thursday, but the projection is based on the SysMark benchmark. Detailed performance improvement numbers will emerge over time. The performance improvements from Skylake to Kaby Lake topped out at 15 percent. The CPU performance boost for Cannonlake should be at least that, Intel said. The first Cannonlake chips are scheduled to ship in the second half of this year. The chips -- called 8th-generation chips on an Intel slide -- could include Core i7 chips. Intel showed a Cannonlake chip at CES. The chip will be the first made on Intel's 10-nanometer process, which will deliver a substantial reduction in power consumption, Renduchintala said. Intel may be trying to catch up with AMD, which is boasting a 40 percent performance improvement for its upcoming Ryzen chips. Ryzen's numbers are based on IPC (instructions per cycle), an important performance metric. The benefit of high-performance PC chips isn't lost on Intel. The gaming market is exploding, especially eSports, and demand for high-performance Core i7 chips skyrocketed last year, Renduchintala said. As markets like virtual reality heat up, buyers will be motivated to upgrade to Core i7 chips from Core i3 chips. The Core i7 chips today are up to 36 percent faster than Core i3 chips, Renduchintala said. Chipmakers in past years focused on increasing performance by raising the clock frequency. But that made chips power hungry, and their focus shifted to adding cores, which boosted performance but also added battery life to laptops. Then the focus turned to integrating technologies like graphics and I/O buses inside processors. Gaming and virtual reality have brought a focus back to raw CPU performance. There's a limited scope for growth in the PC market, with gaming and VR being the bright spots, and both right now require high-performance CPUs. Unlike in the past, Intel doesn't want to sell low-margin chips that would ultimately incur a loss. Intel was "disciplined" with its PC business, and the focus was on high-margin products like Core i7 chips. Intel's highest priced PC chip is the Core i7-6950X, which is priced at US$1,723, and it generates a high profit margin for Intel. But Intel will have to contend with AMD, which is coming on strong with Ryzen. Analysts say Ryzen will start off strong in high-end gaming PCs based on the early hype, but then its success will depend on word-of-mouth recommendations. Ryzen's subsequent success in consumer laptops and desktops will depend on PC makers adopting the chip.

It's one thing to automate a house, but connecting lights within a community can have an array of effects, from monitoring air pollution to possibly lowering crime rates. by Theresa Meek · Feb. 10, 17 · IoT Zone Like (2) Comment (0) Save Tweet {{ articles[0].views | formatCount}} Views Edit Delete {{ articles[0].isLocked ?

Join For Free Traffic jams. Parking problems. Pollution. Crime. Cities face lots of tough problems. Although mayors and city managers are well aware of the issues, they often lack the resources to create effective solutions. And it’s not just a budget problem. The information that administrators use to make decisions is often incomplete and scattered across departments. Consequently, they can’t see the big picture. Nor can they measure the results of their efforts. But new solutions are emerging from the unlikeliest of sources — the humble streetlight. From Streetlight to Smart Light If you put sensors on a streetlight, it morphs into an “intelligent light” with capabilities Edison never dreamed of. Intelligent lights help cities gather information that officials can use to deploy services efficiently, save money, and run cleaner and greener overall. Current, a smart energy startup within GE, is using intelligent lights to illuminate a new way forward. By combining GE’s data analytics know-how with Intel’s secure computing expertise, Current’s streetlights reveal the state of city services and show how they can be improved. “We’re going to transform the streetlight from a pole that sits 30 feet up in the air to a sensor beacon,” said Austin Ashe, global product manager of intelligent cities at Current. The lights contain built-in sensors including cameras, thermometers, and humidity gauges, as well as a powerful Intel processor. Information gathered from the lights is sent to Predix, a GE cloud-based platform that instantly crunches data and sends the city actionable results in real time. Extending Capabilities San Diego is one of the first cities to take advantage of Current’s technology. Like most urban areas, the city suffers from traffic jams and parking problems. By using sensor-embedded LED streetlights to improve parking enforcement, the city reduced traffic by up to 30 percent and saved more than $350,000 annually in energy and maintenance costs. San Diego and other pilot cities are just the start. In the future, data from streetlight sensors could automate and connect city systems in new ways, solving once-stubborn problems with little human intervention. “The city will be able to sense itself through our technology,” said Justin Christiansen, global accounts manager at Intel. Because streetlights are ubiquitous, intelligent lights can create a dense sensor network that allows data to be collected and used to benefit residents in ways that were never possible before. For example, information from intelligent lights could reroute ambulances to get to emergencies faster, possibly saving lives, Christiansen said. Sensors might also reveal problems city managers don’t know about, such as dangerous street corners where accidents have yet to occur, but where sensors show cars barely avoiding collisions. Alerted to the problem, city engineers might make changes to prevent accidents. And, not only can these lights collect information, they can also broadcast it. Equipped with speaker systems, they’re able to sound alerts before a hurricane or an earthquake. Streetlights Can Even Help Fight Crime Current is working with ShotSpotter to create streetlights that can detect the sound of gunfire and send the location of the incident to police stations, dispatch centers and officers’ smartphones. Cameras in the streetlights can take photos automatically when a shot is detected, helping police identify suspects. Although ShotSpotter has been around for years, putting the technology into streetlights instead of single-purpose sensors enables cities to expand its presence at minimal cost. A Peek Inside the Lights Pumping data to the cloud can be expensive, particularly for bandwidth-hungry applications such as video. To get around this problem, the streetlight itself can do initial processing of sensor information. This activity is known as edge processing because it occurs on the fringes of the network. The importance of edge processing was one factor that led GE to partner with Intel. The company’s processors have the performance to handle tough edge processing applications such as computer vision. The robust performance also helps future-proof the platform — meaning cities won’t have to replace their streetlights when their needs grow. GE also worked closely with Intel to ensure cities can perform software updates and other maintenance remotely — even across hundreds of thousands of streetlights. Unleashing Creativity GE’s lighting is engineered to be highly secure, with information protected from the edge to the cloud. The strength of this security is evidenced by the fact that Predix is already being implemented by nuclear power plants and health care facilities. Because sensor-gathered information is stored securely, the platform can safely support open data initiatives. These initiatives can unleash creativity in communities — anyone from a local business owner to a smart high school kid can code an idea into a solution. And cities don’t have to worry about these solutions stressing the system. Predix was built for the IoT and can digest extraordinary amounts of data, Ashe said. Getting everything connected is similarly worry-free. Intelligent streetlights can be programmed to connect automatically with any available communications network — cellular, wireless or satellite. Smarter Lights, Smarter City With the addition of sensors, streetlights can be the backbone that supports city departments, helping them deliver services efficiently, cut costs, increase revenue, enhance safety and solve environmental problems. As Christiansen said: “Yesterday, your lighting fixture was a light bulb. Tomorrow, the possibilities are endless.” When humble light fixtures are outfitted with sensors and connected to the cloud, they can unleash truly brilliant ideas for cities, buildings and factories.  Like This Article?

Credit: Intel More like this AMD tries to drum up support for 32-core Zen server chip AMD sets up Ryzen chip for a strong start as battle with Intel looms Intel packs more horsepower into its monster 22-core processor Video Mingis on Tech: Floating solar panels, a VR update -- and Tom Brady? No Intel chip is as expensive as the new Xeon E7-8894 v4 server processor. The US$8,898 Xeon chip has massive horsepower with 24 cores, 60MB of cache and a maximum clock frequency of 3.4GHz. Intel said this is the company's fastest server chip, breaking enterprise application speed records. The company's next expensive chip after the E7-8894 v4 is its other 24-core processor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4, which is priced at $7,174. The chips have similar features except for the base clock speed. The new chip starts at 2.4GHz compared to 2.2GHz for the less expensive chip. The $8,898 chip even outprices Intel's fastest supercomputing chip, the Xeon Phi 7290F, which is priced at $6,401. It is also over four times more expensive than the costliest PC chip, the $1,723 Core i7-6950X for gaming desktops. Some price competition could come from AMD, which is reentering the server market with Zen-based chips in the second quarter. Its initial server chips code-named Naples have up to 32 cores. AMD has not revealed the target market for Naples, but it could be cloud providers. During an earnings call, AMD indicated Naples chips would be competitively priced, and downplayed its margins expectations. AMD is projecting Zen chips to be high performance, but the company is looking for volume shipments and may not participate in the low-volume market of servers with more than eight sockets. The Xeon E7-8894 v4, which is based on the Broadwell architecture, is priced high for many reasons. It is targeted at fault tolerant servers used by financial or retail companies which need highly reliable systems for transactions and fraud detection. These companies could lose hundreds of millions of dollars if a server crashed. The new chip also has features not found in regular PC or server chips, like error correction and RAS (reliability, availability and serviceability), which can diagnose and troubleshoot issues without crashing servers. The chips also have high levels of I/O and networking integration. Right now server buyers don't have bargaining power with Intel, which has more than a 90 percent market share in server chips. Intel charges a hefty premium for the performance and adjacent technologies it bundles, including server and networking gear. The E7 v4 chips aren't high in volume shipments, and are made in smaller batches. But these are highly profitable chips and fuel revenue for Intel, which is now relying more on data center equipment than PCs for growth in the future. Server chips already have a high markup, but average prices have been going up in recent years and will continue to rise, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel, during a speech at a investor day meeting in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday. Prices have been going up due to new applications like machine learning and analytics and the growth of business cloud services, Bryant said. "Because they see value in our high-end products, they are buying up the stack," Bryant said. But server purchases have stalled after years of growth, and Bryant projected a 5 percent decline in server CPU shipments going into 2021. The company isn't expecting to grow from server CPU shipments, but from adjacent product shipments to telecom and cloud providers. Competition from AMD has been worked into the server chip price and shipment projections, Bryant said. Intel plans more potentially powerful and expensive chips this year. The company will ship a deep learning chip called Knights Mill and a separate chip called Lake Crest that will integrate Xeon with a deep-learning chip based on technology acquired from Nervana Systems.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel Readies Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K To Tackle Ryzen Chips – 112W TDP And Higher Clock Speeds By Hassan Mujtaba Feb 7, 2017 740Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel is reportedly preparing faster Kaby Lake processors in a direct response to the Ryzen chips from AMD. The new processors will feature higher clock speeds but will be based on the same Kaby Lake microarchitecture and have higher TDP figures. Intel Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K Reportedly In The Works – Higher Clocks, Higher TDP But Same Architecture The upcoming chips have been reported by CPCHardware who mention that the new Intel CPUs are a direct response to Ryzen. Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, said that he is confident that their company’s Kaby Lake chip will be able to tackle Ryzen. All details point to Ryzen being AMD’s most competitive processor family after many years. Intel is aware of this and are now preparing a few new processors to tackle the mainstream Zen based processors. The two new processors coming in from Intel include the Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K. As the name shows, these will be part of the current 7th generation processors. The architecture would remain the same but will be different when it comes to technical specifications. Reports from Benchlife confirm that these will be part of the Kaby Lake-X family which will be available in August 2017. Intel Core i7-7740K Processor Specifications – The Fastest Quad Core Chip The Intel Core i7-7740K processor will become the fastest Core i7 chip in the Kaby Lake lineup. It will replace the Core i7-7700K with slightly better specs. This chip features a quad core, hyper-threaded design. The chip is based on the latest 14nm+ process node which delivers improved efficiency and performance on the existing 14nm FinFET technology. Advertisement The clock speeds are rated 4.3 GHz base and 4.5 GHz boost. The processor packs 8 MB of L3 cache and has a TDP of 112W. There’s no word on the retail price but it should be a bit higher or if Intel does feel like offering real competition to the Ryzen chips, they could price it the same as the Core i7-7700K while dropping the former in price. i7-7700K vs A10-7700K: IGP Gaming Performance Showdown Intel Core i5-7640K Processor Specifications – First Core i5 For HEDT Platforms The Intel Core i5-7640K processor will be the first instance of a Core i5 chip on the HEDT platform. This chip features a quad core design along with four threads. The chip is based on the latest 14nm+ process node which delivers improved efficiency and performance on the existing 14nm FinFET technology. The clock speeds are rated 4.0 GHz base but boost is also configured at 4 GHz. The processor packs 6 MB of L3 cache. The TDP is rated at 112W, just like the Core i7 processor in the Kaby Lake-X family.. Other updates will include support for quad channel memory which will be a good bump over dual channel. The new X299 platform would offer more PCIe lanes from the CPU and PCH. Intel may be prompted to use a lower price tag if they want this to compete against quad or even hexacore Ryzen chips. Intel Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K and Core i5-7640K Specs: CPU Name Intel Core i5-7600K Intel Core i5-7640K Intel Core i7-7700K Intel Core i7-7740K CPU Process 14nm+ 14nm+ 14nm+ 14nm+ Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/8 4/8 Base Clock 3.8 GHz 4.0 GHz 4.2 GHz 4.3 GHz Boost Clock 4.2 GHz 4.0 GHz 4.5 GHz TBD L3 Cache 6 MB L3 6 MB L3 8 MB L3 8 MB L3 Memory Support DDR4 Dual Channel DDR4 Quad Channel DDR4 Dual Channel DDR4 Quad Channel Socket Type LGA 1151 LGA 2066 LGA 1151 LGA 2066 TDP 91W 112W 91W 112W Price $242 US TBD $339 US TBD Intel CEO Remains Confident They Can Tackle Ryzen With Kaby Lake - 10nm Cannonlake Shipping In Q4 2017 Kaby Lake was a clock boost in general and these new Kaby Lake-X chips will further increase the frequencies at the cost of higher TDP. The higher TDP may compensate for some good overclocks but that remains to be seen. We have already noticed that the Kaby Lake chips have higher temperatures that come from higher clock speeds. The higher clocked Kaby Lake-X variants would come with better thermal designs to suit high-end desktop requirements. The Kaby Lake-X processors will debut alongside the Skylake-X processors on the X299 platform. These chips will be compatible with the LGA 2066 socket and will come with a wide set of features in terms of storage and I/O.

Stock Jumped 13% Last Month The self-driving tech company got a boost last month as it furthered some key partnerships and got several bullish notes from analysts. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Feb 9, 2017 at 8:29PM What happened Shares of Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) were surging last month, gaining 13% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Image source: Mobileye. The self-driving car specialist benefited from a deal with BMW and Intel in the beginning of the month and later jumped on an analyst upgrade. MBLY data by YCharts. So what  Mobileye stock jumped out of the gate to start the new year, gaining 8% on Jan. 3 after announcing the deal with BMW and Intel. The three partners said they would put a fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles on the road by the second half of the year, and Mobileye is also planning with the car maker and tech company to bring autonomous vehicles to market by 2021. On the same day, the Israeli company announced a strategic partnership with NIO, an electric vehicle start-up. Later in the month, the stock continued to move higher as it got endorsements from several research firms and banks including Goldman Sachs, which lifted its rating on Mobileye to buy and gave it a $50 price target, saying the company was well positioned for upcoming opportunities in the autonomous driving space. Now what  There's no shortage of enthusiasm for autonomous vehicles on Wall Street. The consensus among tech companies, automakers, and others seems to be that at least partially autonomous vehicles will become commonplace within five to 10 years.  However, for investors, Mobileye is one of the few pure-play stocks available. Shares of rival NVIDIA nearly tripled last year on growing possibilities in the industry. Mobileye's partnerships across the spectrum of automakers seem encouraging, and the company is solidly profitable. No one knows for sure where autonomous vehicles are going, but Mobileye looks like a solid bet for investors itching for a piece of a potentially huge industry.

In a meeting with airline executives Thursday, he signaled that some “phenomenal” pro-growth tax-cut plan should be announced “over the next two or three weeks.” He promised “rolling back burdensome regulations” in the same sitdown. The Dow proceeded to jump 118 points on the day. Meanwhile, tangible benefits of the new sheriff in Washington continue to roll in. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Intel announced a $7 billion investment in a Chandler, Ariz., plant that will add 3,000 jobs (beyond the construction work). Intel had started the factory in President Barack Obama’s first term (a fact Obama milked in a visit during the 2012 campaign), then mothballed it in 2014 as business prospects dimmed. CEO Brian Krzanich said Intel revived the plant because of “the tax and regulatory policies we see the [Trump] administration pushing forward.” The new jobs will add about 6 percent to Intel’s US workforce. This, of course, follows a host of other one-off announcements of new or saved jobs going back to the Carrier deal just after Election Day. No, company-by-company deals alone won’t Make America Great Again. Big-picture changes — above all, tax reform and that regulatory rollback — have to come. But don’t knock the psychological effect. As Kevin Plank, the Under Armour CEO, said Tuesday on CNBC, “He’s highly passionate. To have such a pro-business president is something that’s a real asset to this country.” Plank also praised the president’s attitude: “I’m a big fan of people that operate in the world of ‘publish and iterate’ versus, you know, ‘think, think, think, think.’ ” Sounds like the right way to get jobs, jobs, jobs.

When a major silicon bug makes itself known, like the Pentium FDIV bug and the AMD Phenom TLB problems of years past, the costs can be enormous. These bugs only cause problems bad enough to make their way into the public eye once in a blue moon, but today's is a doozy. The Register reports that a circuit degradation problem inside some Intel Atom C2000 embedded CPUs can render systems with those chips inside permanently unable to boot. El Reg says that neither Intel nor any of the companies whose products are apparently affected by the issue would actually confirm or deny that C2000 Atom CPUs are the point of failure, but Synology apparently tipped Intel's hand when it issued a statement to the site regarding some of its storage appliances. That statement confirmed that Synology products with C2000 chips inside were affected, but the company said it hadn't seen an increase in failure rates related to the parts. Synology subsequently requested that The Register remove all mentions of Intel and Intel products from its earlier statement. Synology isn't the only company that used Intel C2000 products, however. Cisco recently issued an advisory to its customers noting that it "became aware of an issue related to a component manufactured by one supplier that affects some Cisco products. In some units, we have seen the clock signal component degrade over time. " The company wouldn't admit the name of the supplier to The Register, but Intel's own erratum update (AVR54 in this document) states that "the SoC LPC_CLKOUT0 and/or LPC_CLKOUT1 signals (Low Pin Count bus clock outputs) may stop functioning" in affected chips. Those clock signals are apparently related to critical functions performed on boot, and without them, a system is dead in the water. The Register used that info to put two and two together. Cisco did provide a list of products it expects will experience increased failures related to the C2000 processors, and it says the issue could start rearing its head after the affected gear is in operation for 18 months or so. The company will replace affected components so long as they're under warranty or a service contract. If you have some Cisco switches or ASA security applicances, be sure to check whether they're affected. For its part, Intel told The Register that a "board-level workaround" could be applied to systems in production with the affected steppings of its products. The blue team will also be issuing a new stepping of the Atom C2000 series to resolve the issue at an SoC level. There's no telling what the cost of this issue will be to Intel or its suppliers once the pace of failures picks up, though.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The thing is, the Z270 is overkill for most users' needs. For folks who aren't overclocking and don't need three M.2 sockets, a B-series chipset will serve just fine. Gigabyte clearly agrees, as the company's new B250M-Gaming 5 motherboard packs a fancy feature set worthy of a high-end gamer board but skips the high-end chipset. In this case, the fancy features include metal-reinforced DIMM slots and PCIe x16 slots, a dedicated water pump power header, RGB LED lighting, and an RGB LED header for controlling a light strip. The B250M-Gaming 5 also uses an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller and a high-end Realtek ALC1220 audio codec accompanied by Gigabyte's "Amp-Up" smart headphone amplifier. Gigabyte says the board fully supports Intel's Optane cache devices in its M.2 socket, too. M.2 devices up to 110 mm in length will fit nicely in the board. The B250M-Gaming 5 does suffer a little for its use of a budget chipset. Despite having two metal-reinforced PCIe x16 slots, it has no SLI support. The board supports AMD's Crossfire, but the second card connects to the chipset with four PCIe 3.0 lanes, and has to contend with the rest of the devices for DMI bandwidth. Memory speed is limited to 2400 MT/s, too, since that's all the B250 chipset supports. Finally, there are no USB 3.1, Thunderbolt, or U.2 connectors. Still, for gamers on a budget, this board could be a winner. Aside from the high-speed memory support, none of the missing features have much effect on gaming performance. One of those Pentium G4620s slotted in this motherboard could make for a potent value proposition. The company hasn't revealed pricing or availability yet for the B250M-Gaming 5, but we have some expectation that it's a reasonably affordable model.   Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

With the PC market facing prolonged decline, executives at Intel's annual investor day said the company is depending on explosive growth in new markets or in established industries where it currently has a modest foothold. The company envisions a future enabling self-driving cars, virtual reality and super-fast 5G wireless networks. In pursuit of that goal, Intel pledged to invest billions of dollars in data centers, artificial intelligence and computer networking. "We're in a unique position in time where computing, memory and the requirements for large amounts of data are all converging," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. He was back at corporate headquarters in California for Thursday's meeting, a day after making a surprise visit to the White House to announce a $7 billion investment to open an idle factory in Arizona. If Intel carries off its overhaul, the chipmaker will have remade its business on the fly and profited from the kind of technological change that has rendered other established companies obsolete. "When I look at Intel three years, five years out from now, I do believe the complexion of the company and where they generate their revenue is going to change significantly," said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. Challenges abound, however, as Intel seeks to reposition itself in markets that haven't yet emerged with technologies it has yet to invent. Intel warned Thursday of slow growth and modestly lower profits over the next few years, weighed down by the struggling PC market. Already, the transition has been painful: Intel eliminated 15,000 jobs in 2016 as it recalibrated in anticipation of the PC market's slide. It moved jobs and spending to new sectors. And Intel warned Thursday that it will be some time before the fruits of its efforts become apparent. The company said it expects sales growth in the low single-digit percentages in each of the next three years, weighed down by continued declines in the PC market. Intel also said operating profits will be modestly lower. Investors weren't pleased: Intel shares slid 2.5 percent Thursday to close at $35.46. Intel's current business consists primarily of two segments: PCs, which supply most of its revenue, and data centers, which deliver half of Intel's operating profits. Intel dominates both markets thanks to its industry leading microprocessors, with succeeding generations of technology crafted by its researchers in Hillsboro. The PC market has been in decline for years, undermined by new mobile devices and the absence of compelling features to prompt consumers and businesses to upgrade their desktops and laptops. And though Intel's data center business grew 8 percent last year, the company had been targeting annual growth of 15 percent. Intel said Thursday its long-term forecast is now a little north of 10 percent. To compensate for those disappointments, Intel said Thursday it expects a huge boost in other markets: wireless technologies, computer memory and the emerging class of connected appliances and equipment called the Internet of Things. Those businesses represented less than 5 percent of Intel's revenues last year. By 2021, though, the company envisions their share of its potential market doubling, tripling or quadrupling. It may be unrealistic to expect those new segments to make up that large a share of Intel's business, Zino said. "Even if you see that double-digit growth pace, it's probably not going to be big enough given the sheer size of Intel that it's going to move the needle," he said. However, Zino said that even with the more modest growth and profit forecasts Intel issued Thursday, the company's data center business is robust and has huge growth potential and by itself could fill the void created by the fading PC market. Indeed, Intel said Thursday that it will start putting the first chips from each new generation of processor technology in data center products. Historically, PCs had been first to get Intel's new chips. "This is a company that is going to be heavily driven and dominated by the data center business," Zino said. At Thursday's meeting, investment analysts pressed Intel on its spending plans and declining profit margins. Krzanich, the CEO, said investors should cheer the company's investments. Intel spends $10 billion or more each year to upgrade factories in Oregon and elsewhere that give the company its lead in computer chip technology. With the PC market ebbing, Krzanich said Intel needs to find new areas where it can capitalize on its enormous investments. "The minute you stop growing," Krzanich said, "you're basically saying over time the likelihood you'll run out of the ability to afford those factories and then that leadership will slowly diminish." -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

Intel announced plans for this new facility after the company’s CEO Brian Krzanich met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday. According to a White House official, when built, the new multi-billion dollar factory would be “the most advanced semiconductor facility in the world” and will employ more than 3,000 people. The new Intel factory will be located in Chandler, Arizona where Intel already has facilities that employ over 10,000 people. The new factory would be set up in the next three to four years. In addition to the new plant, another plant that was partly built and left vacant would be revived. The new facility will be used to make the new seven nanometer chips that Intel plans to debut in the next few years. Speaking to news outlets after the meeting with the President, Krzanich revealed that Intel remains committed to the U.S. while adding that the company still maintains most of its manufacturing facilities within the country. In a statement released by him later, he said, “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” President Donald Trump with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. [Image by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Images] In an email to Intel employees, Krzanich discussed his company’s growth. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on. This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry. Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise.” According to Intel, the new facility will be called Fab 42. The company added that the new plant would also help local businesses and fuel long-term job opportunities in the region. “The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona.” The site where the new Intel factory will be built. [Image by Intel Corporation] After the meeting and the subsequent announcement, President Trump tweeted his thanks to Krzanich and called the factory a great investment. Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst???????? pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 In the internal email to Intel employees, the CEO attempted to preemptively answer queries from employees. One of the first questions that was addressed talked about the need for Intel to make this announcement at the White House? This is what Brian had to say about it. “Intel is proud of the fact that the majority of our wafer manufacturing and R&D is based in the United States. This is due to the great infrastructure we have at our U.S. sites, our talented and highly skilled workforce and the proximity to our R&D facilities in Oregon. We’ve maintained this U.S.-based manufacturing even though approximately 80 percent of our product is sold outside the United States—we’re one of the top 5 exporters and top 2 R&D spenders in the U.S.—and despite the fact that from a tax and regulatory position we have been disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete. That’s why we support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies.” Interestingly, this development has come close on the heels of several technology companies, including Intel, filing a legal brief that opposed Trump;s controversial travel freeze.

As confirmed to Ashraf Eassa by Intel at the event, Intel’s 8th Generation Core microarchitecture will remain on the 14nm node. This is an interesting development with the recent launch of Intel’s 7th Generation Core products being touted as the ‘optimization’ behind the new ‘Process-Architecture-Optimization’ three-stage cadence that had replaced the old ‘tick-tock’ cadence. With Intel stringing out 14nm (or at least, an improved variant of 14nm as we’ve seen on 7th Gen) for another generation, it makes us wonder where exactly Intel can promise future performance or efficiency gains on the design unless they start implementing microarchitecture changes. Despite this, if you were to believe supposed ‘leaked’ roadmaps (which we haven’t confirmed from a second source as of yet), the 8th Generation product ‘Cannon Lake’ is more geared towards the Y and U part of Intel’s roadmap. This would ring true with a mobile first strategy that Intel has mirrored with recent generations such that the smaller, low power chips are off the production line for a new product first, however we'd also expect 10nm to also be in the smaller chips first too (as demonstrated at CES). Where Cannon Lake will end up in the desktop or enterprise segment however remains to be seen. To put something a bit more solid into this, Ashraf also mentioned words from Dr. Venkata ‘Murthy’ Renduchintala, VP and GM of Client and IoT: ‘Murthy referred to it at the event, process tech use will be ‘fluid’ based on segment’. If one read too much into this, we may start seeing a blend of process nodes for different segments at the same time for different areas of the market. We already do have that to some extent with the mainstream CPUs and the HEDT/Xeon families, but this phrasing seems that we might get another split between consumer products or consumer and enterprise. We may get to a point where Intel's 'Gen' naming scheme for its CPUs covers two or more process node variants. Speaking of the Enterprise segment, another bit of information has also surfaced, coming from a slide during a talk by Diane Bryant (EVP/GM of Data Center) and posted online by Ashraf. The slide contains the words ‘Data center first for next process node’ We can either talk about process node in terms of the ‘number’, either 14nm/10nm/7nm, or by variants within that process (high power, high efficiency). One might suspect that this means Intel is moving hard and fast with 10nm for Xeons and big computing projects, despite showing off 10nm silicon at CES earlier this year. That being said, it’s important to remember that the data center market is large, and includes high-density systems with many cores, such as Atom cores, and Intel did recently open up its 10nm foundry business to ARM Artisan IP projects. So while the slide does say ‘Data center first’, it might be referring to DC projects based on ARM IP in that segment rather than big 4-24+ core Xeons. At this stage of the game it is hard to tell. On top of all this, Intel still has extreme confidence in its foundry business. An image posted by Dick James of Siliconics from the livestream shows Intel expects to have a three-year process node advantage when its competitors (Samsung, TSMC) start launching 10nm: I’ve been brief with this news for a reason - at this point there are a lot of balls in the air with many different ways to take this information, and the Investor Day is winding down on talks and finishing with smaller 1-on-1 meetings. We may get further clarification on this news as the day goes on. Update 1: On speaking with Diane Bryant, the 'data center gets new nodes first' is going to be achieved by using multiple small dies on a single package. But rather than use a multi-chip package as in previous multi-core products, Intel will be using EMIB as demonstrated at ISSCC: an MCP/2.5D interposer-like design with an Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB). An Intel Slide from ISSCC, via PC Watch Initially EMIB was thought of as a technology relating to Intel's acquisition of Altera and potential future embedded FPGA designs, and given the slide above and comments made at the Investor Day, it seems there are other plans for this technology too. The benefit of using multiple smaller dies over a large monolithic 600mm2 die is typically related to cost and yield, however the EMIB technology also has to be up to par and there may be a latency or compatibility trade-off.

POST A COMMENT 97 Comments View All Comments Yojimbo - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link "Data centers first to new nodes". Does this mean Intel is going to accept lower margins on its data center hardware in order to chase the growth that exists in that segment and to try to stem off competition? Reply witeken - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link You are correct, D. Bryant has said they expect operating margin the shrink from in the high-40 % to low-40%. The EMIB technology to slip the die in chiplets is a really, really big deal to achieve this data center first strategy, which in itself is already a monumental and underrated change of business. Compare this to TSMC and Samsung, who go mobile first. Intel is now doing opposite. Reply Gondalf - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link You are wrong. Intel will go mobile (CORE M and 15W line) and datacenter first with 10nm. LIke have done on 14nm. Nothing is changed. This time Intel refuse to delay datacenter SKUs and adopt the multidie approach to stay ahead the competition in spite the impossibility to manufacture large die SKUs at the beginning of the new node ramp. EMIB was patented for this in 2014. I don't see any monumental change of business, so sorry Reply witeken - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link Diane Bryant has said that this change will start with 10nm++, and then 7nm as the first full node. This is, she said, because it takes many years to build these products, so the development for the first 10nm products are already well under way. Reply Yojimbo - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link Intel didn't go data center first with 14nm. 14nm Xeon E5s didn't come out until the beginning of 2016 whereas 14nm was used on other products (lower power, mobility parts) as early as late 2014. Mobile Core i processors used it in early 2015 and desktop Core i processors used it in the middle of 2015. Reply name99 - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link To me this looks like a desperate action, not a careful plan. It suggests that they expect 10nm yields to be so bad for a while that they simply will not be able to ship mobile volumes, even if they repeat the pathetic multi-quarter extended rollout of Broadwell, one SKU at a time. Even assuming EMIB works wonderfully and delivers something like what it claims, client delivers twice the revenue of data center, and there's much more value to a better performing chip (faster single-threaded, and lower power) in mobile than in data center (ie more people will pay more for it). They're going data center first because they HAVE TO, not because they want to. Reply iwod - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link This implies either IBM Power 8 is really going to be a threat or AMD Zen is finally catching up. Reply revanchrist - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link 14nm Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake? Reply Cygni - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link That's what the leaked documents showed. That plus the discussion about using EMIB to cobble together smaller dies for server parts, as well as the fact that Intel let Fab 42 sit after billions in construction rather than installing 10nm production equipment, leads me to believe that 10nm has been a bit of a disaster for Intel. 14nm was obviously a struggle at first and things didn't get any easier it appears.

Work first began on the Fab 42 factory back in 2011 but construction was paused in 2014. However, with 7nm tech on the horizon, Intel has deemed it time to finish up the building and employ some people to populate it. In Intel’s announcement, CEO Brian Krzanich said that this move should help the US maintain its position “as the global leader” in the semiconductor industry. He also briefly commented that this additional investment should ensure the manufacturing capacity is up to snuff in order to keep Moore’s law going forward. This massive $7 billion investment into this factory also means creating jobs, lots of them. Fab 42 is going to take a few years to complete but it will create an extra 10,000 jobs in Intel’s workforce. KitGuru Says: We will be seeing the arrival of 10nm CPUs from Intel later this year but as always, the company is already setting its sights on the future with preparations now starting for 7nm production in a few years time.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags 7nm fab 42 Intel news Previous AMD won’t be releasing Windows 7 drivers for Ryzen Next Retailers appear to be leaking AMD’s Ryzen pricing Check Also EVGA launches new ICX technology for GTX 10-series graphics cards EVGA this week has launched its all new ICX technology, which will serve as an … Polls Which system memory next?

Intel is already set to reveal two new CPUs to better fight AMD and its upcoming Ryzen processors, but the news of the Core i7-8000 series is a little surprising... especially this early in the game.

Or were you distracted by the amazing comeback of the New England Patriots who won in overtime despite a 25-point deficit over the Atlanta Falcons. During Super Bowl 51 Intel Corp. showcased its 360-degree replay technology. This 360-degree video technology displays an immersive view for fans. Intel is branding the 360 replay as “Be the Player” and it’s the first time the chip making giant has worked with Fox Sports, the Super Bowl broadcaster, for the big game. The “Be the Player” technology produces plays from a player’s point of view and, according to Intel, allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in the action of the game. What’s unique about this Intel technology is that it captures the 360-degree view with attaching any cameras to the players involved. Take a look at this video from Intel on how the 360-degree view looks from the eyes of a quarterback. Now this 360-degree technic could have come in handy after Julien Edelman’s improbable catch in the late stages of the game where he was surrounded by Falcon defenders; but still managed to pick up the ball – double clutch it – an inch from the ground. The play will go down in NFL history as one of the best catches ever along with David Tyree’s helmet grab in the 2007 Super Bowl. Michael Davies, the senior vice president of Fox Sports’ field and technical operations, said the broadcaster tasked Intel to push the Intel 360 Replay technology to the limit of what it could do, using an array of cameras circling the stadium to synthesize a player’s view on the field. The cameras, backed up by a huge bank of Intel computing power, allow a moment to be recreated in 3D space, so that a ‘virtual camera’ can be placed at the player’s eye line; not unlike how limitless camera views can be created in video games. “From the beginning, seeing and breaking down the play from the player’s point of view is the undiscovered country of sports broadcasting,” Davies said “This broadcast with the Intel enhancements brings the audience down to the viewpoint of the player at the critical decision-making moment. What other choices did he have? Was his sight blocked? It all looks much different from field level, and can assist our announcers in describing what actually happened on the field,” he added.   Post to Twitter Post to Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share with Google+ More Articles U.S. road tests show self-driving cars are getting smarter - and safer Samsung Galaxy S8 likely to lose home button, feature curved screen Posts 360-degree, Fox, Intel, New England Patriots, super bowl, video Related Content Top 5 social media stats from Super Bowl 51 YouTube still a Super Bowl commercial destination for Canadians How to take in the first virtual reality Super Bowl 8 business video facts you need to know, according to Vidyard PageBooks Ayelet Baron – Author, speaker and futurist takes us on a journey to the future of work with an engaging series excerpted from her popular columns in ITBusiness.ca Read More Websites ITWC.ca IT World Canada.com Computer Dealer News.com Direction Informatique.com Publications CSO Digital CanadianCIO Computer Dealer News Computing Canada Community About Us Contact Us Subscribe Social Media Tech Videos Tech News Tech Blogs Tech Slideshows Tech Events CMO Digital Find Follow Produced By: © 2017 ITBusiness.ca

Intel demotes PCs, giving datacenter chips first crack at new technologies Intel's following the money into higher-margin businesses. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 10 February, 2017 09:10 0 - - - - print email With Intel’s forecasts projecting the PC could be the smallest moneymaker five years from now, the company has gone “data center first”—giving Intel’s server business first crack at new manufacturing technologies. It’s another sign of massive change within Intel, as the traditional PC business is shoved to the side. In a slide presented during Intel’s investor day on Thursday, the company showed off how the total available market (TAM) for its PC CPU business was just $30 billion or so, less than half that of the data center. The TAM, as its known, projects the maximum available revenue Intel could pull in if it owned the entire market—which won’t happen. It’s an excellent guide to which segments Intel is prioritizing, however: the data center, non-volatile memory like flash and its new Optane, plus mobile communications and various embedded segments.  Intel Intel clearly sees opportunities in anything else but PCs.  Historically, if Intel jumped ahead to a new manufacturing technology, its PC chips would get first crack. Now, Intel’s premium fab lines are reserved for the Xeon and other chips being shipped to cloud providers and the data center. “It’s a big deal,” according to Intel’s data center chief, Diane Bryant. What this means: This is Intel putting its money where its mouth is. Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and Systems Architecture Group, spoke glowingly on Thursday of how the PC business grew revenue as PC shipments declined. (Last week, Kim Stevenson, who was second-in-command, left after six months on the job.) But the cloud and the chips that power them are headed in the opposite direction: up. It may be unfair to characterize funding the PC business as throwing good money after bad, but that’s a bit of what’s going on here. Intel’s priorities: the cloud, not the PC “2016 was probably the biggest year of transition in Intel’s history,” Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich said in introducing the company’s investor day, which familiarizes Wall Street with the various components of Intel’s businesses. Intel used to be a fairly simple company: It manufactured chips for the laptop PC, the desktop, as well as for servers. Today, its core microprocessor business is complemented by forays into memory, networking, the Internet of Things, wireless communications, even software. “All of the things we do either produce or require large amounts of data,” Krzanich said. Intel’s always had a strong interest in the server market, and a quick look at Intel’s price list shows why: Desktop Core chips command $300 or so apiece, while a single Xeon chip for servers can be priced up to almost $9,000. That’s paid off in the “data center first” strategy. As part of Krzanich’s restructuring, “each of the functional groups inside of Intel look at their business and their investments and their strategies, in the context of making the data center a priority,” Bryant said. “And that includes being first to launch on a next-generation process technology node, and that’s a big deal.” For what Bryant called the upcoming “10-nm+” node, as well as the 7-nm manufacturing node to follow, Intel’s data center chips will be first on those lines. Historically, it simply wasn’t possible for the Xeon to be first onto the new technology, as Intel couldn’t ship enough chips to justify the cost. The massive size of Xeon chips also meant a higher risk, as the inevitable manufacturing defects of a new process could ruin the finished product. Now, with a modular packaging structure in place, Intel can afford to shift to its data center-first strategy, she said. Cannonlake will offer the usual improvements That doesn’t mean the PC is dead, but it isn’t commanding the lion’s share of attention at Intel anymore.  Intel Intel’s roadmap toward Cannonlake looks like business as usual. Renduchintala opened his presentation by essentially bragging that Intel had raised its operating profits by 30 percent as the PC market declined. Part of that, he said, was thanks to fat-margin Core i7 chips, which hit an all-time high in percentage of Intel's total CPU sales. Renduchintala said he expected that trend to continue. Intel has previously identified virtual reality as a key driver for the industry, and in one VRMark benchmark, the company found that VR performance improved by 36 percent when moving from a Core i3 to a Core i7. Renduchintala didn’t offer much in the way of a PC roadmap, but he did confirm that Intel’s upcoming Cannonlake chips will deliver a performance improvement of more than 15 percent compared to its Kaby Lake chips, based on the Sysmark benchmark.  Intel Intel’s 2017 priorities look beyond the PC, too. Unfortunately, Intel also failed to provide a roadmap for its Optane product, which Intel has said could revolutionize the PC by serving as a lightning-quick source of local storage. Rob Crooke, Intel’s memory chief, said Intel was already working on its first three generations of its Optane technology, and it's apparently shipping to data center customers. But there was no word on pricing for PC customers.  Kraznich, though, spoke glowingly of Optane's desktop future. “Every single gamer is going to want 3D Xpoint,” the technology underlying Optane, he said. “Every single gamer.” Top 3 Reasons to Own a NAS More from Synology Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Optane: What users can expect in PCs and when it will ship Intel ships first Optane memory modules for testing Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana "Every gamer is going to want to have 3D Xpoint. Every single gamer." Those were words from Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich when updating investors on the company's Optane technology, which the chipmaker believes could ultimately replace SSDs and DRAM in PCs and servers. Intel is now shipping the first-generation Optane but is also working on next-generation technologies as looks to increase density in this new class of storage and memory. Intel says Optane is significantly denser and faster than SSDs and DRAM. It is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, co-developed with Micron. The chipmaker looks at Optane as the Moore's Law of storage. With future generations, Intel wants to make memory smaller, denser and cheaper, and that's driving the development of Optane. That's good news for users. Initial Optane SSDs may be expensive, but prices will go down as the manufacturing cost-per-bit is driven down. Storage will be faster as Optane will bring data closer to the CPU. Intel has talked about some uses for Optane. Games will run faster, with chapters pre-loaded in Optane SSDs. Optane could also be used for analytics and machine learning, which need to move data in and out of storage faster. Intel's ultimate goal with Optane is to unify memory and storage, but that goal could still be a long time out. [ Further reading: Intel lets slip roadmap for Optane SSDs with 1,000X performance ] Micron is also delivering its own brand of 3D Xpoint products under the QuantX brand. Last week Micron said it is also working on its future 3D Xpoint technologies. Intel's low-capacity Optane will be available for laptops in the second quarter. The company has already started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing. The company has also qualified and shipped the first test Optane SSDs to data centers, Rob Crooke, senior vice president and general manager of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group at Intel, said during a speech Thursday at the company's investor day meeting. Enterprise SSDs are typically high in capacity. Memory and storage for enterprises based on 3D Xpoint will disrupt DRAM and SSDs in servers, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel. Intel's projections for Optane in 2017 are modest. Crooke characterized it more as an "investment year," with money being poured into factories and research. The total 2017 revenue will be less than 5 percent of Intel's storage revenue. Storage and memory aren't major revenue generators for Intel, totaling just $816 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total Intel revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, with a bulk coming from PC and server chip sales.

Since our last Guide, Intel released its Kaby Lake CPUs, and we dutifully reviewed them. Kaby parts make good replacements for the Skylake family before them, even if the generational improvement can be charitably described as "minor." We've also seen AMD teasing more information about the performance of its Ryzen CPUs, which should be hitting stores not too long from now. Our stable of CPU recommendations is still all-Intel, but there's some hope that Ryzen may shake things up a little soon. powered by In the graphics card arena, there's no sign of a cease-fire in the price war between AMD and Nvidia. Graphics cards in the sub-$250 range keep dropping in price, so much so that I've taken to calling early 2017 a golden age for cash-strapped gamers everywhere. Just to give you a rough idea, nearly every card cheaper than an RX 480 8GB can be had for under $200. That means you can get a graphics card capable of driving most games at 2560x1440 with ease for only a couple Benjamins these days. If that doesn't classify as "affordable gaming," we don't know what does. Regret buying that PS4 Pro yet? As for the remaining components that make up a PC, there hasn't been much in the way of new releases. Prices for memory appear to have more-or-less stabilized after the massive climb late last year, offering some breathing room for those looking to build machines with 32GB or even 64GB of RAM. Prices for speedy 3000 MT/s and 3200 MT/s RAM are sticking fairly close to those of 2400 MT/s modules, too. That's led us to recommend the faster memory where we can, especially after our Kaby Lake review revealed that some workloads may be amenable to faster RAM speeds. In the SSD front, prices have risen a little, particularly for the 500GB class of drives. While we don't know exactly what's causing this, our best guess is that users are moving onto 500GB as a baseline capacity, and the usual supply-and-demand market rule is reflecting that. Having said that, prices for Samsung's 960 EVO drives have dropped a little, a move that was likely prompted by Intel's aggressive pricing of its 600p SSDs. We expect the solid-state price wars to heat up on the NVMe front in the coming months. The Tech Report System Guide is sponsored by Newegg.

CEO Brian Krzanich uses it to endorse White House efforts to boost US manufacturing. Tech Industry by Stephen Shankland February 8, 2017 5:00 PM PST @stshank Enlarge Image Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, left, stands next to President Donald Trump to announce a next-generation chip factory. CBS News Intel chip factories come and go, but one planned for Arizona has assumed new political importance amid President Donald Trump's attempt to enliven US manufacturing. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich stood by Trump in the White House on Wednesday to announce a plan to resuscitate an Arizona chip factory called Fab 42, boasting of the company's manufacturing prowess and criticizing US regulations. His proximity contrasts with many tech companies' displeasure with the new administration. "Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US," Krzanich said. "We've been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we've had across the world." Trump tweeted his pleasure at Intel's move: "Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst" Although Intel capitalized on the administration's priorities as a way to publicize the factory, that had nothing to do with the company's actual decision. "We're thrilled to have the recognition for the investment and to be able to show people we're investing in the future of innovation in the US, but it wasn't tied to any specific policy or anything the administration did," Intel spokesman William Moss said. "It's driven because we anticipate demand for the factory along the time frame it'll take us to complete." Intel no doubt would like more favorable regulations in the US, but tight ties with Trump can come with a cost. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned from a Trump economic advisory council after customers uninstalled his company's ride-hailing app en masse in part to protest Uber's cooperation. Elon Musk, CEO of electric carmaker Tesla, hasn't resigned despite similar pushback, but he's also offered some resistance to the Trump administration's fondness for fossil fuels. For example, a tweet Wednesday from Musk pointed toward a Wall Street Journal op-ed seeking a carbon tax to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Intel's investment reawakens an old plant. The company announced Fab 42 in 2011 as part of a $5 billion investment plan that would mean 1,000 new jobs, but mothballed it in 2014 because of slumping chip demand. Now it's back on with a $7 billion plan that will mean 3,000 jobs in three or four years, Intel said. Enlarge Image Intel announced Fab 42 in Chandler, Ariz., in 2011, mothballed it in 2014 and is now set to begin manufacturing chips there in 2020 or 2021. Intel At the White House, Krzanich echoed Trump's speaking style to boast of the plan. "This factory will produce the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars -- the most powerful computing devices on the planet," he said. In an email to employees, he also lent his backing to Trump administration policy. "We support the administration's policies to level the global playing field and make US manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies," he said. But Intel has also joined Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and dozens of other tech companies that objected to Trump's immigration ban. "When we disagree, we don't walk away," Krzanich said in his email. "We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H-1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation."

It will take three to four years, and the move will cost Intel several billions of dollars but will create approximately 3,000 of high-tech jobs in Chandler, Arizona. Unfortunately, Intel did not share details about its 7 nm manufacturing technology at this time. Intel began construction of its Fab 42 back in 2011 with the aim to build the most advanced, high-volume chip production facility in the world. The building was completed in 2013, but instead of moving in equipment to produce chips using 14 nm fabrication process, Intel decided to postpone its completion in early 2014. The site is equipped with heating, air conditioning, and other essential things, but no actual semiconductor manufacturing equipment has been installed. Intel still has no immediate public plans to use the Fab 42 for the production of chips using its 10 nm process technology in the short-term future but has indicated it intends to use it for its 7 nm ICs several years down the road. Intel intends to spend as much as $7 billion to equip Fab 42, but at the moment the company does not share what kind of tools it plans to install. As a result we have no new information about Intel's 7 nm technology. Intel has implied that it could start using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography at 7 nm, but has never committed to the plan. Earlier this year the company said it would invest in a 7 nm pilot line in one of its development sites, but did not elaborate beyond that. One of the things that the CEO of Intel disclosed about the 7 nm in general in his email to employees this week is that it requires “an increasing amount of factory space per wafer.” This possibly means that Intel will insert EUV equipment into the process technology for cirical layers and will continue to use a lot of multipatterning, which increases the diversity requirements for the production tools. Intel believes that when completed, Fab 42 will be the most advanced semiconductor wafer fab in the world that will create 3,000 direct high-tech jobs and 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in total. It should be noted that the semiconductor company will not start to move in equipment into the Fab 42 before it figures out all the peculiarities of the 7 nm manufacturing technology. Once it finalizes the pilot line and is satisfied with the equipment performance, it starts to replicate the line at different sites. Intel said that it will use its 7 nm fabrication process to produce various processors for PCs, data centers and other devices that will be used for AI, automated driving, medical research/treatment as well as other applications. So, as usually, the manufacturing technology will be positioned to make the whole stack of Intel’s products several years from now.

POST A COMMENT 12 Comments View All Comments Morawka - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link I wonder if they will use silicon germanium and EUV on their 7nm. i would suspect so since they reserved this site for 7nm. If they were using traditional techniques, they would have probably upgraded existing facilities instead of starting fresh with fab42. Reply Stochastic - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link The generational gains, both in terms of IPC and load power efficiency, have been minimal since 2012 for Intel. Is there any sign of this changing in the next five years? Or are we just too deep into the diminishing returns curve for Intel's architecture? Reply ddriver - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link They mostly care about how small they can make the chip to maximize profit. But it is not entirely their fault, process will soon hit a brick wall and come to a stand still. And all the "graphene and nanotubes will revolutionize chips" stuff is nowhere near commercially feasible, nor is the outlook on new process technology optimistic. Reply Stochastic - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link I thought we were past the point where node shrinks decrease per CPU production costs? Reply willis936 - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link I can't think of a reason that would ever be the case. If it takes you $10,000 to make a wafer wouldn't you rather get 120 chips out of it rather than 100? There's always an economic benefit to making it smaller. When it becomes too costly to make it smaller then they'll stop going smaller. I don't think performance drives the technology as much as money. Reply 3DoubleD - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link I think the cost per chip hasn't been falling significantly or at all because the die sizes haven't been decreasing. In the recent i3 K-series review on Anandtech, they showed a plot that demonstrated this perfectly - die sizes are stagnant. YES, you get more transistors and performance with each generation and the cost/transistor or cost/performance drops, but this is because more transistors are crammed into the same area or are utilized more efficiently. With die sizes stagnant, the cost per wafer is stagnant or increasing unless they can increase the wafer size in a profitable way. This comes with its own issues though. Factoring in that the technologies required to produce "7 nm" node wafers are temperamental (EUV) or has reduced throughput (multipatterning), price per wafer (and per die at fixed die sizes) is bound to increase (or have already started to increase). Reply ddriver - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link It is curious that die sizes remain stagnant while at the same time that is also true for performance. It begs the question, if the transistor count increase is nowhere near the modest performance gains we see, what exactly is intel investing those transistors into? Skynet? From the looks of it, we might actually begin to see regressions in terms of efficinecy in upcoming process nodes. All in the name of shrinking things down and cramming more transistors in there. But why? Maybe intel is just bent on keeping moore's nonsensical law alive, which in their interest is about transistor count only, not about performance or any meaningful metric, are they merely cramming more transistors for the sake of keeping the pipe dream of infinite scaling alive, or are they doing something pointless, or even sinister with those transistors? Reply kiers - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link Does Arizona have the GROUNDWATER to support this kind of Fab in the desert? Reply seerak - Friday, February 10, 2017 - link How much groundwater does a fab need? I don't actually know the answer to that - but that facility is surrounded by several subdivisions with fake lakes, so there's water to be had.

 Intel CEO gives support for Trump tax policy in company-wide email after White House meeting Eugene Kim Feb. 8, 2017, 4:53 PM 3,812 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CEO Brian Krzanich with President TrumpGetty Images/Pool Intel CEO Brian Krzanich showed his support for President Donald Trump's tax and regulatory policies in a company-wide email, following a meeting at the White House with the President on Wednesday. In the email, which was made public by Intel, Krzanich cited the company's "announcement" that it would finish construction on a $7 billion semiconductor factory in Arizona that Intel began building six years ago. Krzanich said the plant was an "investment in our own future," adding he made the announcement at the White House in part to show support for the Trump administration's tax reform policies. "We support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies," Krzanich wrote in the email. The email also touts Intel's track record of being one of the top two R&D spenders and top five exporters in the US, despite facing certain tax and regulatory hurdles that make Intel "disadvantaged relative to the rest of the world where we compete." It's unclear exactly which part of Trump's policies Intel supports, but Trump is well-known for having made pro-business promises that would slash corporate tax rates and bring cash incentives to R&D-heavy companies. Krzanich has previously spoken about this in a CNBC interview, in which he made it clear he doesn't support "trade wars" but would welcome lower tax rates and R&D tax credits, among many others. Common ground Kraznich's visit to the White House comes as many of his tech industry peers, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, are loudly criticizing Trump's immigration policies, such as the recent order suspending immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. In a statement to Business Insider, Intel's spokesperson said, "It’s more about policies conducive to the kinds of substantial, long-term investments we make...We join other companies in supporting the administration’s pro-business and pro-investment goals, which encourage long-term investments like this one." Despite Silicon Valley's differences with Trump over immigration and other issues, tax and regulatory reform might prove to be an area of common ground. A recent proposal from a group of high-profile tech leaders, including Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt and Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs, called for stronger policy changes that would protect the US semiconductor industry from outside threats, including Chinese companies. "We strongly recommend a coordinated Federal effort to influence and respond to Chinese industrial policy, strengthen the U.S. business environment for semiconductor investment, and lead partnerships with industry and academia to advance the boundaries of semiconductor innovation," the proposal said.

It seemed like a coup for Trump, who has pledged to bring manufacturing back to the US. In a media-attended Oval Office meeting, Intel’s Brian Krzanich stood next to Trump and declared that the investment was a response to Trump’s business-friendly policies. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l February 8, 2017 “It’s in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US,” he said. Trump was happy to take credit, thanking Krzanich and calling the Fab 42 plant – which will make state-of-the-art computer chips – a great investment in jobs and innovation. However, the semiconductor company had already announced the same factory back in 2011 when Barack Obama was in power. In 2012, Obama made a speech in front of the building, describing it – to a cheering crowd – as an “example of an America that attracts the next generation of good manufacturing jobs”. The construction of Fab 42 was halted in 2014, following a slump in PC sales, but analysts don’t believe Trump is the reason it’s been restarted. Instead, the decision to complete work on the factory is likely to be based on industry pressure to move to more advanced types of chips as demand for smart devices surges. “Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about Trumponomics,” Neil Campling, the London-based head of global technology, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Securities, told Bloomberg News. Intel (@intel) Thanks for stopping by today Mr. President! @BarackObama speaking at the #Intel Fab 42 in Chandler, AZ today pic.twitter.com/uaVvb9jQ January 26, 2012 “I call it ‘refried’ news. Intel seems to be selling the same horse twice – first to Obama and now Trump,” said Will Marshall, the president of the Progressive Policy Institute. “It gives them a chance to bask in presidential favor and show patriotic commitment to investing in America and jobs.” I call it ‘refried’ news. Intel seems to be selling the same horse twice – first to Obama and now Trump Will Marshall, Progressive Policy Institute Intel’s pledge comes less than a year after the company revealed restructuring plans that included laying off 12,000 jobs by 2017. Intel is the latest company to use a meeting with Trump, who has threatened to punish companies that shift operations overseas, to promote domestic investments and job-creation plans that were already in place. On the eve of a summit between tech leaders and Trump in December, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty unveiled plans to invest $1bn in the US and hire about 25,000 people in the US over the next four years. The news came in the same year the company announced thousands of layoffs. When Lockheed Martin met with Trump in January, after the president-elect publicly criticized the F-35 fighter jet program for being too expensive, the defence contractor announced the creation of 1,800 jobs. The contractor had previously said it would hire more than 1,000 more workers as production of the F-35 ramped up. Similarly, Trump claimed a victory at a Carrier plant in Indiana after offering the company $7m in tax breaks in order to save 1,100 jobs at a time when the company was moving even more jobs to Mexico. Everything you need to know about Trump and the Indiana Carrier factory Read more “There is a pattern now where he takes credit for corporations allegedly changing decisions to move production offshore or investing here,” Marshall said. “These are symbolic events – kabuki theater ­– to show a person delivering on his promise to fight for American workers. It makes Trump voters think he’s delivering on his promises.” Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom said that there is no evidence that manufacturing is returning to the US. “Manufacturing employment was decimated by the great recession with 6 million jobs shredded between 2000 and 2010. Since then about 1 million have come back in a so-so recovery that is now flatlining,” he said. The “PR announcements” are part of the normal ebb and flow of jobs, Bloom explained. Every year, according to census data, around one million manufacturing jobs are created as another million are destroyed. “A bigger long-run issue is the rise of the robots – manufacturing jobs around the world including China are being replaced by robots,” Bloom said. “So Trump trying to stop the inevitable march of technology is his turn at being King Canute – the English king that thought he could command the sea to stop.” This article was updated to note that construction of the Arizona factory announced in 2011 was halted in 2014 due to a slump in PC sales.

Credit: Intel More like this AMD sets up Ryzen chip for a strong start as battle with Intel looms AMD tries to drum up support for 32-core Zen server chip After Ryzen, AMD has no immediate plan to purge other PC chips Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Upgrading CPU performance hasn't been a priority for Intel in many years, but that could be changing. Intel's upcoming Cannonlake chips will deliver a performance improvement of more than 15 percent compared to its Kaby Lake chips, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Intel didn't provide exact numbers at the company's annual investor day Thursday, but the projection is based on the SysMark benchmark. Detailed performance improvement numbers will emerge over time. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] The performance improvements from Skylake to Kaby Lake topped out at 15 percent. The CPU performance boost for Cannonlake should be at least that, Intel said. The first Cannonlake chips are scheduled to ship in the second half of this year. The chips -- called 8th-generation chips on an Intel slide -- could include Core i7 chips. Intel showed a Cannonlake chip at CES. The chip will be the first made on Intel's 10-nanometer process, which will deliver a substantial reduction in power consumption, Renduchintala said. Intel may be trying to catch up with AMD, which is boasting a 40 percent performance improvement for its upcoming Ryzen chips. Ryzen's numbers are based on IPC (instructions per cycle), an important performance metric. The benefit of high-performance PC chips isn't lost on Intel. The gaming market is exploding, especially eSports, and demand for high-performance Core i7 chips skyrocketed last year, Renduchintala said. As markets like virtual reality heat up, buyers will be motivated to upgrade to Core i7 chips from Core i3 chips. The Core i7 chips today are up to 36 percent faster than Core i3 chips, Renduchintala said. Chipmakers in past years focused on increasing performance by raising the clock frequency. But that made chips power hungry, and their focus shifted to adding cores, which boosted performance but also added battery life to laptops. Then the focus turned to integrating technologies like graphics and I/O buses inside processors. Gaming and virtual reality have brought a focus back to raw CPU performance. There's a limited scope for growth in the PC market, with gaming and VR being the bright spots, and both right now require high-performance CPUs. Unlike in the past, Intel doesn't want to sell low-margin chips that would ultimately incur a loss. Intel was "disciplined" with its PC business, and the focus was on high-margin products like Core i7 chips. Intel's highest priced PC chip is the Core i7-6950X, which is priced at US$1,723, and it generates a high profit margin for Intel. But Intel will have to contend with AMD, which is coming on strong with Ryzen. Analysts say Ryzen will start off strong in high-end gaming PCs based on the early hype, but then its success will depend on word-of-mouth recommendations. Ryzen's subsequent success in consumer laptops and desktops will depend on PC makers adopting the chip.

Every single gamer." Those were words from Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich when updating investors on the company's Optane technology, which the chipmaker believes could ultimately replace SSDs and DRAM in PCs and servers. Intel is now shipping the first-generation Optane but is also working on next-generation technologies as looks to increase density in this new class of storage and memory. Intel says Optane is significantly denser and faster than SSDs and DRAM. It is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, co-developed with Micron. The chipmaker looks at Optane as the Moore's Law of storage. With future generations, Intel wants to make the memory smaller, denser and cheaper, and that's driving the development of Optane. That's good news for users. Initial Optane SSDs may be expensive, but prices will go down as the manufacturing cost-per-bit is driven down. Storage will be faster as Optane will bring data closer to the CPU. Intel has talked about some uses for Optane. Games will run faster with chapters pre-loaded in Optane SSDs. Optane could also be used for analytics and machine learning, which need to move data in and out of storage faster. Intel's ultimate goal with Optane is to unify memory and storage, but that goal could still be a long time out. Micron is also delivering its own brand of 3D Xpoint products under the QuantX brand. Last week Micron said it is also working on its future 3D Xpoint technologies. Intel's low-capacity Optane will be available for laptops in the second quarter. The company has already started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing. The company has also qualified and shipped the first test Optane SSDs to data centers, Rob Crooke, senior vice president and general manager of the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group at Intel, said during a speech Thursday at the company's investor day meeting. Enterprise SSDs are typically high in capacity. Memory and storage for enterprises based on 3D Xpoint will disrupt DRAM and SSDs in servers, said Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel. Intel's projections for Optane in 2017 are modest. Crooke characterized it more as an "investment year," with money being poured into factories and research. The total 2017 revenue will be less than 5 percent of Intel's storage revenue. Storage and memory aren't major revenue generators for Intel, totaling just US$816 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total Intel revenue for the quarter was $16.4 billion, with a bulk coming from PC and server chip sales. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The project has been planned for years and it will take another three to four years for the company to star operations at the Fab 42 plant, what it is calling one of the most advanced semiconductor factories ever. The announcement was hailed by state leaders and by President Donald Trump, who was on hand in the Oval Office but who let Krzanich do most of the talking during the four-minute event. “We’ll be completing that factory to make the most-advance 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet,” Krzanich said, according to a White House transcript of the announcement. “This factory will produce, as I said, the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars. All of these devices are the most powerful computing devices on the planet,” he said. Intel first announced the investments that included the Chandler facility in 2010, with then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer touting the planned construction of the factory in early 2011 as she promoted the creation of the Arizona Commerce Authority. President Barack Obama visited the construction site in January 2012, saying, "I am here because the factory that is being built behind me is an example of an America within our reach." Intel is currently working on a timeline for the commercialization of the 7-nanometer chip that would be produced in Chandler, so there’s currently no start-date for the Fab 42 site, a company spokeswoman said. Thanks for reading TucsonSentinel.com. Tell your friends to follow us on Facebook and Twitter. While construction for Fab 42 began in 2011, these types of developments are “complex, long-term projects,” said spokeswoman Patricia Oliverio-Lauderdale in an email Wednesday. The decision to move ahead was made after ongoing discussions Intel has been having with the current administration, in addition to the necessity to meet a growing demand for the company’s semiconductors and the availability of the Chandler site. This will be the third processing plant constructed in Chandler, said Mayor Jay Tibshraeny, who said he was not surprised by today’s announcement because of the close relationship between the city and Intel. “We felt that this was coming because we’re constantly working with Intel on infrastructure and water and sewer issues,” he said. “So we knew it was only a matter of time before that plant got back up and running.” Tibshraeny considers Intel a very important “business component” to the city and sees the project as “one of the most significant projects in the world.” Intel, the largest private employer in Arizona, said that in addition to about 3,000 Intel jobs at the plant, another 7,000 indirect jobs would be created. In 2011, the company said that Fab 42 would directly employ about 1,000 workers. In addition to the economic benefits it will bring to the state, Gov. Doug Ducey said the Intel announcement also reflects defining characteristics of what Arizona and its people represent. “Intel’s commitment to Arizona speaks volumes about our workforce, advanced educational infrastructure, business environment and commitment to technology and innovation,” Ducey said in a statement released by his office. “This represents a core area of Arizona expertise, advanced engineering and manufacturing.” Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said Intel’s “high-paying jobs will be a boon for the East Valley economy.” He said in a statement that he welcomed the decision “to invest in Arizona’s workforce and President Trump’s continued commitment to policies that facilitate job creation here in the United States.” While Trump has emphasized bringing jobs back to this country from overseas, Krzanich said the Chandler plant will mean new jobs, not relocated ones. He said the decision to make the announcement in the White House was a bow to Trump administration’s “tax and regulatory policies” that “really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, whose district includes Chandler, said in a statement that the announcement is evidence of “a new era of business opportunity across the country and will provide a better future for many in the East Valley.” He credited the Republican push for cutting regulations that has been “resetting the economic climate that has beleaguered our nation’s businesses for the past decade.” While no start date is set, Tibshraeny is hoping to get started soon. “I had a discussion today with Intel talking about how the city can work close with them during the construction phase,” he said. “So I think we’ll see them getting their building team onboard and get their plans completed and then start construction.” - 30 - have your say    Comment on this story There are no comments yet.

TheStreet Staff Feb 9, 2017 2:17 PM EST President Donald Trump and Intel (INTC)  CEO Brian Krzanich announced a $7 million investment in an advanced computer chip factory in Chandler,  Ariz., on Wednesday. Initially, Intel had shelved development of the plant in 2014, some three years after announcing plans for it. Krzanich noted that the facility, called Fab 42, would employ 3,000 people at its peak and indirectly create 10,000 jobs in the Arizona area in support of the factory. Intel said the investments will take place over the next three to four years. Trump called the investment a "great thing for Arizona," a press pool report said.

At its investor meeting on Thursday, Intel's VP of its data center group, Diane Bryant, said its data center profit margins would drop over time to the low-to-mid 40 percent range,down from their historical norms between 45 and 50 percent. Shares briefly fell nearly 2 percent in heavy volume, before recovering, last down about 1.5 percent. The company's data center business sells products to enterprises and cloud computing providers to use in their data centers. It's been a critical contributor to Intel's growth: in 2016, data center revenue amounted to $17.2 billion, up 8 percent from the previous year; the only faster-growing segment was its much smaller Internet-of-Things segment, where revenues grew 16 percent to $2.6 billion. Source: Intel Intel CEO Brian Krzanich demonstrates a working SoFIA Intel® Atom™ processor-based smartphone Intel said it expects overall operating margins to grow faster than revenue. The margin adjustment comes just a day after Intel CEO Brian Krzanich appeared at the White House, where he announced the company would invest $7 billion and hire 3,000 workers in long-planned Arizona plant. Krzanich told investors that growth in its data center group was a priority for 2017, and that Intel was a "data company," though it is usually thought of as a chip-maker. — Reporting by CNBC's Josh Lipton and Megan Hawkins Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change INTC --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Feb 9, 2017 at 12:35PM Many chipmakers posted strong numbers over the past year, thanks to rising demand for semiconductors across multiple industries. Two standout names from that sector are AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) -- which respectively rallied about 460% and 50% over the past 12 months. Let's take a closer look at both chipmakers, and see if either stock is still worth buying after those big rallies. Image source: Getty Images. What do AMD and Cypress do? AMD is the world's second largest maker of x86 CPUs and discrete GPUs. But over the past decade, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) CPUs and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs have greatly reduced AMD's share of both markets. To diversify away from those two markets, AMD invested heavily in Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom (EESC) chips for other devices like gaming consoles. It also launched low-end "VR ready" GPUs to tap into the growing demand for PC-based VR games. Cypress makes programmable semiconductors for the automotive, industrial, home automation, medical devices, and consumer electronics markets. It's been expanding aggressively over the past two years, by first merging with embedded chipmaker Spansion in a $5 billion deal in 2015, and then acquiring Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) Internet of Things (IoT) business for $550 million in 2016. Those moves made it a major player in the growing IoT market. How fast are AMD and Cypress growing? After falling year-over-year for seven straight quarters, AMD's revenues rose in the past three quarters, thanks to robust demand for the PS4 and Xbox One supporting its EESC business, and strong sales of its new Polaris-based GPUs bolstering the Computing and Graphics business. AMD's total revenue rose 16% annually to $1.11 billion last quarter, fueled by 4% growth in EESC revenues and 28% growth in Computing and Graphics revenues. For the current quarter, AMD expects its revenue to rise 18% annually at the midpoint -- which easily tops analysts' estimates for 2% growth. Cypress' quarterly revenues have risen annually for nine straight quarters, but some of that growth was inflated by its aforementioned acquisitions. Cypress' revenue rose 16% annually to $530 million last quarter, thanks to the Broadcom acquisition boosting its microcontroller and connectivity division (MCD) revenues, and robust sales growth in China and Japan. For the current quarter, Cypress expects its revenues to rise 20% annually at the midpoint -- which also beats the consensus estimate of 17% growth. The tailwinds and headwinds AMD has enjoyed a nice lift from sales of consoles and low-end gaming GPUs over the past year, but the competition is expected to intensify this year as NVIDIA launches its next-gen Volta GPUs and Intel introduces its next-gen 10nm Cannonlake CPUs. AMD is meeting that competition head-on with its high-end Vega GPUs and Ryzen CPUs. Early data indicates that the Vega and Ryzen chips might respectively outperform NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal and Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake chips, but it's unclear how they'll fare against Volta and Cannonlake. Another issue with AMD is its dependence on console sales. The bulls believe that the recent PS4 and Xbox One upgrades for 4K and VR gaming can rejuvenate console sales this year, but the bears believe that those new features might not persuade consumers to buy new hardware. AMD's RX 480. Image source: AMD. Cypress is well-poised to benefit from the growing demand for connected and programmable chips in the automotive and industrial sectors. Those two high-growth markets accounted for 55% of Cypress' revenue in 2016, compared to just 30% in 2011. The Broadcom acquisition also boosted its content share per connected car by 26%, and is helping Cypress address the wired, wireless, memory, and data storage needs of the broader IoT market. But looking ahead, a key challenge for Cypress will be staying competitive against bigger rivals like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), which targets many of the same markets. Profitability and valuations Neither AMD nor Cypress is profitable on a GAAP basis. AMD reported a GAAP loss of $497 million in fiscal 2016, but that represented an improvement from its loss of $660 million in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, AMD's net loss narrowed from $419 million to $117 million. Cypress reported a GAAP loss of $686 million in fiscal 2016, which was much wider than its loss of $379 million in 2015, due to the rising costs of its inorganic growth strategy. But on a non-GAAP basis, its net income rose 142% to $170 million. Analysts currently believe that AMD can return to non-GAAP profitability this year, and expect Cypress' non-GAAP earnings to grow 41% this year. AMD currently has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which is lower than Intel's ratio of 3.1 and NVIDIA's ratio of 9.4. Cypress also has an EV/Sales ratio of 2.7, which compares favorably to Texas Instruments' ratio of 5.7. That makes both stocks fairly cheap relative to their industry peers. The winner: Cypress Semiconductor I see solid reasons for buying both AMD and Cypress, but AMD's future relies too heavily on Ryzen and Vega's ability to counter Cannonlake and Volta. If those plans don't work out, AMD stock could quickly lose its footing. Cypress has a better-diversified business, and its growth this year isn't heavily dependent on outmaneuvering bigger competitors. Cypress also pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7%, while AMD doesn't pay one at all. Therefore, the choice between the two is pretty clear -- Cypress is a much safer play than AMD at current prices.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Share Written by Sarah Kessler February 09, 2017 Intel is building a $7 billion manufacturing plant in Arizona that will create “3,000 high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs,” CEO Brian Krzanich announced after a meeting with US president Donald Trump on Tuesday. “The people of Arizona will be very happy,” Trump said. “It’s a lot of jobs.” Trump made “bringing back jobs” a central theme in his campaign, and he has continued to emphasize it in the early days of his presidency. Last month, for instance, the president told business leaders that he would use taxes and other penalties to punish American companies who move manufacturing jobs abroad. In that context, there’s something a bit ironic about the Intel announcement. While the newly announced factory will create jobs, those jobs will be centered on producing computer chips that help enable another threat to jobs: automation technology. Intel began building the Arizona factory several years ago. (At the time, Obama also praised the company for creating manufacturing jobs.) It then put the project on hold in 2014, citing changing market conditions. Krzanich said that Trump’s push to cut taxes and regulations influenced his decision to re-up the plant this year. Intel is the world’s largest computer-chip manufacturer; its chips are used in cars, drones, wearables, and data centers. Some chips in the new factory will be made using Intel’s most advanced manufacturing process, which condenses computing power further than ever before, making said chips useful for technologies that involve huge amounts of data. In an email to employees, Krzanich mentioned possible uses that include artificial intelligence, automated driving, and “the factories of the future.” All of those advances are expected to replace and augment human labor. Nor will automation be limited to industries heavy on manufacturing. A recent analysis by McKinsey concluded that 51% of activities in the US economy, accounting for almost $2.7 trillion in wages, could be automated using existing artificial intelligence. Although the analysis found few jobs could be automated entirely, and argued that automation is necessary to maintain global economic growth, it also warned that in the short term, artificial intelligence and robots could cause “significant labor displacement” and “exacerbate a growing skills and employment gap that already exists between high-skill and low-skill workers.” The Obama White House, for instance, estimated that 3.1 million drivers in the US could lose their jobs to automated cars (the administration did not estimate how many new jobs might be developed, or lay out a timeline for when automation might occur). Among its suggestions: “Educate and train Americans for jobs of the future.” It turns out that at least 3,000 of those jobs of the future—at least the very near future—will be in manufacturing.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled plans for $7 billion chip factory in Chandler, Arizona, in the presence of President Donald Trump at the White House Wednesday. Krzanich said the modern factory -- Fab 42 -- will make the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips. Fab 42 will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory. The Intel chief said the factory will produce the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, and autonomous cars. He made the announcement in support of the tax and regulatory policies that the Trump administration is pushing forward that makes it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer termed it as "the latest wave in economic optimism that's sweeping the country following the President's victory." He noted that last quarter, confidence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies jumped by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Political News DNC Day 3: Dems Attack Trump Weekday At Bernie's: Sanders Supporters Disrupt DNC in Philly Republican Convention: Waiting For Trump...Wait, He's Already Here...Again Previous Story Next Story More Political News Trump To Take New Action On Security Next Week Senate Schedules Votes On Three Trump Cabinet Nominees Trump Agrees To Honor "One China" Policy Price Confirmed As Secretary Of Health And Human Services Trump Bashes "Disgraceful Decision" Upholding Suspension Of Travel Ban Trump Signs Three Executive Orders On Criminal Justice Puzder Hearing Scheduled Amid Calls For Withdrawal Trump To Unveil "Phenomenal" Tax Reform Plan In Coming Weeks Trump Slams McCain For Questioning Success Of Yemen Raid Price Nomination As HHS Secretary Heads To Final Vote Alabama Attorney General Selected To Replace Sessions In Senate Anna Christina Niceta Lloyd Named As White House Social Secretary Senate Confirms Jeff Sessions As Attorney General Trump: Courts Seem To Be So Political Trump Invites Moderate Senate Democrats To White House <<Previous        40 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Intel Plans To Invest More Than $7 Bln In Arizona Plant Intel Corporation Profit Rises 4% In Q4 Intel Q4 Profit Beats Estimates; Revenue Up 10% - Quick Facts Intel Q4 16 Earnings Conference Call At 5:00 PM ET Intel Q4 16 Earnings Conference Call At 5:00 PM ET Trade INTC now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Trump To Take New Action On Security Next Week Senate Schedules Votes On Three Trump Cabinet Nominees Trump Agrees To Honor "One China" Policy Price Confirmed As Secretary Of Health And Human Services Trump Bashes "Disgraceful Decision" Upholding Suspension Of Travel Ban U.S. Consumer Sentiment Pulls Back More Than Expected In February U.S. Import Prices Rise 0.4% Amid Another Jump In Fuel Prices Puzder Hearing Scheduled Amid Calls For Withdrawal Trump To Unveil "Phenomenal" Tax Reform Plan In Coming Weeks Trump Slams McCain For Questioning Success Of Yemen Raid Snow Storm Wreaks Havoc On Air Travel, More Than 3300 Flights Cancelled U.S. Wholesale Inventories Jump 1.0% In December, Matching Estimates Republicans Break With Trump Over Defense Of Putin Nomination Of Sessions As Attorney General Clears Procedural Hurdle White House Announces Trump's Cabinet Poll Suggests Warren May Face Uphill Battle For Re-election Trump Reportedly Considering Prominent Critic For Key State Dept.

Photo: EPA US tech giant Intel Corp on Wednesday unveiled plans for a US$7 billion chip factory in Arizona, in an announcement at the White House with US President Donald Trump. While Trump appeared to take credit for the plan, Intel called the investment an “update” of a 2011 plan to invest US$5 billion for the same facility in the state. An Intel spokesman said the initial plan had not been completed due to lack of demand, and that Wednesday’s move represented a “new” investment of US$7 billion. It marked the latest in a string of such announcements since Trump began pressing companies to create more US jobs and reverse the trend of offshore manufacturing. “Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US,” chief executive Brian Krzanich said at a White House event. The company said the Arizona plant would produce “the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet” and directly lead to 3,000 “high-tech, high-wage jobs” at Intel. With the indirect impact, the company said an estimated 10,000 jobs would result from the factory. Trump said Krzanich “called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced.” He called the investment a “great thing for Arizona,” adding: “It’s a lot of jobs.” Krzanich said that “we’ve been working on this factory for several years,” but had “held off actually doing this investment until now.” Asked if the decision came in response to the new president’s actions, he said, “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US.” The announcement came in spite of a deepening rift between the Trump administration and the tech sector over a White House order barring entry to the US to refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Intel joined a group of more than 120 tech and other firms backing a court challenge to the travel ban — which is currently suspended. Tech firms have fiercely opposed the move, saying it would hurt the effort to hire and retain skilled employees from around the world and potentially break up families. The sector relies heavily on foreign-born scientists and engineers. This story has been viewed 2284 times. Comments will be moderated.

Corporations have quickly learned to play Donald Trump at his own game Written by Oliver Staley Obsession "America First" February 09, 2017 Back for seconds. (Reuters/Joshua Roberts) Share Written by Oliver Staley Obsession "America First" February 09, 2017 Since his election, US president Donald Trump has used the power of his office to try and bully companies to do his bidding. But it hasn’t taken long for corporations to flip the script and use the megaphone provided by Trump for their own purposes. The latest example is Intel, which yesterday (Feb. 8) announced it was building a $7 billion plant in Arizona that would employ 3,000 workers. CEO Brian Krzanich met in the Oval Office with Trump, who tweeted in celebration of the good news: Thank you Brian Krzanich, CEO of @Intel. A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS! #AmericaFirst🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/76lAiSSQ1l — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 But Intel’s announced chip plant wasn’t new, and Tump wasn’t even the first US president to celebrate it. In 2012, Barack Obama toured the factory construction site to tout the plant and Intel’s commitment to US manufacturing, the AP reported. The project was put on hold in 2014, and recently revived. By giving Trump a photo opp, Intel was able to bask in the glow of a president celebrating its project. Again. Intel joins a growing number of companies willing to exploit Trump’s eagerness to take credit for any good news for the US economy, no matter how tangental his role in it. Like Trump, they’re counting on a surge of positive press and goodwill from the headlines, and trusting that most Americans won’t pay much attention to the details. One of the first to realize a public relations windfall from the strategy was Masayoshi Son, CEO of Softbank, who visited Trump Tower in early December and let Trump, then the president-elect, take credit for the telecom’s company pledge to invest $50 billion in the US. In fact, the pledge was part of a commitment made in October—before the election—to invest $100 billion globally. Ford also used Trump to get credit for something it was already doing. In November, Trump announced he had talked Ford out of moving jobs assembling Lincoln SUVs to Mexico and saving 4,700 jobs in Kentucky. But Ford had previously said any workers not making the Lincoln model would be shifted over to making Ford Escapes, so no jobs were ever in jeopardy. On Feb. 6, Lockheed Martin praised Trump’s involvement for helping drive down the cost of the F-35 fighter jet. Yet, the fall in price was a result of the US Defense Department increasing its order, effectively getting a discount for volume. Trump accelerated the negotiations, but “this would’ve happened if Hillary Clinton had been elected president,” a defense consultant told Politico. By giving Trump credit, Lockheed was able to end Trump’s nagging on Twitter, which previously had hammered its stock. Buttering up Trump may also make the president an ally as the contractor looks to sell planes and weapons systems in the US and around the world. Ultimately, corporations are not people. They’re not motivated by the same sense of pride and honor. If giving Trump undeserved credit helps the bottom line, that’s a deal most CEOs will take.

The company has four new motherboards based on Intel's 200-series chipsets, and they're all as white and frosty as my neighborhood streets. The new offerings come in pairs—two Tomahawk Arctic ATX mobos and two Mortar Arctic microATX boards. First up are the Z270 Tomahawk Arctic and H270 Tomahawk Arctic motherboards, differing only in the choice of chipset. MSI packed these models with features: two M.2 slots, USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports, and an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller. The main PCIe x16 slot is also reinforced with metal for better supporting heavy graphics cards. There's also onboard LED lighting done in a seemingly-tasteful fashion, and one of MSI's Mystic Light Sync headers for synchronizing RGB LEDs across components. Next up are the H270M Mortar Arctic and B250M Mortar Arctic. These microATX motherboards are similar to Tomahawk models above, but in a smaller form factor. There's only one M.2 slot instead of two, but the rest of the feature set remains unchanged. The Z270 Tomahawk Arctic is showing up in a couple online retailers for $145, and the H270 Tomahawk Arctic is making an appearance for $125. The smaller H270M Mortar Arctic retails for about $110, while the B250M Mortar Arctic is the cheapest of the bunch at $100.   Tags: Motherboards Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Andrew Cunningham - Feb 9, 2017 3:36 pm UTC reader comments 55 Share this story HP's Elite Slice (Diet Coke tallboy for scale) Andrew Cunningham This is the Slice with the speaker slice underneath; the desktop by itself isn't quite so tall. Andrew Cunningham The only ports on the front or either side are one USB-C port and a headphone jack. Andrew Cunningham The port layout on the back is OK, save for the lack of an SD slot and a relative dearth of USB-A ports. Andrew Cunningham The "collaboration cover" includes light-up capacitive buttons for video conferencing. Andrew Cunningham The slice-free Slice next to Intel's dual-core and quad-core Skylake NUCs (above and to the right, respectively). Andrew Cunningham The port layout of any given mini PC is dictated mostly by its size. Andrew Cunningham The wireless keyboard and mouse are fine, but they use IR and not Bluetooth. Andrew Cunningham The external power brick adds some extra volume. Andrew Cunningham Mini desktop PCs are a well-established market segment at this point, and they follow pretty much the same template. Take laptop or low-power desktop CPUs, slap them on a small motherboard that uses laptop-sized RAM and storage, and pop it all into a little case with lots of ports. It's not an exciting formula, but it gets the job done. Today's ultraportable laptops offer enough speed for most common tasks, and there's no reason to provide a bunch of room for add-on cards and other upgrades that many users will never perform. But what if there were another option that walked the line between a mini desktop and an old-school mini tower? A little PC with the virtues of a mini desktop, but one that could still be expanded and customized relatively easily? That's the line the HP Elite Slice tries to walk. It's a conventional business-focused mini desktop on the surface, but it also has a port on the bottom that allows you to stack it on top of other modules, adding and removing functionality as needed. On paper, this is a cool idea with a lot of promise. Unfortunately, HP's first try falls a little short of fulfilling that promise. Look and feel Specs at a glance: HP Elite Slice (as reviewed) OS Windows 10 Pro x64 CPU 2.8GHz Core i7-6700T (Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz) RAM 8GB 2133MHz DDR4 (single-channel, supports up to 32GB dual-channel) GPU Intel HD 530 (integrated) HDD 256GB SATA III SSD Networking 867Mbps 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, Gigabit Ethernet Ports 2x USB 3.0, DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 1.4a, 2x USB-C Size 6.5 x 6.5 x 1.38" (165 x 165 x 35mm) with no slices attached Other perks Kensington lock, optional fingerprint reader, "Collaboration Cover" Warranty 3 years Price Starts at $699, about $1,144 as configured The Slice sits somewhere between Apple’s neglected Mac Mini and Intel’s NUC in size, a little pizza box with rounded corners. There’s a gap between the body of the computer and its lid—a fan vent runs around the perimeter of the system, and hot air is pushed out of this gap rather than through a vent in back. This approach takes up more space but also makes it harder to block the entire vent when the computer is tucked away. By itself, the Slice measures 6.5 inches squared and is 1.38 inches tall, a little smaller than the Mac Mini (7.7 by 7.7 by 1.4 inches) but larger than the dual-core NUCs (4.53 by 4.37 by 1.26 inches). Unlike the Mac Mini, the Slice uses an external power brick, which bumps up its total volume a bit. A couple of optional features only ship with customized models or with specific configurations; these can’t be added later, so make sure you’re getting what you want when you put in your order. One is a fingerprint reader mounted on the right side of the desktop. The other is called the “collaboration cover,” and it includes five glowing capacitive buttons aligned across the top front of the machine. These are intended to make the Slice more convenient for teleconferencing. There’s one button for picking up calls, one for muting the mic, two buttons to control speaker volume, and one to end calls. The Slice is perhaps a bit expensive for a dedicated teleconferencing box, but the buttons are more convenient than having to keep track of a wireless keyboard if you keep your computer in the middle of your conference table. Speaking of the included wireless keyboard and mouse, both are basically fine. The chiclet keyboard isn't the best I've ever used (travel is both a little too shallow and the keys are a little too soft for my taste), but it didn't introduce a ton of new typing errors, and a three-button mouse is a three-button mouse. The only frustrating thing—and this isn't the first HP desktop I've used that has done this—is that the keyboard and mouse use a little wireless receiver instead of Bluetooth. This frees you from the occasionally frustrating Bluetooth pairing process, but it also blocks one of your USB-A ports right off the bat, and the Slice only has two of them in the first place. The increased size of the Slice relative to the NUC is because the box uses regular socketed desktop processors rather than soldered-on Ultrabook processors. These 35W desktop processors are from Intel’s T-series rather than the conventional 65W desktop processors, but you can still get both dual-core and quad-core options, and general performance isn’t too much lower than what you get from the regular chjps. Our review unit uses a quad-core Core i7-6700T. Further ReadingIntel pushes out the rest of its Kaby Lake processors for 2017’s PCs Yes, that’s a Skylake chip, and since Intel’s quad-core Kaby Lake-based CPUs just came out, that could potentially be an argument against buying this machine. Just bear in mind that Kaby Lake’s improvements over Skylake, especially in computers that are more thermally constrained, are small. The Core i7-7700T has a base clock that is just 100MHz faster than the i7-6700T and a Turbo Boost clock that’s just 300MHz faster. That’s not nothing, but it’s not a difference you’re going to notice most of the time. The performance of the integrated GPU will be about the same, too, though Kaby Lake chips do support HDMI 2.0 and some hardware-accelerated 4K video encoding and decoding options that Skylake doesn’t have. Keep all of that in mind if you’re in the market for one of these things, and also keep in mind that HP (or even an end user, theoretically) could update the hardware to Kaby Lake with an easy processor swap. That’s the benefit of socketed CPUs. That said, you will pay a fair amount to get quad-core performance. The $699 base model is outfitted with a dual-core i3-6100T, a chip that performs a lot more like the NUC; that model also comes with 4GB of RAM and a 500GB spinning hard drive, which is pretty skimpy for a desktop computer these days. The $899 model offers probably the best combination of performance and price—it steps up to 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SATA SSD, and it includes a quad-core i5-6500T. The $999 model gives you the Core i7 that we have in our review unit, but all the other specs are the same. The port selection in the Slice is pretty good, though the lack of an SD card slot is a bummer: There’s a power button, power jack, gigabit Ethernet port, a USB-C port, two USB-A ports, a full-size DisplayPort, a full-size HDMI port, and a lock slot on the back, and there’s a headphone jack and a USB-C port on the left side. The layout is sub-optimal, though—having the power button on the back and no ports on the front makes it more difficult to put the desktop in a confined place—one of the selling points of a mini-desktop. And as glad as I am to see USB-C in the Slice, if you’re going to pick one port to put on the side in 2017, USB-C probably isn’t the best one. Pairing it with a USB-A port would have been a better way to keep users out of dongle hell. It's also too bad that the Slice isn't using Thunderbolt instead of plain-old USB-C—not just because it limits future expandability through third-party accessories, but because it limits the kinds of "slices" HP can make. Slice and dice The USB-ish port on the bottom of the Slice connects to its slices. Andrew Cunningham The Slice itself (left) next to the speaker slice (right). Andrew Cunningham So by itself, this is a competent but not especially exciting mini PC. The inclusion of quad-core CPUs sets it apart from most of the NUC lineup, but its larger size, lack of Thunderbolt, and slower GPU means it’s not an upgrade in every respect. The big selling point here is the “slice” system of external accessories that HP has created to bring an element of desktop-style upgradeability and extendibility to a more compact, tightly integrated system. Slices connect to the rest of the system via a proprietary connector that uses USB, and they can be attached, combined, and removed at will. The only slice HP sent for us to play with was a Bang & Olufson-branded speaker module, which adds an inch or so to the desktop’s height in exchange for better sound than you get from the Slice’s tinny, deficient internal speaker. If you buy this thing for video conferencing and don’t have a TV or external speaker to hook it into, you’ll want the speaker attachment, even though it doesn’t exactly turn the Slice into a multimedia workstation. Other slices include an optical disc drive module and a VESA mount module for attaching the desktop to the back of a monitor or TV. The most disappointing thing about the slice system is that there are so few of them, and the slices that are there mostly add non-critical functionality. How about a slice that adds a 2.5-inch hard drive bay or two to expand storage or enable NAS usage? Why not a slice with extra ports? HP’s decision to use USB-C instead of Thunderbolt limits the amount of available bandwidth, which in turn limits the kinds of slices the company can come up with. A decent GPU slice, especially when combined with the quad-core CPU option, could make the Slice a plausible gaming and CAD box or a multi-monitor workstation (the Slice’s built-in HDMI, USB-C, and DisplayPort outputs can drive three screens at once, but an Nvidia slice could drive four and an AMD slice could drive six). Slices with M.2 slots could be used to add more high-speed storage. But USB doesn’t have the bandwidth to handle that sort of thing, so the slice system will never be quite as cool or as useful as it feels like it could be.

Contact me: bcovert@thinkprogress.org Feb 9 Intel’s job announcement at the White House was just a PR stunt The plant that Intel says it will now complete was first announced alongside President Obama. President Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office. CREDIT: AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Intel CEO Brian Krzanich traveled to the White House on Wednesday to announce his company will spend $7 billion on a semi-conductor chip plant in Chandler, AZ — which will mean hiring 3,000 new people once it’s completed. Later that day, President Trump took to Twitter to take credit for the news. “Thank you Brian Krzanich,” he wrote. “A great investment ($7 BILLION) in American INNOVATION and JOBS!” The White House also sent out an email in which it said “we have already begun bringing OUR jobs back to OUR country,” pointing to the Intel announcement. But as with other recent jobs announcements, there’s not much that Trump can actually take credit for. Intel first announced its plans to build the new factory in Chandler in 2011. At that time, then-CEO Paul Otellini broke the news that it would spend $5 billion on the plant alongside President Obama. Construction started that year, and the company thought it would be done by 2013. But in early 2014, as PC sales began to lag, the company postponed the opening of the Chandler factory, saying it would instead manufacture the chips in its existing plants by making them more efficient. The company rolls out new manufacturing on a two-year cycle, and at the time it announced the postponement of the plant, it couldn’t say whether construction would be complete within two years or later. “We left it open so we could have maximum flexibility,” a spokesman said at the time. At the White House, Krzanich credited the “tax and regulatory policies” of the Trump administration, which he said are “advantageous,” for why the company decided to revive construction now. But Trump has not actually put forward any tax legislation as president, let alone signed any into law, although on the campaign he promised to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and to give corporations a tax break to bring overseas profits back to the U.S. So far, the steps he’s taken on regulation have been to freeze new ones and issue an order calling for two regulations to be axed for every new one created. Privately, however, Krzanich had a different explanation. In a memo he wrote to employees about the announcement, he answered the question “why now?” by saying it is “relatively simple”: “Intel’s business continues to grow,” necessitating investment in capacity. He also added that the 7 nanometer (nm) semiconductor requires more factory space. “These two factors have driven Intel to a point where we must get to work and build out another factory for 7 nm capacity,” he said. Since factories take a few years to build, “we made the decision to start the process now.” As to why he announced the decision at the White House, Krzanich told employees it’s because “we support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies.” It also seems likely that the restart of the company’s plant building would have happened regardless of whether Trump was in the White House. “This would have happened anyway. This was always part of their plan,” Jim McGregor, an Intel analyst at Tirias Research, told the Washington Post. He added that it’s not a significant change in the company’s strategy; most chipmakers have a cycle of periodically shuttering or building plants. Meanwhile, things were rough enough for Intel recently that it cut 12,000 jobs last year, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it restructured to shift focus away from PCs to drones and artificial intelligence. That came on top of 1,155 layoffs the year before. So while it may now be adding 3,000 new positions, that makes up less than a quarter of the jobs it has shed. McGregor also told the Washington Post that with the new investment in the Chandler plant, it’s likely Intel will retire older factories elsewhere, which would mean shedding jobs. And while Trump has set a particular focus on bringing offshored jobs back to the U.S., Krzanich made it clear that’s not part of Intel’s plans. When asked by the press pool whether the company will bring jobs back, he said the announcement “is actually about expansion, this is about growth.” The company has production in China, Ireland, and Israel. This is not the first time Trump has claimed credit for jobs that had little to do with him. Last month, after General Motors said it would invest $1 billion in American plants and create or retain 1,500 jobs while bringing back 450 jobs to the country, Trump tweeted about “all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U.S.” But GM was publicly adamant that the decision had nothing to do with the administration; meanwhile, it’s laying off about 3,300 American workers at other plants. Fiat Chrysler says Trump had nothing to do with its jobs announcement The company says it has already invested $9.6 billion in the U.S. and created 25,000 jobs since 2009.thinkprogress.org When Fiat Chrysler said it will create 2,000 jobs as it expands plants in Michigan and Ohio, Trump tweeted about the announcement by saying “It’s finally happening.” But the company told ThinkProgress that its decision was also unrelated to politics and was in the works before the election. Ford said in early January that it had decided to invest $700 million in a Michigan plant instead of in one in Mexico, thus creating 700 jobs. Trump thanked the company on Twitter, but the CEO insisted that the move wasn’t related to a deal with the administration. Outside of the auto industry, Trump took credit for a decision by Sprint that will bring back or create 5,000 American jobs, as well as for satellite startup OneWeb’s addition of 3,000 jobs. While Masayoshi Son, CEO of Sprint parent company SoftBank, gave Trump credit, both are actually part of an investment that SoftBank made before November. None of this stopped the White House from pointing to Sprint and GM, once again, as evidence of Trump’s impact on American job creation in the email it sent out Wednesday afternoon touting the Intel announcement. The email also claimed that air conditioner and heater manufacturer Carrier had pledged to “create 1,000 new jobs” thanks to Trump. But while the president did work out a deal with the company to keep under 800 jobs from moving to Mexico, they aren’t new positions, nor do they come to 1,000. The company will still move 1,300 jobs below the border. PoliticsEconomyJobsDonald TrumpManufacturing 9 5 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Bryce Covert Economic Editor at ThinkProgress.

No Ryzen drivers for Windows 7 By Martin Brinkmann on February 9, 2017 in Windows - Last Update:February 9, 2017 27 Microsoft announced back in January of 2016 that the upcoming chip generations of Intel and AMD would only support Windows 10, and not the more widely used Windows 7, or Windows 10's predecessor Windows 8.x. It was not really clear what Microsoft meant by that at the time, but we figured it out some time later.  Basically, what it means is that Microsoft does not support these processors on older versions of Windows, and that both Intel and AMD won't support them officially either. So, no official drivers, and no support for new features that these processors may ship with on older versions of Windows. Some or even all of these processors may work however; a YouTube video was published that demonstrated that Windows 8.x could be installed on a PC equipped with Intel's Kaby Lake processor (check the link above for the video). Unsupported means that some new features may not work as intended, and that Microsoft, Intel and AMD won't provide support on devices equipped with these processors if they run Windows 8.x or Windows 7. It was not really clear what AMD's intentions where with the company's Ryzen processors. Microsoft did mention back in 2016 that upcoming Intel and AMD chips would not run on older versions of Windows. Information on AMD stances has come to light recently. While AMD appears to have validated Ryzen processors on machines running Windows 7 and Windows 10, the company stated that it would only offer support and drivers for Windows 10 (via Infoworld). PC users who upgrade hardware components on their PCs, and those who want to stay on Windows 8.x or 7, face a difficult decision now. While they may be able to install a Ryzen or Kaby Lake processor on the machine, and run Windows 7 or 8.1 on it, they'd be left alone if they require support. Neither Microsoft, nor Intel or AMD will provide support on unsupported operating system version. So, if you want to run the latest Intel or AMD processors, you need to get your hands on Windows 10 if you want them to be supported officially by those companies. It is unclear if Ryzen processors will perform the same on Windows 7 or Windows 10, or if driver support and better operating system support make Windows 10 beat earlier versions of Windows performance and stability wise. This is something that has to be tested extensively, but it seems likely that without proper drivers and operating system support, performance and stability are probably going to be worse on older versions of Windows. Closing Words The decision to limit support for next generation silicon to Windows 10 seems anti-consumer to me. Windows 7 is still the operating system that is most widely used, and that is not going to change in the next couple of years. Did Microsoft convince AMD and Intel to drop support for older versions of Windows? I cannot see any of the two companies drop support for the Windows version with the largest user base. We will probably never know for sure. Now You: What is your take? Why are AMD and Intel supporting only Windows 10 for their next gen chipsets? Summary Article Name Et tu, AMD? No Ryzen drivers for Windows 7 Description AMD will only support Windows 10 with drivers and support for its upcoming next generation Ryzen processors.

Himitsu February 9, 2017 at 5:09 pm # Agree with the privacy issues but stability? I use Win 10 ever since Consumer Preview build and for me this is the most stable Windows OS I've ever used, at least from those bits and pieces I still remember from Win98+. Tom Hawack February 9, 2017 at 5:58 pm # @Technowix, "Windows 7 get the same spywares windows 10 haves". I'm afraid this is not correct. Have a look on GitHub pages dedicated to block Microsoft spyware components, several lists are available and if you focus on those handling Win7/8.1 as well as Win10 you'll notice that the blockers are far more numerous for Win10. If you read experts' comments, if you consider all of what is written on Win10 ... you have no choice than to consider that Win10 IS spyware not to mention an advertisement platform : this is even, IMO, the core philosophy of this OS. Of course the infrastructure has to have something, If a company rapes the user it has at least to be done with excellency, as Google for instance. Think that Win10 doesn't even offer that excellency is like walking on someone's toe and saying we've done it intentionally. The company is obviously uneducated. Concerning this silicone "shall we / will we / will we not support older OSs on our newest chips?" it's plain commercial bluff. Let those sticking to their Win7/8.1 carry on and you'll see as the next commercial argument "Our latest chips do and will continue to support older OSs and we'll continue to support them as well". Anyway, no blackmail here. I've never and will never accept that. Determination is fed, always, by having a look at what is essential. A computer is NOT essential. Period. Off-topic : The article states "Et tu, AMD?". Martin, if the title intended a wink at French it should rather mention "Et toi, AMD?" ;) Earl February 9, 2017 at 10:09 pm # @Tom, it's Latin, not French. Tom Hawack February 9, 2017 at 10:29 pm # @Earl, thanks. If there's one thing worse than to be ignorant it is to ignore it :) Music, Latin, ancient Greek are among the continent of my weaknesses! @Martin, now I understand. ;) Martin Brinkmann February 10, 2017 at 5:33 am # I had Latin in school, not French, so, Latin it is for me. Sorry for not making that clearer. David February 10, 2017 at 12:31 am # @Tom Hawack - More specifically, it's a parody of the famous quote, “Et tu, Brute?”, from Shakespeare's play, "Julius Caesar". It was said by Caesar when Brutus (a supposed friend) betrayed him and joined in stabbing Caesar to death. Tom Hawack February 10, 2017 at 10:44 am # @David, I had a look on Wikipedia and learned what you state, indeed. Also, the English culture refers quite often to Latin expressions, perhaps more than the French one, I mean in everyday language, not as such relevant of a Latinist, even if he/she may be one of course. @Martin, no problem! Of course the French language has relationships with Latin and "ex-abrupto" (!) "Et tu, AMD?", quickly read and read by someone who ignores the Latin wording referring to Brutus, Caesar and Shakespeare could interpret this as a "Et toi, AMD?" moreover because precisely of etymology : "Et toi" in French would fit one of the translations of "Et tu", which is "And you" even if others would consider a "Even you?" ... you see I did my homework on Wikipedia! This was totally off-topic but, hey, if you don't mention things you never get to learn, even if the topic is out of a thread's considerations, right? So, AMD it was, AMD it remains. AMD, Brutus?! Flyer February 9, 2017 at 4:27 pm # "we need"??? You mean who exactly?? Reply TechLiteratePerson February 9, 2017 at 4:43 pm # Where do you take that arrogance from to decide how I use my hardware in the next 3 years? Windows 7 will be supported with security patches until January 2020 (and possibly after that for companies). IMHO: Time to migrate completely to Linux after that. Windows 7 will never be purged, even after support ends. It will find it's place inside a virtual machine. A virtual machine disconnected from the internet. Reply T J February 9, 2017 at 5:06 pm # @ Yokogawa Tell that to all the Governments, Health organizations, Banks (ATMs !!) , etc, etc, who use Win 7 in order to run Legacy software, which require a major rewrite in order to be compatible with Win 10. "The last thing we need is Windows 7 to become the new XP a few years down the road, security holes and all". Oh dear. Replace Win 7 with Win 10 in the above sentence and you will be very close to current reality. Have you not noticed that, after 18 months, Win 10 is STILL full of bugs and potential security problems. There are still 11 major problems In Win 10 15031, even after SIX recent updates !! Win 10 is really a half arsed beta OS. Take your rose tinted glasses off, fan boy. @ Technowix Invest in some decent AV and Anti-Malware software. Even Win 10 needs it. Windows Firewall and Windows Defender do not do the job. Reply Yuliya February 9, 2017 at 3:16 pm # Afaik DELL and Lenovo offer support for Windows 7. Lenovo actually sells KabyLake laptops with Windows 7. Don't buy on micro$oft's fud. Windows 10 is a Vista with an ugly theme on top of it, plus some tracking features, and nothing more. Reply Earl February 9, 2017 at 4:05 pm # Most people do not upgrade any hardware on their older machines, except maybe for storage (HDD or SSD), so this is really about what's being sold now and in the future. Of the new Windows machines (with the new processors) being sold, how many of them have Windows 10 installed? I'd guess the majority of them (almost all of them, in fact). Reply Dave February 9, 2017 at 4:38 pm # I think next time I buy a graphics card it will be an awesome old card, rather than a good new card. Reply P February 9, 2017 at 5:07 pm # These processors will probably run on W7, its just some of their new features won't be supported. I guess MS has to resort to these sort of tactics now to sell its operating systems. W10 Game Mode was a good laugh however. Reply kevin February 9, 2017 at 7:29 pm # As a Phenom II user, this is one more reason why the next upgrade will be to a second hand I7 4xxx or 5xxx instead of this new AMD architecture. The high price point was already bad enough. No Windows 7 support seals the deal. All I want is hardware AES support and SSE4, something which Intel has provided for years now. In a world full of older hardware that is still "good enough", these high prices and dictatorial business tactics simply will not work. Reply niKo February 9, 2017 at 8:38 pm # What about very huge Windows 10 issue, which is corrupted search mechanism after joining PC to AD domain.

Intel has launched a deep learning library – the open-source BigDL for Apache Spark cluster-computing framework. BigDL, which is already running in the Databricks Spark Platform, allows users to write their deep learning applications as standard Spark programmes that can directly run on top of existing Spark or Hadoop clusters. It allows the exporting of artificial intelligence expertise to data scientists that currently work across several applications in various fields. BigDL is modeled after Torch, an open source deep learning framework used in scientific computing. It provides support for deep learning, including various computing through Tensor and high level neural networks. By using BigDL, users can load pre-trained Caffe or Torch models into Spark programmes. BigDL leverages Intel MKL and multi-threaded programming in every Spark task for achieving high performance. The BigDL can also serve as the unified data analytics platform (Hadoop/Spark) for data storage, processing and mining, feature engineering, machine and deep learning workloads, Intel said. Intel senior vice president and general manager of the Software and Services Group Doug Fisher said: “BigDL is an open-source project, and we encourage all developers to connect with us on the BigDL Github, sample the code and contribute to the project.” The deep learning library is part of Intel’s AI strategy, which was unveiled in November 2016 and aims to drive breakthrough performance and democratise access. READ NOW: Transforming your business with deep learning The strategy outlined the company’s work to make AI training and tools accessible to developers via the Intel Nervana AI Academy. Built for speed and ease of use, the Intel Nervana portfolio serves as the foundation for highly optimised AI solutions, allowing more data professionals to tackle the major challenges on industry standard technology. The semiconductor company intends to deliver up to 100x reduction in the time to train a deep learning model, compared to GPU solutions.

President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (left) in the Oval Office of the White House on February 8, 2017. (Mandel Ngan / AFP/Getty Images) Ana SwansonThe Washington Post President Donald Trump met with Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of U.S.-based technology company Intel, on Wednesday to announce a $7 billion investment in an advanced computer chip factory in Chandler, Arizona. Speaking from the president's side in the Oval Office, Krzanich said that the facility, called Fab 42, would employ 3,000 people at its peak and indirectly create 10,000 jobs in the Arizona area in support of the factory. In remarks to the news media, Trump said Intel is a "great, great company" and a "great thing for Arizona." "Brian called a few weeks ago and said, 'We want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced,' " Trump said. Trump's next immigration move will hit closer to home for tech Peter Elstrom and Saritha Rai President Donald Trump's clash with Silicon Valley over immigration may become even more contentious. After the new president banned refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Microsoft and others railed against the move, saying it violated the... President Donald Trump's clash with Silicon Valley over immigration may become even more contentious. After the new president banned refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Microsoft and others railed against the move, saying it violated the... (Peter Elstrom and Saritha Rai) In his remarks, Krzanich echoed the president's broader economic message of employing Americans and increasing exports rather than imports. "Intel is very proud of the fact that a majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S. and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.," Krzanich said. Krzanich said the company decided to make the announcement in response to Trump's business-friendly policies on taxes and regulation. But some analysts raised the question of whether Intel would have made the investment sooner or later. "This would have happened anyway. This was always part of their plan," said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research in Phoenix. "But obviously, the current administration and Intel are going to try to get some political gain out of it." McGregor said the announcement was a positive sign for Intel but not a significant strategy or policy change. He described Intel and other chipmakers as having a rotation cycle in which they periodically update, build and shutter facilities. The Chandler facility was built years ago, but Intel postponed its opening in 2014 amid decreased global demand for its products, the Portland Oregonian reported at the time. For years, the factory has been an empty shell while Intel focused on its other facilities. It is not clear when Intel planned to bring the Chandler facility online, but the company probably would have completed its investment at some point, McGregor said. As Intel invests in Arizona, it's also likely to retire older facilities in other areas - including perhaps a factory in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, McGregor said. Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and 93 other tech companies call travel ban 'unlawful' in rare coordinated legal action Elizabeth Dwoskin Silicon Valley is stepping up its confrontation with the Trump administration.

Silicon Valley is stepping up its confrontation with the Trump administration. On Sunday night, technology giants Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Uber and many others filed a legal brief opposing the administration's contentious entry ban, according to people familiar with... (Elizabeth Dwoskin) The Chandler facility will be completed in three to four years, a company announcement said. Krzanich, in his remarks, said that Intel had been working on the factory for several years but had "held off actually doing this investment until now." In response to a question from the news media, he said Intel decided to make its announcement in support of the Trump administration's tax and regulatory policies, which "really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S." Krzanich also took aim at past government policies, saying Intel had been able to achieve its success despite regulatory and tax policies that "disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world." "The president and the administration's commitment to tax reform, smart regulation and deregulation, and a general attitude of 'make it in America' has given them the confidence and the will to move forward," said Reed Cordish, a Trump assistant. Pointing out that the product was high-tech, cutting-edge technology, Cordish added, "It's a wonderful statement for where we're heading, bringing manufacturing back to America, creating 21st-century jobs in America and the feeling of optimism and confidence that CEOs all over the country are showing and a validation of the president's policies and views." Intel joined more than 100 companies to file a legal brief opposing Trump's Jan. 27 executive order, which barred entrants to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries. In a letter to employees Wednesday about the investment, Krzanich briefly mentioned the controversy. "When we disagree, we don't walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation." Since Trump's election victory, numerous companies have announced plans to create or retain jobs in the United States. Yet some analysts have said that many of those plans were in the works before the election or had come at significant cost to taxpayers. In November, air-conditioning company Carrier announced that it would keep hundreds of factory jobs in the United States that were slated to move to Mexico. While Trump celebrated the announcement as a win, later reporting revealed that Indiana had agreed to give the company up to $7 million in tax credits. In December, when Japanese corporate giant SoftBank said that it would invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs, analysts said that those funds probably would have been destined for the United States anyway. Intel's stock rose after the announcement but pared gains before the market closed. The stock ended the day up 0.08 percent, underperforming overall gains by the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index.

Texas, Feb. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CodeLathe, the leader in personal cloud, today launched a next generation personal cloud software that offers remote access  to all documents, photos, music and videos stored on Intel® Core™ processor-based desktop PCs from a web browser, smartphone, tablet and DLNA-enabled devices. With Tonido, users need not worry about their privacy and security of data. The personal cloud solution allows users to view documents, play music, browse photos, watch videos and share files without storing the files in public online services. Individuals can begin by downloading the free Tonido server app on their desktop and the free mobile app onto their portable devices. Tonido app safely connects users to the documents stored on their desktop in seconds. Users can access their files via Wi-Fi or mobile networks and automatically backup their photos and videos from mobile devices to their Tonido personal cloud. Tonido -Intel Home Media Software Solution Tonido Personal Cloud According to Intel's the State of Cloud Adoption report conducted among 1200 IT professionals, only 13% trust public cloud with sensitive data. Changing geo-political events and increasing high profile cyber-attacks have made customers question the reliability of storing sensitive personal files. Tonido has become the leading alternative to public cloud file sharing by bringing 100% private, secure file sharing to the general public. Tonido doesn't store user credentials in Tonido controlled servers and user authentication happens directly between the client device and the Tonido server running on a Home PC. "From security perspective, the best place to store personal files is Intel powered Home PC and the best way to access files remotely is through our Personal Cloud software Tonido. We are glad that Intel chose Tonido to power Intel's Home Media Software Solution. Our goal is to enable a Personal Cloud in every PC," said Madhan Kanagavel, founder and CEO of CodeLathe. Tonido provides automatic backup of photos and videos from mobile phones and tablets to the Home PC.  It helps to free up space in mobile devices and at the same time gives anywhere access to all media. Unlike public cloud storage services, Tonido is completely free and one never needs to pay costly yearly subscription fees. "Popular public cloud storage services like Dropbox and OneDrive can cost anywhere from 50-100$ per year to store a TB of data. Public cloud storage services easily become an expensive affair if you consider the fact that an average household now creates gigabytes of photos each month. Alternatively, Tonido is free and the storage is limited only by users' hard drive capacity. Great value for users without compromising their privacy," said Amar Kanagaraj, CMO of CodeLathe.                                  Accelerating broadband speeds and powerful Intel powered PCs have been a driving force behind the adoption of consumer personal clouds. With current broadband capabilities available to homes, nothing stops them running their own personal file or media server and sharing platform. Additionally, Tonido Relay servers across three continents and six countries provide seamless access to any Tonido powered Home PC. Tonido is the only cross-platform personal cloud application that is available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well as iOS and Android mobile operating systems. Tonido Personal Cloud solutions are white labeled by leading OEMs, and the Tonido team is currently in talks with major PC brands to enable Personal Clouds on more PCs.

The high-volume factory is in Chandler, Ariz., and is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made by U.S. President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House. Intel Corporation on Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2017, announced plans to invest more than $7 billion to complete Fab 42. On completion, Fab 42 in Chandler, Ariz., is expected to be the most advanced semiconductor factory in the world. The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona. Context for the investment was outlined in an e-mail from Intel’s CEO to employees. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on,” said Krzanich. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry.” “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” Intel is America’s largest high-technology capital expenditure investor ($5.1 billion in the U.S. 2015) and its third largest investor in global R&D ($12.1 billion in 20151). The majority of Intel’s manufacturing and R&D is in the United States. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States, while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, including semiconductor tooling, software, logistics, channels, OEMs and other manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs. The 7 nm semiconductor manufacturing process targeted for Fab 42 will be the most advanced semiconductor process technology used in the world and represents the future of Moore’s Law. In 1968 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computing power will become significantly more capable and yet cost less year after year. Making a leading-edge computer chip is the most complex manufacturing process in the world, engineering magic that turns sand into semiconductors, the foundation of the knowledge economy. The chips made on the 7 nm process will power the most sophisticated computers, data centers, sensors and other high-tech devices, and enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more. These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore’s Law. 1PWC Global Innovation 1000 study and Intel 2015 annual report.     Contact Intel Fill out this form for contacting a Intel representative.

The project has been planned for years and it will take another three to four years for the company to star operations at the Fab 42 plant, what it is calling one of the most advanced semiconductor factories ever. The announcement was hailed by state leaders and by President Donald Trump, who was on hand in the Oval Office but who let Krzanich do most of the talking during the four-minute event. “We’ll be completing that factory to make the most-advance 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet,” Krzanich said, according to a White House transcript of the announcement. “This factory will produce, as I said, the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars. All of these devices are the most powerful computing devices on the planet,” he said. Intel is currently working on a timeline for the commercialization of the 7-nanometer chip that would be produced in Chandler, so there’s currently no start-date for the Fab 42 site, a company spokeswoman said. While construction for Fab 42 began in 2011, these types of developments are “complex, long-term projects,” said spokeswoman Patricia Oliverio-Lauderdale in an email Wednesday. The decision to move ahead was made after ongoing discussions Intel has been having with the current administration, in addition to the necessity to meet a growing demand for the company’s semiconductors and the availability of the Chandler site. This will be the third processing plant constructed in Chandler, said Mayor Jay Tibshraeny, who said he was not surprised by today’s announcement because of the close relationship between the city and Intel. “We felt that this was coming because we’re constantly working with Intel on infrastructure and water and sewer issues,” he said. “So we knew it was only a matter of time before that plant got back up and running.” Tibshraeny considers Intel a very important “business component” to the city and sees the project as “one of the most significant projects in the world.” Krzanich said Intel is the largest private employer in Arizona, and that the 10,000 long-term jobs expected will also bring about 3,000 high-tech, high-wage jobs. In addition to the economic benefits it will bring to the state, Gov. Doug Ducey said the Intel announcement also reflects defining characteristics of what Arizona and its people represent. “Intel’s commitment to Arizona speaks volumes about our workforce, advanced educational infrastructure, business environment and commitment to technology and innovation,” Ducey said in a statement released by his office. “This represents a core area of Arizona expertise, advanced engineering and manufacturing.” Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said Intel’s “high-paying jobs will be a boon for the East Valley economy.” He said in a statement that he welcomed the decision “to invest in Arizona’s workforce and President Trump’s continued commitment to policies that facilitate job creation here in the United States.” While Trump has emphasized bringing jobs back to this country from overseas, Krzanich said the Chandler plant will mean new jobs, not relocated ones. He said the decision to make the announcement in the White House was a bow to Trump administration’s “tax and regulatory policies” that “really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, whose district includes Chandler, said in a statement that the announcement is evidence of “a new era of business opportunity across the country and will provide a better future for many in the East Valley.” He credited the Republican push for cutting regulations that has been “resetting the economic climate that has beleaguered our nation’s businesses for the past decade.” While no start date is set, Tibshraeny is hoping to get started soon. “I had a discussion today with Intel talking about how the city can work close with them during the construction phase,” he said. “So I think we’ll see them getting their building team onboard and get their plans completed and then start construction.”   Tweet Related items Survey Looks to Measure Off-Highway Vehicle Financial Impact Education and Health Services Showed Most Job Growth in Arizona in 2016 Arizona’s Highway Safety Message Contest Begins Feds Face Trump Hiring Freeze, With Hundreds of Arizona Jobs Vacant Abortions Dropped in Arizona in 2015, Continuing Four-Year Decline Join the 10,000+ others and subscribe to the newsletter.

TRUMP — Brands keep pushing back against President Donald Trump and on Wednesday, at least, the brands won. Shares in Nordstrom Inc. closed the day up over 4 percent after Trump lashed out at the high-end retailer for dropping first daughter Ivanka Trump’s apparel and accessories line. The news of the removal was about a week old. But Trump chose Wednesday morning to fire back, tweeting: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” The official @potus account then retweeted the attack, putting the full weight of the United States government at the service of Trump’s personal family business squabble. Press secretary Sean Spicer dutifully kept up the attack at the daily briefing, accusing Nordstrom of dropping the line not because it was selling poorly but as a “direct attack” on the administration. Story Continued Below But investors shrugged off Trump, sending Nordstrom shares higher after a brief dip. Other companies targeted by Trump have also seen their shares recover much of their initial declines after finding themselves on the receiving end of a presidential blast. Stocks move for all kinds of reasons, of course. But at least on Wednesday, it appeared that Trump simply gave Nordstrom some free — and potentially welcome — attention. Vox’s Mathew Yglesias: “[I]t may be that investors are anticipating a surge of new sales at the retailer thanks to the massive amount of free publicity Trump garnered for their store, or the way that doing battle with an unpopular president could boost its profile in the large metropolitan areas where most of its stores are located.” Read more. Bloomberg’s Shannon Pettypiece, Richard Clough and Lindsey Rupp: “Trump is intervening in the daily business of U.S. companies to an unprecedented extent, spurring investors and executives to weigh their exposure to his wrath when making decisions. “[After the Nordstrom tweet], Trump was trying to play corporate good cop. Intel Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich was in the Oval Office with Trump when he announced the semiconductor-maker would spend $7 billion on its production facilities in Chandler, Arizona that will create 3,000 jobs, a move that was already widely expected by investors and did little to boost shares.” MM BOOK SHELF — We are excited to read New Yorker staff writer Sheelah Kolhatkar’s new book “Black Edge” about the government’s investigation of Steve Cohen and SAC Capital. Here’s a rave about it from the NYT. Get it on Amazon. CEA MIND-MELD — A plugged in DC veteran offers thoughts on what Trump could do with the in-house economic forecasting shop that still doesn’t have a director: “CEA was created by statute which also requires an annual economic report — so it will be hard to eliminate (it could be ignored, but they do need to fill it out sometime). “What has also not been reported is that the two Members of CEA are no longer Senate-confirmed, only the Chair. … So, it would be very easy for them to simply name a Member and have that person as ‘acting’ until a Chair is nominated. Not sure why they have not done that.” CALLABRIA JOINS TEAM PENCE — POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “Vice President Mike Pence has hired Mark Calabria as his chief economist … Calabria was director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, where he was a prominent voice on financial services and economic policy and an expert on mortgage and housing reform. “Before joining Cato in 2009, Calabria worked for the Senate Banking Committee, where he handled housing, mortgage finance, economics, banking and insurance for then-ranking member Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). His resumé includes stints at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Association of Realtors and the National Association of Home Builders” MELANIA INC. — Tim O’Brien on Bloomberg View: “We can all thank Melania Trump for giving us a clearer sense of what she and her family are looking for from their stay in the White House. … In court papers Melania filed on Monday as part of a libel lawsuit against the parent company of the Daily Mail, she said that the British tabloid and web site, by falsely reporting that she had once worked as a prostitute, caused the first lady to miss ‘major business opportunities’ and ‘multimillion-dollar relationships.’ “The lawsuit … said Melania’s missed deals would have involved such products as ‘apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care, and fragrance.’ Melania’s role as first lady to President Donald Trump would have offered her a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ opportunity to cash in on such deals, the lawsuit noted, but the reputational damage done by the Daily Mail had disrupted those plans” Read more. ANTHEM DEAL REJECTED — POLITICO’s Paul Demko: “A federal judge halted Anthem’s bid to acquire Cigna for $54 billion … ruling the deal between the insurance giants can't go forward because it would illegally hurt competition. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson concluded that the merger, which would create the country's largest insurance company, would stifle competition for large employers in a market dominated by just four insurers, including Anthem and Cigna. “The Justice Department successfully argued that the deal would eliminate an innovative, growing competitor in Cigna, and that the savings promised by Anthem were either illusory or not contingent on the merger” Read more.

MNUCHIN BACKED — The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce CEO Javier Palomarez in Forbes: “We know that nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, will play a pivotal role within the administration to promote a fair corporate tax rate and roll back much of the complex web of financial regulations that hurt our companies.” Read more. Mnuchin, FWIW, is expected to get confirmed on Saturday. Shortly thereafter look for several top Treasury slots to get announced. ** A message from American Bankers Association: The Durbin Amendment, which imposed government price caps on debit card interchange rates, was supposed to help consumers.

Let’s repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** TRICKY TIME FOR FOREX — Mohamed El-Erian in the FT: “This is a tricky time for foreign exchange traders who now face an unsettling combination of policy uncertainty, fluid international trade arrangements and changes in official practices. … The dollar initially surged as the election of … Trump alongside Republican Congressional majorities fuelled market expectations of higher growth, capital repatriation and tighter monetary policy … “This, together with the post-Trump rise in stocks and government yields, subsequently stalled as market participants waited for policy announcements to translate to design and implementation. Even last Friday’s dramatic financial deregulation signal could not stop a fourth successive week of dollar weakness. Currency markets have also been dealing with unusual uncertainties relating to international trade regimes and White House commentary.” Read more. INTEL APPEASES TRUMP, GETS FREE AD — POLITICO’s Tony Romm and Madeline Conway: “Intel pledged on Wednesday that the chipmaker would commit $7 billion to build a new factory in Arizona while hiring at least 3,000 employees, an expansion that the company’s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, attributed to … Trump — even though some of those plans have been in the works for years. “After a meeting with Trump at the White House, the president essentially turned the microphone over to Krzanich for what amounted to a product unveiling in the Oval Office that aired for free on the major cable networks” Read more. BANKS SEE AN OPENING — POLITICO Pro’s Colin Wilhelm reports: “The war between banks and credit unions over a tax exemption for the latter has a new battleground: the House Republican tax reform plan. “Banks see a way to break through the current stalemate by pushing to include an end to the exemption in the House GOP's yet-to-be released comprehensive tax reform plan.” Read more. DEUTSCHE RETREATS FROM SWAPS CLEARING — FT’s Joe Rennison reports: “Deutsche Bank is closing its US swaps clearing business as it battles to cut costs amid continued questions over its business model. “The bank will continue to clear futures globally, according to people briefed on its plans, but its decision to stop clearing swaps in the US is effective immediately. The business had dwindled, with the German lender slipping to become only the 13th largest clearing bank for US swaps at the end of 2016.”Read more. CHINA’S YUAN HONEYMOON — Bloomberg reports: “China has got the yuan in a sweet spot. The nation’s authorities have let the currency rise enough against the U.S. dollar to put a spanner in President Donald Trump’s assertion that China deliberately undervalues its exchange rate. At the same time, it has weakened against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, giving China a competitive edge in exports.” Read more. BANKS CAN'T WAIT TO WIPE OUT COMPLAINTS DATABASE — Bloomberg’s Shahien Nasiripour reports: “Among the changes enacted through Dodd-Frank was the creation of the database, which catalogues consumer complaints about financial products and services. The law called for the CFPB to maintain it and provide Congress with annual updates analyzing the complaints. “Reviled by banks, the database is a prime target for a Trump administration that has vowed to rewrite Obama-era financial rules and has suggested it will change the consumer bureau’s approach to policing financial markets. Richard Cordray, the bureau's director, is among the complaint portal's biggest proponents.” Read more. GOLDMAN FOLDS LONDON OPERATIONS — Reuters’ Maiya Keidan and Olivia Oran report: “Goldman Sachs Investment Partners (GSIP), which opened in 2008 with one of the biggest launches in hedge fund history, is folding its London operations into the United States and shifting staff members to New York, four sources told Reuters. “About eight staff members who made up the London team were recently told to move to the Battery Park City headquarters of Goldman Sach Group Inc (GS.N) in lower Manhattan or find a new job internally, the sources said.” Read more. WELLS FARGO TO CUT BONUSES — WSJ’s Emily Glazer reports: “Wells Fargo & Co.’s board is likely to eliminate annual bonuses for 2016 for some top executives following the bank’s sales-practices scandal, according to people familiar with the matter. “The cut to compensation isn’t meant to reflect culpability on the part of the executives in connection with the sales-practices scandal, the people said. Rather it is meant to show accountability for the bank’s overall performance.” Read more. INVESTORS PILING ON JUNK BONDS IN TRUMP ERA — FT’s Eric Platt reports: “Investors are piling into some of the riskiest bonds sold by US companies as they bet on President Donald Trump delivering on his promises of a stronger economy, lower taxes and less regulation. “Demand for junk-rated bonds has driven yields on debt with the lowest quality credit rating down towards 10 per cent as more than $10bn has flowed into funds that invest in the asset class since the start of December.” Read more. WORRIES BUILD OVER EURO FATE — NYT’s Landon Thomas Jr. reports: “Even as global stock markets climb, worries are building among investors that long-simmering debt troubles in Greece and Italy will put additional strain on the euro. “Yet with the central bank expected to eventually unwind its purchases of government bonds and other assets, investors are increasingly becoming concerned about how Europe — and Germany, in particular — can cope with escalating debt pressures in Italy and Greece.” Read more. FIRMS SLASH INTEREST TAB: WSJ’s Matt Wirz reports: “Rising interest-rate expectations are fueling the biggest corporate-refinancing boom in years. “U.S. companies refinanced $100 billion of loans in January, the largest monthly total in at least a decade, according to data from S&P Global Inc … .Borrowers in recent months have saved more than $1 billion in annual interest costs by renegotiating terms with their lenders, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the data.” Read more. VW THREATENS LEGAL ACTION — FT’s Patrick McGee reports: “Volkswagen threatened legal action against its former chairman on Wednesday as the carmaker stepped into a public feud over whether top executives concealed knowledge about the diesel emissions scandal before it was revealed by US regulators in September 2015. “In the past week, assertions to the contrary have been circulating in German media, based on leaks from what former chairman Ferdinand Piëch, grandson of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of the VW Beetle, allegedly told public prosecutors in Braunschweig, who are investigating the issue.” Read more. FED GENERAL COUNSEL ALVAREZ TO RETIRE: POLITICO Pro’s Victoria Guida reports: “Federal Reserve General Counsel Scott Alvarez, one of the most influential figures at the central bank, will retire later this year after decades at the agency, the Fed announced today. “Alvarez, who has served as general counsel since 2004, has played a key role in shaping the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and its implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Fed Board of Governors said it will launch a search for his replacement.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — MORE ON DURBIN — The Nat’l Restaurant Association also sent members to the Hill on Wednesday to argue against repeal of the Durbin amendment on swipe fees. Via the association’s VP Leslie Shedd: “If Wall Street gets its way and the current debit swipe-fee protections are removed, it would mean an $8 billion tax on small businesses that goes directly into the pockets of the biggest banks in the country.” GE LAUNCHES 20K WOMEN INITIATIVE — GE on Wednesday announced a goal of having 20,000 women fill STEM roles at GE by 2020 (obtaining a 50:50 representation for all technical entry-level programs).

The report “shows that each year nearly forty percent of US families make at least one extraordinary payment of roughly $1,500. The percentage is even higher for older Americans (44 percent) who often face the added challenge of managing against a fixed income.” Full report. NEW ONLINE LENDING INSTITUTE — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “A new Online Lending Policy Institute has formed to research marketplace lending and fintech, with the backing of Quicken’s RocketLoans division and Cross River Bank, a New Jersey bank that helps facilitate loans made by marketplace lenders. “The institute will be directed by former Federal Reserve assistant general counsel Con Hurley, who currently teaches banking law at Boston University. In a call with POLITICO Hurley insisted that the institute will focus on research, not advocacy, to differentiate itself from a trade association.” ** A message from American Bankers Association: When the Durbin Amendment was passed in 2010, retailers pledged that consumers would see the savings. Years later, the truth is out: big box stores have pocketed an extra $42 billion—and, according to a Federal Reserve study, just 1 percent of retailers are passing savings onto customers. Even worse, many consumers lost access to free checking and debit card rewards. Enough with broken promises and consumer harm. It’s time to end this lose-lose for consumers and repeal the Durbin Amendment. www.aba.com/RepealDurbin ** « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben Mary Lee mlee@politico.com About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Apache Spot (Incubating) Provides Scalable, Flexible, Open Source Cybersecurity Hub for Forensic, Telemetry and Contextual Data PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Cloudera, the global provider of the fastest, easiest, and most secure data management, analytics and machine learning platform built on the latest open source technologies, today announced that Apache Spot (incubating) now acts as a modern, open-source solution that can economically provide a comprehensive cybersecurity hub for forensic, telemetry, and contextual data. These capabilities combined with log management, compliance, reporting and advanced netflow analytics are being used to power machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) cybersecurity applications for advanced threat hunting and reduced mean time to detection and investigation. Since Spot’s launch in September of 2016, Cloudera, alongside Intel and other project collaborators, have continued to accelerate the larger vision of fighting cybercrime via a community supported open data model. In today’s cybersecurity landscape, there is a proliferation of data that organizations need to constantly monitor. Cyber criminals have discovered ways to learn from one another, while enterprises have been operating independently to fight threats. Spot allows security operation centers to break down siloed proprietary application data repositories by creating a single, shared open data model that any vendor or custom security application can plug into. Spot also works with the Apache Spark community, enabling organizations to harness the parallel processing power for advanced detection using machine learning and AI. “Cobbling together cybersecurity applications without a common architecture creates data silos that limit the effectiveness of advanced analytics that can be used for faster threat detection, investigation and remediation,” said Tom Reilly, chief executive officer at Cloudera. “The Apache Spot project is breaking down data constraints to open up new analytics capabilities, enabling organizations across industries to reduce risk.” In September 2016, Intel donated Spot to the Apache Software Foundation with Cloudera’s support. This donation marked a significant milestone for the cybersecurity industry. Intel and Cloudera’s efforts towards Apache Spot have provided a new level of cybersecurity response and the community at large continues to discover new analytics functionality for detecting advanced cyber threats that are impacting our society. Since launching, Apache Spot has already been recognized by the industry and awarded InfoWorld’s 2017 Technology of the Year and an Edison Award for Collective Disruption. Intel Corporation “The momentum generated behind the Apache Spot community is allowing us to collectively come together to enable AI and provide comprehensive visibility across all security data using an open, scalable platform. Spot’s open data models, scalability, and flexibility has fostered a rich ecosystem of AI-based applications that can run simultaneously on a single, shared, enriched data set.” — Alan Ross, senior principal engineer and chief cloud security architect Context Relevant “With Apache Spot, CISOs now have a way to effectively centralize all of their cybersecurity data in one open platform. Context Relevant is excited to deliver our ML-driven Context Security Engine on top of Spot, empowering our customers to rapidly identify and stop advanced persistent threats. We want to concentrate on innovative results for security analysts, not the cumbersome management of data sources. Spot’s advantage is knocking out barriers between organizations’ existing security data repositories, enabling the Context Security Engine to connect advanced behaviors across datasets and dramatically reduce the mean time to threat detection.” — Dustin Hillard, vice president of Engineering Arcadia Data “To get a complete picture of a security posture requires real-time analyses across a diverse set of corporate data sources siloed away in systems that are too slow or expensive to handle. Apache Spot brings together this myriad of data sources so Arcadia Data can enable security professionals to be build advanced visual applications that capture investigative workflows, real-time incident response and machine learning-guided data exploration for the very first time across networks, entities, applications, and endpoints.” — Shant Hovsepian, co-founder and chief technology officer Streamsets Inc. “StreamSets works within the Apache Spot community to accelerate cybersecurity data ingestion into the Apache Spot open data model. By contributing pre-assembled pipelines and connectivity, StreamSets equips organizations to easily create Apache Spot applications that analyze diverse security-oriented data feeds in order to quickly detect threats through machine learning.” — Arvind Prabhakar, co-founder and chief technology officer Additional Links About Cloudera Cloudera delivers the modern data management, analytics and machine learning platform built on Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark and the latest open source technologies.

BBC News1:13 Trump meets with airlines CNBC2:00 This is the world's most expensive chocolate bar CNBC0:39 Honoured Apple CEO takes aim at Trump Reuters1:31 UP NEXT Intel is building a $7 billion manufacturing plant in Arizona that will create “3,000 high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs,” CEO Brian Krzanich announced after a meeting with US president Donald Trump on Tuesday. “The people of Arizona will be very happy,” Trump said. “It’s a lot of jobs.” Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 35.34 -0.12 -0.34% Trump made “bringing back jobs” a central theme in his campaign, and he has continued to emphasize it in the early days of his presidency. Last month, for instance, the president told business leaders that he would use taxes and other penalties to punish American companies who move manufacturing jobs abroad. In that context, there’s something a bit ironic about the Intel announcement. While the newly announced factory will create jobs, those jobs will be centered on producing computer chips that help enable another threat to jobs: automation technology. Intel began building the Arizona factory several years ago. (At the time, Obama also praised the company for creating manufacturing jobs.) It then put the project on hold in 2014, citing changing market conditions. Krzanich said that Trump’s push to cut taxes and regulations influenced his decision to re-up the plant this year. Intel is the world’s largest computer-chip manufacturer; its chips are used in cars, drones, wearables, and data centers. Some chips in the new factory will be made using Intel’s most advanced manufacturing process, which condenses computing power further than ever before, making said chips useful for technologies that involve huge amounts of data. In an email to employees, Krzanich mentioned possible uses that include artificial intelligence, automated driving, and “the factories of the future.” All of those advances are expected to replace and augment human labor. Nor will automation be limited to industries heavy on manufacturing. A recent analysis by McKinsey concluded that 51% of activities in the US economy, accounting for almost $2.7 trillion in wages, could be automated using existing artificial intelligence. Although the analysis found few jobs could be automated entirely, and argued that automation is necessary to maintain global economic growth, it also warned that in the short term, artificial intelligence and robots could cause “significant labor displacement” and “exacerbate a growing skills and employment gap that already exists between high-skill and low-skill workers.” The Obama White House, for instance, estimated that 3.1 million drivers in the US could lose their jobs to automated cars (the administration did not estimate how many new jobs might be developed, or lay out a timeline for when automation might occur). Among its suggestions: “Educate and train Americans for jobs of the future.” It turns out that at least 3,000 of those jobs of the future—at least the very near future—will be in manufacturing.

Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, broke ground on the plant in 2011 (former President Barack Obama visited in 2012), but Intel suspended the project when the PC market hit a slump. Krzanich said the company decided to make this $7 billion investment now because of "the tax and regulatory policies we see the administration pushing forward." In a note to employees, Krzanich said Intel had coordinated the unveiling with the White House starting a few weeks ago to signal support for the parts of Trump's agenda that benefit Intel, like the push to make U.S. manufacturing more globally competitive. But "when we disagree, we don't walk away," he added. Intel and other big Silicon Valley companies have signed on to a legal brief opposing Trump's executive order banning travel and immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations, but many of them are in favor of Trump's proposed corporate tax breaks and seek incentives for research and development. Intel also wants the federal government to scale back restrictions on exporting certain types of advanced chip technology, The New York Times notes, specifically regulations that "forbid the company from making its high-end processors in China." About half of Intel's 106,000 employees are in the U.S. Peter Weber   After Trump meeting, Intel announces $7 billion Arizona factory investment February 9, 2017 Only in America Edit 'Leftist Fight Club' teaches Florida college students how to fight Trump supporters February 10, 2017   iStock A group of students at the University of Central Florida hosted a "Leftist Fight Club" event to train liberal students to defend themselves against Trump supporters and "other Alt-Right Neo-Nazis," Fox News reports. An amateur boxer was on hand to demonstrate hand-to-hand combat techniques, and the clinic was billed as open to "everyone except Republicans." Event planners specifically encouraged women to attend the event, saying the president "is a sexual predator and rapist." The university said the group that sponsored the event, called the "Knights for Socialism," is not a registered student group and is not officially affiliated with the school.

Gayle McCormick, 73, a Democrat, had not previously fought about politics with her conservative husband, but she felt "betrayed" by his decision to vote for Trump, Reuters reports. "It totally undid me that he could vote for Trump," McCormick said. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 13 percent of Americans had ended relationships over the presidential election.

Up until this point, investigators had been unable to verify the claims asserted in the document, which was compiled by a retired British intelligence agent and revealed to the public Jan. 10. CNN said that while the dossier's more "salacious" claims remain unverified, investigators have corroborated details about some of the communications "between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals." The dossier includes "a dozen" conversations between foreign nationals, and investigators have been able to confirm that "some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier" after intercepting communications during "routine intelligence gathering," CNN said. Some of the individuals involved in the intercepted communications were previously found to be "heavily involved" in leaking information from Democratic organizations that proved harmful to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. CNN did not reveal specifics, including whether these latest findings are at all connected to Trump, but the confirmations have given U.S. intelligence "greater confidence" in the dossier's credibility. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer responded to CNN's request for comment combatively: "We continue to be disgusted by CNN's fake news reporting," Spicer said, echoing Trump's previous dismissals of the reports as "phony stuff." Spokespeople for various intelligence agencies declined to comment.

The Volta V ($1,999) harks back to that minimalist 1970s aesthetic, when long-haired nerds had to build their own cases out of wood. Available in a fully assembled bamboo and walnut case, this "simple but elegant" desktop computer comes "packed with the latest technology," says Joshua Fruhlinger at The Wall Street Journal. That includes a high-end motherboard, graphics card, and solid-state hard drive. Like the DIY computers of yore, it has modular components that can be upgraded for years to come.

"To be honest, the idea of a 'trophy girl' has felt antiquated for some time now," Portnow said in a statement. "Who wrote that rule anyway? The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one's gender." Portnow explained the change wasn't intended to be "provocative or buck convention," The Associated Press noted, but to recognize that "music's universal power lies in its spirit of inclusion." The three trophy handlers for the 2017 Grammys are transgender model Martina Robledo, model and actor Derek Marrocco, and model and actress Hollin Haley. The Grammys will be hosted by James Corden and air Sunday, Feb. 12 on CBS at 8 p.m. ET. There will be performances by Chance the Rapper, who is nominated for seven Grammy awards, as well as Beyoncé, Adele, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Metallica, and Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban.

The gathering was intended to be a discussion about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Politico reported that as soon as reporters exited the room, Trump began telling the group of senators how both he and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) — who lost her re-election bid and is now serving as a Capitol Hill liaison for Trump on Gorsuch's nomination — were victims of a rigged election. Ayotte was in the room, as was White House Counsel Don McGahn. Trump obviously won the election, but he narrowly lost New Hampshire to Hillary Clinton. He told senators Thursday that was because of the "thousands" of people "brought in on buses" from Massachusetts to "illegally vote" in New Hampshire. The room reportedly responded with an "uncomfortable silence." Trump indicated that this voter fraud, of which there is no evidence, had also affected Ayotte, though he suggested her loss might have also had something to do with her decision to distance herself from him after he criticized the parents of a Muslim Gold Star soldier. "He told her, 'You'd have won if you'd been on my train," a participant told Politico. Then, as the cherry on top of that crumbling cake, Trump told Democrats he was glad "Pocahontas" — his chosen nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — was "becoming the face of 'your party,'" Politico reported. Trump has repeatedly claimed millions voted illegally in the presidential election, causing him to lose the popular vote to Clinton, but he has yet to produce any evidence to substantiate those claims. Becca Stanek   President Trump reportedly told the Senate a totally bananas lie about voter fraud February 10, 2017 big pupper is watching you Edit Your dog is constantly judging you February 10, 2017   It's not just your parents who want you to be nice to other people. New research by scientists at Kyoto University has found that dogs judge humans based on how they treat other people, New Scientist reports: … The researchers tested whether dogs preferred people who helped their owner. Each owner tried to open a container then presented it to one of two actors. This actor either helped or refused to do so, while the other actor was passive. Then the two actors offered the dog a reward and it chose between them. The dogs had no preference when the first actor had helped their owner, but were more likely to choose the passive actor if the first one had refused to help. [New Scientist] Dogs evolved closely alongside humans, which means they are particularly sensitive to how people act. The Kyoto study also tested monkeys, and found similar results, with the primates preferring people who acted kindly or generously. Even human morality might be evolutionary: "I think that in humans there may be this basic sensitivity towards antisocial behavior in others. Then through growing up, inculturation and teaching, it develops into a full-blown sense of morality,” said comparative psychologist James Anderson. Watch the dogs make judgments in the study below.

This high-volume factory is earmarked for production of processors made with 7nm process technology. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made the announcement, which should mean the creation more than 10,000 US jobs, alongside US President Donald Trump at the White House. "Intel's business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore's law continues to march on, fuelling technology innovations the world loves and depends on," said Krzanich. "This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry." In a press release concerning the Fab 42 news Intel claims to be America's largest high-technology capital expenditure investor with $5.1 billion invested in the US in 2015, and the third largest global R&D investor with $12.1 billion spent in 2015. Intel directly employs more than 50,000 people in the US and it is estimated that half a million people are employed by industries that support Intel operations. Thanks to its huge new investments in turning "sand into semiconductors" Fab 42 will be at the forefront of "the most advanced semiconductor process technology used in the world," says Intel. Its 7nm chips will be sold into market segments such as data centres and high-tech devices and help enable cutting edge AI, smart automobiles, medical equipment, and more. Fab 42 will be complete in 3 or 4 years from now.

Intel® SDM is a new and effective standard in display computing with optimized processing capabilities that offer our users the smallest, most power-efficient computing engine for IFPs, corporate and retail digital signage displays to date.” ViewSonic’s Interactive Displays are a popular solution in both the corporate and education sectors with features including One Touch Google Drive access and the ability to facilitate video calls, as well as popular collaborative apps including Slack and Trello. Smart Signage is ViewSonic’s newest signage solution for the retail sector which has gained popularity for use in hotel, restaurant, and café applications. The company is set to unveil the newest addition to its Digital Signage catalogue at ISE 2017. “When we design specifications for the next generation of integrated media players, we are laser-focused on achieving three things: minimal space, maximum performance, and future-proofing the solution.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Ruh-roh Flaw in some Intel Atom chips has reportedly been bricking products for at least 18 months By Dan Thorp-Lancaster Wednesday, Feb 8, 2017 at 12:54 pm EST 15 Comments According to a new report, a flaw in Intel Atom C2000 family of chips has been bricking systems for at least 18 months. Speaking with an anonymous industry source, The Register reports that the flaw in question, which was recently acknowledged by Intel in an update to its documentation, was first noticed by engineers when return rates started spiking around 18 months ago. From The Register: The well-placed insider, who spoke to The Register on condition of anonymity, said the problem – which results in bricked systems – became apparent to engineers at product makers when the return rate on gear spiked about 18 months ago. It took additional time to figure out that Intel's hardware was responsible. The vendor in question worked with Intel engineers during this period to replace affected units under manufacturer warranty. Then about two months ago, Intel acknowledged the issue was with its chip blueprints, the source said. The flaw in question is a faulty clock component that Intel detailed in its recent revision under a section titled "System May Experience Inability to Boot or May Cease Operation." Curiously, Cisco recently issued an advisory noting that some of its routing, networking and security products may fail due to a faulty clock component after around 18 months. Although the Cisco products with this component are currently performing normally, we expect product failures to increase over the years, beginning after the unit has been in operation for approximately 18 months. Once the component has failed, the system will stop functioning, will not boot, and is not recoverable. This component is also used by other companies. Intel isn't specifically mentioned, but, as The Register speculates, non-disclodure agreements could prevent companies affected by the chip failure from commenting on whether technical issues are related to Intel products. Companies affected by the C2000 flaw, however, appear to include Aaeon, Dell, HP, Infortrend, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgate, Netgear, Quanta, Supermicro, Synology, and ZNYX Networks, ASRock Rack, iXsystems, Seagate and Sophos.

I lost $14,000 mexican pesos, and that's why I won't purchase Acer product never again, but after reading this is Intel's fault, I may give Acer another chance in future. 4 2 days ago Reply user-774 Planned or not...? 0 2 days ago Reply cowboy6201 What about the Surface 3? no Probs here just wondering, my Surface is running fine no issues at yet?

I have had a significant number of BSOD on 2 of mine. Are they doing anything about this or is intel and the hardware manufacturers' just sweeping this under the rug. An 18 month shelf life is unacceptable. 1 2 days ago Reply smithy_dll None of your consumer gear is affected by this, put down the pitchforks. The C2000 range are the Avoton, Xeon branded server processors. That's why all the vendors listed are enterprisey. The C2000 series were very popular for people building ZFS filesystems as they have a generous amount SATA ports and ECC memory support, and just enough processing power for a couple of Plex streams. 0 2 days ago Reply pox67 You mean like my Intel Avoton C2750 file server? DAMNIT! I love that thing, 8 hardrives, server 2012 R2 Hyper-V version and a couple of management VMs. Runs very cool and has been up for years.

However if they don't do something to make up for this, then this is perfect reason to buy products with a different chip manufacturer... Oh wait... There's only Intel and AMD.

The Fab 42 factory in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler will turn out advanced semiconductor chips, Brian Krzanich said during the Oval Office event. Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US, the CEO said. Fab 42 will employ some 3,000 workers and the operation will provide work for more than 10,000 people altogether in the Chandler area. Great thing for Arizona. Unbelievable company and product, and were very happy. And I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy. Its a lot of jobs, Trump said. The Intel announcement follows word from other major companies, including General Motors and Ford, that they plan to expand in the US in response to the presidents call to boost domestic manufacturing. Trump has threatened to levy tariffs on imports of goods made by US companies at factories abroad. A reporter asked the Intel CEO if his decision to announce the Chandler plant at the White House had been motivated by any actions or statements by the president. Its really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US, Krzanich said.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

While Trump appeared to take credit for the plan, Intel called the investment an "update" of a 2011 plan to invest USD 5 billion for the same facility in the southeastern US state. An Intel spokesman said the initial plan had not been completed due to lack of demand, and that Wednesday's move represented a "new" investment of USD 7 billion. It marked the latest in a string of such announcements since Trump began pressing companies to create more American jobs and reverse the trend of offshore manufacturing. "Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US," chief executive Brian Krzanich said at a White House event with Trump. The company said the Arizona plant would produce "the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet" and directly lead to 3,000 "high-tech, high-wage jobs" at Intel. With the indirect impact, the company said an estimated 10,000 jobs would result from the factory. Trump said Krzanich "called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced." He called the investment a "great thing for Arizona," and added, "it's a lot of jobs." Krzanich acknowledged that "we've been working on this factory for several years" but "held off actually doing this investment until now." Asked if the decision came in response to the new president's actions, he said, "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US." The announcement came in spite of a deepening rift between the new Trump administration and the tech sector over a White House order barring entry to refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Intel joined a group of over 120 tech and other firms backing a court challenge to the travel ban -- which is currently suspended. Tech companies have fiercely opposed the move, saying it would hurt the effort to hire and retain skilled employees from around the world and potentially break up families. The sector relies heavily on foreign-born scientists and engineers. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Asked if the decision came in response to the new president's actions, he said, "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US." The announcement came in spite of a deepening rift between the new Trump administration and the tech sector over a White House order barring entry to refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Intel joined a group of over 120 tech and other firms backing a court challenge to the travel ban -- which is currently suspended. Tech companies have fiercely opposed the move, saying it would hurt the effort to hire and retain skilled employees from around the world and potentially break up families. The sector relies heavily on foreign-born scientists and engineers. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

X Intel announces $7bn investment in Arizona factory Chief executive latest to tout spending and job-creation plans that were already in place Thu, Feb 9, 2017, 06:59 Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich with US president Donald Trump at the White House. Photograph: Chris Kleponis/Bloomberg         Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said the semiconductor maker will invest $7 billion (€6.6 billion) to finish a chip factory in Arizona, becoming the latest company to use a meeting with US president Donald Trump to tout spending and job-creation plans that were already in place. Mr Krzanich, speaking Wednesday at the Oval Office, called the investment an expansion of Intel’s presence in Chandler that will finish a plant – already under construction – capable of advanced, 7-nanometer chip production. The Fab 42 facility will be completed in three-four years and create about 3,000 jobs, Intel said in a statement following the meeting at the White House. The chipmaker took a page from what has become a familiar playbook for technology and other companies: making a splashy announcement on investment and job additions after a high-profile huddle with Mr Trump, who has threatened punishment for companies that shift operations overseas. Intel already builds most of its products in the US, at facilities in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico, and part of the spending will come out of the company’s previously disclosed budget for new plants of about $12 billion this year. This announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about Trumponomics In December, IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty said she planned to hire about 25,000 people in the US and invest $1 billion over the next four years – an announcement made on the eve of a meeting of technology industry leaders with Mr Trump. The president, in the run-up to his inauguration, also sought credit for Sprint’s commitment to create to bring back 5,000 jobs that the telecommunications company said are part of broader US hiring plans previously announced by Japan-based parent SoftBank Group. ADVERTISEMENT Heavy automation The massive facilities required to make advanced semiconductors in an economically competitive way don’t require heavy staffing. Chip plants are among the most automated factories on the planet. Their immense cost – more than $5 billion for a state of the art facility – comes from the expense of equipping them with that automation. Intel, like other chipmakers, typically locates its factories in areas where it can get tax breaks to offset some of the outlay. HP Inc closure shows how easily tech jobs can vanish Data commissioner tells court US law fails to protect privacy HP Inc to shed almost 500 jobs as it shuts print facility in Leixlip “We’ve been working on this factory for several years. We’ve held off actually on doing this investment until now,” Mr Krzanich said from the Oval Office. “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US.” The investment will also indirectly generate about 7,000 jobs in support of the facility, Intel said. The plant in Chandler, when completed, will take its place among a worldwide network of Intel factories, which are also located in Ireland, Israel and China. Intel, one of the founding companies of California’s Silicon Valley, has held onto its 15 per cent market-leading slice of the $300 billion global chip industry through outspending rivals on research, development and plants over the years. Fab 42 has been celebrated by presidents before. In 2012, former president Barack Obama made a speech in front of the building, which was then going to benefit from $5 billion of investment. Presaging language Mr Krzanich used in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr Obama called it “a factory which will turn out some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth”. “The factory being built here behind me is an example of an America within reach,” Mr Trump’s predecessor called it at the time. “An America that attracts the next generation of manufacturing jobs.” Chip demand Intel’s decision to complete work on the plant now is likely based on industry dynamics. The company is under competitive pressure to move to more advanced production, and the factory was already built and just needed to be equipped. “Now this announcement tonight is probably because of the semiconductor demand we have alluded to in great detail in recent weeks, more than it is about Trumponomics,” said Neil Campling, the London-based head of global technology, media and telecom research at Northern Trust Securities. “In this industry, talk is cheap until the production ramps.” The California-based company has about 106,000 employees around the world, with half of them located in the US. The chipmaker’s staffing levels have stayed roughly unchanged through acquisitions. In April last year Mr Krzanich announced he would be eliminating 12,000 jobs, the company’s biggest cutbacks in a decade, prompted by slower growth amid a continuing slump in demand for personal computers, Intel’s biggest market.       Read More LSE and Deutsche Börse gamble over Brussels merger approval Why the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s case against Facebook matters Drone racing takes off as technology becomes more affordable Deloitte buys innovation consultancy Red Planet Internet of Things to become everyday reality with spending to jump to $2tn Facebook extends Safety Check feature for times of crisis Quarter of US tech workers perceive discrimination, survey finds Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy No crisis on Greece bailout deal, says euro zone finance chief Work Doing business in China: Meet face to face and mind your Ps and Qs International 1:51 Ireland ready for relaunch as Italy brace for backlash Innovation IBM and UCD in drive to perfect intelligent in-car assistant Sponsored Why a flagging libido doesn’t have to be part of your menopause experience Why buying into the Jaguar lifestyle has never been more affordable WebPort Global speeds up exports for Irish SMEs Suites for my sweet: 10 Irish getaways for Valentine’s ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Job losses in Leixlip but more positive news elsewhere 07:22 Eddie Hobbs, Brendan Investments and the disaster in Detroit 07:00 Piech adds to the drama at Volkswagen 05:35 ‘Irish Daily Mail’ publisher to launch new mobile-friendly news site 05:33 Oisín Fanning’s San Leon receives second Chinese approach 05:15 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Review: Does the new MacBook Pro live up to the hype?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump sits during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts From the New York Times, The completion of the factory, which will complement two other Intel semiconductor plants in Chandler, Ariz., had been under consideration for several years. Standing beside Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, said the company had decided to proceed now because of “the tax and regulatory policies we see the administration pushing forward.” Mr. Trump said: “The people of Arizona will be very happy. It’s a lot of jobs.” He said Intel called the White House several weeks ago to coordinate the announcement. That outreach illustrates the tightrope that Silicon Valley companies are walking as they deal with a president most of them did not want to see in office. Intel was one of over 100 companies that recently signed a legal document to challenge Trump’s Muslim travel ban, issued on January 27. That Trump executive order halted the entry into the United States of all refugees, immigrants, and green card holders from seven predominantly Muslim nations where the President does not have reported personal business interests. None of this is normal. None of this is okay. This is a crisis. Intel, you're not helping. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich (L) shakes hands with Gary Cohn (C), head of the National Economic Council and Reed Cordish, assistant for intragovernmental and technology initiatives, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts From an analysis of the meticulously choreographed PR stunt, over at WIRED: The photo-op played into Trump’s #AmericaFirst promise of more US manufacturing jobs, and the president didn’t waste time exploiting the PR moment. But everything was not as it looked. Intel’s plans have a lot less to do with Trump and a lot more to do with Intel trying to reinvent itself. If today’s event looked eerily familiar, that’s because Krzanich’s predecessor, Paul Otellini, originally announced the Arizona factory, known as Fab42, alongside President Obama in February 2011. At the time, Intel estimated the plant would open in 2013. In early 2014, the company confirmed that construction was indefinitely delayed. Krzanich, a longtime Trump supporter, credited the resurrected plan to the new president. “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the president pushing forward that make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US,” Krzanich said during the press conference.

Image Credit: REUTERS/Joshua Roberts (Reuters) – Intel chose the White House Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a $7 billion investment in a previously shelved Arizona factory, which it said would create 3,000 jobs when it is up and running. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told reporters about the investment while standing behind President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the “tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, promised during his campaign to push companies to keep or create jobs in the United States rather than sending them abroad. Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. The issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives. The company said in a statement that the plant would be completed in three or four years. The chip factory was started in 2011 as a $5 billion project that was targeted to open in late 2013. Intel shelved its plans in 2014 when smartphones and tablets cut into demand for chips for personal computers. Krzanich said in an email to Intel employees that was posted on the company’s website that the factory would build chips for data centers and smart devices. Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power data centers and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.

PHOTO: REUTERS US tech giant Intel unveiled plans Wednesday for a $7 billion chip factory in Arizona, in an announcement at the White House with President Donald Trump. While Trump appeared to take credit for the plan, Intel called the investment an “update” of a 2011 plan to invest $5 billion for the same facility in the southeastern US state. An Intel spokesman said the initial plan had not been completed due to lack of demand, and that Wednesday’s move represented a “new” investment of $7 billion. It marked the latest in a string of such announcements since Trump began pressing companies to create more American jobs and reverse the trend of offshore manufacturing. Technology firms to urge Trump to alter US travel ban: sources “Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the US and the majority of our research and development is here in the US, while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the US,” chief executive Brian Krzanich said at a White House event with Trump. The company said the Arizona plant would produce “the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet” and directly lead to 3,000 “high-tech, high-wage jobs” at Intel. With the indirect impact, the company said an estimated 10,000 jobs would result from the factory. Trump said Krzanich “called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced.” He called the investment a “great thing for Arizona,” and added, “it’s a lot of jobs.” Tech sector leads resistance to Trump travel ban Krzanich acknowledged that “we’ve been working on this factory for several years” but “held off actually doing this investment until now.” Asked if the decision came in response to the new president’s actions, he said, “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US.” The announcement came in spite of a deepening rift between the new Trump administration and the tech sector over a White House order barring entry to refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries.

By Vindu Goel / The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Intel, the world’s largest computer chip manufacturer, will invest $7 billion to build a new factory in Arizona, the company’s chief executive said Wednesday after meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House. The factory, which will complement two other factories that Intel has in Chandler, Ariz., has been under consideration for several years. But Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that the tax cuts and deregulatory policies pushed by Mr. Trump had prompted the company to move forward with its plans. “The people of Arizona will be very happy. It’s a lot of jobs,” Mr. Trump said at a White House event to announce the expansion. The new facility will build a new generation of chips with ultra-small circuitry and employ 3,000 additional people at its peak and indirectly create 10,000 jobs in the Arizona area in support of the factory, Intel said. “This factory will produce the most powerful computer chips on the planet,” Mr. Krzanich said. Although the company is based in California’s Silicon Valley, the majority of its global chip production is in Oregon and Arizona. It also has factories in other countries, including China and Israel. Mr. Trump was the second president to celebrate the computer chip maker’s attempts to expand its domestic production at the same facility in Chandler. In 2012, then-President Barack Obama went to the factory’s construction site and celebrated that the plant would produce “some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth.” “Let’s stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas,” Mr. Obama said at the time. “Let’s reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America.” The announcement comes as Intel has shed jobs. It announced last year that it planned to lay off 12,000 workers in a reorganization prompted by a decline in sales of personal computers. That was about 11 percent of the company’s workers. Since Mr. Trump’s election victory, numerous companies have announced plans to create or retain jobs in the U.S. Yet some analysts have said that many of those plans were in the works before the election or had come at significant cost to taxpayers. In November, air-conditioning company Carrier announced that it would keep hundreds of factory jobs in the U.S. that were slated to move to Mexico. While Mr. Trump celebrated the announcement as a win, later reporting revealed that Indiana had agreed to give the company up to $7 million in tax credits. In December, when Japanese corporate giant SoftBank said that it would invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs, analysts said that those funds probably would have been destined for the U.S. anyway.

It seems as if the lovely - but extremely expensive – new MacBook Pro was released only yesterday, but we’re now hearing more and more about new versions of Apple’s flagship laptop. Earlier this month, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple will release new Kaby Lake models of the MacBook Pro this year, and new code in the latest version of MacOS backs up his prediction. According to MacRumors, Apple blog  Pike's Universum has uncovered several bits of code in the macOS 10.12.4 beta that seem to point toward new laptops. The code refers to three new motherboards that don’t exist in any MacBook Pros at the moment, but use the same power management as the current models' identifiers in the OS code, all of which do not correspond to any existing models.

Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told reporters about the investment while standing behind President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the “tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, promised during his campaign to push companies to keep or create jobs in the United States rather than sending them abroad. Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. The issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives. The company said in a statement that the plant would be completed in three or four years. The chip factory was started in 2011 as a US$5 billion project that was targeted to open in late 2013. Intel shelved its plans in 2014 when smartphones and tablets cut into demand for chips for personal computers. Krzanich said in an email to Intel employees that was posted on the company’s website that the factory would build chips for data centres and smart devices. Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 per cent of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power data centres and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Intel gambit aims for position in post-PC world Intel’s new processors just made the PC exciting again Intel gestures towards the future (VIDEO) Slow demand for PC drags Intel sales numbers down Will your home soon have Intel Inside?

The factory will be in located Chandler, Arizona, the company said. Krzanich confirmed to CNBC News that the investment over the next three to four years would be to complete a previous plant, Fab 42, that was started and then left vacant. The 7 nanometer chips will be produced there will be “the most powerful computer chips on the planet”, Krzanich said in the Oval Office with the Trump administration. Most Intel manufacturing happens in the US, Krzanich said. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled US companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation,” Krzanich said in a statement. “Our factories support jobs – high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” After the announcement, Trump tweeted his thanks to Krzanich, calling the factory a great investment in jobs and innovation, CNBC News reported. The announcement comes as the technology industry has pushed back against the Trump administration, amid mounting pressure to move manufacturing jobs back to the US. However, the White House said that there will be no incentives from the federal government for the Intel project. Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. –IANS ksk Tags back innovation jobs White House CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts Trump's policies pose risk to Mexico's credit rating Feb 10th, 201704 Mexico City, Feb 11 (IANS) US President Donald Trump's potentially "disruptive changes to trade relations"...

The chipmaker said the factory, called Fab 42, will employ 3,000 when it opens in 2020 or 2021 - a decade after construction began and several years behind schedule. The Chandler, Arizona, plant will make chips using technology developed at Intel's new D1X research factory in Hillsboro. Wednesday's announcement represents a windfall of publicity for Intel and for President Donald Trump, who has been advocating new policies to boost domestic manufacturing and has touted a series of manufacturing investments from Ford Motor Co., air conditioner manufacturer Carrier and others since his election in November. "This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry," Krzanich said in a written statement. "We're very happy, and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy," Trump declared. However, chip industry analyst Jim McGregor said the changing political climate in Washington had nothing at all to do with Intel's decision to finally move ahead with the idle factory in Arizona. "Intel's fab strategy has been set for at least a decade," said McGregor, who works with TIRIAS Research in Arizona. Intel indicated that the new factory will make its forthcoming 7 nanometer microprocessor technology, two generations ahead of Intel's current processors. The timing of the Fab 42 opening means Intel will almost certainly develop that new technology in Hillsboro, where it has crafted each of its last several generations of processors. This is actually the second time an Intel chief stood next to a president and announced this factory. In 2011, former CEO Paul Otellini welcomed President Barack Obama to Hillsboro and promised a hiring and spending spree, including a $5 billion investment for the Arizona facility. Wednesday's announcement suggests Intel is finally making progress in deploying a new production technology, called extreme ultraviolet (EUV), which will enable smaller features on its microprocessors. That's a positive signal for Intel's operations in Oregon. The chipmaker built both Fab 42 and its new D1X research factory in Hillsboro to accommodate the enormous EUV manufacturing tools. Intel mothballed Fab 42 in 2014, in part, because it didn't need more production capacity as sales ebbed, and also because the EUV manufacturing technology wasn't ready for mass production. Recent signals suggest EUV is now close, making the new factory in Arizona and D1X in Oregon indispensable for Intel. Fab 42's arrival could mean changes at the chipmaker's other sites, though. "Although that's big news, I would expect you're going to see the closure of older fabs," McGregor said. The aging Fab 11x in New Mexico is in particular jeopardy; it has been several years since Intel upgraded it for contemporary manufacturing technologies. McGregor said the 15-year-old Fab 22 in Arizona could also close, at least temporarily, for a retrofit as Fab 42 comes online. "I wouldn't look at this as creating new jobs," McGregor said. "It's most likely the reshuffling of resources. Obviously the PC market isn't picking up." Intel eliminated 15,000 jobs last year to prepare for a long-term decline in the PC industry but ultimately posted strong financial results, buoyed by its robust data center business. For 2017, though, Intel forecasts very modest growth, and the company indicated last month that its expectations for the PC market are even worse than outside analysts' dismal forecasts. Still, other parts of Intel's business are expanding. And McGregor said it is possible Intel might be quietly preparing to buy other semiconductor companies, which would require more manufacturing capacity. Intel's shares were up 7 cents Wednesday morning, at $36.41. The company's stock is near a multiyear high. Krzanich was among the tech executives courting Trump during the presidential transition. He attended a summit at Trump Tower in New York and later joined the administration's new American Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. However, last week Krzanich denounced Trump's ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. And over the weekend Intel joined other tech companies that filed legal briefs opposing the executive order. In January, Krzanich said he had advised Trump against protectionist trade policies the new president has sometimes advocated. Unlike many large tech companies, Intel makes most of its technology in the United States. Krzanich said Wednesday that Intel sells 80 percent of its products overseas. Intel is one of the largest users of H1-B visas, which allow highly skilled workers from other countries to work in the U.S. Trump has suggested he may seek major changes to the program, though substantial reform would require congressional action. "When we disagree, we don't walk away," Krzanich said in a letter to employees Wednesday. "We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1-B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation. After his appearance at the White House, Krzanich is due back at corporate headquarters in California early Thursday morning for Intel's annual investor day. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

Trump was the second president to celebrate the computer chip maker's attempts to expand its domestic production at the same facility in Chandler, Arizona. In 2012, Obama went to the factory's construction site and celebrated that the plant would produce "some of the fastest and most powerful computer chips on Earth." "Let's stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas," Obama said at the time. "Let's reward companies like Intel that are investing and creating jobs right here in the United States of America." But by 2014, however, Intel had pulled back from finishing the factory. The company said Wednesday that it expects to open the plant known as "Fab 42" within four years. "We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand," said William Moss, an Intel spokesman. "We're making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business." Like Obama, Trump declared it a win for workers. "We're very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy," Trump said. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in an Oval Office visit with Trump that the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly -and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich said he made the announcement from the White House because "it's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward." But Intel has not been a universal fan of Trump's policies. It was among the tech companies that filed a legal brief that challenged the president's 90-day ban on travel to the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries. The announcement comes as Intel has shed jobs. It announced last year that it planned to lay off 12,000 workers in a reorganization prompted by a decline in sales of personal computers. That was about 11 percent of the company's workers. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

So what happens to those and other PC processors, like the A-series and FX, when AMD's new Ryzen chips start flooding the market in March? AMD has said the first high-end desktop Ryzen chips will ship in March. For now, AMD plans to make no changes to its lineup of existing chips, a company spokesman said. Instead, the chips will be regrouped to focus on price-sensitive PC buyers. Ryzen-based PCs are expected to be priced at a premium, competing with Intel's top gaming CPUs. The FX chips will not go away once Ryzen arrives, and will be targeted toward budget gamers. The A-series chips -- which were targeted toward a wide range of laptops -- will be much like Intel's Core i3, i5 and Celeron and Pentium processors, which are also targeted at low-end to mid-range laptops and Chromebooks. Unified AM4 socket compatibility helps maintain existing chips and has provided an easy path to Zen-based PC chip upgrade, the spokesman said. For example, the AM4 socket supports Zen chips and the recent 7th Generation A-series chips. Expanding the PC chip lineup will help AMD compete with Intel, from the high-end to low end. AMD is already gaining in the PC market. AMD took x86 chip market share from Intel in 2016. AMD had a 13.6 percent market share in 2016, growing from a 12.7 percent share in 2015. Intel's share was 86.3 percent in 2016, dropping from 87.1 percent in 2015, according to Mercury Research. Strong laptop chip shipments in the second half of 2016 and an inventory purge in 2015 helped AMD grow its market share, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The most vulnerable AMD chips are Athlon and Sempron, which sit on the bottom rung of the company's chip lineup.  Some brands like Phenom have died, but Athlon and Sempron have shown amazing staying power thanks to brand loyalty from home PC builders in Asia, McCarron said. Those chips will be hard to discontinue overnight, McCarron said. "Intel dealt with that in Asia on Pentium. Once it is established, they can't go away," McCarron said. Chips like the Athlon X4 and FX-4300 -- which is cheap to manufacture -- will keep serving customers' needs and will stay in production for some time to come, McCarron said. Also, PC makers need low-end products to segment markets and maintain prices. The price of high-end FX chips helps set a minimum price for Ryzen chips. It also helps retain Ryzen as a high-margin product, which is important for AMD in its pursuit of higher profitability. The low-end chips will also help keep AMD's chip volume active and meet supply agreements. AMD has an agreement with GlobalFoundries to manufacture a certain number of chips each year. Low-end chips are also important to manufacturing. They help amortize manufacturing costs and provide a market for chips with minor defects. It's fairly common for chips to get defects during manufacturing, and those are repackaged into low-end parts. That helps reduce inventory and produces revenue from those chips. AMD can't say it is getting rid of older chips because that would damage partnerships with PC makers and OEMs, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "They can't displace the entire product portfolio over night," McGregor said. But at some point, AMD will have to figure out which ones to chuck. It's likely the chips that are more expensive to manufacture will get the boot. Some chips like high-end FX parts could get the boot as Ryzen chips expand into lower-end gaming PCs. A decision to drop expensive chips and retain cheaper ones would be a cost-saving measure to reduce the manufacturing overhead. "You'll see the transition over the next nine to 12 months to move everything over," McGregor said. AMD has also released Zen-based server chips to succeed the current Opteron server chips. The company has seemingly put the development of ARM-based server chips on hold, and few server makers are using Opteron chips now. AMD will continue making embedded chips, which are used in devices with life spans of up to 10 years. Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

Evan Vucci AP Photo 1 of 5 i The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times EST): 8:40 p.m. The White House says President Donald Trump has written Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) to wish the "Chinese people a happy Lantern Festival and prosperous Year of the Rooster." The White House says Trump wrote Xi to thank him for a congratulatory letter and to express his hopes of developing "a constructive relationship that benefits both the United States and China." Before taking office, Trump questioned the "one-China policy" that shifted U.S. recognition from self-governing Taiwan to China in 1979. He said it was open to negotiation. Trump also wants to pressure Beijing to narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. ___ 6 p.m. First lady Melania Trump has named Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd as White House social secretary, putting her at the helm of the White House's social events, state dinners and other high-profile gatherings. Mrs. Trump says Niceta Lloyd — who goes by Rickie — brings "solid diplomatic, political and social entertaining experience" to the job. The White House says Niceta Lloyd has worked with both Republicans and Democrats in planning events for the last five presidential inaugurations. She's also assisted the State Department's Office of Protocol with events with several secretaries of state. Mrs. Trump has yet to move to Washington, but she is starting to fill out her staff. She's said she plans to stay in New York while the president's 10-year-old son, Barro, finishes the school year. ___ 5:30 p.m. Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee has told a Democratic senator that he found the president's attacks on the judiciary "disheartening" and "demoralizing." Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut disclosed the comments from Judge Neil Gorsuch after meeting with the nominee Wednesday. Trump referred to a Seattle judge who put a stay on his immigrant travel ban as a "so-called judge." Gorsuch's confirmation team confirmed that Gorsuch was referring to that comment and described it as disheartening. Gorsuch is making the rounds in the Senate, drawing praise from Republicans but skepticism from many Democrats, including Blumenthal. ___ 4:30 p.m. Republican Sen. John McCain isn't budging from his assessment that the U.S. raid in Yemen wasn't a success after he was criticized by the White House. McCain says any operation where a $75 million airplane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, "cannot be labeled a success." His remarks came after White House spokesman Sean Spicer said anyone who questions the success of the Yemen operation is doing a "disservice" to the life of Navy SEAL Ryan Owens. McCain recalled a failed 1970 mission to rescue U.S. service members held in North Vietnam. He says, "Any connection between success or failure and the heroism of men and women who serve, there is none." ___ 2:50 p.m. White House press secretary Sean Spicer says those who question the success of a deadly U.S. raid in Yemen are doing a "disservice" to the life of a Navy SEAL who was killed in the raid. The comments come after Arizona Sen. John McCain said Tuesday that he wouldn't describe the raid as a success, given the loss of American life. Spicer says the action taken in Yemen was a "huge success" and that any other characterization does a disservice to the life of Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL who was killed in the assault. Innocent civilians, including children, were also killed in the raid. Three other U.S. service members were wounded. ___ 2:15 p.m. A White House spokesman says President Donald Trump was standing up for his daughter when he posted a tweet criticizing Nordstrom. Trump tweeted that Ivanka Trump was treated "so unfairly" by the department store, which decided to stop selling her clothing and accessory line. White House spokesman Sean Spicer says Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter." Spicer says Trump is president — and "for people to take out their concern about his actions or executive orders on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Nordstrom did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about Trump's tweet. ___ 1:10 p.m. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich is at the White House and bringing the kind of economic news that President Donald Trump likes to trumpet: a $7 billion investment in an Intel factory in Arizona. The CEO says in an Oval Office visit with Trump that Intel will be completing the factory and making "the most advanced" chips on the planet." The CEO says the factory will employ about 3,000 workers directly — and 10,000 workers in Arizona in support of the factory. Krzanich says the announcement comes partly in response in part to Trump's tax and regulatory policies. Trump calls the product that Intel will be making is "amazing." ___ 12 p.m. The U.S. military is looking to rent space at Trump Tower for use when President Donald Trump is working in New York City. Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. J.B. Brindle says the Department of Defense is looking for the space "in order to meet official mission requirements." It's not immediately clear how much it would cost the Pentagon to rent space in the 58-story midtown Manhattan tower owned by the Trump Organization. Trump lives in the three-story penthouse. He hasn't returned to New York since taking office on Jan. 20. His wife, Melania, and their young son, Barron, are living there for now. It's customary for the military to obtain space near a president's residence. ___ 11:50 a.m. Organizations opposed to President Donald Trump's executive order on government regulations are suing to block it. The order required federal agencies to identify at least two existing regulations to repeal for every new regulation proposed or issued. The suit contends the order exceeds the president's constitutional authority — and directs agencies to unlawfully repeal rules intended to protect the health and safety of Americans, and the environment. Filing suit are Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, the Communications Workers of America and the Natural Resources Defense Council. ___ 11:25 a.m. President Donald Trump isn't happy about Nordstrom's decision to stop selling Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories — and he's tweeting his criticism. Trump says his daughter has "been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom." The president says she's "a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Nordstrom said last week that it would stop selling Ivanka Trump merchandise. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance of the first daughter's brand. Nordstrom hasn't immediately responded to an email seeking comment. Ivanka Trump has formally stepped down from her leadership role with the brand. ___ 9:57 a.m. President Donald Trump is promising "zero tolerance" for violence against law enforcement officers. He tells a group of police chiefs that his administration will give their departments the resources to recruit and retain officers. Trump also says "no one in America should be punished" simply for growing up in a place where violence may be prevalent. And as he has done before, he's singling out Chicago, saying the level of violence in the city cannot be allowed to continue. He says "we've allowed too many young lives to be claimed." When it comes to people who may be living illegally in the United States and involved in criminal activity, the president wants law enforcement and the public to report them to the Department of Homeland Security. In his words — "I want you to turn in the bad ones." ___ 9:40 a.m. President Donald Trump is asserting that had the right to enact his travel ban. He tells a group of police chiefs that his immigration order was "done for the security of our nation." He says the provision supporting the order was written "beautifully" and was within his executive authority. Trump says "a bad high school student would understand this." A federal judge has put the ban on hold, and an appeals court is considering an appeal from the Trump administration. The order includes a temporary travel ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. While awaiting a decision, Trump says "courts seem to be so political." ___ 7:55 a.m. President Donald Trump is expected to have lunch Thursday with a group of moderate Senate Democrats who could play a key role in his legislative agenda. The lunch is expected to include Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana. Trump faces a narrow Republican majority in the Senate and hopes to secure some support among Democrats for his agenda and the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch. All four Senate Democrats face re-election in 2018. The lunch was first reported by USA Today and confirmed by the Senate offices. The White House did not immediately provide details on the lunch, which is also expected to include Republican lawmakers. __ 7: 24 a.m. President Donald Trump is tweeting that if he loses the pending court case over his travel ban, the country "can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled." The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing the appeal of Trump's executive order on immigration, including a temporary travel ban on those from seven Muslim-majority countries. The appeals court challenged the administration's claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but it also questioned an attorney's argument that it unconstitutionally targeted Muslims. The president tweeted early Wednesday, "If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!"

Nordstrom said Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories.

Sessions survived a near-party-line vote, 52-47, the latest sign of the extreme partisanship at play as Trump strains to install his Cabinet. No Republicans broke ranks in their support of a colleague who will become the nation's top law enforcement official after two decades in the Senate.

More videos Jeff Sessions confirmed as next U.S. Attorney General The U.S. Senate votes to confirm Republican Senator Jeff Sessions as the next attorney general of the United States. But the confirmation process -- ferocious even by the slumping standards of decorum that have defined the body's recent years -- laid bare the Senate's deep divisions at the outset of the Trump presidency. At the same time, the latest star turn for Warren rekindled the gender-infused politics that animated the presidential election and the women's march protesting Trump the day after his inauguration last month. Democrats spent the hours before the vote on Wednesday seething over the treatment of Warren, who had been barred from speaking on the floor the previous night. Late Tuesday, Republicans voted to formally silence Warren after the senator read from a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King that criticised Sessions for using "the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens" while serving as a federal prosecutor in Alabama. Related Content Warren goes viral after being blocked from reading Coretta Scott King letter Donald Trump's showdown with America's courts on the horizon Since Trump announced his choice for attorney general, Sessions' history with issues of race had assumed centre stage. A committee hearing on his nomination included searing indictments from black Democratic lawmakers like Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights icon, and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who broke with Senate tradition to testify against a peer. For weeks, Republicans have rejected any suggestion that Sessions cannot be trusted on civil rights, arguing that he had been tarnished unfairly over accusations of racial insensitivity that have dogged him since the 1980s. Advertisement "Everybody in this body knows Senator Sessions well, knows that he is a man of integrity, a man of principle," Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said during the debate on Wednesday afternoon. The "twisting" of Sessions' record offended him, he said, even as Democrats continued their attacks on the nominee. As the 84th attorney general, Sessions brings a sharply conservative bent to the Justice Department and its 113,000 employees. A former prosecutor, he promises a focus aligned with Trump in pushing a "law and order" agenda that includes tougher enforcement of laws on immigration, drugs and gun trafficking.

Advocates point to his history of votes against various civil rights measures, as well as the accusations of racial insensitivity. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, said on Wednesday that on civil rights, immigration, abortion, criminal sentencing guidelines and a range of other issues, Sessions had been far outside the mainstream and had pushed "extreme policies" often targeting minorities.

The widow of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., King wrote the letter in response to Sessions' 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship, for which he was ultimately rejected in part because of accusations that he had been insensitive to minorities as a prosecutor.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Klint Finley. Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 02.08.17. 02.08.17 Time of Publication: 7:45 pm. 7:45 pm Intel’s ‘New’ Factory Isn’t About Trump—It’s About Fixing Intel President Donald Trump greets Brian Krzanich (L), the chief executive of Intel, at the White House on February 8, 2017. DOUG MILLS/The New York Times/Redux Intel CEO Brian Krzanich promised $7 billion today to resume construction of a chip factory near Phoenix that could one day employ 3,000 people. But he didn’t make the announcement at the job site or on stage during a Silicon Valley keynote. Instead, Krzanich stood in the Oval Office holding a sheet of microchips next to President Trump. The photo-op played into Trump’s #AmericaFirst promise of more US manufacturing jobs, and the president didn’t waste time exploiting the PR moment. But everything was not as it looked. Intel’s plans have a lot less to do with Trump and a lot more to do with Intel trying to reinvent itself. If today’s event looked eerily familiar, that’s because Krzanich’s predecessor, Paul Otellini, originally announced the Arizona factory, known as Fab42, alongside President Obama in February 2011. At the time, Intel estimated the plant would open in 2013. In early 2014, the company confirmed that construction was indefinitely delayed. Krzanich, a longtime Trump supporter, credited the resurrected plan to the new president. “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the president pushing forward that make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the US,” Krzanich said during the press conference. Related Stories Intel Looks to a New Chip to Power the Coming Age of AI PC Sales Are Up in the US! But Don’t Expect a Great Comeback OpenAI Joins Microsoft on the Cloud’s Next Big Front: Chips But the “new” plant, assuming it’s actually finished this time, doesn’t exactly represent a resurgence in domestic investment. Intel was in a very different place when it first announced Fab42. The company posted record sales in 2010. It had billions in cash on hand to invest in new facilities like Fab42 and its D1X research center in Oregon. Otellini promised to hire 4,000 people in the US. But by 2014, Intel’s revenue was flat due in part to falling demand for its PC chips as both consumers and businesses spent more mobile devices—a gadget wave Intel missed. The company announced plans to layoff 5,000 people that year. Intel broke its 2010 sales record last year. But it also announced that it would layoff 12,000 people worldwide. The company wouldn’t say how many people it will lay off in the US, but about half of its workforce is based in the US. An Intel spokesperson says it made the decision to resume construction on Fab42 this year thanks to projected growth and that Intel had not received any new tax incentives for the project (though it has received incentives from the state of Arizona in the past). The company’s woes, meanwhile, are far more directly tied to its failure to anticipate the market for mobile chips than to taxes or regulations. Intel says Fab42 will support a seven nanometer manufacturing process, enabling the company to squeeze more transistors onto its chips than ever before. It will need that boost in technology as it tries to figure out its place in a post-PC world. Standard PC chips still account for a large volume of Intel’s sales, but depending on PCs is not a sustainable plan for the future. Intel is now seeking to cement control of the data center chip market and to own the burgeoning market for chips to power artificially intelligent gear like self-driving cars and that swarm of drones you saw during Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl performance. In 2015, Intel spent $16.7 billion on Altera, a company that reprogrammable chips used by companies like Microsoft to power AI applications in the cloud. Last year, Intel spun off security company McAfee, which it acquired for $7.68 billion in 2010, and acquired Movidius, a company that specialized in creating chips specifically designed for AI. To manage all that re-engineering of its chips—and its business—Intel needs factories close to home. Unlike the gadgets they power, chips are complicated enough to demand a closely monitored manufacturing process that has long kept Intel’s chip-making a US-bound operation. Trump may want to chalk up Intel’s decision as a win for his presidency. But it’s Intel that really needs the win. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

But at a hearing on Wednesday night in Sydney, the committee accepted the 26-year-old's ignorance and deep remorse over his words, caught on camera following Victory's controversial 2-1 win over City. They also took into account the fact he had met Berisha personally on Tuesday to apologise, and praised City for taking immediate steps to address the situation with Victory.

"You should think yourself fortunate to have got the minimum in the circumstances, and you can never count on that happening ever again," Marshall said. Advertisement Bouzanis accepted the sanction, meaning he would sit out until City's round-24 away clash with Western Sydney and likely be replaced by Thomas Sorensen. "I'm grateful to have been able to present my case and I'd like to apologise to Berisha and the football community," he said afterwards.

During the 40-minute hearing, City chief executive Scott Munn recounted the moment he found Bouzanis in the changing rooms after Saturday's fiery match and explained the severity of what he'd said. Munn said Bouzanis had been under the impression the word "gypsy" was nothing more than a swear word or something akin to "bogan". But he became extremely anxious and regretful after learning its other meaning and sought to apologise to Berisha immediately, which Victory deemed inappropriate on the night. Bouzanis' absence further ravages City's already massively depleted squad for Saturday's crunch clash with Brisbane at AAMI Park. Tim Cahill has a one-game ban for swearing, while defender Michael Jakobsen is injured and captain Bruno Fornaroli, Muscat, Osama Malik, Luke Brattan and Fernando Brandan will all serve one-week suspensions due to an accumulation of yellow cards.

The rebuke comes as UN officials dealing with almost 70,000 Rohingya who have fled to Bangladesh refugee camps expressed concern the outside world has not fully grasped the severity of the crisis unfolding in Myanmar's western Rakhine State, home to almost one million Rohingya, who are denied basic rights, including citizenship in the country where they have lived for generations. "The talk until now has been of hundreds of deaths. This is probably an underestimation – we could be looking at thousands," a UN official told Reuters.

They slit his throat, says witness The pope expressed concern about the plight of Rohingya in 2015 but his latest comments are his strongest yet on the issue, and will intensify pressure on Myanmar's military to end a brutal crackdown in Rakhine, following attacks on several border police posts last October. Francis said the Rohingya have been "thrown out of Myanmar, moved from one place to another because no one wants them." Advertisement "But they are good people, peaceful people. They are not Christian….they are our brothers and sisters," he said. The UN released a devastating report on February 3 detailing atrocities that it concluded raised serious concern that "ethnic cleansing" was underway to force Rohingya from Myanmar, the country also known as Burma.

Among the atrocities was the slitting of a baby's throat as he cried out for his mother's milk while she was being gang raped.

On Wednesday, Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a  statement saying it was "deeply concerned" about the "very serious" allegations detailed in the UN report" and said the country would "spare no effort to take legal action against any perpetrators if there is clear evidence of human rights abuses."

Ms Suu Kyi, who led her National League for Democracy to a landslide victory at elections in late 2015, has been widely criticised for failing to protect the Rohingya in the Buddhist majority country since violence erupted in Rakhine in 2012, displacing more than 100,000 from their homes. For decades she stood up to despotic generals who ruled the country under brutal repression for half a century, winning admiration as democracy champion. But observers in Myanmar believe she still has no control over the military which controls key security ministries.  Ultra-Buddhist nationalists regard Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh who have no cultural or religious links to the Myanmar. Meanwhile, foreign diplomats and non-government-organisations are alarmed at reports that Bangladesh plans to move tens of thousands of Rohingya from refugee camps at the border with Myanmar to low-lying islands off-shore. "You don't put 100,000 people on an island where there is today nothing…without any preparation. It's terrible," a diplomat was quoted as saying in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka.

Intel's Open-Source Driver Stack Now OpenGL 4.5 Certified, Complements Vulkan & GLES Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 6 February 2017 at 03:01 PM EST. 20 Comments Intel's open-source Mesa DRI driver has passed The Khronos Group's process for certifying it as a conformant OpenGL 4.5 implementation. This now rounds out the Intel open-source Linux stack with OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2, and Vulkan 1.0 certification. Intel's open-source Linux driver stack has managed the trifecta of certification from The Khronos Group for graphics: OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2, and Vulkan 1.0. This cannot be said for any other vendor with a completely open driver stack: AMD hasn't certified their open-source driver offerings, Nouveau hasn't yet reached GL/GLES certification though they are working on it with the X.Org Foundation acting as the entity behind it plus they don't yet have a Vulkan driver, and there isn't yet any other vendor with a fully-open driver stack covering multiple areas. Perhaps we'll see Freedreno and Raspberry Pi VC4 reach it one day. When it comes to proprietary drivers on Linux, NVIDIA has this certification too. This milestone today is about formal OpenGL 4.5 certification from The Khronos Group where as previously they had exposed OpenGL 4.5 support in Mesa but they hadn't been through the formal process until ensuring the OpenGL Conformance Test Suite fully-passes. Unrelated, The Khronos Group recently open-sourced their conformance test suite. Imad Sousou of the Intel Open-Source Technology Center announced this grand accomplishment today on 01.org. Splendid job to all those involved. Hopefully their next area of focus will be on OpenCL certification for Beignet, which recently hit OpenCL 2.0. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Speaking from the president’s side in the Oval Office, Krzanich said that the facility, called Fab 42, would employ 3,000 people at its peak and indirectly create 10,000 jobs in the Arizona area in support of the factory. In remarks to the news media, Trump said Intel is a “great, great company” and a “great thing for Arizona.” “Brian called a few weeks ago and said, ‘We want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced,’ ” Trump said. Advertisement Continue reading In his remarks, Krzanich echoed the president’s broader economic message of employing Americans and increasing exports rather than imports. “Intel is very proud of the fact that a majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S. and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S.,” Krzanich said. Krzanich said the company decided to make the announcement in response to Trump’s business-friendly policies on taxes and regulation. But some analysts raised the question of whether Intel would have made the investment sooner or later. “This would have happened anyway. This was always part of their plan,” said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research in Phoenix. “But obviously, the current administration and Intel are going to try to get some political gain out of it.” McGregor said the announcement was a positive sign for Intel but not a significant strategy or policy change. He described Intel and other chipmakers as having a rotation cycle in which they periodically update, build and shutter facilities. The Chandler facility was built years ago, but Intel postponed its opening in 2014 amid decreased global demand for its products, the Portland Oregonian reported at the time. For years, the factory has been an empty shell while Intel focused on its other facilities. It is not clear when Intel planned to bring the Chandler facility online, but the company probably would have completed its investment at some point, McGregor said. As Intel invests in Arizona, it’s also likely to retire older facilities in other areas – including perhaps a factory in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, McGregor said. The Chandler facility will be completed in three to four years, a company announcement said. Advertisement Continue reading Krzanich, in his remarks, said that Intel had been working on the factory for several years but had “held off actually doing this investment until now.” In response to a question from the news media, he said Intel decided to make its announcement in support of the Trump administration’s tax and regulatory policies, which “really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” Krzanich also took aim at past government policies, saying Intel had been able to achieve its success despite regulatory and tax policies that “disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world.” “The president and the administration’s commitment to tax reform, smart regulation and deregulation, and a general attitude of ‘make it in America’ has given them the confidence and the will to move forward,” said Reed Cordish, a Trump assistant. Pointing out that the product was high-tech, cutting-edge technology, Cordish added, “It’s a wonderful statement for where we’re heading, bringing manufacturing back to America, creating 21st-century jobs in America and the feeling of optimism and confidence that CEOs all over the country are showing and a validation of the president’s policies and views.” Intel joined more than 100 companies to file a legal brief opposing Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order, which barred entrants to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries. In a letter to employees Wednesday about the investment, Krzanich briefly mentioned the controversy. “When we disagree, we don’t walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation.” Since Trump’s election victory, numerous companies have announced plans to create or retain jobs in the United States. Yet some analysts have said that many of those plans were in the works before the election or had come at significant cost to taxpayers. In November, air-conditioning company Carrier announced that it would keep hundreds of factory jobs in the United States that were slated to move to Mexico. While Trump celebrated the announcement as a win, later reporting revealed that Indiana had agreed to give the company up to $7 million in tax credits. In December, when Japanese corporate giant SoftBank said that it would invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs, analysts said that those funds probably would have been destined for the United States anyway. Intel’s stock rose after the announcement but pared gains before the market closed. The stock ended the day up 0.08 percent, underperforming overall gains by the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index.

"My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" he tweeted. Last week, Nordstrom, the Seattle-based retail giant, told The Seattle Times it would no longer carry Ivanka Trump's line of clothing and accessories. ADVERTISEMENT Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser to President Trump. She does not have an official role within the White House but is among the most influential people in her father's inner circle. Nordstrom said the decision to drop Ivanka Trump's line was based on sales performance. Here's more from The Hill's Jonathan Easley: http://bit.ly/2kUuNR0. Nordstrom's stock gains over 4 percent for the day: Nordstrom's stock went up by more than 4 percent Wednesday after President Trump fired off a tweet criticizing it for discontinuing Ivanka Trump's brands of clothing and other merchandise. Nordstrom's stock dipped -0.5 percent immediately after Trump's morning tweet calling it "terrible" for treating his daughter, Ivanka, "so unfairly." However, the stock fully recovered within four minutes, and closed out the day up 4.1 percent, MarketWatch reported. The Hill's Jennifer Calfas has more here: http://bit.ly/2lpTiCC Obama ethics czar: Trump's Nordstrom tweet an 'abuse' of presidency: Trump's tweet about Nordstrom added another spark to the long debate over the president and his family's business ties.

The company will use the $7 billion to complete its Fab 42 factory in Chandler, Ariz., Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a meeting at the White House with President Trump. Krzanich said the decision to make the announcement with the White House was borne out of Intel's support for Trump's economic and trade policies. "We support the Administration's policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies," Krzanich wrote in an email to Intel employees. The Hill's Ali Breland tells us more: http://bit.ly/2kUklsE. Judge blocks Anthem-Cigna merger: A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the proposed $48 billion merger of two of the nation's largest health insurers, Anthem and Cigna. The move is the second recent large health insurance merger to be blocked recently, following a judge stopping the merger of Aetna and Humana last month. The judge on Wednesday blocked the merger citing a reduction in competition that would occur in the market for employer-sponsored health insurance. The blocking of the two mergers is a win for consumer advocates who argued the combinations of the large insurance companies would harmfully reduce competition. When the mergers were announced last year, Republicans argued that pressures from ObamaCare were forcing the consolidation.

Dems: Don't repeal offshore tax rules: Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee are urging their colleagues to oppose a resolution that would repeal Obama administration rules aimed at curbing offshore tax deals. "These regulations are intended to combat aggressive corporate tax planning techniques that, rather than serving an economic purpose, are used by some corporations to avoid taxes," the Democratic tax-writers wrote in a letter Wednesday to their colleagues. The letter comes after Rep. Todd Rokita (R-Ind.) introduced a resolution last week to use the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of the rules, which the Treasury Department finalized in October. A vote on Rokita's resolution has not yet been announced, but in recent weeks, the House has approved several resolutions to undo recent Obama-era regulations.

It was most recently set for Tuesday but delayed last week to give Puzder time to separate himself from CKE, which owns the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast food chains. Puzder's nomination has stirred criticism because of his views on issues such as sick leave and overtime pay for workers: http://bit.ly/2kUjuZ1. Group questions whether CFPB chief broke records laws: A watchdog group says the chief of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) might have violated federal records laws by not preserving work-related text messages. The Cause of Action Institute told CFPB Director Richard Cordray he may have violated federal records laws in a letter sent Wednesday. They say work-related text messages sent by Cordray from a personal cell phone, as first reported by The Daily Caller, may not have been archived according to federal regulations. The Daily Caller reported in January that Cordray had sent several text messages to CFPB employees related to CFPB work from a personal cell phone. Under federal law, government employees can conduct work on private devices as long as they preserve records of that work with their employer: http://bit.ly/2kUzf21. Rural Republicans question using private cash to fix infrastructure: Rural Republicans are expressing serious doubt that private financing -- the funding tool favored by conservatives and the White House -- could fix the infrastructure needs in their communities. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee convened a hearing on Wednesday to get input from transportation leaders from rural regions as lawmakers and the new administration assemble an infrastructure package.  "Funding solutions that involve public-private partnerships, as have been discussed by administration officials, may be innovative solutions for crumbling inner cities, but do not work for rural areas," Chairman John BarrassoJohn BarrassoOvernight Finance: Trump attacks Nordstrom | Judge blocks Anthem-Cigna merger | Trump, Intel tout B investment | Labor pick gets hearing date | Feds grant easement for Dakota pipeline Rural Republicans question using private cash to fix infrastructure Dems seek new targets post-DeVos MORE (R-Wyo.) said.

Feds grant final easement for Dakota Access pipeline: Federal officials have granted the easement necessary for construction of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. The Army Corps of Engineers announced Wednesday night it had given Dakota Access developers the easement they need to lay an oil pipeline under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River south of Bismarck. The 1.25-mile span is the most contentious segment of the 1,170-mile pipeline route, because a local tribe says the pipeline threatens its drinking water supplies there. Pipeline supporters have hailed the decision to build the stretch of the project, with a company lawyer saying this week work on the pipeline could be complete in two months and oil could begin moving through the $3.8 million pipeline within 80 days. But the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has vowed to fight the project, as it has since last summer. The tribe could go to court to challenge the easement again, arguing the Trump administration improperly dismissed an environmental review of the project that Obama officials kicked off in December. The Hill's Devin Henry has more here: http://bit.ly/2lpVc6f Ex-officials try to pitch carbon tax to GOP: A team of Republican former high-ranking government officials is pitching the GOP on a carbon tax. The group, which includes people such as former Secretary of State James Baker, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulsen and former Secretary of State George Schultz, rolled out their plan Wednesday and are meeting with Trump White House officials on the proposal. They're pitching the idea as a "repeal and replace" plan, like what the GOP is attempting to do with ObamaCare. The group of establishment Republicans, which calls itself the Climate Leadership Council, is urging President Trump and Congress to institute a carbon tax and simultaneously remove nearly all of former President Barack Obama's climate change regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan. The Hill's Timothy Cama explains: http://bit.ly/2kUlrVq. Republicans working with CBO on ObamaCare bill: House Republicans have been working with the Congressional Budget Office on parts of an ObamaCare replacement that they could include in a repeal bill this spring, lobbyists and aides tell The Hill. They have been working with the CBO, Congress's nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, on the details of tax credits, high-risk pool funding, and changes to Medicaid that could be included in a repeal bill that Republicans hope to pass by the end of March. The bill will use the fast-track process known as reconciliation to avoid a filibuster by Senate Democrats.

The Fed announced Wednesday that Scott Alvarez, the central bank's general counsel, would be stepping down later this year after 36 years at the institution. "Scott advised successive Chairs, including myself, with deep expertise and utmost integrity," said Chair Janet L. Yellen in a statement. "I am enormously grateful for his wise counsel, calmness and good humor during times of stress, and, above all, his intense dedication to the public interest served by the Federal Reserve." Alvarez served as the head of the Fed's Legal Division for 12 years, meaning he served as the top legal expert for both Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. During that time, Alvarez helped the Fed navigate the financial crisis and resulting bailouts, as well as the implementation of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law: http://bit.ly/2kUhMHa.   Write us with tips, suggestions and news: slane@thehill.com, vneedham@thehill.com, pschroeder@thehill.com, and njagoda@thehill.com.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking By By Roberta Rampton, Reuters Feb 8, 2017 at 5:19 pm | Print View WASHINGTON — Intel Corp chose the White House Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a $7 billion investment in a previously shelved Arizona factory, which it said would create 3,000 jobs when it is up and running. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told reporters about the investment while standing behind President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the “tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, promised during his campaign to push companies to keep or create jobs in the United States rather than sending them abroad. Intel was one of more than 100 companies that joined together to file a legal brief opposing Trump’s temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority nations. The issue did not come up during the Oval Office meeting, said Reed Cordish, a White House official in charge of technology initiatives. The company said in a statement that the plant would be completed in three or four years. The chip factory was started in 2011 as a $5 billion project that was targeted to open in late 2013. Intel shelved its plans in 2014 when smartphones and tablets cut into demand for chips for personal computers. Krzanich said in an email to Intel employees that was posted on the company’s website that the factory would build chips for data centers and smart devices. Intel announced less than a year ago that it would cut up to 12,000 jobs globally, or 11 percent of its workforce, as it refocused its business towards microchips that power data centers and Internet connected devices and away from the declining personal computer industry it helped found.

The plant in Chandler, where Arizona has long had manufacturing operations, will make computer chips. Intel said the opening of the factory will lead to 3,000 “high-tech, high-wage jobs” and will create more than 10,000 long-term jobs in Arizona. Intel, which has its headquarters in Santa Clara, announced 12,000 layoffs across the company last year. The construction of the plant, Fab 42, was nearly finished several years ago, but was put on hold because of changing market conditions. The work to finish the plant, expected to take two to three years, is convenient timing for a company looking to forge connections with a new administration that is largely focused on keeping jobs in the U.S. Intel was one of about 100 companies that filed a legal brief this weekend opposing Trump’s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. According to a White House Pool report, when asked by Reuters why Intel is making this announcement at the White House, Krzanich said: “It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.” Chipmakers like Intel stand to benefit from tax credits on purchases of manufacturing equipment, for example. Workplace Facebook adds family benefits Companies have been offering ever-longer paid parental leaves to lure or retain younger workers: Six weeks for new moms at Starbucks. Six months for both new moms and dads at Etsy. Up to a year at Netflix. But expansive benefits for new parents have overshadowed the many caregiving responsibilities of other workers: Parents with sick grade-school children. Single employees who need to help with a parent’s critical illness. Anyone — male or female, young or old — grieving after the death of a close family member. A new policy at Facebook looks to change that. On Tuesday, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg announced that employees at the Menlo Park company will receive up to 20 days of bereavement leave in the event of a family member’s death, six weeks of paid leave to care for an ill relative and three days of paid family sick time to help out with a short-term illness. “This is personal for me,” said Sandberg, whose husband died two years ago, at a women’s leadership conference where she and Facebook human resources executive Lori Goler announced the news. It’s also practical for achieving the kind of goals that Sandberg’s “Lean In” book and project are trying to advance for women’s empowerment. For one, women continue to disproportionately bear the responsibilities of caring for sick children or parents, even when they work full time. A leave policy that gives employees paid time off for those needs helps women remain in the workforce and continue to advance in their jobs. Beverages Cuervo sets IPO price Snapchat’s parent might be the most prominent company to seek an initial public offering this year. But until it begins trading, that honor will briefly belong to Jose Cuervo. The world’s biggest Tequila maker will sell shares at between 30 and 34 pesos in its offering Wednesday, seeking up to $742 million.

The 70-year-old businessman and political novice wrapped up his third week in the Oval Office with a bruising defeat after the courts upheld a freeze on his travel ban targeting refugees and travellers from seven mostly-Muslim nations — his most emblematic measure to date. Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip approach to high office has fired up a despondent political opposition with a new sense of purpose as huge segments of US society rally in “resistance” to his presidency. Millions of Americans have filled the streets in protest at his plans to “make America great again,” while his brash forays into global diplomacy have rattled key allies from Australia to Germany. When Trump delivered his election victory speech in November, it seemed — for a fleeting moment — he would work to pull the country back together after a bitterly divisive campaign. It has since become clear that Trump has chosen to speak to the loyal base of Americans who backed his insurgent bid for the White House — and to them alone. That decision is grounded in the unflinching support Trump still enjoys among his core supporters, even as his approval rating among Americans at large sits at record lows. As political strategies go, it’s a risky one — all the more so since he is now locked in what is sure to be an arduous legal battle over his clampdown on immigration in the name of national security. Thursday’s decision by an appellate court in San Francisco, upholding a lower court suspension on the controversial decree, was a major blow to the president. The case is now likely to wind up before the Supreme Court. Trump’s camp was at pains to stress — with reason — that the ruling concerned only the temporary stay on his executive order, not the constitutionality of the ban itself. But it carries heavy symbolic weight, as does the fact that the appellate panel’s three judges were appointed both by Republican and Democratic leaders: Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” a defiant Trump quickly tweeted after the ruling, in one of the all-caps tweets he uses to convey anger and exasperation. ‘Venom’ Trump is far from the first US president to be thwarted by the courts. But his angry, personal response to the ruling — and his virulent attacks on the judiciary in the run-up to it — have astonished even observers accustomed to his daily Twitter outbursts targeting everyone from political foes to the media to television celebrities. In a New York Times editorial entitled “Trump’s Leading Rivals Wear Robes,” Charles Blow recalled that Obama had also spoken out strongly against a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that paved the way for unlimited political spending by corporations. Obama was brutally criticised at the time, even though his objections were confined to “the ruling itself and not impugning in any way the character or qualifications of the justices who rendered it,” Blow noted. “But it is impossible to argue that his judicial rebuke, which looks quaint in retrospect, comes anywhere close to the venom Donald Trump is spewing at the judicial branch,” he wrote. “The only courts or press that Trump sees as legitimate are those that bow to his will.” ‘Larger man inside?’ After the real estate mogul’s upset win over Hillary Clinton, Obama was at pains to stress — perhaps to reassure a shell-shocked Democratic camp — that the sheer gravity of the world’s most powerful job necessarily changed a man. One thing is certain at this point: so far, the presidency has not changed Trump. At least part of his White House team seems determined to replicate word-for-word the recipe that propelled Trump to victory, rolled out in rally after giant rally from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania. “Part of the reason the president got elected is because he speaks his mind,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday. “He doesn’t hold it back, he’s authentic, and he’s not going to sit back.” It remains to be seen whether the turmoil of Trump’s first three weeks in power — and the small but growing number of dissenting voices in his Republican camp — will lead him to change course, or adapt his tone. For the writer and long-time US radio host Garrison Keillor, the answer is in little doubt. “What we know so far is that the man is who he is,” Keillor wrote recently in The Chicago Tribune. “There is no larger, finer man inside him trying to get out.”  “Everyone who is paying attention knows this.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week China gets an early win off Trump, but many battles remain Shallow quake hits southern Taiwan Tourist critically injured in Hong Kong subway arson attack Trump warns Iran president he ‘better be careful’ India’s Modi faces biggest election test since 2014 landslide Brazil deploys troops to city with no police Melania Trump suit alleges escort claims cost her 'millions' (VIDEO) French leaders try to stem fury over alleged police rape Obama enjoys watersports with Virgin chief on luxury island (VIDEO) Iran leader rebuffs Trump warning, says he shows America’s ‘real face’ Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform China gets an early win off Trump, but many battles remain Hundreds of immigrants arrested in ‘routine’ US enforcement surge Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) 13564 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump has quietly signed an executive order changing the order of succession in the Department of Justice, reversing an executive order by President Obama signed just last month. The order appears to be the first that Trump has not signed in a public ceremony. It's dated Thursday — the same day Attorney General Jeff Sessions was sworn in — but was not posted to the White House website until Friday morning. The White House did not explain the discrepancy. The executive order spells out who will act as the nation's highest law enforcement officer if the attorney general dies, resigns or becomes incapacitated. Such orders have been routine since the 2001 terrorist attacks, but Trump's is notable becomes it comes two weeks after he fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to defend his executive order banning travelers from seven predominately Muslim countries. That time, Trump went outside the official order of succession — as he has the right to do — to elevate Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to acting attorney general. Because the Senate has not confirmed any other top Justice Department officials, Boente will continue to be second in the line of succession under Trump's order, followed by Zachary Fardon, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, and Tammy Dickinson, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Missouri. Seven days before he left office, President Obama changed the order of succession without explanation to remove Boente from the list. Obama's order had listed U.S. attorneys in the District of Columbia, the Northern District of Illinois and the Central District of California. The top positions remain unchanged: the deputy attorney general, the associate attorney general and — at the discretion of the attorney general — the solicitor general and other assistants. But because those positions are now officially vacant, the order currently skips to the Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys.

 Trump's plan to make Wall Street unregulated again won't go unchallenged Pedro Nicolaci da Costa Feb. 9, 2017, 12:44 PM 2,095 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump sits during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Self-regulation is so 1990s. But US President Donald Trump wants to bring it back, betting Americans have short enough memories that they will forget that the new rules were put into place to protect them, however imperfectly, from a repeat of the devastating 2008 financial crisis. Given public views of Wall Street and the makeup of Congress, however, he may have some difficulty in removing those rules. The latest reason he offered for the need to roll back post-crisis reform was, as Slate’s Jordan Weissmann put it, “hilariously flimsy.” “We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank because, frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, who have nice businesses who can’t borrow money. They just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow, because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,” Trump said at a meeting with CEOs last week. There is little evidence of a credit crunch in the US economy. But whatever Trump's motivations, we know, thanks to this handy breakdown from my colleague Frank Chaparro, what areas he and the Republican-controlled Congress intend to target. These include taking a more hands-off approach to banks considered too-big-to-fail and a roll back of the “Volcker rule” intended to prevent investment banks from gambling with customers’ money. However, even though bank shareholders have salivated at the prospect of a return to the heyday of Wild West Wall Street, bidding stock prices higher, there are still more questions than answers. Sean Tuffy, head of regulatory intelligence at Brown Brothers Harriman, has gone through a useful mental exercise that helps shed some light on what might happen — and what might not. In particular, Tuffy is skeptical that deregulation will simply sail through Congress given popular discontent with big banks and the fact that Trump himself ran for office on an anti-Wall Street platform. Now that he is being advised by several former Goldman Sachs bankers, some have assumed the president will simply axe the existing legislation. But as Tuffy notes, it’s not t hat easy. "Clearly there will be an attempt to reform elements of Dodd Frank," he says. “However, the Republicans don’t have a supermajority. Any substantive change will require cooperation from the Democrats. We can expect any attempt to repeal key elements of Dodd Frank to be met with stiff resistance." In addition, says Tuffy, “the Trump administration needs to walk a tightrope on financial regulatory reform because anything seen as a giveaway to Wall Street could spark voter discontent. Given these two constraints, a bonfire of financial regulation still seems unlikely."  SEE ALSO: Trump's push to roll back financial regulation is a 'big mistake' that threatens a new financial crisis NOW WATCH: Here's how to use one of the many apps to buy and trade bitcoin Loading video...

This episode the crew tackles the topic of sports on TV, on the internet, and in person. Live streaming of sporting events is something we’d all like to see happen more often (and better), but there are roadblocks from the league and from the networks that need to be cleared. Highlights and full-length broadcasts in VR are also pretty dope—when they work properly. It’s not all bad news though; we visit the best intersections of sports and the internet. Halfway through the episode, WIRED writer Paul Sarconi talks to Populous, an architecture firm that designs stadiums with the aim to substantially improve the fan experience.

Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots is seated second from left. The Trumps are hosting Abe and his wife for the weekend. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) More WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on President Donald Trump (all times local): 8:30 p.m. Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, is joining President Donald Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their wives for dinner at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Trump began the dinner at Mar-a-Lago's crowded patio restaurant by talking up Kraft and joking that the assembled U.S. and Japanese press had heard Kraft was there. Trump said Kraft "knew he was going to win the game, even when he was down 28-3." The president also quipped about all the interpreters who had pulled up chairs to their not-so-large table. "We need more interpreters," he joked. "They don't play games." ___ 6:15 p.m. President Donald Trump's chief of staff says he expects new executive orders to be "enacted soon" in response to a federal court decision to block the administration's immigration ban. Reince Priebus told reporters Friday that "every single court option" is on the table as the administration contests a decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block Trump's executive order. A White House official said the new executive order could be a modified version of the one signed last month or a new version altogether. The official spoke anonymously because the issue is still under review. Priebus says the White House is "fighting out this case on the merits, which will be proven ultimately 100 percent correct and vindicated on the merits." — By Vivian Salama ___ 5:30 p.m. A White House official says President Donald Trump has "full confidence" in National Security Adviser Michael Flynn following reports that he discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the election. Trump advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, previously said Flynn did not talk about the sanctions in his conversations with the Russian envoy. But the official said Flynn now says that while he does not recall talking about sanctions, he can't guarantee the matter did not come up. A second administration official says Flynn and Pence spoke in person Friday morning. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity. Trump told reporters traveling Friday on Air Force One that he had not seen a Washington Post report saying Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador. —By Ken Thomas ___ 5:15 p.m. President Donald Trump says he's unaware of reports that his national security adviser discussed sanctions with the Russians before Trump was sworn into office. Trump told reporters flying with him to Florida that he'll look into the issue. The Washington Post first reported that Michael Flynn discussed the sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Flynn had spoken to the ambassador during the transition period to wish him a Merry Christmas and offer condolences after a deadly Russian plane crash, but he denied that sanctions had come up in the conversation. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday: "I don't know about it. I haven't seen it. What report is that?" Flynn is among the passengers flying aboard the plane. ___ 5:05 p.m. President Donald Trump says that he's considering signing a new executive order on immigration as the one he signed suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries is held up in court. Trump tells reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida that he's confident he'll win his court battle. But he says, "we also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." He adds: "We need speed for reasons of security. So it could very well be that we do that." Trump says a new order would likely change "very little" from the first and says he'll likely act next Monday or Tuesday. He adds of his decision: "I'd like to surprise you." ___ 3:55 p.m. President Donald Trump has revived claims of voter fraud, arguing in a lunch meeting with senators that he and former GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte would have won in New Hampshire if not for voters bused in from out of state. That's according to a GOP official with knowledge of Thursday's lunch conversation. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting. Read More Ayotte was present for the meeting at the White House with a bipartisan group of 10 senators because she is working with Judge Neil Gorsuch, Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Trump's comments were first reported by Politico. There is no evidence of people being improperly bused into New Hampshire to vote. —By Erica Werner. ___ 3:50 p.m. A White House official says the Trump administration will likely contest the merits of its travel ban in district court rather than appeal a restraining order on the ban in the Supreme Court. The official also left open the possibility that the White House could rework President Donald Trump's original executive order that temporarily halted entry to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim countries. The official says "all options" are on the table with regard to that order. On Thursday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a 3-0 decision that kept Trump's travel ban from going back into effect. Trump says he has "no doubt" his administration will ultimately win in court. The official was not authorized to discuss the administration's planning publicly and insisted on anonymity. —By Julie Pace ___ 3:35 p.m. First lady Melania Trump is getting her first ride on Air Force One. Mrs. Trump, who is not yet living in the White House full time, greeted President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews before a trip to Florida. The Trumps are playing host this weekend at their Florida estate to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie. It's the first time Mrs. Trump has been seen in the Washington area since Trump took office on Jan. 20. It was unclear how long she'd been in town. The first lady joined her husband last weekend at their estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Mrs. Trump is living full time in New York with the couple's 10-year-old son, Barron, through the end of the school year. ___ 1:45 p.m. At his press conference with the Japanese prime minister, President Donald Trump touted plans by Intel announced this week to open a $7 billion factory because of his administration's planned tax cuts. But that's not the whole story behind the Chandler, Arizona facility_which began construction during Barack Obama's presidency. In fact, Obama appeared at the side of Intel's CEO when the factory was announced and even spoke at the construction site in 2012. Intel never finished its "Fab 42" factory because there was insufficient demand for its high-powered computer chips, a spokesman said this week. The company plans to complete the facility within four years because it expects its business to grow. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, which have yet to be publicly detailed. ___ 1:40 p.m. President Donald Trump says he had a "very, very warm conversation" with Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and says he thinks the two global powers are "on the process of getting along very well." Trump notes in a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (shin-zoh ah-bay) that he has been complaining about currency devaluation with China for a long time. He predicts "we will all be at a level playing field." Trump told the Chinese leader in a phone call on Thursday that the U.S. would honor Washington's "one China" policy, which had been in question since Trump broke protocol and spoke to the leader of Taiwan after his election. The White House said the reaffirmation of U.S. policy came at Xi's request. Trump made no mention of the "one China" dispute in his remarks. ___ 1:30 p.m. President Donald Trump says he has "no doubt" that he will prevail in the federal court case over his travel ban. He also promises to take additional steps to improve U.S. security. Trump commented a day after a San Francisco-based U.S. appeals court refused to reinstate his temporary ban on travel to the U.S. by refugees and residents of seven mostly Muslim countries in the name of national security. Speaking at a White House news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump says the administration will continue to work the case through the court process. He says he has "no doubt that we'll win" the case. Trump says the administration will do whatever is necessary to keep the country safe. ___ 11:45 a.m. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia has been sworn in as health and human services secretary, setting the stage for the conservative to play a leading role in dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath to Price hours after he won Senate confirmation on a narrow 52-47 vote early Friday. Price is an orthopedic surgeon who is expected to help scuttle the Affordable Care Act, in part, by issuing regulations to weaken it. Democrats assailed Price as an ideologue with a questionable history of trading health care stocks and warned that he would take away health insurance from millions of Americans. ___ 10:50 p.m. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is praising a federal appeals court decision against reinstating President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, saying Trump proceeded on the issue in an "incompetent and strategically incoherent" way. Wrapping up their annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Democrats reveled in the administration's court loss. Pelosi said the ban would make Americans less safe. "This is a major, major, major defeat for the administration," said New York Rep. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic Caucus. "And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep." Crowley also criticized Trump's all caps tweet just after the decision Thursday that said "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" "The president needs to grow up," Crowley said. ___ 10:15 a.m. Fitch Ratings says President Donald Trump "represents a risk to international economic conditions," noting that his "aggressive tone" and willingness to float "unanticipated changes" to U.S. policies could harm worldwide growth and make it more expensive for governments to borrow. Judging by its opening weeks, the Trump administration could potentially disrupt foreign trade, reduce the flow of capital, limit migration and provoke "confrontational exchanges" that could destabilize volatile financial markets, the credit ratings firm said in a Friday statement. Fitch noted that other promised policies in a Trump administration such as tax cuts, fewer regulations and more infrastructure spending could boost U.S. growth. But its note stressed the possibility of Trump disrupting foreign economies as he seeks to renegotiate trade deals. ___ 9:47 a.m. President Vladimir Putin says he's grateful to Slovenia for its offer to host his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, adding that it will depend on Washington. Speaking after the Kremlin talks Friday with his Slovenian counterpart, Putin said that Russia welcomes Trump's statements about the need to restore the strained Russia-U.S. ties. He said Moscow is waiting for the Trump administration to prepare for a dialogue. He added that Moscow and Washington could jointly tackle the terror threat and deal with other global challenges. Putin thanked the Slovenian president for his readiness to organize his meeting with Trump. He added it will depend on the U.S. on whether to hold such a meeting. __ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is lashing out at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision against reinstating his refugee and immigration order, calling it "a disgraceful decision." Trump has been pointing to a federal law that details when immigration restrictions by the president is permissible. In a tweet Friday, Trump quotes an article by Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of the Lawfare blog. It reads, "Remarkably, in the entire opinion, the panel did not bother even to cite this (the) statute." Trump tweeted, "A disgraceful decision!" Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the unanimous decision undercut his presidency and tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" in response.

Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Will Hit $15 Soon BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Worth $8 a Share View All Posts There is nothing more painful for investors than watching a stock that once traded at $1.81 soaring six-fold in the last year. The higher shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) goes, the riskier it gets for investors. AMD stock still has $1.44 billion in debt against $1.26 billion in cash and equivalents. In early March, the chip supplier is about to make its biggest launch its his history with Ryzen, and that’s bound to make a lot of noise. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr For the time being, details of AMD’s Ryzen are limited. Although the company recently demoed the chip in a gameplay demonstration, it gave no details on the chip’s pricing. Without knowing what Ryzen offers at a price-to-performance ratio compared to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), the harder it is to predict Ryzen’s sales when it launches. AMD’s (Leaked) Ryzen Roadmap If the leaked rumors are true, AMD will launch three classes of PC chips: high-range, medium-range and entry-level. Denoted R7 (8 core, 16 threads), R5 (4-6 core, 8-12 threads) and R3 (4 core, 4 threads), respectively, the CPUs will differ by core, thread and clock speed. The mid- and high-range chips will compete with Intel’s mainstream processors, the i5 and i7. Click to Enlarge Ryzen’s processor speed does not aim to out-clock that of Intel chips. Rather, AMD’s strategy primarily targets the enthusiast PC game community. Ryzen will pair with the next-generation GPU (graphics processing unit) Vega chips. After Ryzen’s launch in March, AMD will release Vega sometime in the second quarter. Mentions of Ryzen picked up again on Feb 9. Ryzen’s Processor Size Although Advanced Micro Devices is manufacturing Zen on 14nm, its an area of 44 square millimeters implies that the chip will at least match or beat Intel’s chips. Before Lisa Su’s leadership, AMD did not talk about manufacturing at 14nm. Prior to Ryzen, Advanced Micro Devices embraced x86 chips at 28nm. The engineering achievement will lead to lower manufacturing costs and higher profit margins for AMD stock. On its conference call, the company revealed that it aimed to achieve gross margin of around 33% in the first quarter. In the quarters before that, its gross margin hovered in the 31%-range due to the product mix. With Ryzen on the list, expect that profitability number to improve quarter after quarter.

USA TODAY NETWORK President Trump speaks during a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Feb. 10, 2017, in the East Room of the White House. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) 9836 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 274 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump said Friday he's considering a new executive order on refugees as soon as Monday or Tuesday, even as his administration mulls an appeal of a court decision suspending his previous order barring travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries. "We will win that battle," Trump said of the court fight. "We also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand new order." The shifting White House strategy marked the beginning of a third weekend of chaotic developments on the travel ban, which has stranded air travelers and led to nationwide protests and legal challenges. After a three-judge panel refused to reinstate the travel ban on Thursday, the next stop would ordinarily be the Supreme Court. But a potential roadblock emerged late Friday, when a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco asked for the case to be heard by the full court of appeals, setting a deadline of next Thursday for arguments on that question. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One Friday, suggested that a new executive order would be the most expedient route. "It very well could be. We need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be." The new order would include additional security measures, Trump said. "We have very, very strong vetting. I call it extreme vetting and we're going very strong on security.  We are going to have people coming to our country that want to be here for good reason," he said. The San Francisco appeals court decision came in response to a challenge from Washington State, which sued to block provisions of the order temporarily barring nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from traveling to the United States. A key part of that opinion struck at a provision of Trump's order applying it to permanent legal residents. White House Counsel Donald McGahn later issued a memo clarifying that the ban did not include so-called "green card" holders, but the appeals court said the memo did not have the force of an executive order and can only be corrected by another executive order. The Trump administration also continued to fend off legal challenges on other fronts Friday, including in Alexandria, Va. A federal judge there offered a blistering critique of the travel ban, citing a "startling" lack of evidence that travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries represented a specific national security threat. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema did not immediately rule on a request for a nationwide preliminary injunction against the order, but she characterized its language as overly "broad and imprecise." Trump's comments on Air Force One, while traveling to his winter home in Mar-a-Lago, Fla. to golf with the Japanese prime minister, came after he deflected similar questions in a news conference earlier in the day. "We'll be going forward and we’ll be doing things that will continue to make this country safe. It will happen rapidly," he said at the White House. "I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States. We will have extreme vetting, which is a term I developed early in my campaign, because I saw what was happening." Contributing: David Jackson in Washington and Kevin Johnson in Alexandria, Va.

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 10, 2017 2:27pm   Comments Share: Related INTC Nvidia Remains One Of The Most Exciting Growth Stories In Tech Intel: 4 Reasons To Overlook Disappointing Margin Outlook And Buy The Stock Intel Down After Analyst Day; Monolithic Power Rises On Q4 Report (Investor's Business Daily) Betsy Van Hees of Loop Capital said Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) have set a low bar for the next three years with disappointing margin guidance, as it is positioning itself for long-term growth by diversifying away from PC business. Inte's Outlook Intel expects its gross margin to decline modestly over the next three years, due to expectations for higher revenue growth in memory, modems and adjacent products. However, it would remain in the top half of historical range at 63 percent. The chip giant also cut its DCG (DataCenter Group) operating margin outlook to the low- to mid-40 percent range from prior range of 45 to 50 percent over 2017 to 2021. Intel also guided CCG (Client Computing Group) to decline low-single-digits with new businesses to increase double-digits resulting in overall revenue increasing low single-digits over the next three years. “We came away from INTC's investor meeting incrementally more confident that INTC is making the right "big bets" for the long-term growth of the company and reiterate our Buy rating and $42 price target,” Van Hees wrote in a note. The DCG margin cut guidance reflects Intel’s ramp DCG products first on its next process technology rather than at CCG traditionally, and higher expected mix of non-processor sales within DCG, which carry lower margins. As a sign of diversification, Intel expects its traditional PC CPU TAM (total available market) to drop to about $30 billion in 2021 from $32 billion in 2016 and data center to increase to $65 billion from $13 billion in 2016. Analyst Day Takeaways  Other highlights of the analyst day include: Intel’s TAM should grow to $220 billion in 2021 from $45 billion in 2016. Intel will invest more in DCG and IoT chips. Intel is confident that it has a three-year manufacturing lead over competing foundries. Intel to ship its first 5G modem this year on 14 nm, and expects shipments in the millions in 2018. Intel also expects 14 nm LTE modem shipments in the tens of millions in 2018, which implies retention of share at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) at a minimum. At last check, shares of Intel were down 0.62 percent to $35.24.
