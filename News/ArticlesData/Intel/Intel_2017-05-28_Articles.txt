The chipmaker, which has stood unchallenged atop the performance desktop mountain for years, is reportedly working on a potent lineup for its X299 platform that includes an 18-core monster. Update: And they are official! Check out Intel's confirmed Core-X and Core i9 lineup here. According to VideoCardz, which says its intelligence was obtained from multiple sources, the Intel Core i9-7980XE will be the new performance king with 18 cores and 36 threads (other details like L3 cache size and clock speeds wasn't shared). There’s also said to be a Core i9-7960X with 16 cores / 32 threads and a Core i9-7940X with 14 cores and 28 threads in addition to the stable of chips we’ve previously heard about. Intel even reportedly has new boxes in the works as spied above. As we learned earlier this month, AMD is also gearing up for an epic battle this summer with its Ryzen 9 “Threadripper” chips. That lineup, if you recall, is said to be capped by the Ryzen 9 1998X, a 16-core / 32-thread beast with a base clock of 3.5GHz (Boost to 3.9GHz), quad-channel DDR4 support and access to 44 PCIe lanes. That chip, along with the 1998, will carry a 155W TDP, rumors indicate. Some expect Intel to announce its new X299 platform as early as next month although as always, rumors of this nature should be taken with a grain of salt until we hear official word from the horse’s mouth.

Viewed by many as the spiritual successor to its Compute Stick, the Compute Card is a full-blown computer crammed into a card-like form factor that’s roughly as thick as a few credit cards. The idea is that, instead of having to replace an entire PC or IoT device when it comes time to upgrade, one can just swap out the Compute Card with a new model containing faster hardware. Despite their small footprint, Intel said its Compute Cards would pack plenty of processing power upon their arrival in mid-2017. As we approach that promised launch window, we’re now hearing rumors regarding specific Compute Card hardware that corroborates Intel’s claims. CNX-Software recently published a handful of block diagrams and specs for four Compute Card models – two with Apollo Lake processors and two with Kaby Lake chips. The Apollo Lake models are said to include the CD1C64GK with an Intel Celeron N3450 quad-core chip, 4GB of DDR3 and 64GB of eMMC flash and the CD1P64GK which packs a quad-core Pentium N4200 as well as 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC. The more powerful Kaby Lake models mentioned include the CD1M3128MK with a Core m3-7Y30 dual-core CPU, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of PCIe storage and the CD1IV128MK that features a Core i5-7Y57 dual-core with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of PCIe storage. No word yet on pricing or a solid launch date.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Kate Burleigh has led the Australian and New Zealand businesses, having made the shift from sales and marketing roles. Jerry Tsao, VP of Intel's Sales & Marketing Group and GM of Regional Sales for the Asia Pacific and Japan region said "Kate brought a new energy and creativity to the Managing Director role in Australia and New Zealand. Under her leadership, Intel's impact extended well beyond our traditional customer base and channels". In previous roles in PR and sales, Burleigh told Tech Republic that she didn't notice a gender imbalance. But when she started looking for enterprise sales roles she found she needed to justify herself. In that interview, Burleigh said "It wasn't that it was harder, but I had to have that second or third conversation that I really was serious and I seriously wanted it, because were a few question marks over could you really do it, and I could never say it was because I was female, or was it because my skills were [such that] I was identified more strongly as a consumer marketer". Burleigh finishes up on June 30 with a replacement to be announced "in due course" according to Tsao.

No Thanks Log In Sign Up × Get Permalink Close Trending Stories Right Now How The Promise Of The NBN Fell Short For So Many Australians Tooran Alizadeh 05 Jun 2017 11:15 AM Eight years into the Australian government’s National Broadband Network (NBN) project, the nation has an average internet speed – 50th in the global rankings – that lags well behind many advanced economy countries. Ongoing secrecy around the NBN, a project that’s likely to cost more than A$50 billion, makes it impossible for the public in most cases to know when and what quality service they will receive. Further, new research shows the NBN rollout was politically motivated and socioeconomically biased from the beginning. It is perhaps time to remind ourselves of the ups and downs of the project that was once announced as a dream national infrastructure project for the 21st century. This requires a ten-year journey back in time, before we can figure out what needs to be done next.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Intel Intel’s new Core i9 sounds like a monster Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 29th, 2017 at 2:53 PM Share Tweet It’s been a long time since Intel came out with a new line of CPUs. Although the company updates its processor lineup every year like clockwork, the product categories remain the same: Core i3 for budget PCs, Core i5 for most people, and Core i7 for those mystical “power users.” But starting this year, the dial goes up to 9. A previous rumor had suggested that Intel will be debuting a Core i9 lineup this month. Now a new leaked specs sheet has details: there will be multiple Core i9 models, topping out with a disturbingly powerful 18-core version. Don't Miss: New leaks show the iPhone 8 design we’re hoping for Videocardz got their hands on a bunch of information about the upcoming Core i9 lineup, including all the models and the roadmap for the release date. The Core i9 appears to be the spearhead for a new wave of powerful Intel processors, named the Core X series. The X series will come in Core i5, Core i7 and Core i9 versions, going from 8 to 18 cores. The headline is the Core i9-7980XE, an 18-core monster that should comfortably be the fastest consumer chip on the market when it launches. It has a TPU of 165 Watts, which is a lot compared to Intel’s other CPUs. But the high power draw should mean plenty of speed with overclocking, which is fully supported on the chip. Further down the card, we have versions of the Core i9 with 16, 14, 12 and 10 cores. Those are likely to be much cheaper, and more attractive for the gaming and video production crowd. The new lineup isn’t so much a big leap forward technically as it is a big middle finger to AMD, Intel’s only competition in the PC market. AMD recently released a lineup of well-received Ryzen chips that challenged Intel seriously for the first time in years, and the roadmap has a new line of “Threadripper” processors, designed for serious parallel processing, coming soon.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel’s new Core i9 Skylake-X lineup said to feature 18C/36T and 16C/32T CPUs Intel’s new Core i9 Skylake-X lineup said to feature 18C/36T and 16C/32T CPUs Matthew Wilson 6 days ago CPU Update 2: Intel’s new Core-X CPU family has been made official. Intel made the announcement at Computex this morning, going into detail on the X299 platform and the benefits these new CPUs bring. You can read our report on that, HERE.  Update: A few weeks back, we first caught wind of Intel’s plans for Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X in the form of new Core i9 and Core i7 CPUs. At the time, it was believed that the highest end CPU in the lineup would be the Core i9 7920X with 12 cores and 24 threads. However, since then, it appears that two more Core i9 CPUs have come to light, one with 16 cores and 32 threads and another with 18 cores and 36 threads. This news comes just a week after AMD officially announced its upcoming Threadripper 16C/32T CPU for its upcoming HEDT platform. According to an exclusive report on Videocardz, the Core i9 7980XE will be Intel’s flagship chip for Skylake-X, with 18C/36T. Meanwhile the Core i9 7960X will be a 16C/32T chip. Unfortunately, clock speeds and other features are not currently listed. Here is a leaked presentation slide courtesy of Videocardz: Original Story: We have been hearing rumours surrounding Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs from Intel for months now. However, the picture remained unclear and somewhat confusing to follow. Fortunately, some new information has now come to light, indicating that Skylake-X will arrive as a batch of HEDT Core i9 processors later this year, while Kaby Lake-X will carry the Core i7 name. Up to this point, Intel’s Core i7 branding has carried across a broad range of CPUs, blurring the line between mainstream chips like the 6700K and HEDT parts like the 6900K. According to a leak over on the Anandtech forum, this will be changing this year, with the introduction of the Core i9 series. This new lineup will contain Intel’s upcoming Skylake-X CPUs, ranging from the 6C/12T Core i9 7800X up to the 12C/24T Core i9 7820X. For the mainstream, Intel will be launching two new Core i7 CPUs, the Core i7-7740K and the Core i7-7640K Here is a list of each of the rumoured CPUs and the details we have on them so far: Processor Cores/Threads L3 Cache PCIe Lanes Base Clock Turbo Clock 2.0 Turbo Clock 3.0 Launch  Core i9-7920X  12C/24T  16.5MB  44  TBD  TBD TBD August  Core i9-7900X  10C/20T  13.75MB  44  3.3GHz  4.3GHz 4.5GHz June  Core i9-7820X  8C/16T  11MB  28  3.6GHz  4.3GHz 4.5GHz June  Core i9-7800X  6C/12T  8.25MB  28  3.5GHz  4.0GHz N/A June  Core i7-7740K  4C/8T  8MB  16  4.3GHz  4.5GHz N/A June  Core i7-7640K  4C/4T  6MB  16  4.0GHz  4.2GHz N/A June This is a good start to clearing up the confusion surrounding Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X. Though I do think the Kaby Lake-X name is still a tad confusing, given that one of these CPUs is a cut down 7700K, while the other is a slightly improved one. With that in mind, now is as good a time as any to remind everyone that these are still rumours. While this particular leak seems promising, we have no way of verifying its legitimacy. KitGuru Says: This is certainly the most promising leak we have seen so far but so far, the claims are unverified. That said, we don’t have long to wait to get the full story, with Computex kicking off in two weeks time, coupled with Intel’s appearance at E3.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags core i7 Core i9 Intel leak news Skylake-X Previous 10% of KitGuru gamers play at 4k/5k resolution Next Square Enix brings Final Fantasy VII Remake development in-house, Lightning Returns director is a project lead Check Also Computex: AMD RX Vega Consumer Launch July 2017, Threadripper Summer 2017 At its press conference in Taipei, AMD has announced that the RX Vega consumer GPU … Rocky40 “Core i7-7640K 4C/4T 6MB 16 4.0GHz 4.2GHz N/A June” Now that’s some funny stuff right there branding a i5 a i7 like wow Intel now I have seen everything. Then again they do the same thing on the mobile make a i3 a i5 or worse a i7 with dual core 2/4 and people think oh look a i7 it’s the best I will buy it. This is really sad & this is what happens when there is very little competition in a market. I would have thought with AMD’s Ryzen being out there now that Intel would stop trying to pull the wool over peoples eye’s. But then again this rushed kaby-lake X stuff seems like a direct response to the Ryzen because Intel knows kaby-lake has enough core mhz speed to do great in games that are out now and is hedging their bets to make sure AMD does not over take them on the 2066 socket in the games. I am not a AMD fanboy I don’t own any AMD CPU’s at all just 4 Graphics cards from them. I do know my next CPU will be AMD once Ryzen 2 comes out as I am tired of these little Intel games they like to play. Danilo Bojic I wonder how many thousands of dollars they’re gonna price this at CnM So basically you paired your intel processor with an AMD graphics card? Don’t pretend to be Mr. Knowitall if you can’t build a proper rig. Weston Konik I estimate it at possibly $2,500 Rocky40 LOL What does pairing a AMD Graphics card with a Intel CPU have to do with anything? I happen to like both companies each has their own great products. I also like Nvidia graphics cards but this time around I chose to go AMD graphics card next time who knows. My system is fast enough and plays the games just fine. Владан Аранђеловић I think its misstype. i5-7640k from 7600. Cos i7-7740k is from 7700. So basically high and k version gets revision.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 18 Intel Core-X CPU series to include 18-core flagship says leaked slide by Mark Tyson on 29 May 2017, 15:31 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadhzt Add to My Vault: A couple of weeks back we saw a 'leaked Powerpoint presentation' that indicated Intel was readying its first ever Core i9-Series processors. These processors would sport as many as 12 physical cores, and up to 24 threads via Hyperthreading. A table showed that the Core i9-7920X was the top-end Skylake-X processor and it was asserted by the source that we would see many of this processor range launched in June. Fast forward to last Thursday and a SiSoft Sandra benchmark database entry seemed to confirm one of the lower tier Skylake-X processors had been undergoing some testing. The Core i9-7900X appeared to have been 'confirmed', packing 10C/20T but with a TDP of 175W. Intel has Core-X 18, 16, and 14-core options Today, in an exclusive from the leak specialists over at VideoCardz, new slides and info "from multiple sources" assert that Intel's Core X-Series chips will include SKUs with up to 18 cores. In a genuine looking Intel slide you can see above, the first callout box clearly boasts that the upcoming enthusiast processors will offer "More core options: 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, and 4." Other highlighted features of the X-Series include a so-called Rebalanced Intel Smart Cache hierarchy. This will tweak the L1, L2, and L3 cache structure. Intel also trumpets and updated Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, and an integrated memory controller for up to four channels of DDR4 2666. Using new data VideoCardz has put together the table above which adds the 18C/36T Core i9-7980XE at the top of the pile. The site also sourced some gaudy (RGB LED illuminated?) boxes for the upcoming X-Series. Please remember to take these rumours with a pinch of salt. Intel's Computex keynote is scheduled for tomorrow at 2pm Taiwan time (7am here in the UK).

Posted by QuorTek - Mon 29 May 2017 16:42 As I read it, then it is like they are digging into their work station CPUs and rebranding them..sorry if I am paranoid or anything… though if AMD keeps pushing out good stuff now and in the future + good prices.. then will be AMD next time building a system for sure. Not a fanboy of either brand but if offer high quality for a more reasonable amount of money then count me in, and if the difference is like 5% or less give or take performance wise either side then wont notice the difference if buying the top products from either company. Posted by 3dcandy - Mon 29 May 2017 16:43 And you'll need a mortgage to buy one as well ;) Posted by LSG501 - Mon 29 May 2017 16:59 So basically intel are releasing their ‘xeon cpu’s' onto the desktop as i9 then rather than being called xeon like they are now. Now based on current ryzen benchmarks, where ryzen has better multithreading in the apps I use, plus the current cheaper pricing from AMD I see no reason why I would pick an i9 over a thread ripper assuming AMD keeps the prices cheaper….the motherboards will likely be cheaper on AMD side too. The Intel cpu might give me better fps in games but lets be honest if you're going after 8+ cores the odds are you're not after the cpu to play games, it's for heavy cpu workloads like 3D rendering and video editing etc. Posted by Iota - Mon 29 May 2017 18:51 LSG501 The Intel cpu might give me better fps in games but lets be honest if you're going after 8+ cores the odds are you're not after the cpu to play games, it's for heavy cpu workloads like 3D rendering and video editing etc. Even if it was for gaming, the difference in FPS is so slight I'd be more inclined to go with AMD at this stage, purely for the pricing / core count available. Posted by Tabbykatze - Mon 29 May 2017 21:51 Well this all seems rather convenient, AMD announces and releases Ryzen 8/16 which do quite well, AMD leaks a little of an HEDT range, Intel bring out their cut down/across Zeons as the i9 series up to 12/24 but then AMD states they will have up to 16/32 as their flagship then magically Intel has an HEDT processor with 18/36. AMD need to keep this up and see how long the stored up ammo that Intel has stagnating is used up and we see the real battle starting :P SEE NEWER » MY HEXUS Sign in for the best HEXUS experience LOG IN REGISTER HEXUS NEWSLETTER MOST VIEWED MOST COMMENTED 1 Intel Core i9-7900X breaks several benchmark world records 47 2 Intel Core-X CPU series to include 18-core flagship says leaked slide 18 3 AMD Ryzen 5 1400 and Ryzen 5 1600 (14nm) 13 4 Intel introduces its Core-X Series processors at Computex 17 5 The Cryorig Taku desktop ITX chassis has hit Kickstarter 7 1 QOTW: Which graphics card is in your PC? 92 2 Intel Core i9-7900X breaks several benchmark world records 47 3 AMD is preparing nine Threadripper CPUs for launch 22 4 Intel Core-X CPU series to include 18-core flagship says leaked slide 18 5 Intel introduces its Core-X Series processors at Computex 17 EVENTS ALL EVENTS POLL FACEBOOK INDUSTRY PRESS RELEASES 1 TUNAI CLIP Bluetooth Music Receiver and Wireless Headphone Amplifier Wins Computex d&i Award 2 Synology® Debuts an Array of Cutting-Edge Products and Advanced Applications during Computex 3 Thermaltake New Riing Plus LED RGB Radiator Fan TT Premium Edition at COMPUTEX Taipei 2017 4 QNAP Releases Qfixes for Samba Writable Share Vulnerability 5 BIOSTAR Holds Successful Showcase at COMPUTEX 2017 6 COLORFUL at COMPUTEX: Black Tech is Here INFORMATION About us Advertise Contact us How Competitions work How we test About Cookies What our awards mean Privacy and terms of use SUBSCRIPTIONS RSS / Alerts / Twitter Facebook / Newsletter Unsubscribe HEXUS Community Members: 412,187 Forum posts: 2,579,074 Forum threads: 248,350 Currently active users: 477 Copyright © 1998 - 2017, HEXUS.net.

The powerhouse notebooks and convertibles are characterised by high-performance internals. ASUS unveiled all of its new products at its press event at Computex 2017. There are three new additions to its flagship ZenBook brand and a further two VivoBook models. The overarching focus is on professional customers who are looking for a premium product. ZenBook Pro Headlining the announcements is the new ZenBook Pro, purportedly the "thinnest, lightest and most powerful" version to date. It comes with a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB SSD. An NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 Ti graphics card provides ample power for on-the-go gaming sessions. ASUS ZenBook Pro ASUS / Microsoft The laptop's 15.6-inch display has a full 4K Ultra HD resolution. It fits within a package that weighs only 1.8kg and measures up at 18.9mm thick. Despite the 4K display and plentiful processing power, ASUS is quoting a battery life of up to 14 hours. The ZenBook Pro will launch later this summer priced from $1,299. ZenBook 3 Deluxe With a similar target audience to the Pro, the ZenBook 3 Deluxe is a smaller 14-inch device that weights 1.1kg and has a 12.9mm thick chassis. ASUS' NanoEdge bezel-less display technology makes the laptop's overall footprint only marginally larger than that of a 13-inch device. Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe ASUS / Microsoft Internally, there's an Intel Core i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage. In a decision that will please forward-thinking buyers, ASUS has included two USB Type-C ports as connectivity options. It will help to futureproof the laptop as USB-C starts to gain widespread adoption. Availability will start this summer priced at $1,199. ZenBook Flip S The ZenBook Flip S is a convertible laptop that can be used as a tablet while on the go. It has a 4K Ultra HD display, an Intel Core i7 processor and up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. ASUS claims the device is the world's thinnest convertible laptop at just 10.9mm thick. ASUS ZenBook Flip S ASUS / Microsoft The Flip S will support an active stylus for use with Windows Ink. It also joins the other new members of the ZenBook family in offering a built-in fingerprint sensor for secure biometric authentication with Windows Hello. Pricing starts at $1,099 with sales again commencing this summer. VivoBook Pro 15 & VivoBook S15 ASUS has also upgraded its VivoBook collection of mid-range laptops with two new options. The Pro 15 is a 15.6-inch version with an Intel Core i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM, a hybrid storage system and a 4K display. It includes a fingerprint sensor, twin stereo speakers and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card for gaming. ASUS VivoBook Pro 15 ASUS / Microsoft The VivoBook S15 sports a 15.6-inch screen too. It has a Core i7 underneath, although it's a slower i7-7500U compared to the Pro's i7-7700HQ. The graphics hardware is swapped out for an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX and the wealth of accompanying features present on the Pro have been dropped in favour of a lower price. The Pro 15 will start at $799. The S15 is significantly less at $499, allowing it to cross over towards the lower end of the market. In line with the other devices announced today, both will launch in the next few months. "The edge of beyond" Abstract marketing taglines aside, ASUS' new ZenBooks and VivoBooks affirm its presence as one of the leading premium laptop brands. The revised range comprises several notable strengths, including ASUS' signature refined metal design of the past few years and new breakthroughs in overall footprint reduction. ASUS VivoBook S15 ASUS / Microsoft "Today is all about our relentless effort in striving toward perfection," said ASUS chairman Jonney Shih. "Our brand-new ZenBook and VivoBook line-up truly goes to the edge of beyond, providing everyone with a new definition of thin, beautiful and powerful laptops." Alongside the laptops, ASUS has also unveiled a pair of new Windows 10 all-in-one computers, a flagship 27-inch QHD design-focused monitor and a unique new Wi-Fi router built with Intel technology.

But that doesn’t mean people don’t want it, as Eve-Tech CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis will tell you. And he should know — his startup’s new convertible computer, the Eve V, had its spec sheet determined by the votes of thousands of crowdfunding backers. What does the resulting product look like? Well, it’s pretty much a Surface Pro with two USB-C ports. You were saying, Microsoft? But Microsoft is just fine with the Eve V. In fact, it’s impressed — it’s going to be showing off the product this week in its booth and at its keynote at Computex Taipei, according to Karatsevidis. Intel is another heavy hitter backing the Eve V, having invested a “six-figure” sum in its development. There’s something going on with the Eve V beyond your average Indiegogo vaporware. Other specs apparently decided upon by committee are a slightly thicker chassis than the Surface Pro to allow for a bigger battery, and Intel Core i5 or i7 Y-series processors — that’s the low-power line that used to be called Core M before Intel confusingly rebranded it. Karatsevidis claims that the Eve V’s cooling system allows the processor to run at top speed for longer, and the selection of chips allowed for a fanless design. There aren’t any obvious red flags Performance and battery life assessments will have to wait for a full review, of course. But what I can say about the Eve V after spending a little time with it is that there aren’t any obvious red flags in its design, apart from a backspace button that’s inexplicably labeled “oops!” The build quality is solid, with subtle rounded edges that make it feel friendlier than a Surface Pro. There is almost no branding beyond a light pattern underneath the kickstand and a triangle logo on the V key. The design is obviously derivative, but it’s a good-looking machine for what it is. The 3:2 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 screen appears to be a very similar panel to the Surface Pro’s, though the glass has had an extra anti-reflective coating applied. The pen, meanwhile, is literally identical to the Surface Pro 2, 3, and 4’s — it comes from the same supplier and is backwards compatible. The keyboard has RGB backlighting and a surprising amount of travel, and there’s a Precision Trackpad that felt reasonably good. The power button has a fingerprint sensor. And yes, there are two USB-C ports — one with Thunderbolt 3 — as well as two regular USB-A ports. And a headphone jack with a dedicated amplifier. All of this starts at $799 including the keyboard and pen. The Surface Pro also starts at $799, but that’s for a model with half the RAM (just 4GB) and without a bundled keyboard or pen. On paper, the Eve V looks like a very well balanced machine for the price. But there is a catch The catch is that it’s going to be produced in limited quantities, so you might have trouble actually buying one even if it does turn out to be great. Eve-Tech is a small company that seems to be taking inspiration from OnePlus’ early success stoking fan enthusiasm with direct online sales in batches. It’s going to be shipping the first Eve V units out to Indiegogo backers in a matter of weeks, however, so it shouldn’t be too long before we know whether this really is a product worth buzzing about.

Starting at $799, the 15-inch brushed aluminum laptop comes with an Intel quad-core processor, and NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics, with an optional 4K display. Of the information Asus has released so far, the company has released the base price, but not the prices of the higher-end configurations. At the $799 base model will include an Intel Core-i5 7300HQ CPU, 500 GB HDD, and a 1080p display. Meanwhile the high-end model will have a Core-i7 7700HQ, 4K full sRGB screen, NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics, 16GB of RAM, and both a 512GB PCIe SSD and a 2TB hard drive. Asus will also be including Intel’s Optane Memory for faster storage performance (though it’s not clear if this is just for HDD models or all models). Asus VivoBook 15 N580 Processor Intel Core i5-7300HQ (4C/4T, 2.5-3.5GHz, 6MB L3, 14nm, 45w) Intel Core i7-7700HQ (4C/8T, 2.8-3.8GHz, 6MB L3, 14nm, 45w) Memory Up To 16 GB (2x SO-DIMM) Graphics Intel Core Intel HD Graphics 630 (24 EUs) (Optional) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (640 CUDA Cores) Displays 15.6" 1080p (Optional) 15.6" 1080p, 178° Viewing Angle (Optional) 15.6" 1080p, 100% sRGB, 178° Viewing Angle (Optional) 15.6" 4K, 100% sRGB, 178° Viewing Angle Storage HDD: 500 GB, 1 TB, 2TB SSD (SATA): 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB Networking 802.11ac, 2x2:2, 866Mpbs Max, 2.4 and 5GHz Bluetooth 4.2 Audio Stereo Speakers (Harman Kardon Certified) Battery 47 Whr Right Side 2x USB 2.0 Type-A Headset Jack SD Card Reader Kensington Lock Left Side USB 3.0 Type-A USB 3.0 Type-C (w/DP Support) RJ45 Slim Port HDM Dimensions 380 x 256 x 19.2 mm Weight Non-Touch: 1.99kg Touch: 2.29kg Pricing $799 USD and up Considering its plethora of high-end components, the VivoBook Pro's 4.85-pound weight and 0.75-inch thickness are quite reasonable. The VivoBook Pro uses a dual-fan system to keep its powerful components from getting too hot. During a brief hands-on, the laptop felt solid and sturdy in my hands and its metal deck was pleasantly cool to the touch. The VivoBook's backlight keyboard felt sturdy snappy under my fingers and didn't even have a hint of flex. Its buttonless touchpad had just the right amount of friction and resistance for each click. Asus claims that the optional 4K screen on the VivoBook covers an impressive 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut. In my brief time with the laptop, it was difficult to tell how vibrant the colors were as the background and icons the company displayed were rather bland. The VivoBook Pro doesn't skimp on ports. Its left side contains an Ethernet port, a USB 3.0 connector, HDMI out and a USB Type-C port. The right side houses two more USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader and a 3.5mm audio jack. It's a shame that Asus didn't put a Thunderbolt 3 port on this laptop, but that would have likely added to the cost. Asus hasn't announced a release date for the VivoBook Pro. However, depending on just what the base configuration is like and how much the higher-end models cost, this laptop could be a great buy for design students or anyone that needs to do creative work, without breaking the bank.

(Optional) 15.6" 1080p, 178° Viewing Angle Can I take that to mean that the base model will have a TN panel? Reply lazarpandar - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link That's what I took it to mean. Reply peevee - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link Still the huge awful bezels like it is 1999. The laptop is so big because of them, you could literally fit 17" screen instead of 15". Reply rocky12345 - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link LOL a bit picky but it is ok to have a preference. Just be thankful it don't got a glossy bezels like so many laptops had in the past and some still do or have flashing LEDS around the bezels...lol Reply Freakie - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link The bezel is fine by me, gives them room for that number pad. Too few 15" laptops have number pads. Reply ciuvak - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link 2x USB 2.0 Type-A seriously? Why would anyone need even one 2.0 port in 2017? Reply rocky12345 - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link I was wondering the same thing why not just have all the USB ports 3.0 or 3.1 makes a lot more sense in 2017.

Both new Acer Switch 2-in-1 notebooks can be used with an Acer Active Pen on the touch screen to sketch, take notes or annotate documents or photos with Windows Ink. The Acer Switch 5 builds on the industry-leading innovations of its predecessor, the Acer Switch Alpha 12, providing a fanless, quiet experience through Acer LiquidLoop cooling, and excellent performance with up to 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processors. Acer’s patented auto-retracting kickstand allows for easy one-handed adjustments to the viewing angle. It also supports Windows Hello with a fingerprint reader for fast and secure access. The Acer Switch 3 features a 2-in-1 design that is well-balanced with a large 12.2-inch display, Intel processors and a quiet, fanless design. “Customers have embraced the flexibility of 2-in-1 designs to help them get more done throughout the day in both notebook or tablet modes,” said James Lin, General Manger, Commercial & Detachable Notebooks, IT Products Business, Acer Inc. “Acer’s Switch line is now able to reach more customers, whether they are looking for something that provides the latest in performance and features, or if they need a more accessible option for studies, work and play.” The Switch 5 is Acer’s first 2-in-1 to be offered with 7th Generation Intel Core i7 and i5 processors to deliver the top-rated performance needed for serious tasks, presentations and entertainment on the go. The built-in fingerprint reader on the power button authenticates users and provides quick access to their projects. Users can be assured their information will remain secure and private when using the fingerprint reader for logging on thanks to Windows Hello. With Acer’s patented auto-retracting kickstand, the Switch 5’s viewing angle can be easily adjusted one-handedly, providing added convenience in any scenario. Also, the Switch 5 uses Acer’s proprietary fanless LiquidLoop cooling system to keep it running efficiently without fan noise, making it ideal for shared spaces such as meetings and open offices. Plus, the LiquidLoop Cooling System doesn’t require venting that can compromise reliability due to airflow issues and dust accumulation. The fanless design supports powerful 7th Generation Intel Core processors to deliver excellent performance and day-to-night 10.5-hour battery life. The Switch 5 has a vibrant 12-inch wide-view FHD+ touch display with IPS technology, an impressive 2160 x 1440 resolution and support from Intel HD Graphics 620. Customers will enjoy vivid colour and crisp detail on the display for video and fun that can be shared on wide 178-degree viewing angles. Acer TrueHarmony and Smart Amplifier provide enhanced audio performance for clarity and robust volume to complement the exceptional display. The Switch 5 has an anodized aluminum chassis that is elegant and modern. The brushed hairline texture complements the design while enhancing the comfort of the device during transport.

The front-facing speakers complement the stunning visuals with enhanced volume and quality for rich, expressive tones. The sleek metallic top cover has a distinctive yet subtle design with complementary etched edging. Slim, lightweight The Switch 5 and Switch 3 are available with ample storage and memory options. The Switch 5 supports a 256GB or 512GB PCIe SSD and up to 8GB of LPDDR3 SDRAM. The Switch 3 supports 32GB, 64GB or 128GB eMMC memory and up to 4GB of LPDDR3 SDRAM. Both models can access additional files through the MicroSDXC slot.

According to a leak over at VideoCardz, the upcoming Intel Core i9 X-Series processor family for the Intel X299 platform are going to be monsters with high core counts, up to 44 lanes of PCIe off the CPU and updated Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. The flagship part will be the Intel Core i9-7980XE with 18-cores and 36-threads, but clock speeds, pricing and launch date are all unknown. It looks like the TDP on the Intel Skylake-X processors will be up to 165W TDP, which is actually pretty impressive for an 18-core processor. Intel will also be offering Kaby Lake-X processors for this platform according to the leaked information, so that means the Intel X299 platform will support your source of 4 to 18 processing cores!

Coach Well, like most folks have been saying. Regardless of your team, red or blue or neither, the competition is helping. Without Ryzen, we would have seen more “status quo” from Intel with the usual up-tick, or is it up-tock? 😉 This is good news for the industry and consumers. Moore’s Law has become difficult to continue, yet if no one is pushing the chip-maker(s), then of course, the Law will fail to hold true. Coach I can’t wait for the benchmark battles between the Threadrippers and i-9’s. 🙂 Six_Tymes yep, and coffee lake with the newer chipset is what i have been waiting for, and its coming sooner thanks to what you said. yes!!! clip art The flagship part will be the Intel Core i9-7980XE with 18-cores and 36-threads, but clock speeds, pricing and launch date are all unknown.

Reception has been mixed, ranging from “this should have been called the Surface Pro 5” to “meh”. Fortunately, Microsoft’s “tablet that can replace your laptop” is no longer the only game in town. In fact, there’s quite a few of them right now. We take a long at some of the most recent and most enticing 2-in-1 options so far this year to see which one might be the best for your mobile Windows 10 needs. The New Microsoft Surface Pro Let’s start with the “granddaddy” of Windows 2-in-1s, at least as far as the new trend goes. The new, numberless Surface Pro is as mixed as the opinions about it. While Microsoft itself almost downplays the new device, this latest gen Surface Pro almost has enough new features to make upgrading from a Surface Pro 4 almost worth it. At the same time, it lacks the punch of a totally new flagship, leaving fans and prospective buyers quite conflicted. There is a lot going for the new Surface Pro. Its top configuration definitely blows away most of the competition. The 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity on the N-Trig Surface Pen threatens to dethrone Wacom at what it does best. The thinner and, at least promised, cooler body makes for a worry-free portable workstation. And it promises an almost unbelievable 13.5 hours of battery life, which will probably be the most debunked claim. There are, however, areas where it failed or flat out refused to move forward. The screen hasn’t changed one bit, be it in size or pixel density. And Microsoft hasn’t budged on the issue of USB-A versus USB-C. But perhaps most disappointing is that, for all its power, the Surface Pen is no longer included in the price tag, effectively increasing the New Surface Pro’s TCO. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core m3/i5/i7 • RAM: 4/8/16 GB • Storage: 128/256/512 GB/1 TB SSD • Display: 12.3-inch 2736×1824 PixelSense • USB: 1 x USB 3.0 • Battery: 13.5 hrs • Pen: Yes, N-Trig (Separate) • Keyboard: Yes (Separate) • Dimensions: 292 x 201 x 8.5 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 768/770/784 g (tablet only) • Price: $799 to $2,699 Samsung Galaxy Book 10.6 It might be unfair to have two Samsung tablets in this list, but the two models are so different to warrant it. Aside from subtle external differences, the insides are also different enough that you could almost compare this to the dichotomy between a Pro and non-Pro model of the Microsoft Surface. The 10.6-inch Galaxy Book is arguably the smallest and lightest of the bunch. While Huawei does have something that is claimed to be lighter, the overall smaller surface area of the Galaxy Book lends itself easier to hold, especially with one hand. Plus, it’s easier to cram inside a smaller bag than any 12-inch slab. Digital artists and scribblers definitely won’t mind having a highly portable drawing pad or notebook, especially one powered by Wacom. The size does come at a price. Though not exactly the weakest, the Galaxy Book 10.6 pales in comparison with its larger contemporaries. Fortunately, it does run on the latest Intel Core m3, so you are at least guaranteed some fanless performance. The bottleneck, however, will be the 4 GB of RAM and most especially the 128 GB of eMMC storage. For light computing uses, that’s not going to be a problem, but do remember this is Windows we’re talking about. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core m3 • RAM: 4 GB • Storage: 128 GB eMMC • Display: 10.6-inch 1920×1080 LCD TFT • USB: 1 x USB-C • Battery: 4,000 mAh • Pen: Yes, Wacom (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 261.2 x 179.1 x 8.9 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 650 g (tablet only) • Price: $729.99 Samsung Galaxy Book 12 Admittedly, the Galaxy Book 10.6 almost seems like an afterthought that it’s puzzling Samsung even put one out at all. It is lavishing all of its marketing attention on the larger 12-inch model and understandably so, considering it is the more powerful of the two. More, of course, doesn’t mean most. In the grand scheme of things, it does barely cut it. There are a few available configurations, depending on whether you want LTE connectivity to go with your tablet. But at most you will be given a 7th gen Intel Core i5, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of SSD storage. If you opt for LTE, you only get half of that. And while Samsung fortunately does throw in the essential pen and keyboard in the package, the keyboard folio cover’s stability leaves much to be desired. There are, of course, some things going for the Galaxy Book, aside from bundling the important accessories. Samsung’s Super AMOLED screen is always praiseworthy, especially when lumped in with a Wacom digitizer. You’ll also be hard-pressed to find a Windows 10 2-in-1 of this size to actually have not just one but two USB-C ports. It’s not the only one anymore, mind, which hopefully hints at a new trend. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core i5 • RAM: 8 GB • Storage: 256 GB SSD • Display: 12-inch 2160×1440 Super AMOLED • USB: 2 x USB-C • Battery: 11 hrs • Pen: Yes, Wacom (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 291.3 x 199.8 x 7.4 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 754 g (tablet and keyboard) • Price: $1,129.99 to $1,329.99 HP Spectre x2 (2017) HP announced the 2017 refresh of the HP Spectre x2 without much fuss or fanfare, lumping it with other new 2017 models of its other product lines. It is, however, perhaps the most underestimated of this group. Calling it a refresh does it no justice, almost mirroring Microsoft’s attitude towards the new Surface Pro. In reality, however, this might as well have been called the Spectre x3. HP has bumped up almost everything without bumping up the size, at least not too much. While still at 12 inches, it now offers a staggering 3000×2000 pixels, higher than even that of the Surface Pro. At its top configuration, it matches that new Microsoft flagship blow for blow: Intel Core i7, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of SSD. But unlike the Surface Pro, it uses USB-C. Two, in fact, just like its predecessor. There is a price to pay for all that power. It’s by far the bulkiest and heaviest of the group. Perhaps not really by much, though HP hasn’t divulged how much the tablet itself weighs. But whereas most of its rivals are trying to cut down on active cooling, the Spectre x2 2017 actually has 2 fans inside. That should help with thermal issues and throttling but does add to the battery drain. The Price for the top tier might also be one of the highest, but that would already include the N-Trig powered pen and keyboard in the box. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core i5/i7 (optional Iris Pro graphics) • RAM: 16 GB • Storage: 1 TB • Display: 12.3-inch 3000×2000 LCD IPS • USB: 2 x USB-C • Battery: 8 hrs • Pen: Yes, N-Trig (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 294 x 207 x 7.7 (tablet only) • Weight: 1,140 kg (tablet and keyboard) • Price: starts at $999 Huawei MateBook E Huawei is a latecomer to the Windows 2-in-1 party, and its first MateBook shows how green it is. Fortunately, it isn’t one to give up after the first try. It has expanded the MateBook brand to three new devices, and the 2-in-1 MateBook E aims to correct much of its predecessor’s flaws, while making some rather big claims for itself. In terms of specs, the MateBook E is more a direct rival of the Samsung Galaxy Book 12 rather than the Surface Pro. It has the same 7th gen Core i5 at its highest, with 8 GB of RAM, and the same 12-inch 2160×1440 screen, albeit not an AMOLED one. Although it only has room for one USB-C port, it does trump the Galaxy Book in some other areas, like having a 512 GB SSD option and a fingerprint sensor on the volume rocker button. The MateBook E’s biggest appeal, however, will be its relatively diminutive size. Huawei boasts of is 6.9 mm profile and 640 g weight. It is, in effect, pitting itself against the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which is slightly larger in size as well as weight. It does, however, raise the question of thermal management, as there is most likely no room for active cooling. If Hauwei managed to pull that off without a hitch, the MateBook will certainly be the lightest and thinnest 2-in-1 so far. • CPU: 7th gen Intel Core m3/i5 • RAM: 4/8 GB • Storage: 128/256/512 GB • Display: 12-inch 2160×1440 LCD IPS • USB: 1 x USB-C • Battery: 4,430 mAh • Pen: Yes, Wacom (Separate) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 278.8 x 194.1 x 6.9 mm (tablet only) • Weight: 640 g (tablet only), 1,100 g (tablet and keyboard) • Price: TBA (Estimated $1,455) Chuwi SurBook “Best” might not always mean the same things to everyone. It definitely doesn’t always mean having the top of the line things. It usually means having the best of what your money can buy, and money isn’t always infinite. When you’re willing to cut a few corners but still need something quite usable, then Chuwi’s newly minted SurBook might be worth a look. Sure, it’s not going to win this race in term of performance and more, even against the Galaxy Book 10.6’s Core m3. Running the show is a Celeron N3450 (Atom) and you also have the same 128 GB eMMC. It’s also not the most carry-friendly at nearly a kilo. In other areas, however, it is just as competitive and even better than its rivals. It has 6 GB of RAM, more than what Samsung was willing to put in the lower end Galaxy Book. It boasts of the same screen density as the Surface Pro, with a 12.3-inch 2736×1824 display, though definitely not the same screen tech. It has three, yes three, USB ports, one USB-C and two regular USB ports. And the clincher is that it costs less than $500, including the pressure sensitive pen and the keyboard cover. Chuwi is running an Indiegogo campaign for discounts, but slots are extremely limited, so better fly over there if you’re interested. • CPU: Intel Celeron N3450 • RAM: 6 GB • Storage: 64/128 GB eMMC • Display: 12.3-inch 2736×1824 LCD TFT • USB: 1 x USB-C, 2 x USB 3.0 • Battery: 10,000 mAh • Pen: Yes (Included) • Keyboard: Yes (Included) • Dimensions: 297.8 x 203.3 x 9.4 mm • Weight: 967 g • Price: $473/$498 Wrap-up So which Windows 10 2-in-1 tablet is the best? You’ll hate the answer but it doesn’t make it less true. “It depends”. But we can probably whittle the choice down to three. Best in performance: HP Spectre x2 (2017) Sorry Microsoft, it seems that HP has learned its lessons quite well. The 2017 HP Spectre x2 has just the right mix of power and versatility that trumps even the new Microsoft Surface Pro. And it throws in the pen and the keyboard in the price tag, too. If you’re looking for power, this is the one to beat. But, be prepared to also always be looking for a power outlet. Best in mobility: Huawei MateBook E If you were looking for a Windows 10 counterpart of the iPad Pro, then the Huawei MateBook E just answered your prayers. Presuming heat won’t be a problem given how thin it is, this slate offers the best compromise between power and portability. You are giving up one USB-C port you might have ad and you will need to buy the pen separately, but, hey, that’s why they call it a compromise. Best in price: Chuwi SurBook Hands down, this is the cheapest of all, but mind that you do get what you pay for. That’s not to say it will totally stink. The Celeron N3450 still beats the now outdated Atom x5 and x7 you’ll still see in some budget-friendly Windows tablets (like the Lenovo Yoga Book) so it might not be a complete dealbreaker. Considering what some have been able to accomplish even on barely powered older Atoms, you will definitely be able to get work done on the Chuwi SurBook. Unless your work happens to involve editing videos, creating hi-res multi-layer digital paintings, or playing Triple-A games.

Intel’s Newest 10-Core I9 Chips Is Now Coming As A Beast Motherboard Ralphy Bonn SimMay 28, 2017 07:36 PM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email WATCH RELATED VIDEO Submit (Photo : Ethan Miller/Getty Images) New information has been revealed for the upcoming Intel 10-core Skylake X CPU, the i9 7900X which looks like the chip could end up being more powerful. With its 10 core ability, it sports a base clock speed of 4.0GHz that boosts up to 4.5GHz. According to Hot Hardware, the latest details for Intel's i9 series CPUs spotted in a publishedSisoft Sandra benchmark result post. The specifications, however, should be perfectly accurate telling consumers that despite running 10 cores and 20 threads, this chip is still capable of hitting 4.5GHz without any overclocking.

Considering that this Intel's upcoming 10-core i9 chips were initially expected to be clocked far lower. While some tech enthusiasts speculated that this could be a revision on Intel's behalf to counter the potential for AMD's Ryzen CPUs to showcase its performance crown before the end of this year. According to HEXUS, several information about Intel's upcoming 10-core i9 chips were confirmed by listings which include the fact that it has 10MB of level two caches with 1MB for each core and 13.75MB of level 3 cache, along with a TDP of 175W. Another thing is that one of the highlighted features is the Intel CPU detail reveal, where consumers can draw a little information on the motherboard from it. Meanwhile, the Gigabyte X299 Aorus Gaming 7 is an announced motherboard and shows that Gigabyte will be one of the first partners supporting Intel's upcoming PUC design. To make a clearer view, chips like this aren't made for everyday consumers; the added performance of that high clock speed should further ramp up the competition between Intel and AMD that has been both on their momentum since last year's launch of Ryzen. Stay tuned for more updates.

Even at that early stage HEXUS readers poured cold water over the principle of such a processor, especially at its leaked inventory screen price of approx $177 (though it launched in January at $184). Today there are reports that Intel has slashed the price of its 2C/4T Kaby Lake Core i3-7350K chip to $149. I've found this price comes from Newegg, in what appears to be a sales promotion, rather than via any official revised Intel price list. Meanwhile in the UK it still seems to cost £170. The Intel Core i3-7350K runs at a stock base frequency of 4.2GHz (no Turbo Boost is available in the Core i3 family) and according to Bit-Tech it is easily and affordably overclockable "to 4.8GHz or 4.9GHz". In an interesting article dubbed Why the Core i3-7350K Is a Good CPU, back in January that site compared the i3-7350K processor in both application and gaming tests against an i7-7700K with HT disabled, running at stock 3.5GHz and found them to run neck-and-neck in almost all challenges. Back to the price cut news, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see permanent cuts to the Core i3-7350K price as it's been a few months on the market now and AMD's Ryzen 5 processors deliver 4C/8T processing from $169. HEXUS published a thorough review of both the AMD Ryzen 5 1400 and Ryzen 5 1600 (14nm) on Friday, in case you missed it. Our benchmark and performance tables include comparisons with the Intel Core i3-7350K CPU. In April we reported that Intel was accelerating its CPU and platform updates due to AMD pressure. Price cuts could also be part of Intel's strategy. We shall see shortly if any significant new announcements are made by Intel at Computex.

Burleigh: 20 years leading Intel Burleigh handled a range of different jobs during her time with Intel, becoming marketing manager in 2005 before she was handed the Australia and New Zealand MD role in 2005. Intel is the world’s biggest computer chip manufacturer. Jerry Tsao, Intel’s vice president sales and marketing group and general manager regional sales group for Asia Pacific and Japan, said that during her time at the company Burleigh had extended its influence to new areas. “Kate brought a new energy and creativity to the managing director role in Australia and New Zealand,” Tsao said in a statement. “Under her leadership, Intel’s impact extended well beyond our traditional customer base and channels. We thank Kate for the passion and dedication she showed Intel and wish her the best of luck in her future endeavours.” Burleigh said it was the right time to make the move after a long career in a sector renowned for high executive turnover. “I’m proud to say that I joined Intel when Andy Grove was still CEO and I’m as excited today as I was all those years ago about the transformative innovation that Intel is driving,” Burleigh said. “Although it is incredibly hard to leave such a fantastic company and so many great people, the time seems right for me to make a career change and pursue opportunities outside of Intel. I have been privileged to be at the centre of technology transformation thanks to Intel and trust I will have the chance to apply my passion for innovation in my future career.“ Along with growing and maintaining the prominence of a brand which largely lies hidden inside computers and laptops, Burleigh was also an advocate for science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and pushed for smarter government policy on technology. She leaves the role at the end of June with Intel saying it will announce her successor “in due course”. Simon Canning Simon is Mumbrella's marketing and advertising editor.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Best Dividend Stocks in Virtual Reality Microsoft, Intel, IBM, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm are all putting serious resources into capturing a share of the burgeoning VR market -- and paying their investors while they do so. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 28, 2017 at 4:46PM The virtual reality (VR) market is expected to be worth about $34 billion annually by 2022. Tech investors are understandably excited about this expanding opportunity, particularly as giants like Facebook and Alphabet make huge plays in the space. Those looking to benefit from this fast-growing market -- and receive a dividend at the same time -- should consider what Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) are doing in virtual reality.  Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft Microsoft folds its augmented reality and virtual reality pursuits into one category that it calls "mixed reality." That can be a bit confusing when it comes to parsing the success of the separate formats, but just know that Microsoft is making very early moves into what could become a transformative play in the virtual space.  The company's HoloLens headset is its most outward-facing mixed reality play right now. The device allows its users to see holographic images overlaid into the real world, and developers are exploring a wide array of possibilities for the tech. It can give people new ways to view industrial equipment, could be used in the training of surgeons by overlaying real-world images with digital information, and may transform how we communicate with others through telepresence.  But one of the most important aspects of mixed reality that Microsoft investors should focus on are its efforts to use it as the foundation of a new computing platform. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has suggested that virtual reality might be the next major tech platform, and the Windows-maker is treating it that way. As PC Magazine wrote back in April, "Microsoft is building a software and device ecosystem around the Windows Mixed Reality platform, formerly known as Windows Holographic." Microsoft is already partnering with device makers to launch a version of its mixed reality software, which runs a version of Windows 10, this year. On top of its aggressive mixed reality pursuit, Microsoft is also a solid dividend play for income investors. It is currently yielding 2.3%, with a 66% payout ratio, and a 13-year streak of dividend hikes behind it. NVIDIA Don't worry if you've overlooked NVIDIA as a dividend player in the past. The company only started paying one out back in 2012, and it's admittedly yielding far less than other companies in VR space; its current trailing 12-month yield is just 0.37%, with a payout ratio of 18.9%. Despite it not being the most lucrative dividend stock, investors should keep two things in mind about this company: First, it has massive potential in VR; and second, the stock appears to have a lot of room to grow. Gaming is one of the most important segments of VR, and NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) already dominate the discrete desktop GPU space -- which is key to gaming -- with a 70.5% market share. That means that when PC manufacturers are in need of high-end graphics processing power (which VR eats up by the bowl-full), they most often look to NVIDIA.  NVIDIA has been doing its own part to help the VR market expand by releasing a suite of APIs to assist developers in creating VR games and apps, and has even released its own VR game to show off the capabilities of its products. Additionally, NVIDIA is helping the PC market adapt by launching VR-ready graphics cards for notebooks, which helps expand the computing platforms that can fully handle VR beyond the realm of high-powered PCs.  Intel  Intel's bet on VR may be more muted than other tech players, but it isn't all that different than NVIDIA's in some regards. The chipmaker expects that more powerful (and expensive) processors will be needed to power PCs and VR headsets as this market expands, which it hopes will result in it selling more chips.  Intel is already marketing some of its chips for the VR market; for example, on its website, it says that its iCore 7 processor helps create "a great VR experience." To help show off its processors' capabilities, Intel is working its own VR headset, called Project Alloy, which has an Intel chip embedded in the device itself, allowing it to operate untethered from a computer. It's worth noting here that Alloy is expected to run a version of Microsoft's mixed reality software when it launches at the end of this year.  Intel is solid bet for both VR and income investors. Its shares currently yield 2.9%, and the company sports a payout ratio of about 45%. Qualcomm Like Intel, Qualcomm is jumping into the VR fray through its processors and a headset developer kit. The company is putting its Snapdragon 835 processor into the standalone headset, along with other chips for wireless connectivity and memory.  The device will ship by the second half of this year and can be used without having to be tethered to a computer. In fact, at Google's I/O conference earlier this month Qualcomm and Google announced that the chipmaker is working with Google to bring untethered Daydream VR headsets to market later this year, which will also be powered by the Snapdragon 835 processor. Aside from its growing VR opportunities, Qualcomm has an impressive dividend yield of 3.6%, and 14 consecutive years of dividend growth. IBM I know, I know -- IBM seemed like an unlikely VR play to me too -- at first. But it turns out that the company's Watson artificial intelligence platform has virtual reality applications as well. IBM recently partnered with game maker Ubisoft to incorporate speech recognition and cognitive capabilities from its Watson into the latest Star Trek virtual reality game. According to IBM, gamers will be able to speak commands in the game, and Watson will help the system parse what they're saying and respond appropriately in a way that games have never been able to do before. The company also recently launched a developer kit specifically designed to help content creators incorporate natural language processing into VR software. As IBM noted in a recent press release, "We are only just seeing the impact of virtual and augmented reality and IBM is committed to providing developers with the tools they need to innovate and be competitive in this AI and Cognitive era." IBM is just shy of Dividend Aristocrat status, having raised its payout every year for the past 22 years. Its current yield is a solid 3.7%, with a 46% payout ratio, which gives investors looking to profit from VR (and AI) a nice incentive to bet on IBM's prospects.

This is essentially a refresh of current 24-inch designs, with the addition of an Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core CPU, 32GB of RAM, and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050 GPU, making this all-in-one a candidate for some decent mainstream gaming at 1080p. Indeed, the 23.8-inch IPS panel is FHD (1920x1080). It also features what Asus calls NanoEdge, which means it sports a 2mm bezel that gives the display a 90% screen-to-body ratio, according to Asus. The ZN242 includes a re-worked stand that boasts a much different design than previous versions and a pop-up infrared camera that, in conjunction with Windows Hello, provides facial recognition from up to 4m away. Asus Zen AIO ZN242 (High-End Configuration) Processor Intel Core i7-7700HQ (4C/8T, 2.8-3.8GHz, 6MB L3, 14nm, 45w) Memory 32 GB Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (640 CUDA Cores) Displays 23.8" Asus NanoEdge: 1080p, IPS Storage SSD (PCIe): 512 GB HDD: Unspecified Sizes w/Intel Optane Cache Rear Ports 4x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x USB 2.0 Type-A RJ45 Ethernet Headset Jack Microphone Jack Under the hood, the system comes with either a 512GB PCIe SSD or an HDD coupled with Intel Optane memory. (We’re probably going to be seeing lots of new systems with those kinds of options this week.). Unfortunately Asus hasn't detailed anything besides the maximum configuration, so it's not clear what the other options are with regards to CPUs and GPUs. Meanwhile we’re always curious about ventilation, especially when you’re talking about this kind of processing power and discrete graphics. Although we didn’t get a look inside, there are vents in the underside of the chassis, along with a vented Asus logo on the back — a clever touch that would be more effective if the company had a much longer name. An Asus representative said that the Zen AiO ZN242 will be available in September, but the company has not announced pricing. Other details, such as color gamut support, were also not being discussed. Fritz Nelson Contributed to this Report Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 1 Comments View All Comments Glock24 - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link I'll guess around $1500 for the price, as this is essentially a laptop in AiO form, and laptops with those specs are in that price range. Would be nice to get lower specced configurations for office use.

This very high end part will be at the top of the new X-series processors that will apparently stretch from four cores to that huge 18 core offering, adding two cores with each step, according to Videocardz's sources. All of these processors will use the X299 chipset and LGA 2066 socket, but they will not all have the same set of features. Only the 7820X and above will have Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 and support up to four channel DDR4 2666 RAM. Naturally these CPUs will also have different TDPs, with some coming in at 165 W, others at 140 W, and the 7640X and 7740X (both quad-core parts) will be at 112 W. The X-series is going to have new boxes as well, and according to a chart Videocardz put together, the 10 core/20 thread 7900X and lower CPUs will be launching in June, while the 12 core/24 thread 7920X will be launching in August. The higher end 7940X, 7960X, and 7980XE do not have a launch date specified yet. The chart also shows a range of base and turbo clock speeds, from 3.3 GHz/4.5GHz for the 7900X to 4.0 GHz/4.2 GHz for the 7640X. Check it out if you want to see where these CPUs will fall, but the top of the chart is lacking a lot of data currently.

At the Asus press conference held ahead of Computex on Monday, the latest addition to the family was announced, and it appears to be a more-than-worthy successor. We managed to get to have a quick play with it, and we were impressed. Zenbook Pro UX550 is a revamp of the original Zenbook Pro launched a couple of years ago, and it looks like Asus has really gone to the next level in terms of battery life and portability. It’s slim, light, rocking some great specs, and as we’ve come to expect from the Zenbook range, it's a bit of a looker. Asus shaved almost 2mm off the earlier model at 18.9mm ,and the weight has dropped from 2.26kg to a mere 1.8kg. Pocket-lint Asus Vivo Book Pro S15: The world’s first laptop with Intel Optane Asus Zenbook Flip S: Super thin convertible jam packed with top-shelf kit Asus ZenBook 3 review: A super-thin MacBook killer? Asus says it has a whopping 14-hour battery life and can charge to 60-per cent capacity in 49 minutes. All of which is even more impressive when you look at what’s under the hood. The top-shelf model runs on Intel’s H-series core i7 processor and boasts a Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics card. With up to 1TB of PCIe x4 SSD storage and 16GB DDR4 RAM, this machine is packing serious power in a small package. The display is another strong point with a 15.6-inch UHD 4K NanoEdge - meaning super slim, 7.3 mm bezels that give an 83-per cent screen-to-body ratio. Asus says it runs at 100 per cent of the sRGB colour gamut and certainly was a vibrant pleasure to behold. There’s a quad speaker set up for the Harman Kardon surround-sound audio, which we didn’t manage to test but which sounds promising. One rather odd decision for a device which otherwise seems to be catering to people working with video and photos is the lack of a full-size SD card slot. However the rest of the port set up is more than reasonable with two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB 3.1 ports a full sized HDMI port, and a micro SD card reader. We liked the feel of the keyboard, too.

The Zenbook Pro will ship with either Windows 10 Pro or Home. The now-familiar concentric brushed aluminium finish and diamond-cut silver edges round off a nice-looking machine. Arguably, the best bit is the price, though. Asus says it will start off at just over a £1,000, which, considering that this is a top-end device with some excellent capabilities, is an extremely competitive price. The Zenbook Pro is set to hit the streets in July, and we look forward to reviewing it between now and then.

At a special event ahead of the Computex 2017 trade show in Taipei, ASUS has announced a quintet of new laptops in its ZenBook and VivoBook series. The lineup is led by the ZenBook Pro, the new star of the company's premium notebook family, which boasts seventh-gen Intel Core i7 (H-series) processors, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti GPU and configurations with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of PCIe 3.0 (4x) SSD storage — all in a sleek metal unibody with ASUS's trademark two-tone color design. Along with those leading internals, the ZenBook Pro packs a 15.6-inch 4K display with an 83% screen-to-body ratio and a Harman Kardon audio system. Powering that whole assembly is a 74WHr battery promising 14-hour longevity, and quick charging that'll refill to 60 percent in just 49 minutes, along with Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. Pricing for the ZenBook Pro starts at $1,299 — likely with at a configuration somewhere below the maxed-out 16GB/1TB option. ASUS' ZenBook Flip S claims the title of world's thinnest convertible. At the other end of the spectrum, the new ASUS ZenBook Flip S claims the title of world's thinnest convertible laptop, with a thickness of just 10.9mm and a 360-degree steel hinge, allowing it to be contorted into a wide range of positions. It's powered by Intel's latest U-series Core i5 and i7 processors, and available with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, and ships with a 13.3-inch 4K touchscreen boasting an 80% screen-to-body ratio. It uses the same quick charging tech as ASUS's other premium ZenBooks, with 11.5 hours of use quoted. For $1,099 you're getting quite an impressive piece of kit, however the maxed-out RAM-plus-storage config will likely set you back a good bit more. For buyers who don't need a discrete GPU and gaming-class performance but still want an attractive, capable 14-inch machine, there's the ZenBook 3 Deluxe. If this sounds familiar, it's because we already got a first look at it at CES in January. Internal specs are largely the same as that of the ZenBook Flip S, with a few important differences. There's a larger 14-inch Full HD display, with a large 84% screen-to-body ratio. It's constructed out of aerospace-grade aluminum, and is the first notebook to feature Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection, matching the toughness of leading smartphone displays. Like the ZenBook Pro, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity is supported, allowing you to connect external 4K monitors or hook up an external GPU. Pricing for the base model starts at $1,199. ASUS is also doubling down on affordable laptops with premium specs, through its VivoBook series. The VivoBook S starts at $499 with a 15-inch Full HD panel (80% screen-to-body ratio), and U-series Core i5/i7 processors. It's available with "up to" a GeForce 940MX GPU — suggesting the base model will come with integrated graphics — and configurable with up to a 512GB SSD + 2TB HDD, and up to 16GB of RAM. (Again, don't expect to get all those extras for anywhere near the $499 baseline price.) You'll also miss out on the ZenBook line's gorgeous two-tone metal aesthetic, nevertheless, the VivoBook line's slightly chunkier chassis are attractive enough, especially considering the starting price. The VivoBook S and VivoBook Pro target price-conscious buyers who still want premium performance. For price-conscious buyers wanting more power, the ASUS VivoBook Pro steps up to a 4K display, H-series Core i5 and i7 chips, and up to a GTX 1050 GPU and Harman Kardon audio. On the software side, ASUS's new laptops support the latest Windows 10 features like one-touch login through Windows Hello (optional on the VivoBook models), Windows Ink (with the ASUS Pen bundled with the ZenBook Flip S) and Modern Standby. So between a bewildering array of SKUs, configurable options and price points, ASUS' latest professional-grade laptops should have something to suit most buyers' tastes. No word on release dates for ASUS's new notebooks yet, but we'd expect them to land later this year. Stay tuned for hands-on coverage from Taipei!

I do agree that MS's offering isn't necessarily those most awe inspiring, when compared to what's out now. However, without their initial lead in this category, I doubt the market would have as many options today. It says a lot that competitors are inspired enough by a form factor to create something just as good or better to compete with the likes of the Surface Pro and Surface Book. I certainly appreciate the options that are and will be available. Now, I don't have to limit myself to just MS products to get a premium machine in those form factors...and at a better price point in some cases. 4 6 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Thank you Vincent. -1 6 days ago Reply DJCBS I don't disagree.

Whether or not students should be spending money on these premium laptops is another argument. The fact of the matter is that students are. So it is entirely reasonable that the Surface laptop can be marketed as a device for college students. Because MSFT, like it or not, is an American company and caters to their home market the majority of the time. 0 6 days ago Reply Ivan05il MS is failing in mobile phones, but it brought new life to the laptop market.

The announcements at ASUS's Taipei press conference today weren't limited to super-high-end products like the ZenBook Pro. The company also debuted two new, more affordable devices in its VivoBook range, with specs to rival expensive competitors, and hardware designs that look good, but won't turn quite as many heads. Both the VivoBook S and VivoBook Pro are 15.6-inchers, with the main difference between the two being U-series and H-series Intel chips, and NVIDIA 940MX versus GTX 1050 graphics. They're decidedly mainstream-looking laptops, with such crazy things as full-sized SD card slots and Ethernet ports littering the sides. But maybe that's just what you're after in a notebook. Let's take a closer look. Sensible, but powerful. The VivoBook Pro packs top-tier internals into a smart but indistinctive chassis. It's got an aluminum frame decorated with ASUS's concentric circle pattern and an inner body that looks... well, rather plain, but not ugly by any means. ASUS's flagship VivoBook includes the same seventh-generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors as the more expensive ZenBook Pro, along with the same top RAM configuration of 16GB — plus 512GB SSD + 2TB HDD storage options. Other similarities include a GTX 1050 GPU on the inside (not to be confused with the more powerful 1050Ti inside the ZenBook Pro), plus a one-touch fingerprint scanner for Windows Hello, and similar Harman Kardon audio chops. (Which is to say this thing can pump out some seriously loud, clear, bassy audio.) And yes, the display is still a beautiful 4K panel, with 100% sRGB color gamut coverage. So basically, you're looking at the core experience of a ZenBook Pro, in a less trailblazing chassis design, and at a considerable discount. The base model VivoBook Pro starts at $799, compared to $1,299 for the entry-level ZenBook Pro — though don't expect an i7 and the quoted RAM and storage options above at this price. There's actually a lot about the VivoBook Pro that feels a little enterprisey, and I suspect this model may find an audience with professionals who value performance, but also want legacy ports and connectors, a large bank of internal storage. The same target customer might balk at the recent trend towards super-thin notebooks, and dongles and adapters. All that stuff is built into the VivoBook Pro. Even then, it doesn't feel excessively frumpy or heavy compared to the ZenBook Pro. The weight is comparable, and the impact extra thickness is diminished by the fact that these are both 15.6-inch laptops to begin with. ASUS has the solution to your #donglelife nightmares. At a price tier below the VivoBook Pro, there's the VivoBook S. The main downgrade here is the move to an NVIDIA 940MX GPU, which will put a dent in the machine's gaming and video production potential. But for general use, the U-series Intel Core i5 and i7 chips should more than suffice, and buyers seeking a more manageable notebook will appreciate the 3.3 pound weight and slimmer dimensions. With pricing starting at $499 (likely without a discrete GPU, nor the top-end CPU, RAM or storage options), the VivoBook S could strike a compelling balance for a performance laptop that won't break the bank. While the computing potential of both VivoBook models may be similar to their prettier ZenBook-branded siblings, we're looking at a different set of priorities in these machines. Performance is key, and everything else is secondary. And if that matches up with your own buying preferences, the VivoBook S and VivoBook Pro may well be worthy of you consideration.

The CPU inside the machine is an Intel Core i7-7700HQ and the graphics are handled by an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU. ASUS also outed the ZenBook Flip S. That machine is billed as the “world’s thinnest convertible” and packs a 4K display for entertainment. These first two products are definitely aimed at the high-end market, but ASUS has some new stuff for the mainstream masses as well reports CNET. The mainstream products include new VivoBooks with 7th gen Intel processors. via CNET Those mainstream machines also have discrete graphics via GeForce GTX 1050 GPUs. The lower-end VivoBook S15 packs in a GeForce GTX 940 GPU. According to CNET that was it for ASUS at Computex this year. If you were hoping for some new information on the Zenbo robot, none was offered. Zenbo was one of the coolest things announced at the show last year. That fact disappointed IDC VP of Client Devices Bryan Ma. He said the lack of any new information makes Zenbo seem to be a side project for ASUS.

To create such a compact convertible, Asus constructed a new ergo lift hinge design that's made of steel alloy and measures just 3.9mm in thickness. This mechanism should also see users through opening and closing the notebook at least 20,000 times.  Meanwhile, the body is made of aerospace-grade aluminum, and for cooling Asus has gone with an ultra-thin vapor-chamber cooling system. Another core piece of the ZenBook Flip S is a 13.3-inch nano edge 4K UHD display that features ultra-thin 6.11mm bezels. With a touchscreen the ZenBook Flip S also fully supports Windows Ink and works in tandem with the Asus Pen to offer 1,024 levels of precision, as well as reading 10 to 300 grams of force. Windows Hello is also fully supported with an integrated fingerprint sensor. Modern Standby combined with Instant Resume features see the laptop waking up from sleep three times faster than other laptops. This is partially thanks to the ZenBook Flip S's speedy hardware, which includes the latest Intel Core i7 CPUs with up to 1TB PCIe SSDs and 16GB of DDR3 RAM. The Asus ZenBook Flip S starts at $1,099, with Asus yet to provide details about availability. Find out how this compares to the Surface Pro 4 Timelord science Asus also announced the ZenBook 3 Deluxe, which the company calls most prestigious laptop in the world. Measuring 12.9mm and weighing just 1.1kg, it's incredibly light and thin for a 14-inch laptop in a 13-inch notebook shell. This is made possible by its chassis being made of aerospace-grade metal.  The Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe also sees the same nano-edge display as the ZenBook Flip S, although here there's also a 0.55mm thin sheet of Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for the cover glass.  Configurations go up to an Intel Core i7, 1TB PCIe SSD and 16GB of RAM. If you want more power the laptop also connects to Asus' external GPU solution, the XG Station 2. In terms of inputs, it includes a glass-covered touchpad and fully backlit keyboard. The ZenBook 3 Deluxe also features a quad-speaker setup with Harmon Kardon's Smart Amp technology, to make it three times louder than your average laptop. Asus has set the starting price for the ZenBook 3 Deluxe at $1,199, but again, hasn't mentioned availability. Move over MacBook Pro Rounding out the trio of Ultrabook announcements was the Asus ZenBook Pro. It amps up the power with an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti and Intel Core i7 H-series (read: quad-core) processors. Over other ZenBooks, the Pro is further upgradable to a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD and 16GB DDR4 RAM. Despite all this power the ZenBook Pro is also thin and light at just 18.9mm thick and 1.8kg in weight. The 15.6-inch nano-edge 4K display is no slouch either. The Pro also features a 14 hour battery life thanks to a 73WHr battery and can charge up to 60% after 49 minutes. Quad-speakers also find their way to the Pro for a 2.5x louder sound and 1.6x wider frequency response. The Asus ZenBook Pro starts at $1,299 with no word on availability. Viva la VivoBook Beyond its ZenBook announcements, Asus also brought out a new VivoBook S. It's a run-of-mill 15.6-inch laptop with a regular Intel Core i7, Nvidia GeForce 940MX, though, you can add some serious add-ons including an 2TB HDD plus a 512GB SSD and 16GB of RAM.  It's all packed into an 17.9mm thick and 1.5kg aluminum chassis. Asus has also honed the screen-to-body ratio to 80% thanks to its 7.8mm bezels. This 15-incher starts at $499. If you're looking for something that's a step up but not the ZenBook Pro, the Asus VivoBook Pro similarly features Intel Core i7 H-series CPUs along with the Nvidia GTX 1050, all of which is kept from overheating by a dual-fan cooling system. The cherry on top is a 4K UHD 15.6-inch display that renders 100% of the RGB color gamut. This last entry comes in at a starting price of $799.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Intel Wants to Replace USB with Thunderbolt 3 Azeem Ullah 7 days ago People who hate dongle hell can rejoice because one of the more advanced (and speediest) connections out there just got a huge boost. Thunderbolt 3 is among the most critically-acclaimed data-transfer standards right now. It was held back by its limited availability and high cost. But not anymore. Thankfully Intel, its main backer, is removing some of those barriers in a bid to help it achieve mainstream status. Fast and Easy to Use There are several reasons as to why Thunderbolt 3 is being touted as the standard most PCs should be using. For one, it is reversible as it uses the Type-C standard, which allows it to be much more hassle-free than past standards. Further, it is one of the fastest ports around with a peak transfer rate of 40 GB/s. USB ports by comparison can only reach 10 GB/s at best. Thunderbolt 3 is capable of transferring a 4K movie within 30 seconds However, as it has been mentioned several times, the costs of Thunderbolt 3 accessories such as cables also need to be lowered. No Royalties To reduce the price of Thunderbolt 3 ports, Intel won’t be charging a royalty fee from manufacturers who choose to license Thunderbolt 3 on their devices. Secondly, the company is also increasing support for Thunderbolt 3 via its 7th-generation Core processors, which will bring the necessary power to handle the extra oomph brought by the port. The move can also give it another competitive edge in the fight against AMD. There are currently 120 PCs which use the combination of Intel Core processors and Thunderbolt 3, a number which is said to swell to 150 by the end of this year. However, these systems have almost exclusively consisted of high-end machines, such as the new MacBook Pro laptops that only bring Thunderbolt ports for connectivity. A Dongle-less Future? The news can potentially open up even more options for technologies like virtual reality, gaming and all others that need to handle large amounts of data to thrive. It also takes us one step towards a future – with one single dongle – to handle everything.

Live Watch Top Democrat on House Intel Committee calls for review of Kushner's security clearance By Nicki Rossoll Close Follow on Twitter More from Nicki May 28, 2017, 10:14 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayJ. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo WATCH Rep. Adam Schiff says 'there ought to be a review' of Kushner's security clearance 0 Shares Email The House Intelligence Committee's top Democrat called for a review of Jared Kushner's security clearance over questions of whether he was truthful about his contacts with Russia. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, spoke to ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an exclusive interview on "This Week" Sunday in the wake of revelations that Kushner, the son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, talked to the Russian ambassador about establishing a back channel for communications in December, before Trump took office. “If these allegations are true and he had discussions with the Russians about establishing a backchannel and didn't reveal that, that's a real problem in terms of whether he should maintain that kind of a security clearance,” Schiff said. "There ought to be a review of his security clearance to find out whether he was truthful, whether he was candid" about his Russia contacts, Schiff added in an apparent reference to what Kushner may have submitted in the security clearance application process. "If not, than there's no way he can maintain that kind of a clearance." Kushner, who met with the Russian ambassador in December along with Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, asked for back-channel communications to discuss Syria and other policy matters, sources told ABC News. The Democratic National Committee is calling for Kushner's security clearance to be suspended until the federal investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump associates is completed. "The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house," the DNC deputy communications director Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday. "Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete." U.S. intelligence operatives reportedly learned about Kushner's interest in back-channel talks through communications that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had with Moscow. Raddatz said Kislyak must know "he’s being monitored all the time" and asked Schiff if it was possible the Russians wanted U.S. intelligence to hear what the Russian ambassador said about Kushner. "Could it be a ruse" by Russia to get Americans to suspect Kushner? Raddatz asked. Schiff responded, "Certainly in dealings with the Russians, they're very sophisticated, you always have to take into consideration that the Russians may be doing things that are designed to throw you off the track or provoke discord." He added, though, that "it's hard to understand ... why this would be some kind of a Russian ruse. Why would they want to undermine the very government that they hope to have a good relationship with?" Schiff said that he expects Kushner to be asked to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.

The update not only improves the device’s stability and touch functionality, but also enhances the Surface Pro 4’s battery life when it is in Sleep Mode.  ( Microsoft ) Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 is set to get a massive maintenance update. The company tweaked the sleep and hibernation modes to improve the device's battery life, as well as enhance the system's stability. The Surface Pro 4's firmware update also improves the device's brightness control and system functionality. During the Windows 10 OS' unveiling, Microsoft promised that it would roll out regular firmware updates for its software and hardware platforms. The arrival of the Surface Pro 4's update evidences that the Redmond-based has stayed true to its word. Surface Pro 4 Update Improves Battery Life On Thursday, May 25, Microsoft rolled out the firmware update for its Surface Pro 4 2-in-1 device. The Surface Pro 4 firmware update comes inclusive of features such as Intel Precise Touch Device, Surface System Aggregator Firmware, and Surface Integration drivers. These features were introduced and released in April this year for all Microsoft devices running on Windows 10 version 1703 (Creators Update).The features are currently available for Windows 10 Version 1511 (November Update) and also Windows 10 Version 1607 (Anniversary Update). Apart from these inclusions, Microsoft's Surface team also upgraded the drivers for the Surface Touch Servicing ML, Surface Embedded Controller Firmware, Surface UEFI, and Surface Touch. These drivers were updated to fix screen brightness problems when the device wakes up from the Sleep Mode. Apart from the enhancement in the touch functionality, the Surface Pro 4 firmware update will also improve the brightness settings, adjust the hibernation defaults, make the device more stable to extend battery life during sleep, and disable the touch functionality when the laptop's cover is closed. Surface Pro 4 Firmware Update: What Does It Bring? The new Surface Pro 4 update brings a Microsoft driver upgrade for Surface Embedded Controller Firmware (103.1684.256.0), which will enhance the battery capacity of the device while the Surface Pro 4 is on Sleep Mode. The Intel Corporation driver update for Intel (R) Precise Touch Device with build number 1.2.0.83 is also available for the Surface Pro 4. This update not only enhances the device stability, but also disables the touch functionality when the cover is closed. The Surface driver update with firmware version 1.0.121.0 for Surface Integration fine-tunes the system's Hibernation defaults. The Microsoft driver update for Surface Touch Servicing ML updates the touch functionality. This system upgrade comes with the version number 1.0.724.0. The Surface System Aggregator update resolves screen brightness problems when device wakes up from the Sleep Mode. The Surface UEFI driver update with firmware version 106.1624.768.0 and Surface Touch Microsoft Driver update (57.1.1.1 ) aim to optimize touch functionality. "When Surface updates are provided via the Windows Update service, they are delivered in stages to Surface customers. As a result, not every Surface will receive the update at the same time, but the update will be delivered to all devices," Microsoft notes. A Surface Pro 4 user can download the firmware update from the Microsoft Windows Update page. However, one must ensure that the Surface Pro 4 is running on Windows 10 OS as these drivers and firmware are only compatible with the Windows 10 platform.

Reuters More On: israel Trump's postponed promise on Israel Linda Sarsour's commencement speech sparks small protest Dems' problem is with the working class, empty climate promises & other comments Team Trump holds off on moving embassy to Jerusalem Wondering where to find the next tech startup propelling humanity to the next best thing? Israel’s answer to Silicon Valley is Silicon Wadi, an area around Tel Aviv on the country’s coastal plain with a heavy concentration of high-tech industries that rivals the San Francisco Bay Area’s cluster of innovative firms. There are about 4,300 startups operating in Israel, with about 2,900 of these located within a 10-mile radius, a rate of development second in intensity to only Silicon Valley itself. Even as President Trump was meeting with the Israeli political elite on the Jerusalem leg of his first foreign trip, a huge slice of that country’s brain trust was gathered in Midtown Manhattan to explore the reasons behind this tech wave and showcase some of the developments that have enabled this small country to punch above its weight. Or maybe jumping would be a more apt metaphor. “The cat flea has the ability to jump almost 200 times its height,” Oded Shoseyov, a professor of protein engineering and nano biotechnology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told the crowd at Nexus: Israel, a gathering sponsored by the American Friends of Hebrew University. Shoseyov, who has his name on more than 50 patents and has served as the scientific founder of 10 companies specializing in everything from nanotechnology to production of medical cannabis, says one of the most exciting scientific quests is understanding the jumping power of the flea. That and other marvels of nature are helping spark solutions to real-world challenges faced by humans. CollPlant, one of the companies he helped found, is attempting to bioengineer solutions to these problems by cloning human DNA onto tobacco plants. “I have no doubt that we’ll be able to produce a human heart in the laboratory,” he says. “This heart is not going to be the same as a human heart, it’s going to be better.” One of the more established players in both Silicon Valley and its Middle Eastern rival is Intel Corp., which set up a research and production operation in Israel in 1972. Intel Israel has since grown to the point where it has become Israel’s largest private employer, with more than 10,200 workers on its payroll as of last year. According to Maxine Fassberg, executive in residence and vice president of Intel Capital, the company exported $3.35 billion of chips and other products from Israel last year, accounting for 1 percent to 2 percent of the country’s GDP. In addition to the tech developments fostered by Intel, Fassberg credits both Israel’s defense sector and its academia for propelling this development. “The bottom line is the people and the quality of the education there,” she says. For his part, Dr. Yaron Daniely, chief executive of Yissum, Hebrew University’s technology transfer arm, and himself the driving force behind many Israeli developments in medical technology, credits the amazing performance of Israeli R&D to “chutzpah,” shown in the willingness of the country’s scientists and entrepreneurs to take on risk. “Exceptional people exist everywhere who are more creative than others, but that doesn’t guarantee success,” he points out. “We were arrogant Israelis. We didn’t think that we were stupid.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under israel ,  patents ,  silicon valley ,  tel aviv Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jeff Bezos does the unthinkable with new Amazon book store Read Next Jeff Bezos does the unthinkable with new Amazon book store Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 199,033 Mary Kay Letourneau's husband: We only split so I could sell pot 86,494 'Kushnergate' is a big fat nothing-burger 37,202 Doctors warn women against putting wasp nests in their vaginas Now On Ariana Grande rocks ‘One Love Manchester’ benefit concert Katie Holmes enrolls at Harvard Business School Rev.

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs May 30, 2017 How Business “Partnerships” Flopped at America’s Largest University by Lawrence Wittner by Tweet Email The State University of New York (SUNY)―the largest university in the United States, with nearly 600,000 students located in 64 publicly-funded higher education institutions―has served an important educational function for the people of New York and of the United States. But its recent “partnerships” with private businesses have been far less productive. In the spring of 2013, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, joined by businessmen, politicians, and top SUNY administrators, embarked upon a widely-publicized barnstorming campaign to get the state legislature to adopt a plan he called Tax-Free NY. Under its provisions, most of the SUNY campuses, portions of the City University of New York, and zones adjacent to SUNY campuses would be thrown open to private, profit-making companies that would be exempt from state and local taxes on sales, property, the income of their owners, and the income of their employees for a period of ten years. Tax-Free NY, Cuomo announced, was “a game-changing initiative” that would “transform SUNY campuses and university communities across the state.” According to the governor, this program would “supercharge” the state’s economy and bring job creation to an unprecedented level. Conceding that these tax-free zones wouldn’t work without a dramatic “culture shift” in the SUNY system, Cuomo argued that the faculty should “get interested and participate in entrepreneurial activities.” Despite criticism of the program by educators, unions, and even some conservatives, SUNY administrators and local officials fell into line. Reluctant to challenge the governor and oppose this widely-touted jobs creation measure, the state legislature established the program, renamed Start-Up NY and including some private colleges, in June 2013. Start-Up NY quickly acquired considerable momentum.  Hundreds of tax-free zones were established at New York colleges and universities, most of them on SUNY campuses, with numerous administrators hired to oversee the development of the new commercial programs. New York State launched a very expensive Start-Up NY television advertising campaign around the nation, with ads focused on the theme: “New York: Open for Business.” SUNY’s chancellor, Nancy Zimpher, proclaimed: “Nowhere in the country do new businesses . . . stand to benefit more by partnering with higher education than in New York State, thanks to the widespread success of Governor Cuomo’s Start-Up NY program. With interest and investment coming in from around the globe and new jobs being created in every region, Start-Up NY has provided a spark for our economy and for SUNY.” This was, she declared, a “transformative initiative.” Although no one seems to know―or at least has revealed―just how much Start-Up NY has actually cost New York State, it has certainly been quite expensive. Back in 2013, the governor’s budget office estimated that it would cost $323 million over the next three years. That figure did not include the lost tax revenue to localities. And what has it produced for the state? After three years of operation―2014, 2015, and 2016―that question is answered by the official reports of Empire State Development (New York’s official economic development agency). In 2014, Start-Up NY produced 76 jobs. In 2015, it produced 332 jobs. And, in 2016, it produced 757 jobs. Deducting 30 jobs apparently lost somewhere along the way, Empire State Development claimed a grand total of 1,135 jobs were developed by Start-Up NY. Although 1,135 jobs might strike observers as a remarkably small increase in the state’s total workforce of over 9 million people, it’s actually an inflated figure. According to Empire State Development, only 722 of these jobs could be considered “net new jobs.” Many of the participating companies did not really create new jobs at all, but simply moved their operations to another region of the state to avail themselves of Start-Up NY’s tax breaks. Moreover, it’s far from clear that Start-Up NY’s tax breaks were necessary for businesses to hire these 722 workers. After all, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were years of recovery from the Great Recession, during which employment in New York State grew by 168,401 jobs. What about the benefit of the program to SUNY? According to the SUNY administration, at the beginning of 2017, half of all SUNY schools had become sponsors of Start-Up NY businesses, with 201 campus “partnerships.” Although Chancellor Zimpher has spoken enthusiastically about the program’s “academic benefits for our faculty and students,” her examples are less than convincing. Yes, the participating companies paid SUNY a modest rental for their use of campus facilities. But this business use deprived SUNY faculty and students of their ability to avail themselves of these same facilities―including buildings, classroom space, labs, and advanced machinery and equipment. The chancellor also pointed to 134 students who had interned at Start-Up businesses and 121 who had gone to work for Start-Up firms. But these figures are not impressive when set against SUNY’s student enrollment of nearly 600,000. Perhaps most significant, what is the academic merit of devoting university teaching or education to producing or marketing corporate projects? Shouldn’t the role of higher education be the advancement and diffusion of knowledge? Actually, New York State has developed another―and certainly larger―university-business “partnership”: SUNY Polytechnic Institute. In some ways, it is much like Start-Up NY, for it involves the use of public funding and SUNY resources to assist profit-making businesses. In the case of SUNY Poly, however, the participants are giant corporations and the capital investments, by the state and by the corporations, are enormous: an estimated $43 billion. SUNY Poly’s College of Nanoscale Sciences and Engineering (located in Albany and usually referred to as the NanoCollege) alone is reportedly a $24 billion enterprise, whose onsite corporations include IBM, Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and TSM―in all, hundreds of corporate “partners,” many of them Fortune 500 tech companies. SUNY Poly’s operations are very opaque, and it is extremely difficult to determine how much money is going where. An Albany Times Union journalist told me that he has been working for more than thirteen years to “crack the SUNY Poly secret,” but, “like the meaning of life, I can’t figure it out.” His problems were enhanced by the fact that, until recent, SUNY Poly didn’t recognize Freedom of Information law requests and, even since then, delayed responding until the last possible date set by the law. Even so, it appears that SUNY Poly owes its meteoric rise to the opening, in 1997, of the Center for Environmental Sciences and Technology Management as a component of SUNY/Albany. Developed and headed by Alain Kaloyeros, a colorful, wheeler-dealer physicist, this entity was eventually expanded into the NanoCollege with the assistance of a $1 billion investment by the New York State government. This public funding was supposed to attract business investment. And it did, with the money soon rolling in. When Governor Cuomo took office in January 2011, he made the NanoCollege a centerpiece of his statewide economic development program. Kaloyeros became not only the highest-paid public employee in New York, but a key advisor to the governor on economic development and university-corporate “partnerships.” Drawing upon Cuomo’s staunch backing, as well as upon the vast corporate and state funding he amassed, Kaloyeros began buying up property across the state for new facilities under his control. The first, Nano Utica, was announced in October 2013, and involved a $200 million state investment in a computer chip manufacturing and research center to be run by the NanoCollege and the SUNY Institute of Technology. Announcing the venture, Governor Cuomo declared that “this partnership demonstrates how the new New York is making targeted investments to . . . take advantage of the strengths of our world class universities.” As Kaloyeros’ empire grew, he decided to pull the NanoCollege out of SUNY/Albany and, in 2014, announced the formation of SUNY Polytechnic Institute, headquartered in Albany and Utica. According to the SUNY website, SUNY Poly is now “New York’s globally recognized, high-tech educational ecosystem,” with “over 300 corporate partners and multiple technology and innovation hubs.” But how, exactly, does this “ecosystem” work? Unfortunately, answering that question presents quite a problem. Not only are the relevant details largely hidden from public scrutiny, but a variety of non-profit entities―such as the Fuller Road Management Corporation and the SUNY Research Foundation―play intermediary roles. It does appear, though, that New York State “partners” with giant corporations by pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into developing research and production facilities they desire. In turn, the corporations pay “rent” or make other contractual payments to the SUNY Research Foundation for SUNY space and access to SUNY equipment. SUNY Poly also rents out its employees. In 2016, it agreed to send up to 50 of its top scientists and engineers to work for two years at GlobalFoundries’ chip factory in Malta, NY. SUNY Poly was supposed to receive as much as $18 million in exchange for these employees, who, in turn, would be paid by the SUNY Research Foundation. Who benefits from these arrangements? Well, certainly the corporations do, for it is cheaper for them to handle their research, development, and employment needs with the infusion of large amounts of cash from the state’s taxpayers than for them to fund it entirely themselves. Also, by operating within SUNY, they are shielded from state, local, and business taxes. Meanwhile, Kaloyeros, as president and CEO of SUNY Poly, saw his annual salary rise to nearly $1.4 million, almost $900,000 of which came through the SUNY Research Foundation. New York State does not fare as well. Although spurring business investment and job growth sounds good, it does not always help New Yorkers. There are substantial costs for public services that the state’s taxpayers provide, especially if these corporations are shielded from taxes through their “partnership” with SUNY. There are also environmental costs. Furthermore, the jobs the corporations bring with them do not always go to New Yorkers. When GlobalFoundries moved to Saratoga County, thousands of new jobs were created at the NanoCollege and at Global Foundries. Although some jobs went to local people, most of them went to outsiders from across the nation and the world. Thus, New York added jobs, but few of them went to unemployed New Yorkers. Moreover, the NanoCollege has been of dubious benefit to the City of Albany. Although the presence of the NanoCollege has increased local employment, most people working within its walls live outside Albany and, therefore, do not pay property taxes to the city. An even more significant loss to Albany is the exemption of the NanoCollege from property taxes. Nearly two-thirds of Albany’s land is now tax-exempt, putting the burden of city services, such as schools, police, and roads, on the city’s homeowners, rather than on the NanoCollege or its hundreds of corporate “partners.” This situation put Albany in such a financial bind that, thanks to complaints from city officials, the NanoCollege’s nonprofit real estate arm, the Fuller Road Management Corporation, ultimately began paying $500,000 a year to the city in lieu of the NanoCollege’s taxes. But numerous Albany officials consider that sum insufficient and quite out of line with what a multi-billion-dollar operation can afford. Finally, what about SUNY Poly’s impact on the SUNY system? SUNY Poly now owns a very large amount of real estate, which its rents out to a substantial number of firms. But whether SUNY receives any significant overhead from this “educational ecosystem” remains unclear. What is clear is that, in September 2016, after a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s office, Kaloyeros was arrested along with a former top aide to Cuomo, plus developers in Syracuse and Buffalo, in an extensive corruption case. Two months later, Kaloyeros turned up in a federal grand jury’s 14-count indictment. According to the Albany Business Review, the indictment outlined “several alleged bribery schemes overseen by SUNY Poly in Albany involving some of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s signature economic development projects spanning from Buffalo to Syracuse, Albany, and the Hudson Valley.” Kaloyeros now faces federal criminal charges that he steered lucrative development contracts awarded by SUNY-affiliated nonprofits to preferred companies in exchange for bribes, as well as state criminal charges that he and another individual were engaged in a bid-rigging scheme involving a student dorm project at the NanoCollege. The trial is slated to occur this fall. SUNY Poly continues, although tarnished by the scandal. It has lost several of its high-profile programs, as well as a number of top scientists and engineers. Global Foundries abruptly pulled out of its massive chip factory deal, terminating the employment of most of its rented SUNY Poly workforce. Several questions arise from this history of SUNY-corporate collaboration. Does this “partnership” produce enough economic benefit to be worth the cost? Is assisting private business research, development, and sales an appropriate role for higher education? Finally, is using public funds to subsidize profit-making corporations an appropriate role for government? These questions are certainly worth considering before states rush into promoting further ill-fated university-corporate “partnerships.” Join the debate on Facebook Lawrence S.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Eve V crowd-developed Surface clone nearing production 2 by Surur  @mspoweruser May 29, 2017 at 22:20 GMT6 days ago The Eve V 2-in-1 PC claims to be the first “crowd-developed computer” as all of the main parts of the device were based on feedback from the Eve community. Eve’s V device is a lot like Microsoft’s Surface Pro line of devices but Eve V’s specs are better than what you get with the Surface Pro 4 for the same price. It comes with Intel’s 7th gen Core i7/i5/m3 processors. As for the RAM, you can get up to 16GB of LDDRP3 RAM with the Eve V and up to 512GB of internal storage (128GB and 256GB variants are also available). For the display, Eve is including a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD panel with a resolution of 2736×1284 pixels that’s protected by Gorilla Glass with a special anti-reflective layer. As for the security, you can’t get Windows Hello’s face recognition feature on the Eve V but there’s a fingerprint scanner that’s integrated into the power button of the device. The device has been in development for some time, but is now nearing production, and is expected to start shipping on the 10th June, which is pretty close to the May date predicted in their crowd-funding campaign last year. Some journalists have had an early hands-on with the device, and it is expected to be part of Microsoft’s Computex keynote. Early reports indicate a solid, lightly branded device, with a good RGB back-lit detachable keyboard and Precision touch pad, with no real obvious issues. Branded the king of ports, and addressing a major weakness of the Surface Pro, there’s 1 USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port, 1 regular USB Type-C port, two regular USB ports, a 3.5 mm port for audio and there’s also a microSD card reader. More importantly, the device boasts a 48Wh battery which, according to Eve, provides 12 hours of battery life.  All of this comes in a device that weighs less than a kilogram and has a thickness of 8.9mm. Gallery The device represents better value than a Surface, and offers a keyboard, pen and magnetic sleeve for $799, while for the same price the Surface Pro has half the RAM, and no pen and sleeve.

It probably thought it would have a killer deal if it cut the price of the LG G6 in half forv Memorial Day, since not many people can turn down a $300 flagship phone. But unfortunately, the one thing better than a 50% off deal is the 65% off that Best Buy is offering on the Verizon version of the G6. Don't Miss: Intel’s new Core i9 sounds like a monster If I didn’t know better, I’d say that Best Buy is deliberately trolling Sprint here. The deal that Sprint is offering is undeniably great: $14.75 payments every month for 24 months, for a total device price of $360. (Monthly payments are common, as it ties you to the carrier for two years.) Best Buy’s offer is nearly identical, but just a little bit better. If you go to Best Buy, you can get a Sprint-locked device for $19.99 per month, a little more than from Sprint direct. But Best Buy will sell you a Verizon LG G6 for $11.99 a month, comfortably undercutting the Sprint pricing. Granted, Verizon’s data plans are more expensive than Sprint’s, so you’ll probably end up paying more on your bill overall. But you’ll also get a faster and more reliable service, so it’s a wash, especially if you’re only adding one service line, where Sprint’s only barely cheaper than Verizon.

Companies use the annual Taipei, Taiwan-based technology trade show to show off their latest PC products and components. Last year, everything seemed to be related to virtual reality, with several brands unveiling high-end GPUs or budget ones capable of running VR. But don't expect it to be as busy this year, considering Microsoft has already held a couple events this month to introduce new hardware. Still, Asus has picked up the slack. It kicked off the show with a bunch of new laptops. And based on recent leaks and launches, some other companies will likely have a few announcements up there sleeves too. Pocket-lint is of course at the show and will bring you all the latest as it happens. Here's everything you need to know about this year's Computex, including when it is and what was announced. Best laptops 2017: The best laptops you can buy today Best Windows 10 laptops: The best available to buy today What is Computex 2017? Computex is an international computer expo held annually in Taipei, Taiwan. This year's show, which has the theme "From Mobility to Intelligence", will feature keynotes on the topics of artificial intelligence, internet of things, and other future technologies. When is Computex 2017? Computex 2017 will be held from 30 May to 3 June 2017, though some companies, such as Asus, technically hold keynotes the weekend before in order to get a jump start, as there will undoubtedly be a flood of announcements on the first day of the show. Where to watch Computex 2017 There is no official live stream for Computex 2017, but some companies might post live streams of their own keynotes. When they become available, we will share them below. Meanwhile, visit Computex's website for more videos and photos from the show. What was announced at Computex 2017?

Intel Intel Core i9 X-Series is a hardcore gamer's delight, with 18-core option Intel will present "the future of cricket" at the ICC Trophy During its Computex keynote, Intel announced a new series of CPUs that sit at the very top of the Skylake family. The Intel Core i9 X-Series is for power users and seriously hardcore PC gamers, as it starts at around $1,000 and goes up to a mighty $2,000 for the 18-core i9-7980XE. And that's not including new motherboards you'll likely need to run them. For that, you'll more than likely be futureproof for years. The Intel Core X-Series of processors also includes i5 and i7 CPUs, but it's the i9 range that's garnered the most attention. The i9-7980XE, for example, is the first consumer chip from the manufacturer that offers over a teraflop in computing power. The i9 series of chips all run at base clock speeds of 3.3GHz. Turbo Boost can increase that to 4.5GHz. Intel also announced a few new technological additions to the International Cricket Champions (ICC) Trophy, which starts Thursday 1 June. Chief among the technological advancements, Intel will be taking to the tournament, include using the company's Falcon 8 drone to analyse the pitch before each match. The Falcon 8 drone is equipped with HD and infrared cameras. It will be able to monitor and assess grass cover, grass health, and topology. All the data will then be available for commentators to access and use during matches. Intel also has a cricket bat sensor that's powered by the company's own Curie technology. The sensor can be attached to any cricket bat to generate data for each individual player. Data monitored includes back-lift, bat speed, and follow-through MSI MSI showed off its new gaming laptop, called the GT75VR Titan. It features a new, innovative, low-profile mechanical keyboard and some top-shelf hardware, including a Core i7 CPU, which can overclock to 4GHz, as well as options for SLI graphics cards.

They will be engineered with sophisticated thermal and electrical design in order to maintain a thin footprint yet keep cool and quite in operation. Nvidia's proprietary WhisperMode technology will also ensure a Max-Q laptop runs quietly. Manufacturers signed on to produce Max-Q machines include Acer, Asus, Alienware, Gigabyte, Lenovo and MSI. Expect them to appear on the market from 27 June. Samsung Samsung Samsung has announced that you can use its S Pen technology on its new Notebook 9 Pro, which is different from the old Notebook 9 series, as the Pro version has a 360-degree hinge, which means you can use it as a tablet or a laptop. Samsung has added an embedded S Pen too; it slides into the base of the Notebook 9 Pro. The stylus offers 4,000 levels of pressure and the ability to detect tilt for shading.

QCOM, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology globally, will settle a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited BBRY by paying U.S. $940 million, on or before May 31, 2017. The settlement includes an $815 million payment plus interest, attorneys’ fees and net of certain royalties due from BlackBerry for calendar 2016 and the first quarter of calendar 2017. This is in relation to the over-payment by BlackBerry to Qualcomm in royalty payments from 2010 to 2015 under terms of a licensing deal. This marks a big victory for BlackBerry which is focused on expanding its software development and licensing businesses. The company expects this monetary addition to be free from taxes. Meanwhile, BlackBerry is hitting headlines with a number of patent litigations. In the beginning of this year, it filed a lawsuit against Nokia stating that the latter has violated as many as 11 of its patents in offerings to carriers including AT&T and T-Mobile. Last August, it filed a 105-page patent lawsuit against Avaya, which was followed by another suit accusing Blu Products violating 15 of its patents. Same goes for Qualcomm, as it is not the first time when the company is getting engaged in any lawsuits and their payments. In Jan 2017, it was slapped with a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments by tech giant Apple Inc. AAPL accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Prior to this was an anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, on grounds of anticompetitive measures to maintain a monopoly in baseband chipset market. On Apr 10, 2017, Qualcomm counter attacked Apple mentioning the value of its invented technologies, their contribution and share in the industry through its licensing program. Recently, the company updated one of its lawsuits providing more evidences that Apple is interfering with its existing arrangements with the contract manufacturing firms. In this recent amendment of lawsuit, Qualcomm stated that Apple has been withholding payments to suppliers and encouraging them to similarly withhold those amounts from Qualcomm, all the while promising to indemnify the suppliers if Qualcomm takes legal action. Intel Corp. INTC and Media Tek are the closest competitors of Qualcomm in this field. In addition to iOS, Qualcomm chipsets are vastly used in Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Google developed Android software and Microsoft Corp. MSFT developed Windows operating system. We expect Qualcomm to quickly resolve all such disputes and focus on its growth strategies. Moreover, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market remain headwinds for the company. Price Performance and Zacks Rank Over the past three months, Qualcomm’s share price has grown 0.89% but failed to beat the Zacks categorized Wireless Equipment industry’s gain of 4.73%. View photos Meanwhile, the share price of BlackBerry has returned 61.25%, outshining the Zacks categorized Wireless Non-US industry’s 7.24% gain, over the same time frame.

Print Email By Rob Enderle May 29, 2017 10:30 AM PT Protect Your Future NOW - Five Easy Steps to Eliminate Legacy Contact Center Risk Is your management team asking about the future of your contact center technology & strategy? This webinar will show you how to avoid pitfalls when replacing infrastructure, as well as how to create an effective migration plan. View Now! It is kind of amazing how much advancement is going on in the autonomous car space. A year ago, we were mostly talking about cars that seemed comparatively boring, because they just drove on the surface. How quaint -- how 2016. Now when we mention "boring," we may be talking about Elon Musk's new underground tunneling idea. However, a little company called "Airbus" -- yes, the one that likely made the plane you last few in -- disagrees. It plans to start testing its autonomous flying car this year in Silicon Valley -- I expect so it can buzz Musk's Tesla plant there. That kind of explains why Ford just fired its CEO (who wasn't planning to tunnel or fly), and why Toyota is looking at blockchain for automotive security (because you sure as heck don't want flying cars to have Hitchcock Birds). Read on for more about the future of cars, er people-carrying drones, er automated sleds -- ah, personal transportation this week! I'll close with my product of the week: a new drone using Intel's Movidius Myriad 2 technology from DJI, the Spark. (No, it won't carry you to work, but it may become your favorite summer toy.) Flying or Tunneling? This is really both pretty amazing and pretty annoying. I mean, why the heck doesn't someone just invent the Star Trek. Transporter and call it a day? In one corner there's Musk, who has been badmouthing flying cars and just bought an automated tunnel-making machine, arguing that the future is underground. At the same time, a ton more people -- including Google's founders (who are Musk's neighbors) -- a number of startups, and at least one huge aerospace company are arguing for flying cars. Oh, and given that Amazon is developing heavy-lift delivery drones that aren't far removed from this, it's no doubt working on something similar in secret. The Underground Approach So, who is right? Will we soar into the heavens or scurry underground? Well, flying is both easier and more problematic. If we were talking greenfield, I think Musk would be right. The reason is that tunneling is certainly (well, except for earthquakes) safer. His idea of using sleds that would carry cars at high speed is basically a more advanced elevator, and elevators currently are the safest way to travel at speed. You are basically on a rail in a tunnel, so any accidents likely would be either computer- or act-of-god related. There could be a weather impact, resulting from a combination of flooding and pump failure. It happens to subways, but very infrequently. Still, you have to dig the damn tunnels -- and that's expensive and complicated. You'd have to dig them under buildings and under areas where you have power lines, aging waste disposal systems, water pipes, gas pipes and subways. Oh, and there are skyscrapers, which often have support structures that are drilled down into bedrock, and if you break those structures, they will fall over. Even if you could get the permits, which is really iffy, the time it would take to build all of those tunnels likely would be measured in centuries. By the time you were even 20 percent done, you'd likely find the tech you were planning to use and that you designed around had become obsolete. Now, if you were building a new city and could drop the tunnels in first, that would be a different story -- so on Mars, if we ever go there, I'd expect Musk's concept to be top of the list. Here on Earth, though, it would just be too expensive and too slow to get to critical mass. This is largely why Musk stands alone, at least for now. Flying High That is not to say that flying doesn't have issues. Granted, earthquakes wouldn't be a concern. (According to Musk, they wouldn't be in tunnels either, but...) However, weather is a real problem if you are up in the air. Let's say you're in a flying transport with a top speed of 70 miles per hour and a storm hits with 75 mph winds. You'd be pretty screwed, because you wouldn't be able to land, you wouldn't be able to fly out of the storm, and eventually the batteries would run out. (That parachute, instead of saving you, likely would kill you.) That means any hint of a storm like that, and the system would be grounded -- but we don't always get a ton of warning. Musk's tunnel could be hard-wired for power, but flying transports would operate off batteries that would have to be recharged. This technology has been advancing, but it still means not only that they would be severely range-limited, but also that they often would be out of service for charging. An alternative could be expensive battery-swapping stations (with some automated way to move batteries around in order to balance inventory). Ironically, Musk himself has a decent solution for the battery swap, but logistics remain an issue. So, for instance, I live in Bend, Oregon, which is a resort town. Most of the time, we have very little traffic. On a holiday weekend, like Memorial Day, it's hard to get around. So, without some way of moving large battery supplies quickly, we'd have a lot of grounded, battery-less vehicles in town this weekend, because we just wouldn't have the inventory. Finally, if a major problem were to occur in the air, the emergency solution would be to use parachutes or parafoils. With the latter, the vehicle might have a choice of where it landed. Imagine flying over New York, though, and the parachute getting hung up on top of a building, then ripping, then... For planes, which mostly don't fly over tall buildings, this parachute solution makes sense, but over tall buildings we'd need a far better way to deal with a total system failure. (Fortunately, electric power is vastly more reliable than internal combustion, and most designs can lose up to four motors and still remain flying -- but a catastrophic failure, say if the battery died, would be problematic.) Wrapping Up: Why Corning Wins OK I'm kind of messing with your heads calling out Corning, but I'll explain. What it comes down to is this: Technology can and will fix most of the flying issues, and what makes it a favorite to win is that you don't need much physical infrastructure. There are trials going on now, while Musk is still drilling his first test tunnel. We likely can find a way to tunnel faster, but dealing with all the crap we already have underground -- or just the fear that one of these things might topple a skyscraper -- makes his tunneling idea a non-starter outside of a greenfield city where you could tunnel first. Given that we have to solve the same problems for heavy-lift flying drones, the cost of this advancement is spread over far more firms, the problems are being worked by far more companies, and the speed of deployment likely will be far faster. (Dubai is expected to be in limited service next year.) So, flying should win. Now if we build a city on Mars... Hmm, this may explain why he suggested nuking the planet. So, why did I mention Corning? Whether you are talking Musk's sleds or people-carrying drones, you'll need a light transparent material -- either to protect the car on Musk's sled or to see out of in the drone. Right now, the best material for that is Gorilla Glass. This is why it is used in supercars. It is far lighter and far more robust than regular glass, and it doesn't scratch or mar like plastic does, so it wouldn't have to be replaced as often. So, Corning may be the one sure bet in all this mess. Go figure. The problem with most drones -- like most cameras, actually, is that you don't have one with you when you want to take a picture of something. The good ones -- and DJI typically is ranked at the top -- simply are too big to lug around all of the time. This brings up portable drones, but they tend to be underpowered and much harder to fly well, and they have really crappy battery life. The one I have, the Dobby Drone, is better than most, but the battery life is still in single digit minutes. Oh, and if it loses its smartphone connection, which mine did last weekend, it crash lands (in my case, breaking one of the propeller blades). The DJI Spark uses Intel's new little AI platform, Movidius Myriad 2, to allow you to control it by hand gestures and automate what it does once it's in the air. DJI Spark It will create 10-second videos automatically by circling you, flying up quickly, and shooting you from overhead while following you. It will carry out an interesting maneuver called "Helix," shooting you as it spirals away. You can keep it flying for a while, as it has a 16-minute flight time, pretty amazing for a small drone. Oh, and it can be launched from, and return to, your hand. The cost is US$499 -- reasonable for an advanced drone. There is a $699 bundle if you want the propeller guards (advisable if you want to do the hand thing), an actual controller, a spare battery, and a bag to put all that crap in. It comes in Alpine White, Sky Blue, Meadow Green, and Lava Red. The DJI Spark starts shipping on June 22 from DJI (and you can order it on Amazon). This DJI Spark is by far -- on paper -- the best small drone currently in market and thus my product of the week (and likely my new favorite summer toy).

As you may have inferred from the name, this is convertible, and we have to say it looks pretty sleek. At just 1.1kg and 10.9mm thin, it’s both slimmer and lighter than the MacBook Air and HP Spectre X360. However, it is jam packed with some top-shelf kit. The highest-specced model boasts Intel’s Core i7 CPU and a more than respectable 1TB PCle SSD and 16GB of RAM, which, combined, provide some serious performance power. Asus says it has invented a 0.3mm fan as part of a very sophisticated sounding "ultrathin vapor-chamber cooling system" to keep things chill while all this is going on. As you’d expect there are two USB-C ports, which handle the charging and can support two 4K external displays. The device itself has up to a 4K UHD display with a slim bezel (6.1mm). The display is fully flippable, allowing it to convert into a tablet, or be set up tent style, etc. The display is matte and features the reassuringly strong sounding Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Asus ZenBook 3 review: A super-thin MacBook killer? Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom preview: The mid-ranger cameraphone It comes bundled with a mini dock that adds on an HDMI port, a USB3.1, and a further USB-C port, which apparently "supports fast charging" though that sounds a touch odd to us since the in-body USB-C would still be handling the connection. Asus claims an 11.5=hour battery life and charging to 60 per cent power in 49 minutes. For the more creative amongst you, there’s also a 1024-level stylus available, the Asus Penm which is compatible with Windows Ink with a 1-300g pen tip force. Asus also emphasised that the Flip S fully supports all the latest whistles and bells from Windows including Modern Standby, an ultra-fast restart option that we haven’t yet tried. There’s also a fingerprint sensor on the edge of the display, which will recognise partial fingerprints to allow logging in with Window’s Hello. With our limited-time hands-on we found the keyboard pleasant to use and touchpad well-sized and responsive. The hinge movement was fluid and seemed to be a solid design. Asus ZenFone AR preview: A solid introduction to mixed reality Asus Chromebook Flip is now a 12.5-inch awesome machine Weighing in at just over 1kg, it was light in the hands but didn’t feel flimsy in the slightest. Like other Zenbooks, the chassis is aluminium alloy and features Asus’ trademark spun metal concentric design. The display was crisp and the colours were on point. The Zenbook Flip S is particularly fetching in the Royal Blue, which has a surprisingly ungarish gold trim. The display models were picking up fingerprints like flies, but it was a crowded event with lots of eager grubby mitts. The Smokey Grey model seemed to suffer from this slightly less but is a little bit less glam. Product launch is set for the back-to-school September window and lowest-specced models will start at $1,099 (around £850).

This was the second range apart from the new ZenBook that launched at the company’s ‘Zenvolution’ event. The VivoBook range is a more mainstream offering and the design language used in this series is not as sleek as the one used by the company in the ZenBook series. The company announced two laptops as part of the series, VivoBook Pro 15 and the VivoBook S15. The company did not announce the prices and the availability of the laptops but it did announce the specs of both the devices. Asus VivoBook S15 VivoBook S15 is packed with Intel Core i7-7500U processor along with 16 GB DDR4 RAM and Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics card.

It also comes with a USB 3.1, Type-C port, HDMI port, USB 3.1 port, two USB 2.0 ports and an SD card reader slot. Image Credit: Asus Asus has also added a backlit keyboard for low-light situations along with an integrated fingerprint sensor to access your device using Windows Hello. The company claims that the laptop can maintain the below 35-degree temperature even after hours of use with the help of ‘IceCool’ technology that uses smart fan control, heat pipes and internal layout for an efficient cooling system. Image Credit: Asus It comes with fast-charging technology where the battery can be charged from 0 to 60 percent within 49 minutes. The VivoBook S15 is considered the most premium model in the series and Asus claims that it is the it is one of the slimest 15.6-inch notebooks offering just a 17.9mm profile with just 1.5 kg weight. It also sports a ‘NanoEdge’ display with a 7.8mm bezel providing a larger display size in the same size to an immersive experience. Asus VivoBook Pro 15 Asus VivoBook Pro 15 is the second laptop added to the VivoBook series by the company. The laptop packs similar specs to the one in VivoBook S15 with the 7th-generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor along with 16 GB DDR4 RAM. Asus has added the latest Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card, the same 2 TB mechanical drive and 512 GB SSD for improved system performance. Image Credit: Asus VivoBook Pro 15 weighs about 2.2 kg with 19.2mm thickness, a fingerprint sensor and backlit keyboard. The interesting part about this device is that Asus has added a 4K UHD display with 100 percent sRGB colour gamut along with Harman Kardon-certified audio speakers. Asus has added fast charging in the battery to give similar performance as the VivoBook S15. Image Credit: Asus Last but not the least, The laptop comes with SD card reader, Audio combo jack, two USB 2.0 ports, one DC-jack, one LAN RJ-45 jack, USB 3.1 port, HDMI 1.4 and a USB 3.1 Type-C port for connectivity.

When the modern tablet era kicked off seven years ago with the first iPad, Steve Jobs famously pitched it as an in-between device, something to use when you didn't want to squint at your phone's tiny screen or do serious work on your laptop. It was a decent value proposition, and the iPad sold like hotcakes. Eventually, the narrative shifted. Tablets wouldn't just be good for lean-back content consumption, we were told, they'd eventually replace the laptop for good. Microsoft has toyed with the concept since the Surface's debut in 2012, calling it "the tablet that can replace your laptop." Apple followed suit a few years later with the iPad Pro, and has recently run a series of ads pitching it as a better solution than a laptop. And over the last two years we've seen several tablet/laptops from a variety of manufacturers, all of them chasing the promise of a laptop killer. The problem? It doesn't work. Despite all the pitches and promises that each company has cracked the code for that dreamy device that can be all things to everyone, the result is always a niche product that's one part mediocre laptop and one part mediocre tablet. Don't believe the hype. While these tablet/laptops might be fine for frequent travelers and some other minor use cases, they're not good for the average person. The latest in the category is the Samsung Galaxy Book, a $1,200 tablet that runs the full version of Windows 10. I've been testing one for the last several days. It comes with a 10 or 12-inch screen, keyboard cover, stylus, and some of Intel's best processors. On paper, it's impressive that you can now cram a full Windows computer into this form factor. In reality, it's a clunky solution, and it falls into the same traps as every other device in the category. Even though I'm going to talk about the Galaxy Book specifically, a lot of this applies to its competitors, ranging from the Surface Pro to the iPad Pro. No matter what a gadget maker tries to tell you, there's no such thing as a tablet that can replace your laptop. Using it as a laptop Unlike the soon-to-be-released Surface Pro, the Galaxy Book comes with a keyboard cover. And that's a good thing. Apple and Microsoft make you spend an extra $130, which is borderline insulting to sell the device as a laptop replacement, but make you pay more for that luxury. When it comes to typing and using the trackpad, the Galaxy Book's folio keyboard works just fine. The trackpad is surprisingly accurate for a Windows machine, and the keys are comfortable to type on, even though they feel a bit plasticky. Beyond that, the Galaxy Book runs smoothly. I wish it had a bit more RAM and storage options, but I didn't experience any major performance issues. By that measure, it should serve most people just fine. There really is something appealing about having a full PC in such a tight package. Unfortunately, there are far too many tradeoffs. The form factor simply doesn't work as a laptop replacement. The keyboard folio that attaches to the tablet provides limited viewing angles, forcing you to strain your neck. And it's a disaster to use on your lap thanks to the floppy plastic construction. The Galaxy Book constantly fell over because the folio was unable to support the weight of the tablet on my legs. It only worked on a flat, hard surface. It's just not as good as the metal or sturdy plastic builds you get with laptop keyboards. View photos samsung galaxy bookMore (This thing does not hold up in your lap.Steve Kovach/Business Insider) Using it as a tablet Of course, the benefit with the Galaxy Book is supposed to be that you can use it as a tablet when you want. But Windows has never been a good tablet operating system, and it doesn't have a vibrant touch-friendly app ecosystem like iOS or Android. Windows is still about getting things done, and a lot of the apps you'd want to use are available, but the Windows app store is still shockingly barren after all these years compared to iOS and Android. Read More And again, the form factor is a problem. Tablets make great reading devices and mini TVs, but the Galaxy Book weighs in at a hefty 1.7 pounds. It's uncomfortable to hold for extended periods of time. Good luck getting through a full-length movie. Stick with what works While there are plenty of Surface fans out there, I have a feeling the category will remain niche. The portability is great, but the form factor isn't. The touchscreen is great, but the apps just aren't there. The problems keep adding up. From the Surface to the iPad Pro to the Galaxy Book, I have yet to use a tablet/laptop hybrid that convinces me this category has any real legs. There are too many tradeoffs, too many caveats. There's no better combination than a really great laptop and a big-screen smartphone for everything else when you're on the go.

ASUS chairman Jonney Shih unveiled two new members of the ZenBook today, at a special event in Taipei ahead of Computex 2017. The 2017 ZenBook Pro is the company's most premium laptop to date (outside of its gaming-focused ROG brand). And the bendy ZenBook Flip S lays claim to the title of world's thinnest convertible, but without compromising on display quality or hardware specs. After some brief hands-on time with both at ASUS's event in Taipei today, we're eager to see more of these two high-end machines. ASUS ZenBook Pro 2017 A laptop for people who care about performance, picture, and sound. ASUS's redesigned ZenBook Pro sits at the top of the ZenBook line, packing the latest seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 chips from Intel and discrete graphics in the form of an NVIDIA GTX 1050Ti GPU. (That's faster than the regular 1050, but less battery-hungry than the 1060.) Plus it's configurable with a 4K touchscreen, up to 1TB of PCIe 3.0 SSD storage and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. And all of that power is contained in a chassis that draws on ASUS's established design language, with dual color pairings, reflective chamfers and an etched concentric circle design on the lid. As a result of the 15.6-inch screen diagonal, the ZenBook Pro is a hefty machine, but it's not excessively weighty, tipping the scales at just under four pounds. That's all the more impressive when you consider that ASUS is promising up to 14 hours of battery life from this model — with an H-series Core i5 or i7 processor and a meaty GPU. The Pro isn't exactly pitched as a high-end gaming laptop — that's ROG territory, after all — but the combination of specs should make it a nicely balanced machine for folks working on photo or video production, or anything requiring a bit more oomph than an Ultrabook. And yes, that pits it directly against Apple's larger MacBook Pro — which is why it's important that other premium features are packed in there. There's a built-in fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello in the top-right corner of the trackpad and audio driven by a quad-speaker system, developed in partnership with Harman Kardon. Speaker quality is tough to judge in a demo situation, but I was impressed with the clarity and bass of the ZenBook Pro's audio playback and was able to max out the volume without any noticeable distortion. While you can argue about the ergonomics and aesthetics of the ZenBook Pro compared to Apple's 15-incher, and Windows rivals, it's hard to fault the brilliant 15.6-inch touchscreen, which makes up 83 percent of the interior surface and covers 100% of sRGB color gamut. It's bright and vibrant, and between this top-notch display and the Pro's impressive audio capabilities, this looks set to be an excellent laptop for audiovisual connoisseurs. ASUS ZenBook Flip S ASUS's other new ZenBook is aimed at an altogether different kind of consumer. The ZenBook Flip S is a convertible Ultrabook — the world's thinnest, as ASUS is keen to point out — with U-series Core i5 and i7 processors, and the same maximum 16GB/1TB RAM/storage config as the ZenBook Pro. It has a suitably gorgeous 13.3-inch 4K touch display, which takes up 80% of the screen area, and this can be used with the ASUS Pen for even more precise drawing and note-taking. ASUS's new convertible is an upgraded, slimmer, more versatile take on the ZenBook 3. The key differentiator for the Flip S is its 360-degree "ErgoLift" hinge. Sure, the name is cringe-inducing, but the joint itself is firm yet flexible, allowing you to prop it up in a tent or stand position, or rotate it all the way around in tablet mode. The ZenBook Flip S isn't entirely fanless — there is a tiny impeller fan on the inside, measuring 0.3mm in thickness — and with any luck, this will help keep the Flip S cool despite its svelte depth of just 10.9mm. Despite its slim dimensions, the Flip S also manages to pack a one-touch fingerprint sensor on the side bezel for Windows Hello, ideally placed for use in tablet mode. Battery life is quoted at 11.5 hours, which isn't the longest we've seen in an Ultrabook, but equally is nothing to sniff at. Unlike ASUS's other ZenBooks, the Flip S's integrated 39WHr battery charges over USB Type-C, with quick charging technology able to revive a dead Flip S to 60 percent in 49 minutes. The convertible space is more crowded than ever right now, but ASUS's latest offering has promise, taking the familiar design of the ZenBook 3 and transforming it into a versatile lightweight machine. Even more compelling is the $1,099 starting price — though you'll likely need to settle for less RAM and internal storage, and an i5 CPU to bag a Flip S at this price point.

The design of Asus laptops is very ooutdated, they should do something with it 1 6 days ago Reply ananve The fingerprint magnet was what I was thinking too. Seemed like they tried to clean it before the show. Hmmmm.... 0 6 days ago Reply Richard Devine Hundreds of people all trying to touch doesn't make for a clean laptop. 4 6 days ago Reply ananve Yeah, you've got the point. I was thinking of my personal experience with ZenBook users around me having these fingerprints on their machine and I felt like I do not want that on my machine. Only my preference though. . Back to reality, My Surface 3 has no fingerprint on the keyboard, but plenty on the screen 😆 I have to wipe it everyday. . Different design choice, different problem, it seems. . Admittedly, I do not like Asus design choice to date. Many people around me do and I respect them. 0 6 days ago Reply abrichman Really seems like a great alternative to the XPS 15. Give up the 32GB ram option to get the GTX 1050Ti and, while to me, it's not as much a looker, nice to shed a half pound over the XPS. 1 6 days ago Reply Neo Nuke If they add a Thunderbolt 3 option to the Flip, that might be my next 0 6 days ago Reply AndroidPurity If this Zenbook Pro has a Thubderbolt 3 port with a full 4 lanes. Then this would be a better spec laptopthan the Lenovo 720 Yoga 15" 4K that I got. Although this Asus looks awfully wide, I like the look of my Yoga 720 better. Plus I don't think Asus can match the $1,319 I got my Lenovo for with the specs I got on it. 0 6 days ago Reply Adam1331 Is the back removable on the Zenbook Pro for battery replacement and upgrades? 0 5 days ago Reply waynejk They removed the num pad from the Pro, making it decidedly less "pro." Glad I bought the previous gen! 0 5 days ago Reply Halueth I prefer this version of Zenbook Pro. Having smaller case for 15.6 inch monito into somewhat 14 inch frame, have 2 thunderbolt, have usb 3.1 that I always wanted (I don't dig the all usb-c for future). It has pcie x4 ssd. The keyboard layout is good for me, due to I feel awkward hand placement when typing on G501, maybe it just not my thing to have num pad. And with the extra column of home and other key, it position the del button aligned with enter button, which helps me more to avoid tapping the power button. Now of course the only matter left is pricing. 0 5 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Recently, Microsoft and Samsung introduced equipment that might affect that conversation going forward. Microsoft has introduced the newest version of the Surface Pro. The company didn’t give it a number. If it had, it would be The Surface Pro 4. The new version offers battery life of 13.5 hours and is 2.5 times faster than the previous model, the company says. The press release offers all the specs which are, of course, sprinkled with a variety of superlatives. BGR points to an important change that has nothing to do with the specs: The Surface Pro is no longer a tablet. Instead, it’s “the most versatile laptop.” Microsoft calls it that in the first promo for the Surface Pro. It refers to it as a laptop in its official announcement and on the product’s store page. The piece traces the marketing metamorphosis to last summer. Initially, the Surface Pro was compared to the iPad Pro in television commercials. Subsequently, the focus turned to a comparison to the MacBook Surface Pro 4. The piece concludes: “Fast forward to 2017, and that change is complete.” Samsung also has a new device, the Galaxy Book, introduced in late February and now available at Best Buy (in store and online), Amazon and Samsung.com. The press release highlights features such as the use of Intel core i5 processors (for the 12-inch model) and Core m3 processors (for the 10.6-inch model). The two devices are compared at Digital Trends, which begins with a graphic that outlines the specifications. The one that sticks out most obviously is the price: The Surface Pro is quoted at $170 more ($799 versus $629). The writer assesses several categories. A number are ties, and there are wins for both devices. The bottom line is that the Microsoft entrant carries the day, though it is clearly a subjective battle: The 2-in-1 category grows ever more refined with each generation, and the Samsung Galaxy Book and Surface Pro for 2017 are both solid offerings facing down some tricky problems with considerable courage. The Redmond team has considerable experience in this area, and it ultimately leads to a victory for the Surface Book, at least on paper. This week, IDC released its quarterly projections for the entire computing universe. The news is not particularly encouraging. Total shipments are expected by the firm to shrink from 435 million last year to 405.2 million in 2021, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -1.4 percent. The company addressed the tablet sector from the perspective of slates and detachables. The smaller and newer detachable sector will fare well. Last year, 21.5 million units shipped; market share was 4.9 percent. In 2021, 45.9 million devices will ship, a market share of 11.3 percent. Slates, however, won’t thrive. IDC says that 153.4 million devices shipped last year, a market share of 35.3 percent. In 2021, 107.1 million devices will ship and market share will shrink to 26.4 percent. The tablet sector is shrinking and broadening at the same time. It is getting larger in terms of form factors. A wider variety of devices now fit under the category umbrella. It is getting smaller, however, as it moves to being a niche product, albeit a powerful one. The continued attention of Microsoft and Samsung – and, of course, Apple – means that it will never recede beyond a certain point. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Video Intel unleashes the powerful teraflop Core i9 processor Budget laptops and plastic parts go together like peanut butter and jelly, but Asus’ new VivoBook lineup looks to add some premium finish to its new machines. The first of two new VivoBooks unleashed Monday is the VivoBook S15. Featuring a 15.6-inch screen, GeForce 940MX graphics and dual-core Kaby Lake CPUs ranging from from Core i3 to Core i7, the VivoBook S15 gives you something the vast majority of budget laptops don’t: aluminum. Asus The budget VivoBook S15 gives you a 15.6-inch screen, GeForce 940MX graphics, Kaby Lake dual-core and an aluminum lid and top deck for $500. To wit: Unlike other $499 laptops, the VivoBook S15 includes an aluminum lid and aluminum top deck. You can’t get everything you want, though, as Asus resorts to a plastic bottom. [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] Asus also unveiled the VivoBook Pro 15, which adds a second feature that sets it apart from the crowd: Intel’s superfast Optane Memory. Like the VivoBook S15, the VivoBook Pro S caters to the more budget-sensitive crowd, but still gives you an aluminum lid and keyboard deck while not skimping on internals. The VivoBook Pro S is spec’d with a range of CPUs from Kaby Lake Core i5 quad cores to Core i7 quad cores, and you can opt for as much as 16GB of DDR4 RAM and GeForce GTX 1050 graphics. Asus said the VivoBook Pro S’s 4K UHD screen will  include support for the Asus pen. Storage options will range from a hard drive-only model, to one with a hard drive and 512GB SSD. Asus said it will also offer a laptop with Intel’s new Optane Memory, and this is where the story gets interesting.  Gordon Mah Ung The Asus VivoBook Pro 15 features an optional finger print reader, pen support, 4K screen, quad-core Kaby Lake CPU and GeForce GTX 1050 graphics. While the version of the VivoBook Pro 15 with the 512GB SSD would be your preferred option, it will also be much more expensive. Enter Asus’ Optane option: Intel’s new tech uses Optane Memory to operate as a cache for a traditional hard drive. Systems won’t be as fast as those running on SSDs, but they’ll be better than regular old laptops as far as storage performance. You can read our review of Optane right here, but the upshot is that under some circumstances, Optane makes a lot of sense. The VivoBook Pro 15 will start at $799, and will include a quad-core CPU and GeForce GTX 1050. Asus did not disclose when the new laptops would be available.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops Impressively thin ZenBook Flip S convertible leads Asus Computex assault Paul Ridden May 29, 2017 The new Asus ZenBook Flip S takes the world's thinnest Windows 10 convertible title, at just 10.9 mm thin (Credit: Asus) View gallery - 9 images At a Computex press event today, the company's chairman Jonney Shih introduced a host of new laptops, including a couple flying world's thinnest claims. The new ZenBook 3 Deluxe takes the thinnest 14-inch laptop crown, but it's the ZenBook Flip S convertible that really caught our attention. After taking a look at the 2-in-1 convertible market earlier this month, Asus says that the Flip S is the slimmest critter around – at just 10.9 mm (0.4 in) thin. The 13.3-inch Windows 10 laptop is also a featherweight, tipping the scales at 1.1 kg (2.4 lb). Its 360° ErgoLift hinge allows the (up to) 4K resolution multitouch display to be flipped over for tablet mode, and is reported to lift and tilt the keyboard for more comfortable typing when the screen is flipped more than 135 degrees. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW Processing grunt up to 2.6 GHz Core i7 is on tap, with integrated HD graphics, and a roomy 1 TB SSD and up to 16 GB of LPDDR3 system memory providing support. There's a teeny side-mounted fingerprint sensor for security, two USB 3 and one USB-C ports, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1, and a new cooling system includes a 0.3 mm liquid-crystal-polymer fan impeller to help prevent the mobile computer from running hot. Its 39 Wh battery is reported good for up 11.5 hours between charges. The slim 2-in-1 will have a starting price tag of US$1,099. Other laptop additions announced today include the ZenBook Pro and the VivoBook Pro 15. The 15.6-inch ZenBook Pro is pitched as the thinnest, lightest and most powerful ZenBook so far and boasts specs including an Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX1050 Ti graphics, 1 TB of SSD storage and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. The 18.9 mm (0.7 in) thick, 1.8 kg (3.9 lb) mobile workstation also has four Harmon Kardon speakers to complement its 4K display, and will stay alive for a healthy 14 hours of use before needing a top up. Prices start at $1,299. The VivoBook Pro 15 is also a 15.6-inch Windows 10 laptop, powered by the same processor, and including the same 16 GB of DDR4 system memory. But this baby has hybrid storage comprising a 2 TB hard drive and 512 GB SSD. It rocks a 4K display, stereo Harmon Kardon speakers and a dual-fan cooling system with copper module and pipes. This one will start at $799. The remaining laptop reveals were the ZenBook 3 Deluxe and the VivoBook S15. Asus has managed to cram a 14-inch thin bezel display into a 13-inch chassis for the 3 Deluxe, which is said to be the world's thinnest 14-inch laptop at 12.1 mm (0.47 in) thick. The 1.1 kg laptop has a Core i7-7500U heart, supported by up to 16 GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 1 TB of SSD storage. It's capable of supporting two external UHD displays and rocks two USB C ports. Pricing starts at $1,199. The VivoBook S15 meanwhile features a 15.6-inch slim-bezel display, is powered by a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor and GeForce 940MX GPU, and up to 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. The cheapest of the bunch, this model will start at $499. Asus revealed a new router design, too, which looks like it could have come straight out of Dyson's research lab. The eye-catching hole in its middle of the Blue Cave box is illuminated by blue light, it runs on the latest Intel Wi-Fi chipset and has its antennas hidden away inside for a spike-free aesthetic. The 802.11ac dual-band router should be fast enough to deliver smooth 4K video streams, fast downloads and latency-free gaming, and comes with cooked-in commercial-grade security courtesy of Trend Micro.

One day, your internet use may not be limited by 4G speeds. As early as 2018, many in the United States will be able to use 5G enabled devices. Just a few blocks away from the roar of the Speedway, there’s a tiny gray house. Unlike its neighbors, it’s not receiving an internet connection from wires running inside. Its internet comes from a 5G radio. This is one of Verizon’s prototypes – the only one in Indiana. The company is partnering with Ericcson and Intel to demonstrate 5G wireless internet. The benefits tested in this house are for entertainment: online gaming with no lag time, and video that relays more visual detail. Cynthia Grupe, executive director of Verizon’s 5G project, says the company will roll-out consumer trials in 11 other cities later in 2017. “This is a real technology. We are running true 5G, today. And seeing true 5G experiences,” Grupe says. Outside of the house, halfway down the block is the radio, providing the connection to all the devices in the house. Ericcson business development director John Macchione, says that box will be able to handle as much as 10 gigabits of data per second. “That’s really going to change the way everybody can be entertained and the way businesses can communicate with you,” Macchione says. As early as 2018, consumers near the Speedway may be able to test 5G from the radio installed near the house.

The 10.9-millimeter profile of the ZenBook Flip S currently takes the record. The laptop will be available later this year at prices starting at $1,099. Read more about it below, and also two other slender notebooks Asus announced at its Monday event at Computex in Taipei. Thin is always in Asus was very specific in showing how thin the ZenBook Flip S is compared to the competition. Chairman Jonney Shih laid it out in his presentation: HP Spectre x360: 13.8mm [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] MacBook Air: 17mm MacBook: 13.1mm ZenBook Flip S: 10.9mm At just 2.4 pounds, the Zenbook Flip S is also lighter than the HP Spectre x360 and the MacBook Air, though not the 2-pound MacBook. Yet it packs the heavyweight punch of Intel’s Corei7-7500U processor and can accommodate up to a terabyte of PCIe SSD storage. Martyn Williams/IDG The Asus ZenBook Flip S at an event in Taipei on May 29, 2017. Like all convertibles, the screen can be folded all the way around and the laptop used in a tablet configuration. The touch display has a 4K resolution (3,840x2,160 pixels) and support for Windows Ink with an optional Asus Pen. Corning’s Gorilla Glass adds durability. When the screen unfolds past 135 degrees, the hinge props up the keyboard from the back to create a more comfortable angle for typing. Martyn Williams/IDG Asus Chairman Jonney Shih speaks at the launch of new ZenBook laptops in Taipei on May 29, 2017. The computer's accessories include a tiny fingerprint sensor for one-touch login via Windows Hello in laptop or tablet mode. There are a couple of USB-C ports and support for fast charging. Asus says the battery will last for 11.5 hours and can be fast-charged to 60 percent of capacity—about 7 hours—in just 49 minutes. Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe Martyn Williams/IDG The Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe on show at a Taipei news conference on May 29, 2017. Asus has upgraded its ZenBook 3 laptop with a new model that carries the “Deluxe” name. The UX490 is the thinnest 14-inch laptop on the market at 12.9 millimeters thick, according to Asus.  It weighs 2.4 pounds and is the first laptop to feature Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5, the latest version of the popular impact-resistant glass, Asus said. The company said it can support up to 9 hours of battery life and will be available at prices starting from $1,199. Asus The Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe is shown hooked up to dual 4K monitors. Like the Flip S, the computer is based on a Core i7 processor and has up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. The twin USB-C ports support Thunderbolt 3, so dual 4K monitors could be hooked up, but the laptop itself offers just a Full HD (1,920x1,080 pixels) panel. For gaming-level graphics performance, the laptop can be connected to the Asus ROG XG Station 2 external graphics dock, which can support cards as large and hot as the NVidia GTX 1080. Asus ZenBook Pro Asus The Asus ZenBook Pro. The third addition is the ZenBook Pro UX550. Starting at $1,299, it’s based around the Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti graphics card. It’s both thinner and lighter than previous ZenBook Pro machines at 18.9 millimeters and just under 4 pounds. It has a spacious 15.6-inch 4K screen. Asus has found room for a four-speaker audio system, battery life is an impressive 14 hours according to Asus, and it comes with a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello biometric login.

Microsoft has announced a new iteration of its popular Surface Pro line, with the new models featuring the latest Intel processors and a number of other upgrades. We see how they compare to Apple's own workhorse, the MacBook Pro. See also: iPad Pro 12.9 v Surface Pro 5 What is a Surface Pro? Microsoft may be primarily associated with software, but a few years ago the company launched the Surface Pro line of tablet/laptop hybrids. Since then these devices have become a regular sight in coffee shops, offices and other places where laptops dare to tread. Out of the box a Surface Pro is a tablet, albeit one that runs a full desktop version of Windows 10. But the most common configuration includes an attachable keyboard cover that makes it far more like a full-blown laptop. Surface Pros are light, beautifully constructed, and have done much to lend the Microsoft brand a touch of cool. This looks set to continue with the release of the Surface Laptop and the Surface Studio, both of which feature excellent and innovative styling, something that was once the sole province of Apple. For more details take a look at the Surface Laptop and Surface Studio features prepared by our colleagues on Tech Advisor. Design The MacBook Pro was redesigned in 2016 to give it a sleeker, more modern look, refining the ageing silver aluminium unibody format that has served it for a number of years. It's a beautiful device - of that there's no question. The construction is exemplary and the new slimmer lines make the MacBook Pro an elegant but robust machine that should take a few knocks while delivering solid performance. MacBook Pro Dimensions: 30.41cm x 21.24cm x 1.49cm; 1.37kg (13-inch models) 34.93cm x 24.07cm x 1.55cm; 1.83kg (15-inch models) Surface Pro Dimensions: 292mm x 201mm x 8.5mm; 768g/770g/784g (m3/i5/i7) Apple has kept the number of ports to a minimum, which isn't everybody's favourite idea, and configurations differ depending on which model you buy. The entry level 13-inch MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports which also act as the charging ports, plus a solitary 3.5mm headphone jack. Opt for the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar or the 15-inch MacBook Pro and you'll get an additional two USB-C ports, not to mention the Touch Bar itself which allows users to control various aspects of software applications via the touch sensitive area at the top of the keyboard. For a more comprehensive look at the capabilities of the Touch Bar read our MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar review. The Surface Pro is a different beast. Technically it's not really a laptop unless you purchase the optional keyboard cover from Microsoft, but when you do it creates a very compelling device. Microsoft has decided not to continue numbering its devices, much like Apple, so whereas most people were expecting this to be the Surface Pro 5, it's technically called just the Surface Pro. The body is the same magnesium alloy that graced the previous models, with the built-in kickstand now able to smoothly recline back to almost flat. Much like the MacBook Pro this is a premium product whose fit and finish shows a great deal of care and thought has gone into not only the design but the construction too. Where Apple choose to only include USB-C ports, Microsoft has omitted them completely, which is a controversial decision and does seem a little odd to us. Instead the Surface Pro comes with one USB 3.0 port, a Micro SDXC card reader, Mini Display Port, 3.5mm headphone jack, Cover port (for connecting the keyboard), and the Surface Connect port which links to Surface Pro to Microsoft's Surface Dock.  The latter turns the Surface Pro into a desktop device when paired with an external keyboard, mouse, and screen, or simply expands the amount of peripherals you can attach to the Pro. Keyboards Keyboards are an essential element to get right on a laptop, because it's the part of the device that you will physically interact with the most. So it's important that any prospective buyer tries the typing surfaces on both of these device before making a purchase, as neither is what you would call normal. The MacBook Pro has the second generation of Apple's new Butterfly keyboard which is ultra thin and divides opinion amongst users. Each key feels more solid, that's true, but the minuscule amount of travel that occurs when they are pressed can take some getting used to. It's a different story on the Surface Pro, as it doesn't have a keyboard at all. Users will need to purchase the attachable Surface Pro Signature Type Cover (£149.99), or use a bluetooth keyboard if they want to get the full laptop experience. The Type Cover attaches magnetically to the Surface Pro (very securely we might add) and is itself quite slim. The keys are of a traditional scissor design  though, so the typing experience is very familiar. Those with heavy hands, though, will notice a slight flexing of the cover as they pound away at their business proposals, emails, or social media discussions. As we said earlier, be sure to test these devices in person before considering a purchase. Touch Another area where Microsoft and Apple take different approaches is touch. The Surface Pro's 12.5-inch PixelSense display is fully touch-enabled, with 10 point multi-touch capabilities. This comes into it's own when combined with the Surface Pen (again additional) which has also seen upgrades to make it more sensitive and reduce any lag. Apple continues to eschew touchscreens and instead has come up with the Touch Bar. This digital strip replaces the function key row on the MacBook Pro's that include the feature. The clever part of the Touch Bar is that it's contextual, so depending on what application you're using the Touch Bar will display different options. Much like the keyboard this feature has proven divisive among Apple users. Some extoll the virtues of the ever changing Touch Bar, while others say they don't want to stare down at the Bar to change things on the screen. Again, try before you buy. Another essential element is of course the display, and both devices have gorgeous HD panels. The Surface Pro comes replete with a 12.5-inch PixelSense display that boasts a 2736 x 1824 resolution with 267 PPI. The MacBook Pro 13-inch utilises an IPS display with 2560x1600 native resolution and 227 pixels per inch. Moving up to the 15-inch model you'll find a 15.4-inch IPS display running at 2880x1800 native resolution and 220 pixels per inch. Specs As these are all premium devices it's not surprising to find premium components inside. Processor-wise the 13-inch MacBook Pros offer either a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 on the entry model, or a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 on the Touch Bar version. The chips used in both 13-inch MacBook Pros are from the sixth generation of Intel Core chips, known as Skylake. This makes them a generation behind those fitted in the new Surface Pro. Microsoft opted instead to use the seventh generation Kaby Lake chips. The Surface Pro range incorporates three variants, starting with a Core M and moving up to Core i5 and Core i7 versions. How this will affect the graphical performances of the two platforms will be an interesting factor when the Surface Pro arrives in our lab for testing. Here's a detailed breakdown of the specs on the MacBook Pro and Surface Pro: 13-inch MacBook Pro model (without Touch Bar) 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz, with 4MB shared L3 cache (Configurable to 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz, with 4MB shared L3 cache) 8GB of 1866MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM (Configurable to 16GB) Intel Iris Graphics 540 256GB PCIe-based onboard SSD (Configurable to 512GB or 1TB SSD) 13.3-inch LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2560x1600 native resolution at 227 pixels per inch; 500 nits brightness; Wide colour (P3) Built-in 54.5-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery; estimated battery life up to 10 hours wireless web use 802.11ac WiFi; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth 4.2 Full-size backlit keyboard with 78 (US) or 79 (ISO) keys including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys; Force Touch trackpad 2 x Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports; 3.5mm headphone port 720p FaceTime HD camera 30.41cm x 21.24cm x 1.49cm; 1.37kg 13-inch MacBook Pro model (with Touch Bar) 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz, with 4MB shared L3 cache (Configurable to 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz, with 4MB shared L3 cache; or 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz, with 4MB shared L3 cache) 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM (Configurable to 16GB) Intel Iris Graphics 550 256GB PCIe-based onboard SSD, or 512GB PCIe-based onboard SSD (Configurable to 1TB SSD) 13.3-inch LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2560 x 1600 native resolution at 227 pixels per inch; 500 nits brightness; Wide colour (P3) Built-in 49.2-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery; estimated battery life up to 10 hours wireless web use 802.11ac WiFi; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth 4.2 Full-size backlit keyboard with 64 (US) or 65 (ISO) keys including 4 arrow keys; Touch Bar with integrated Touch ID sensor; Force Touch trackpad 4 x Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports; 3.5mm headphone port 720p FaceTime HD camera 30.41cm x 21.24cm x 1.49cm; 1.37kg 15-inch MacBook Pro model (with Touch Bar) 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz, with 6MB shared L3 cache, or 2.7GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz, with 8MB shared L3 cache (Configurable to 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz, with 8MB shared L3 cache) 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM Radeon Pro 450 with 2GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching, or Radeon Pro 455 with 2GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching (Configurable to Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching); Intel HD Graphics 530 256GB PCIe-based onboard SSD, or 512GB PCIe-based onboard SSD (Configurable to 1TB or 2TB SSD) 15.4-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit display with IPS technology; 2880 x 1800 native resolution at 220 pixels per inch; 500 nits brightness; Wide colour (P3) Built-in 76.0-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery; estimated battery life up to 10 hours wireless web use 802.11ac WiFi; IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible; Bluetooth 4.2 Full-size backlit keyboard with 64 (US) or 65 (ISO) keys including 4 arrow keys; Touch Bar with integrated Touch ID sensor; Force Touch trackpad 4 x Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports; 3.5mm headphone port 720p FaceTime HD camera 34.93cm x 24.07cm x 1.55cm; 1.83kg Surface Pro 12.3in PixelSense display, 273ppi, 2736x1824 1GHz Core m3-7Y30; 2.6GHz Core i5-7300U; 2.5GHz Cire i7-7660U 4GB/8GB/16GB 128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB SSD Intel HD 615 (Core m3); Intel HD 620 (Core i5); Intel Iris Plus 640 (Core i7) 802.11ac Bluetooth 4.1 8Mp (main), 5Mp (front) USB 3, microSD, 3.5mm headset, Surface connector 292mm x 201mm x 8.5mm; 768g/770g/784g (m3/i5/i7) Release Date The MacBook Pro was released last year, and is available from Apple or a number of other retailers. The Surface Pro is now available for pre-order from Microsoft, with a predicted shipping date of the 15th June 2017. UK price With premium components and features comes premium prices. MacBook Pro: 13-inch model (without Touch Bar): Starts at £1,449 13-inch model (with Touch Bar): Starts at £1,749 (256GB) or £1,949 (512GB) 15-inch model (with Touch Bar): Starts at £2,349 (2.6GHz, 256GB) or £2,699 (2.7GHz, 512GB) Surface Pro: Intel Core M, 128GB SSD, 4GB RAM: £799 Intel Core i5, 128GB SSD, 4GB RAM: £979 Intel Core i5, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM: £1,249 Intel Core i7, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM: £1,549 Intel Core i7, 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM: £2,149 Intel Core i7, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM: £2,699 OUR VERDICT The MacBook Pro is a great update to a much heralded line. The design is subtle but distinctive and performance is strong throughout. It’s not all plain sailing though. The keyboard is unorthodox, and as such might put some buyers off, plus those prices are still eyewatering in these days of austerity, especially if you want the Touch Bar models. The Surface Pro is a breath of fresh air in many ways. The aesthetics are cool, touch works well, and the pen can be a lot of fun to use. Microsoft has positioned it in the past as a great rival to the iPad Pro, which it is, but since the release of the Surface Laptop we’re not sure how well the Surface Pro will fair against the MacBook Pro. In the end this one will come down to personal preference in terms of touch capabilities, keyboards, and whether you want Windows 10 or OSX. Either device is a quality product, but you’ll have to pay for it. Tags: Mac Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

If that’s you fret not because ASUS also has some lower-priced offerings. Gallery: Asus VivoBook S Launch (Computex 2017) Gallery: Asus VivoBook Pro Launch (Computex 2017) The company announced the VivoBook S which they are calling a luxury for everyone to enjoy, and a laptop that won’t be breaking the bank. It will feature an aluminum chassis so you don’t have to worry about sacrificing quality for price, and it will also feature some pretty impressive specs like an Intel Core i7 processor, an NVIDIA GeForce 940M GPU, a combination of an SSD and a HDD, up to 16GB of RAM, and fast charging technology. There will also be a 15.6-inch Full HD display. However for those who want a little bit more power and oomph in their laptops, not to worry as ASUS has you guys covered too, and this comes in the form of the ASUS VivoBook Pro. It will come with a 4K display and feature an Intel Core i7 H-series CPU, an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 GPU, a dual fan design, Intel Optane memory, and HDD and SSD options.

DES – Digital Business World Congress 2017 (PRNewsfoto/DES2017)      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/516642/DES___Digital_Business_World_Congress_2017.jpg ) The profile of attendees at this second edition was marked by a strong international presence, from countries like the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, France, Italy and Mexico, among others.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. — Sipa USA/TNS SAN FRANCISCO: A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights.  Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights.  The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data.  The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested US$1bil (RM4.27bil) in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc.  Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies.  “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group.  Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations.  “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward chief executive officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.”  Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013.  Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence.  “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?”  Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specialising in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialised mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor.  “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said. — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested Waze unveils carpool app Cost vs convenience: is it worth having your own printer?

Digital Trends Home > Computing > The best gaming desktop you can buy The best gaming desktop you can buy Our favorite gaming desktops make the latest consoles look pathetic By Jayce Wagner — Updated May 30, 2017 2:19 pm Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Finding the right gaming desktop can be a serious chore. Sorting through Amazon feedback, spec sheets, and parsing countless reviews for details relevant to your needs can be a massive headache, but we’re here to help. It seems like we get new gaming desktops to review every week, and each one comes with its own quirks and eccentricities. Let’s be honest, the internals in all the top-of-the-line desktops are going to be remarkably similar. When you’re buying a high-end gaming desktop you should be on the lookout for more than just raw performance. Any machine in the same price category will be capable of hitting similar benchmarks. What you’re really looking for in a long term solution is something with manageable quirks, features and eccentricities. You want a gaming desktop that reflects you and your needs, without compromising its horsepower. Most of all, a gaming computer should be fun, so we’ve got the picks to keep the whole process from turning into a stressful mess. Our pick Digital Storm Velox Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Why you should buy this: You’re in it for the long haul, you want the best gaming rig on the market, and you want to keep it up to date. Our Score The best Digital Storm Velox (Kaby Lake) The Digital Storm Velox is an ultra-customizable powerhouse, built for true gaming aficionados. $4,737.00 from Digital Storm Who it’s for: Gamers who want the best of the best, and don’t mind dropping some serious dough How much will it cost: $1,300+, depending on specs Why we picked the Digital Storm Velox Not only does Digital Storm’s Velox own the distinction of housing Intel’s Core i7-7700K processor — it also overclocked that processor to a ridiculous 5GHz, and cleared our tests with flying colors. Simply put, the Velox is among the most powerful gaming desktops you can buy. And if the i7-7700K isn’t to your tastes, well, you can get a Core i7-6950X, or AMD’s new Ryzen processors. Despite its speed and extravagance, opening up the Velox and tinkering with its innards is far less intimidating than performing the same process on other rigs, due to its intuitive case design, which eschews screws and buttons in favor of simple pegs that pop in and out with little effort. You can essentially trick out the Velox to no end (playing with options on Digital Storm’s website, we managed to jack the overall price up to over $40,000), but our review model ran short of $5,000, and it absolutely hauled digital ass. Altogether, the Velox is hard to beat — on top of being incredibly powerful, it looks great, and it’s easy to fiddle with. If you want a future-proof PC, this is just about your best bet. Our review The best compact gaming desktop Falcon Northwest Tiki Why you should buy this: You’re looking for something small, dense, and deceptively powerful (like a neutron star). Our Score The best compact gaming desktop Falcon Northwest Tiki (2015) If you want something a little smaller, the Tiki is a fantastic machine, with a gaming aesthetic and satisfying growl when you turn it on. $4,045.00 from Falcon Northwest Who it’s for: Gamers who want compact, understated power How much will it cost: $1,900 – $4,200, depending on specs Why we picked the Falcon Northwest Tiki The Tiki actually scored a little better than the Velox in our review, but they’re very different machines. Digital Storm’s desktop is a powerhouse, and that’s reflected in its aesthetic; the custom metal chassis is certainly a joy to behold, but we wouldn’t classify it as minimalistic. Sure, it’s less flashy than many gaming rigs, but it’s still eye-catching, and takes up a decent chunk of real estate. The Tiki takes after a different tradition, trading visuals and a luxuriant interior for economy of space. This thing is tiny. It’s also a good choice if you’re averse to some of the flashier gaming PCs out there. Not everyone has a taste for neon red and flashing lights. Like most high-end gaming rigs, you can customize the appearance of the Tiki, but there’s something about its sleek, professional design that lends itself well to shades of black. If the Origin is a cherry-red hot rod with racing stripes, the Tiki is a slick black sports coupe with tinted windows and growling engine. Really, it growls. It’s a little loud, particularly under a heavy load, but given how small it is, you could tuck this thing under your desk to muffle the worst of the fan noise. Or just sit it out in the open and enjoy the sound of a miniature jet engine. There are quieter gaming PCs out there, but you might have to make a few compromises. Our review The best affordable gaming desktop Alienware Alpha ASM100-9000BLK  Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Why you should buy this: You want performance without breaking the bank, or a tiny gaming desktop. Our Score The best for budget-minded gamers Alienware Alpha R2 The Alienware Alpha provides competitive specs and unmatched value at less than $1,000. $949.99 from Dell $529.99 from Amazon.com Who it’s for: Budget-minded gamers who don’t need unnecessary bells and whistles How much will it cost: $700 Why we picked the Alienware Alpha ASM100-9000BLK  Not everyone wants (or is able) to spend thousands on a gaming PC. Luckily, there are potent options out there for even the most frugal gamers, and Alienware’s Alpha Mini series is at the top of the list. Alienware often catches flak for pumping out flashy, LED-laden computers that are too expensive, boasting similar specs to machines made by other companies at higher prices. That’s simply not the case with the ASM100-9000BLK, which currently retails for just $700 via Amazon. If you’re a fiend for gorgeous graphics, you can find better options, but few — if any — desktops offer the same level of power as the Alpha for such a reasonable price. At 1080p, but it’ll play demanding games like The Witcher 3 and Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor at 60FPS without breaking a sweat. The CPU, memory, and hard drive are replaceable, so if you need a solid state drive in place of the slower hard drive, you can make that happen (though that sort of defeats the purpose of buying a $700 gaming desktop). The barebones, gaming-centric Alienware UI is designed to be easily navigable via gamepad or controller, and on this front it succeeds. The Alpha manages to feel like a gaming console, except with Steam’s massive library. If you’re looking for an all-purpose PC, look elsewhere, but this bad boy packs a lot of punch, considering its size and price. Our review How we test You’ve read our reviews. You’ve read our conclusions. And now you’re wondering how we came to them. Reviews often lack context. We’ll give out a score and analyze the finer points of desktop performance, but how do we reach those conclusions? How do we test these machines? Allow us to lift the veil. Here we’ll explain the benchmarks we use for objective testing and the perspective from which we approach subjective topics. We don’t expect everyone to agree with our opinions, but we hope that sharing our process will leave you better equipped to decide what desktop best fits your needs.

Official today, the ARM Cortex-A75 is the new flagship-tier mobile processor design, with a claimed 22 percent improvement in performance over the incumbent A73. It’s joined by the new Cortex-A55, which has the highest power efficiency of any mid-range CPU ARM’s ever designed, and the Mali-G72 graphics processor, which also comes with a 25 percent improvement in efficiency relative to its predecessor G71. The efficiency improvements are evolutionary and predictable, but the revolutionary aspects of this new lineup relate to artificial intelligence: this is the first set of processing components designed specifically to tackle the challenges of onboard AI and machine learning. Plus, last year’s updates to improve performance in the power-hugry tasks of augmented and virtual reality are being extended and elaborated. Before we dive into the detail of this year’s changes, it’s worth recapping what ARM does and why it’s important. This English company, now owned by Japan’s SoftBank, is responsible for designing the processor architecture of practically every mobile device — you’ll have heard of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon, Samsung’s Exynos, and Apple’s A-series of mobile chips, all of which are built using ARM’s instruction sets and based on ARM’s design blueprints. When we talk about the oncoming wave of mobile AI, mobile VR, and smartphones that can perform machine-learning tasks without sending them off to processor farms up in the cloud, developing the capabilities for those tasks starts with ARM. ARM The new Cortex-A75 and A55 are the first Dynamiq CPUs from ARM. Dynamiq is the branding chosen to describe a much more flexible set of design options for silicon vendors like Qualcomm. Where previously ARM allowed for designs that paired a cluster of so-called big CPUs (from its A7x class) and a matched number of little CPUs (from the A5x series), the new design makes it possible to spec a single, mixed-up cluster composed of both big and little CPUs, to a maximum of eight. Thus, chip makers can now have, for example, seven little A55 cores and just one big A75 one: for a favorable mix of long battery life, cost efficiency, and a high ceiling of single-threaded performance when it’s called for. "50x improvement in AI performance over the next three to five years" ARM marketing chief John Ronco says he anticipates a "50x improvement in AI performance over the next three to five years thanks to better architecture, micro-architecture, and software optimizations." ARM’s Dynamiq changes include a redesigned memory subsystem and tweaks to how CPU caches work — which has led to a doubling of memory streaming performance on the A55 relative to the A53 preceding it. Given that the A53 has shipped on 1.7 billion devices over the past three years, it’s truly the A55 that will make the biggest difference in achieving Ronco’s ambitious forecast. In most applications, the new mid-range core will be 10 to 30 percent better than previously, offering up to 15 percent better power efficiency and 18 percent better single-thread performance. But it’s the fact that the new chip designs will be 10 times more configurable, with up to 3,000 different configurations, that will allow chipmakers far greater flexibility to make the most of them by tailoring them to specific tasks. ARM The Cortex-A75 makes double-figure performance improvements across the board Interestingly, ARM won’t just be powering machine learning with its new chips, it’ll benefit from ML too. The new designs benefit from an improved branch predictor that uses neural network algorithms to improve data prefetching and overall performance. The Cortex-A75 makes double-figure performance improvements across the board, with ARM claiming it’s on average 22 percent better than the A73, with 16 percent higher memory throughput, and a 34 percent improvement in its Geekbench score. Single-threaded performance, according to ARM’s Ronco, is up by 20 percent, purely by improving the instructions-per-clock efficiency. The A75 chip is roughly 2.5x the size of the A55, and its intended uses are for infrastructure, automotive, and rich mobile applications. Yes, that means VR, AR, and high-fidelity games, the latter of which ARM’s research has shown have been rapidly increasing in popularity. A major architectural change with the A75 is the opening of a larger power envelope for chips using this core, scaling up to 2W of power consumption, and thus offering up to 30 percent of extra performance on larger-screen devices. This is entirely targeted at the upcoming Windows on ARM reboot, expected later this year. It’s worth noting that in ARM’s world a "large" screen basically amounts to a laptop — and the company set up a dedicated Large Screen Compute division a year and a half ago to more aggressively target the clamshell devices that Intel has been dominant in. ARM As to the new Mali GPU, it has 32 shader cores, 25 percent higher energy efficiency, and a 20 percent better performance density (aka performance per mm² of space). The Mali-G72 is at the heart of ARM’s push toward improving machine learning efficiency, and ARM claims it’s showing itself to be 17 percent better than the G71 in ML benchmarks. The design optimizations from the company are tailored to accelerate inference engines rather than training engines — that’s to say ARM chips will be best at using accumulated ML capabilities rather than developing them, which makes perfect sense for mobile applications. Training AI will be a task better left to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards or Google’s custom TensorFlow TPUs. The Cortex-A75 and A55 designs were released to ARM’s partners at the end of 2016, so by this point, they’ve all had a few months to decide what to do with them. ARM says a "realistic time window" for new mobile devices powered by its latest designs would be the first quarter of 2018 — though the company is also conscious of a new phenomenon it describes as "China speed," where Chinese phone vendors will put its designs into products almost immediately. The Huawei Mate 9, for example, was released just eight months after ARM distributed the Mali-G71 to partners. This faster Chinese cadence could lead to some A75- and A55-based designs this year, but then bulk of them are likely to arrive with the usual smartphone refresh cycle early next year.

Sleek and slim, the 2016 machine packs a lot of power in its portable frame. There is just one problem, however. For power users, the 2016 MBP simply does not have enough horsepower to justify its “Pro” moniker and its premium price. If a noted Apple analyst is to be believed, however, the MacBook Pro 2017 might very well address all of the 2016 model’s issues sooner than expected. According to a MacWorld report, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a pretty solid track record with regards to his predictions about the tech giant, has stated that the entire Mac lineup would see an update this year. This includes the MacBook Pro, which would be given a processor boost and an upgrade on memory. While a processor and memory boost might appear to be marginal upgrades to the popular professional-grade laptop, these improvements would actually go a long way in establishing the MacBook Pro 2017 as a serious productivity machine capable of handling the most arduous tasks that users could throw at it. Currently, the Skylake chip-8GB RAM configuration of the device is good enough for basic productivity tasks, but when users attempt some serious video or image creation, the 2016 MBP struggles. My weapon blacked out. A post shared by Julian O'hayon (@anckor) on May 27, 2017 at 10:14am PDT The MacBook Pro is currently Apple’s most powerful laptop, but it could be so much better. According to persistent rumors about the upcoming device, the professional-grade laptop would be released with Intel’s Kaby Lake chips this coming June during Apple’s WWDC 2017 event. The Kaby Lake chips would not be all that the laptops would be equipped with, however, as the MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to be fitted with 16GB of RAM as well, which is double the amount that was featured in the 2016 models. Kuo even stated that a higher-end MacBook Pro, possibly a 15-inch model, would launch with 32GB of RAM late this year, which would all but make Apple’s professional-grade laptops worthy of their moniker. If any, the signs that Apple is preparing for an update in its lineup have begun appearing. Over the past few months, numerous Apple products, from the iPad Pro to the MacBook Pro 2016, have started going on sale, as noted by AppleInsider. If the Cupertino-based tech giant’s reputation is any indication, sales and promotions on outgoing models usually indicate that newer products would replace them soon. Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook Pro was a gamble that did not pay off as much as Apple expected. While the sleek machines boasted numerous advancements and new features that were not found in their predecessors, they were unfortunately held back by the design choices that the Cupertino-based tech giant rolled out for the computers. Among these is the retirement of legacy ports in favor of USB-C, which resulted in users scrambling to acquire dongles to get basic tasks done, as well as the removal of popular features such as the MagSafe power connector. Kick off your morning off on the right foot. #chillmorning #classicalmusic #coffee #macbookpro #latte #bestpartofwakingup A post shared by Kevin Yeager (@the_simple_cyclist) on May 28, 2017 at 5:13pm PDT Even the Touch Bar, arguably the MacBook Pro 2017’s most iconic feature, has been met with mixed reviews from users as of date. While the feature is undoubtedly novel, and while it does provide a new way for users to interact with their laptops, many have stated that the Touch Bar is not that useful in real-world applications at all. If any, the advantages of the Touch Bar are far outweighed by the compromises that Apple took when designing the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 2017 MacBook Pro would largely be the same device that was released last year. It would still have the same upgrade restrictions, the same lack of legacy ports and its Touch Bar would still be not as useful. Nevertheless, the added power that he Kaby Lake processors would give, and the ease of use that a RAM upgrade would provide, would surely be appreciated by consumers and avid Apple fans alike. Ultimately, such a push in specs would make the MacBook Pro 2017 worthy of its name.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI SAN FRANCISCO: A total of 34 artificial intelligence (AI) start-ups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in AI or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specialises in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested US$1bil in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of AI to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Startups Related Stories Related Stories Rocket Internet narrows losses, boosts sales at key startups Research tool to track animals’ brain activity US startups load up on debt "Investing for good' gains appeal amid rocky tech startup market Discontent among startup community in Sweden You May Be Interested A decent quarter with mixed results for banking sector Maybank IB feels the O&G sector has bottomed out Apple set to expand Siri voice assistant 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read AirAsia warns of ticket scams Getting closer to diverse society on two wheels Fed Cup squabble overshadows home fans' joy Property Related advertisement Latest News A decent quarter with mixed results for banking sector Net foreign buying on Bursa crosses key RM10b Maybank IB feels the O&G sector has bottomed out Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday KLCI wavers early Monday, key Asian markets mixed Most Viewed in Business Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday Higher revenue for IRB Ng to take AIA to the next stage of growth Net foreign buying on Bursa crosses key RM10b Chinese billionaires clash over Alibaba’s parcel deliveries Five golden rules for investing borrowed money TNB to start work on large solar project next month Affin Hwang Research sees Malaysian stock market in early stage rally My money mistakes KLCI wavers early Monday, key Asian markets mixed advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

REUTERS/Peter Nicholls    U.S. May Ban Carry-On Laptops For All International Flights Ted Goodman 6:19 PM 05/28/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly said Sunday that he is considering expanding the laptop ban to include all international flights. “Are you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the U.S.?” Fox News Sunday’s host Chris Wallace asked Kelly. “I might. That’s a quick answer,” Kelly responded. Kelly told Wallace that terrorists are obsessed with the idea of knocking down an airplane in mid-flight, especially if it’s a U.S. carrier full of Americans. He would not say when a decision on expanding the ban would be made, but told Wallace that he would follow the intelligence. “The very, very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world,” Kelly said. “There’s new technologies down the road, not too far down the road, that we will rely on,” Kelly told Wallace. “But it is a real sophisticated threat and I will reserve that decision until we see where it’s going.” DHS implemented restrictions on electronic devices larger than a cell phone on board aircraft flying into the United States from 10 airports located in eight majority-Muslim countries in late March. (RELATED: DHS: Airline Electronics Ban Based On New Intel) The decision to implement the policy in March came after new intelligence indicated that terrorist groups have “intensified” attempts to attack flights mid-air. “Our information indicates that terrorist groups’ efforts to execute an attack against the aviation sector are intensifying,” DHS said in a March 21 press release. While rumors swirled that DHS was considering an expansion of the ban to include flights from the European Union (EU), officials seemed to push back on that notion during talks in mid-May. During a May 17 meeting between the EU and DHS officials, they reached an agreement to take the ban “off the table for now,” according to the Associated Press. They shared details about aviation security standards and agreed to discuss the topic further. “The United States and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to continue working closely together on aviation security generally, including meeting next week in Washington D.C. to further assess shared risks and solutions for protecting airline passengers, whilst ensuring the smooth functioning of global air travel,” members of the organizations said in a joint statement. The aviation sector is under constant threat from terrorist groups because of the ability to inflict a mass casualty event and the global media attention that follows. Terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer products,” according to CNN. Officials cited the 2015 airliner downing in Egypt, the 2016 attempted airliner downing in Somalia, and the 2016 attacks against airports in Brussels and Istanbul as examples of terror-related incidents involving aviation targets.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that.

It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

I had longed for that game but never thought my system might be able to handle it, so wrote it off til an upgrade. But then I found it has a demo – demo works a trick. Proceeding to get the full thing! Woop! Never would’ve thought to try, if not for Prey being in this list. Gotta thank RPS (again) for that one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Tech giants acquired 34 AI startups in Q1 2017 Reuters May 28, 2017 9:33 AM Above: Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, onstage at Google I/O 2017. (Reuters) – A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Company invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

Senator Bob Corker, a conservative Republican from Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, dubbed Trump the "wrecking ball president." Now this wrecking ball is damaging America's alliance with Europe and its procedures for handling the country’s most sensitive secrets, leaving U.S. military and intelligence, and their foreign counterparts, aghast. Trump’s habitual carelessness is dangerous, they say. In his speech to NATO leaders Thursday he scolded them for failing to live up commitments to increase defense spending while failing to mention Article 5, the NATO mutual-defense pledge — something other leaders had been hoping to hear. The Associated Press described the speech as an "unprecedented one-two punch" that "further rattled" an already anxious Europe. One Democratic leader called the remarks "condescending" and an "embarrassment." And that was before Trump described the Germans as "evil, very evil" for running a trade surplus with the United States. The trail of wreckage left by Trump's big mouth is growing longer by the day. Intel on ISIS On May 15, the Washington Post reported that Trump had revealed highly classified information to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in a White House meeting. “This is code-word information,” said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.” The details emerged over the next week. The information, obtained from Israel, concerned specific terrorist plotting by the Islamic State, including Islamic State advances in bomb-making that could be used to mask an explosive device inside a laptop, according to USA Today. Trump’s defense quickly fell apart. He claimed he never mentioned Israel in his talks with the Russians. Whether that is literally true or whether he was lying (again), doesn’t really matter. Israeli officials were “furious” about the disclosures, Foreign Policy reported, and Israeli defense minister Avigdor Lieberman acknowledged that Israel had “tweaked its intelligence-sharing protocols" with the United States after Trump’s off-script remarks. “I can confirm that we did a spot repair and that there’s unprecedented intelligence cooperation with the United States,” Lieberman told Israeli Army Radio. “What we had to clarify with our friends in the United States, we did. We did our check.” Former CIA director John Brennan testified Tuesday that if the president shared classified Israeli intelligence with Russian officials at the White House as reported, he violated intelligence-sharing protocol. “It appears as though, at least from the press reports, that neither did it go in the proper channels nor did the originating agency have the opportunity to clear language for it,” Brennan said. “That is a problem." Submarine Location Then came the disclosure that Trump had told Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that the U.S. had two nuclear submarines stationed near North Korea. “We have a lot of firepower over there,” Trump said, according to a transcript obtained by The Intercept. “We have two submarines—best in the world—we have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all.” BuzzFeed News reported that "Pentagon officials are in shock after the release of a transcript between President Donald Trump and his Philippines counterpart reveals that the U.S. military had moved two nuclear submarines towards North Korea. 'We never talk about subs!' three U.S. officials said." Rank and file military personnel also expressed surprise at the breach of normal security procedures. @CitizensFedUp @sartorialskwirl @BraddJaffy I am a Navy wife, my husband was on subs. WE were never allowed to know where they were or allowed to talk about the dates of deployment — Kate Jones (@katejns8) May 25, 2017 A Pattern In February, Trump "astounded" White House veterans with his decision to turn the public terrace of his Florida home into a situation room after he learned of a North Korea missile launch. Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe remained at the table and discussed their response. "While waiters came and went — and while one club member snapped photos — the two leaders reviewed documents by the light of an aide’s cellphone,” the Washington Post reported, adding that presidents typically “move to private, secured settings to hash out such an event.” In fact, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has an on-site Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, a specially outfitted room for storing top-secret records and holding confidential conversations. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1420251685282-2'); });The White House denied any classified information had been seen or discussed at the impromptu dinner table conference, but that hardly addresses the qualms of security professionals. “Assuming the smartphones staffers held aloft were consumer devices, they’re basically bugs waiting for someone to activate them,” noted Wire’s Brian Barrett. “Android phones are notoriously insecure outside of the most recent update, and even then aren’t guaranteed safe." “The idea that somebody could target these phones is not science fiction,” says Matthew Green, cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University. “It’s actually a pretty standard, well-understood threat.” Not by the president of the United States, it seems. _______ About author Jefferson Morley is AlterNet's Washington correspondent.

I keep getting astounded by I keep getting astounded by the duplicity in the right wing pundits, seen recently on CNN with some right wing woman trying to use her talking point, and even Alan Dershowitz. They make the point "the president can declassify any classified information any time he sees fit to". Ok. Though we all pretty much know this wasn't a conscious decision to declassify, wasn't precluded by any actual thinking, reflecting, decision, it was him running his big mouth trying to impress them, But ok. But their follow up talking point is the real logic tortuous point that "and it was the leaking of this to the press that is the illegal and damaging part of it". You see the problem? Ignoring that th leaker was the president, and that Russia could well do damage to the assets, and are allied with Syria, Iran, etc...ignore that, and then realize they are now pretending the information is STILL classified. I mean if their first argument is that Trump de facto declassified that Intel, then it is no longer classified.. So leaking to the press is just passing declassified information.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ) have been on a volatile ride this month. AMD stock came into May hot, up 20%. Shares subsequently lost 24% after AMD missed revenue estimates and reported in-line earnings results. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Those losses were seemingly in the rearview mirror when, in mid-May, rumors of a licensing deal between AMD and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) materialized. No comment from the company and denial from Intel caused those gains to fade though. Moving Forward with Advanced Micro Devices Shares are still down about 19% for the month of May. Despite the decline, Advanced Micro Devices is still up a whopping 184% over the past 12 months. Investors now need to figure out if it’s time to bail on AMD stock or get in on the action. A big part of AMD’s story is execution. Basically, can management deliver? Over the past six quarters, AMD has beaten EPS estimates four times and had in-line results the other two. In that same span, Advanced Micro Devices has beaten revenue estimates five times. Not to get too historical, but AMD didn’t have one beat in either category for the six quarters prior to that period. So, to say management is improving would be an understatement. Analysts expect earnings of 7 cents per share in 2017. It would be a big deal if AMD were to become profitable this year, after four years of losses. Building on that momentum, analysts expect ~330% earnings growth in 2018 to 30 cents per share. This is where management’s execution comes into play. Advanced Micro’s debt picture is another reason for optimism. In June, AMD was carrying $2.24 billion in debt. As of last quarter, that figure stood at just $1.41 billion, a reduction of 37%. Finally, there’s valuation. As AMD works toward profitability, its earnings-based valuation is just okay. But, on a sales-basis, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t too bad. In fact, trading at 2.33x trailing sales is lower than both Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ). On a forward sales basis, AMD is also cheaper. Trading AMD Stock AMD gives bullish traders a good opening – albeit, a slight one. Support currently sits at the 200-day moving average, around $10.10. Below that, the stock is pretty iffy. Source: Stockcharts.com That’s good for bulls and bears alike though. Bulls can use this level, or one close to it, as their stop-loss. AMD stock should rally should that level hold, although it could have trouble clearing $12.50. Previously serving as support, this level will now likely act as resistance and give AMD stock limited upside. Make no mistake about it, AMD suffered some big damage when it fell on earnings. But, a run back to $12.50 would represent a 15%-20% return, depending on where investors buy the stock. The Intel-rumor rally gave hope to bullish momentum returning. But, its negative reaction could cause the MACD to turn bearish once more (purple circle). That’s what gives bears some hope. Should the MACD turn bearish – the black line falling below the red line – and the $10 level give way as support, bears will be in control. In that case, there’s no real way to know how much downside could exist. But, one thing would be certain: Bulls would be in trouble. At least in the short-term, then, being long AMD would be painful. In the current case of Advanced Micro Devices, the advantage goes to bulls, for now. But, that will change if AMD stock falls below $10.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment.

Doug Ducey, some of Arizona’s needy will be able to get an additional year of help. Big corporations and investors will get increased tax credits. And cities will get to ask voters to hike taxes only once every two years. But farmers can forget about growing industrial hemp. And student journalists are not going to get new First Amendment protections from administrative oversight. Ducey penned his approval to 27 new laws on Monday, the last of what the legislature approved in its 122-day session. But he found six unacceptable, bringing his veto record this session to 11. Proponents of industrial hemp said it would provide Arizona farmers with a new cash crop. The plant is a type of marijuana, but with a concentration of tetrahydrocannibinol, the psychoactive element of the drug, of not more than 0.3 percent. Technically, hemp production, like marijuana, remains illegal. But this measure was built on a 2014 federal law that allows state departments of agriculture to begin cultivating industrial hemp in certain circumstances, including research. The governor said his only reason for the veto was the failure of the legislation to provide funding for the state Department of Agriculture to administer the program. Ducey had a more specific reason for his veto of legislation designed to guarantee both college and high school journalists some First Amendment protections from administrative censorship. The legislation is the culmination of efforts Sen. Kimberly Yee, R-Phoenix, started when she was a student at Greenway High School and a staffer on the Demon Dispatch. After having some of her cartoons quashed by school administration she lobbied Stan Furman, then her state senator, to provide some shielding for student journalists. It was only last year Yee said she realized that while the measure had cleared the Senate it died in the House. So now, a senator herself, Yee championed the measure. In his veto, Ducey said students journalists “play an important role because they are the next generation of journalists who will hold our government and leaders accountable.” “I worry, however, that this bill could create unintended consequences, especially on high school campuses where adult supervision and mentoring is most important,” he wrote. On the enactment side of the agenda, the governor agreed to restoring coverage for a full two years for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. In 2015 the governor and lawmakers imposed a one-year lifetime limit on the emergency cash, the stingiest in the nation. Ducey in January asked lawmakers to reverse course, but with restrictions and conditions that could disqualify some for violations like children not being in school at least 90 percent of the time, conditions that may result in just 70 percent of eligible recipients actually getting the second year. The measure also will allow drug offenders who have completed prison terms to get food stamps to help them get back on their feet, but with a requirement for random drug testing. Another provision waives state licensing fees for people below 200 percent of the federal poverty level — about $40,000 for a family of three — to help them start their own businesses. On the subject of business, the governor signed three separate measures that proponents say will help economic development. One extends and expands an existing state corporate income tax credit for research and development activities. This is designed mainly to benefit large corporations, with proponents specifically mentioning Intel. Ducey also agreed to expand an existing “angel investors” program that gives investors a 30 percent income tax credit — 35 percent for certain targeted industries — for money they invest, mainly in small companies. That provoked controversy over why the state should essentially give away another $10 million — the old cap was $20 million — to people who reap the benefits of their investments but do not share the profits with the state. There also is an expansion of the Arizona Competes Fund which provides grants to eligible companies, with new language designed to designate some of the dollars to “micro enterprises.” One measure Ducey signed is likely to provoke a lawsuit. It says that cities can seek voter approval of sales tax hikes only in even-numbered years — and only at the November general election. Current law allows local elections on four specific dates every year. But proponents of the change say that allows city officials to “game” the system, calling elections on days when turnout is likely to be low so as to give the advantage to highly organized supporters who can get out their members. State lawmakers enacted a similar measure in 2012 telling cities on what dates they could hold candidate elections. But that was voided three years later by the state Court of Appeals which ruled that, at least for the state’s 18 charter cities, the legislature had no right to intercede in what is a strictly local matter. Other bills signed Monday by Ducey include: – Giving lawmakers nine cents more a mile in reimbursement for the use of their vehicles than other state employees. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard said the extensive use of personal vehicles by legislators going to and from the capitol and other official events justifies the difference; – Requiring school districts and charter schools to report the number of suspensions and expulsions that involve possession, use or sale of illegal drugs.

The flaw, according to Motherboard, was in Twitter’s Ad Studio, which allowed advertisers to upload media. The bug, which was discovered in February and quickly patched, is described in detail by kedrisch, the researcher who discovered it – and reported it to Twitter. An attacker could target another Twitter user first by sharing media with them and then modifying the post request with the victim’s account ID. The researcher was awarded a bug bounty of $7,500 – but a former Twitter exec, Charlie Miller, tweeted that he was “not shocked” that this vulnerability was in code from the ads team. Redmond creates Chinese version of Windows 10 Chinese government officials are getting a custom version of Windows 10 built by Microsoft for Beijing, the Redmond software giant said earlier this week. A blog post from Terry Myerson of Microsoft’s Windows and Devices group was a bit sparse on details of what tweaks Redmond has made for the Chinese government. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Myerson said that as a result of “earnestly co-operating” with Beijing, they had built the “China Government Edition [that] will use these manageability features to remove features that are not needed by Chinese government employees like OneDrive, to manage all telemetry and updates and to enable the government to use its own encryption algorithms within its computer systems”. Big technology companies have struggled with China’s heavy-handed approach to their products: many platforms such as Facebook and Google are banned in China, while China has demanded to see the source code of products. Microsoft had joined big tech hitters including Intel in declining to share their code, but it seems now that Redmond and Beijing have come to an agreement. Password manager creates ‘travel mode’ We’re fans of password managers here at Naked Security, and we’ve also been covering the ongoing issues of travellers being asked to hand over their phones and passwords to immigration officials, so we’re pleased to see that one app has come up with a way to protect your sensitive passwords from prying eyes at a border. 1Password has come up with what it’s calling Travel Mode: before you leave home, you add the passwords you might not mind sharing to into a “safe for travel” vault in the app, then turn on travel mode. At that point, all your other passwords are removed from the device. Then, when you’re safely over the border and customs officials have finished with your phone, you turn off travel mode and all your more sensitive passwords are restored to the device. It’s not foolproof – a smart customs official could ask you to disable travel mode – but it could help you keep sensitive passwords safe while you travel.

On top of that, the government steals trade secrets from other countries, secrets that others have poured countless hours of work and billions of dollars into developing. People have no idea how superior the Chinese government feels nor how immoral or power hungry it is. Every action they’ve taken is part of a plan to dominate the entire world. Colonialism? You haven’t seen anything yet. They need to be stood up to very firmly by other countries if they are to be stopped. Reply jkwilborn says: May 27, 2017 at 9:29 am It’s still a business deal and Microsoft is a money making company. For consumer protection reasons itself software should be in the open sourced. Hopefully the Government will learn that our rights are protected if we are in the country. Being at an entry point airport, harbor or boarder crossing in the US, you still have your rights. This is illegal search and seizer. No matter how the Government tries to get your data they will always be behind the state of the art, as legislation cannot move fast enough. Unless they roll over us with a steam roller and outlaw encryption. This will eliminate the US from continuance in the world technology market. At some point it will be similar to a crook dropping the items overboard in miles of seawater. No way to reach it. If you’ve been around computers very long, sometimes you lose stuff and it’s unrecoverable.

LaptopsNewsPersonal Technology Asus takes the world’s thinnest convertible notebook crown. Babu Mohan May 29, 20170484 Convertibles. No, not cars that fold down their roofs at a press of a switch, we’re talking about the PC kind – touchscreen equipped notebooks that can be folded 360 degrees to turn them into tablets. Often called 2-in-1 convertible notebooks, in the last few years they’ve become quite trendy thanks to more efficient and cooler processors, excellent screens and Windows 10, which has touch capabilities that actually work (if you had to live with Windows 8 touch user interface you’ll know exactly what I mean.) In the last year or so we’ve seen some sexy svelte 2-in-1 convertibles, predominantly from Lenovo and HP, but now it’s the turn of Taiwanese PC maker Asus to grab the thin-and-light limelight with the ZenBook Flip S (UX370). Weighing in at 1.1kg and just 10.9mm thick, it grabs the crown as the world’s thinnest 2-in-1 convertible notebook in a 13.3-inch form factor. The ZenBook Flip S features a 13.3-inch 4K display with very thin bezels on the sides, which Asus is referring to as “NanoEdge” and just like Microsoft’s new Surface Pro, the ZenBook Flip S display supports active stylus input as well. Being a convertible, you can “flip” the display as per your preference, thanks to a 360-degree ErgoLift hinge made out of steel alloy. Under the hood, ZenBook Flip S is powered by Intel’s latest 7th Gen Core i7-7500U processor with a boost frequency of 3.5 GHz. It also includes up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD for ultra-fast performance. In order to keep the internals running cool inside the razor-thin chassis, Asus is using a custom “liquid-crystal polymer fan” that happens to be 0.3mm thin. Rest of the key highlights include a fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello authentication, Harman/Kardon audio, and up to 14 hours of battery life. Announced at a Pre-Computex 2017 event, the Asus ZenBook Flip S will go on sale in the US in September this year with a price tag of US $1,099 for the base configuration. The convertible will ship with Microsoft’s Windows 10 S operating system out of the box.

Online retailer Snapdeal, which is likely to be merged with Flipkart, on Monday said that it has received a fund infusion of Rs 113.3 crore (about $17 million) from existing investor Nexus Venture Partners and co-founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal. In a Registrar of Companies filing, the company declared that Snapdeal CEO Bahl and COO Bansal were allotted 1,300 Series J preference shares and Nexus was allotted 14, 810 preference shares. While Nexus invested Rs 96.26 crore, Bahl and Bansal contributed Rs 8.45 crore each. The investment comes at a time Snapdeal’s biggest investor SoftBank is leading from the front to merge the company with Flipkart. The Japanese investor expects the merger will change the ecommerce landscape in the country and help in its fight against the US rival Amazon. Snapdeal didn’t respond to an email query from DH on the development. Nexus Ventures’ total investment in Snapdeal now reaches Rs 306 crore. Nexus first invested in Snapdeal in January 2011 during its Series B round via its Nexus India Direct Investments II fund. In total, Snapdeal has raised around $1.65 billion from about two dozen investors, including SoftBank and Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba. Besides Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn and global online marketplace eBay, Snapdeal investors include venture capital firms such as Intel Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners and Kalaari Capital, among others. According to an analyst, the move of Nexus and Snapdeal founders to again fund the company is surprising. “Softbank recently completed the buyback of shares of Kalaari Capital and the Snapdeal founders, leading to 47.5% shareholding in the ecommerce marketplace. How they are planning to shape up the merger with the Flipkart is now uncertain,” he said. The Japanese investor SoftBank has been going ahead with the proposed merger of Snapdeal with Flipkart and recently managed to convince earlier investors like Nexus and Kalaari Capital. Last February, Flipkart offered $1 billion in stock to buy Snapdeal, excluding its payment arm Freecharge and in this month the company also signed a term-sheet for buying out. Flipkart offering to Snapdeal is really less than its peak valuation of $6.5 billion in February 2016 when it raised $50 million from investors. This will also affect the commitment made by the company founders plan to offer $30 million (Rs 193 Cr) bonanza to its staff after the deal with Flipkart. In a related development, a group of 45 unnamed ex-employees of Snapdeal have sought an explanation from the company on the value of their employee stock option plan (ESOPs) after the merger.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars SECURITY Synaptics warns that fingerprint spoofing makes laptops vulnerable Dean Takahashi@deantak May 29, 2017 12:10 PM In the wake of the WannaCry ransomware computer virus attack, here’s one more thing to worry about. The fingerprint identification systems that some modern laptops employ to recognize users can be easily compromised with a spoofing process. Synaptics, which makes fingerprint identification sensors and touchpad technology, earlier this month issued a warning that some computer makers, seeking to save about 25 cents per machine, have chosen to use insecure smartphone fingerprint sensors instead of more secure laptop sensors, said Godfrey Cheng, vice president of product for the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company, in an interview with VentureBeat. “Fingerprint identification has taken off because it is secure and convenient when it’s done right,” he said. “When it’s not secure all of the way through, then that’s an exposure that an attacker can exploit.” The smartphone fingerprint sensors typically use unencrypted methods to store and send the fingerprint to a central processing unit (CPU) for processing. That makes the data vulnerable to snooping software and other hacks. Synaptics sensors, by contrast, use encryption and a secondary host processor to do the recognition work. That encryption makes it a lot harder for hackers to copy the fingerprint and use it to unlock a computer remotely, Cheng said. Synaptics will demo the fingerprint insecurity at the Computex trade show in Taiwan this week. The insecure fingerprint sensors are disturbing because modern laptop users are conditioned to believe that fingerprints are unique and are much safer than passwords. This is largely true, but a laptop manufacturer’s choice in sensors can potentially lead to the theft of your fingerprint image. That makes a user’s laptop secrets vulnerable, as well as those of an entire enterprise, if it’s a work computer. “There are two types of fingerprint sensors in the notebook market today,” Cheng said. “Those that are encrypted and safe, and those that are unencrypted and unsafe.” Cheng showed that thieves can use typical phishing methods to take control of your computer and can plant a software program to sniff out your fingerprint when you use the laptop’s fingerprint scanner. Once they have the image, they can use a spoof to gain access. He showed this working on a machine I was using, as you can see in the video. “Some computer makers will compromise their brand and customers for 25 cents,” said Cheng. “That’s wrong. They claim they have encryption, but not on [the] link of the sensor to the host.” Above: Synaptics fingerprint demo Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Theives can also print an actual fingerprint from a $200 inkjet printer that contains your fingerprint data. If a thief takes the printout and presses it down against a fingerprint sensor, the fingerprint scanner will recognize the paper as a legitimate fingerprint and unlock the computer. Cheng and his colleagues showed such a spoof working for me in a demo. Whatever level of access the user has to the enterprise is now exposed for the hacker. They can get access to a company’s data and all of its corporate network access services. And if you use your fingerprint to verify passwords for various ecommerce accounts. those networks become vulnerable as well. This attack method can be expanded to power control circuitry, allowing a thief to power on the system at will remotely and turn it off without anyone noticing. To prevent this from happening, you should check to see if your laptop uses encrypted fingerprint sensors, such as those made by Synaptics. Synaptics has introduced a suite of security features dubbed SentryPoint, which fully encrypt the paths between the fingerprint sensor and the computer host or a secondary processor. “Encryption is only as strong as its weakest link,” Cheng said. Above: Godfrey Cheng of Synaptics. Image Credit: Synaptics Some laptop manufacturers chose to use smartphone fingerprint sensors for cost reasons. But laptops are more vulnerable than phones, since we keep smartphones on our bodies, in our pants pockets or purses, most of the time. Notebooks are often left on the desk at home, in the car, at the office, and on a public coffee shop table. You can easily get access to the internals of a notebook casing in just a few minutes. Intel and Microsoft are both working hard to protect data once it is inside the host environment. Flash-based storage, known as SSDs, is encrypted. Even the BIOS (basic input output software, which starts a computer) is now secured. This leaves any unencrypted sensor as a vulnerability. Two-factor authentication, in which a user has to provide two means of secure identification, would help deal with this vulnerability. If your laptop combined fingerprint and face identification that would help. Biometric fingerprint solutions use a publicly vetted algorithm, such as AES256. Using a present-day super-computer, it would take a very long time to brute force (try all possible combinations) an AES 256-bit key. That’s not impossible to crack, but it’s very inconvenient for the attackers. The whole point is to balance convenience for users with protection. “Fingerprint identification will have breakages, as no security is perfect,” Cheng said. “We will continue to step up. Security is weighed against convenience. Somewhere in the middle is a happy medium.” VB Recommendations Why shortcuts for Google Home are a total waste of time Are chatbots just another fad?

And Apple would not miss an opportunity regarding AI. After all Siri is the most famous AI product since 2011. But, now things have changed and according to a Bloomberg report the company is working on a chip dedicated AI chip, in order to boost the performance. The chip is reportedly called Neural Engine and a person familiar with project said that it will improve devices like iPhones and iPads to handle tasks such as facial and speech recognition. Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures said about the company’s plans: “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Now, according to the report this new chip will take the load from the main processor and the graphics chip. This means that the overall performance will be better and of course the battery life will become better. Also the AI chip is designed to bring major improvements to the company’s hardware and the main goal is to bring the chip in devices like the iPhone and iPad. In addition the person with the knowledge about the subject indicated that the tech giant has already tested some prototypes of future iPhones with the chip. But, it’s not sure that the chip will be available ay time soon. However it is possible that Apple will choose to reveal something about their AI projects at the WWDC in June. The same source claims that the tech giant will introduce the newest operating system iOS 11, for iPhones and iPads, with an updated interface. And they might say something about the laptops with chips from Intel. It seems that Apple doesn’t want to stay to far behind from its competitors. Amazon has Echo with many new features and Google Home is pretty popular. So artificial intelligence is a crucial part from the company’s future. Also, since 2010 the California-based company is working on its own processors in-house. Besides the A4 chip for iPhone and iPad they have released the processors for the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. Apple didn’t want to make a statement about the chip and maybe the developer’s conference is the place to do it.

The company revealed the smart router at Computex 2017, which is currently happening in Taipei. Unlike a traditional Wi-Fi router with at least two-four antennas, Asus’ Blue Cave is actually antenna-less. Instead, there is a hole in the middle which Asus likes to call a “central aperture” that directs the signal. Asus says the router will ensure smooth 4K UHD video streaming and lag-free gaming. It also supports IFTTT for automated tasks in smart homes. “Blue Cave is an elegantly designed AC2600-class dual-band smart Wi-Fi router that combines superb performance, commercial-grade security and family friendly features with stylish good looks. The use of powerful, specially designed internal antennas in Blue Cave is the key to its stylish and elegant antenna-less design, which features a unique and attractive central aperture that is bathed in gentle blue light,” said Asus. The Blue Cave also features latest Intel chipset that delivers ultrafast AC2600-class dual band Wi-Fi speeds. Plus, it also gets Asus’ AiProtection, the first commercial-grade security for home networks. It’s a free-for-life security solution powered by Trend Micro Smart Home Network, which protects every connected smart device on the network, including IoT devices. Moreover, Asus is allowing smartphone users to control the router through an app on their device. Even though Asus is yet to reveal anything on availability, according to a report from Engadget, the Blue Cave is priced at $180 ( or approx Rs. 11,617).

May, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Mainland China'S Semiconductor and Equipment Markets: A Complete Analysis of the Technical, Economic, and Political Issues" report to their offering. This report analyzes Mainland China's semiconductor and equipment industries, examining the technical, economic, and political issues that are shaping this nascent industry. China is by far the largest consumer of semiconductors; it accounts for about 45 percent of the worldwide demand for chips, used both in China and for exports. But more than 90 percent of its consumption relies on imported integrated circuits. Integrated-circuit companies in China entered the semiconductor market late - some two decades after the rest of the world - and have been playing catch-up ever since in an industry in which success depends on scale and learning efficiencies. The Chinese government made several attempts to build a local semiconductor industry, but none really took hold. Now, however, things are changing on both the business and policy fronts. Mainland China represents a huge opportunity for semiconductor manufacturers and equipment and materials suppliers.

Company chairman Jonney Shih took to the stage to present 'The Edge of Beyond'. That 'edge' comes from the increasingly thin range of ZenBooks and VivoBooks unveiled. Five new slim and stylish laptops were shown off Asus didn't stop there; it also showcased a pair of AiOs, a new monitor, the ZenFone AR, and the intriguingly designed Asus Blue Cave Wi-Fi router. (The full Edge of Beyond presentation video is embedded at end of this article). Laptops and convertibles As hinted at above, the newest ZenBooks and VivoBooks are the thinnest yet from Asus. For example, the ZenBook Flip S (UX370) is the "world's thinnest convertible laptop", and the ZenBook 3 Deluxe (UX490) is the "world's thinnest 14-inch laptop". Meanwhile it might not break records by the ZenBook Pro (UX550) is the thinnest, lightest and most powerful in this professional-grade ultraportable series to date. Asus ZenBook Flip S (UX370): is only 10.9mm thin and 1.1 kg light, features a 360°-flippable display plus ErgoLift hinge for improved typing angle. Powered by up to a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor and an ultrafast 1TB PCIe SSD. Buyers can specify a NanoEdge screen up to 4K UHD multitouch with active stylus support. Includes fingerprint sensor. Asus ZenBook Pro (UX550): based around a 15.6-inch 4K UHD NanoEdge display and quad-speaker Harman Kardon surround-sound audio. Under the bonnet of this 8.9mm thin and 1.8kg light device is up to a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor for notebooks, gaming-grade Nvidia GeForce GTX1050 Ti graphics, a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD and 16GB DDR4 RAM. Despite its power Asus still promises exceptional battery life - up to 14 hours. Includes fingerprint sensor. Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe (UX490): Again Asus has squeezed a larger display into a smaller form factor. The ZenBook 3 Deluxe has a 12.9mm thin and 1.1 kg light 13-inch-class chassis that houses a 14-inch NanoEdge ultranarrow-bezel display. Inside you will find a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor, up to 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 RAM, and a 1TB PCI Express (PCIe) SSD. Asus boasts this laptop provides two USB Type-C ports that are Thunderbolt 3 enabled with support for 40Gbps data transfers, dual 4K UHD external displays and power delivery. Includes fingerprint sensor. There's a pair of new VivoBooks too. These are a rung down from the premium ZenBook line but the new VivoBook S15 features a premium design with a 15.6-inch display in a 14-inch-class chassis, and the VivoBook Pro 15 is said to be the most powerful VivoBook ever. "Our brand-new ZenBook and VivoBook line-up truly goes to the edge of beyond, providing everyone with a new definition of thin, beautiful and powerful laptops," said Asus chairman Shih. Behind all these thinner and lighter designs are Intel's 7th generation Core processors. Asus VivoBook Pro 15 (N580): This is a slim and light laptop with a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, up to 16GB DDR4 RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 GPU. Hybrid storage up to 2TB HDD and a 512GB SSD can be equipped. The display offers 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) with wide-view technology and a wide 100 per cent sRGB colour gamut. Harman Kardon stereo audio supports the colourful and rich visuals. Includes fingerprint sensor and support for the Asus Pen. Asus VivoBook S15 (S510): This is the pinnacle of the VivoBook range. A 15.6-inch NanoEdge display laptop, it has a 17.9mm profile and weighs 1.5kg. Inside you will find a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7500U processor with up to 16GB DDR4 memory and NVIDIA GeForce 940MX graphics. Asus also showed off a couple of new AiOs, the ZenFone AR and the Designo MZ27AQ monitor. You can read more about them here or watch through the video below. Asus Blue Cave Here is an AC2600-class dual-band smart Wi-Fi router with a unique design. Asus says that it "combines superb performance, commercial-grade security and family friendly features with stylish good looks." Inside is an Intel dual-band Wi-Fi chipset said to be perky enough for problem free 4K UHD video streaming, lag-free gaming and fast file downloads. Its design is 'antenna less' but of course the antennas are inside. The internal array of antennas facilitates the appealing central aperture that is bathed in gentle blue light. The incorporated Asus AiProtection security is a free-for-life security solution powered by Trend Micro Smart Home Network. Thanks to this your connected devices and IoT products should be protected from outside nasties. Another appealing feature of the Blue Cave is its PC-free network control using a smartphone or tablet. Owners can easily monitor and control each family member's internet and app usage.

Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 29 May, 2017, 13:00 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Mainland China'S Semiconductor and Equipment Markets: A Complete Analysis of the Technical, Economic, and Political Issues" report to their offering. This report analyzes Mainland China's semiconductor and equipment industries, examining the technical, economic, and political issues that are shaping this nascent industry. China is by far the largest consumer of semiconductors; it accounts for about 45 percent of the worldwide demand for chips, used both in China and for exports. But more than 90 percent of its consumption relies on imported integrated circuits. Integrated-circuit companies in China entered the semiconductor market late - some two decades after the rest of the world - and have been playing catch-up ever since in an industry in which success depends on scale and learning efficiencies. The Chinese government made several attempts to build a local semiconductor industry, but none really took hold. Now, however, things are changing on both the business and policy fronts. Mainland China represents a huge opportunity for semiconductor manufacturers and equipment and materials suppliers. Massive investments in China's semiconductor industry is paying off as internal production is making inroads on demand. The emerging semiconductor market will exhibit growth far in excess of any other country.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Lenovo Upgrades Its Gaming Laptop Legion Y920 Azeem Ullah 7 days ago Earlier this year, Lenovo updated the low-end systems under their Legion gaming brand. Now, the company is doing the same for the top-end Y920, just in time for Computex, Taiwan. The new Legion Y920 is another machine aimed at advanced gamers which dutifully ticks all the boxes both in terms of speed and output. It aims to be one of your top choices if you are in the market for such systems and so far it looks to have succeeded. Display, Internals and Storage The Y920 comes with a 17.3-inch IPS display on the front, with 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution. The display supports Nvidia G-Sync and comes with a 75Hz refresh rate, too. The keyboard takes a page out of Razer’s book, offering RGB LEDs and programmable buttons. The keys are also mechanical for a richer (and clickier) experience. Under the hood, you get either an Intel Kaby Lake 2.8GHz Core i7-7700HQ or a 2.9GHz i7-7820K processor. That’s accompanied with 16 GB LPDDR4 memory as well as a 512 GB SSD, which can be aided with an additional 1 TB hard drive. For graphical needs, you get a Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card with 8 GB VRAM. Connectivity Options, Battery and Weight For connectivity, you get 4 USB 3.0, 1 USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, 1 DisplayPort, 1 HDMI and Ethernet, alongside Wi-Fi 802.11ac, 6-in-1 card reader and Bluetooth 4.1. There are dual 2W JBL speakers with 3W subwoofer, as well as a 720p webcam. The laptop won’t come light, but then again gaming machines are seldom on the featherweight side. It weighs in at 4.6 kg or over 10 pounds with a width of 36 mm. The battery here is a 90W cell. It comes with Microsoft’s Windows 10 Home pre-installed. Price and Availability The Legion Y920 will cost $2,699 once it goes up on sale starting from June at Lenovo’s online store. With similar specs you can get an Alienware 17 R4 for $2,400 or the HP Omen 17 with a GTX 1070 for $1,800 which makes the Y920’s value prospect smaller.

Our Early Verdict The Asus ZenBook Flip S is an incredibly thin and light 2-in-1 device. If you're looking for a machine that works as both a laptop and a tablet, and also combines stunning design with a tempting price, then this could be the machine for you. For Very thin-and-light Lovely design Against Unclear on price for top-end model Unclear on specs for low-end model At Asus' kickoff Computex event, chairman Jonney Shih excitedly announced the Asus ZenBook  Flip S – which he declared was the thinnest convertible laptop in the world. It doesn't take much to get the eccentric Shih excited, but it appears his enthusiasm is well placed, as from what we've seen the Asus ZenBook Flip S is set to be an incredibly well-built, powerful and desirable device. As a follow-up to the well-received Asus ZenBook Flip UX360, Asus appears to have improved on nearly every aspect, while, crucially, maintaining the ZenBook Flip family's most compelling feature: a low price. Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 release date and price At the launch event on May 29, it was revealed that the Asus ZenBook Flip S would go on sale with a price tag starting at $1,099 (around £850, AU$1,500). This elicited an excited response from the crowd, and it certainly seems like Asus has pitched this at a very compelling price. This is around twice the price of the older – and less powerful - Asus ZenBook Flip UX360, and about the same price as the HP Spectre x360, which currently sits at the top of our best 2-in-1 laptop list. For this price you're getting an excellently-designed hybrid laptop with some impressive specifications. While $1,099 is the price for the base configuration of the Asus ZenBook Flip S, you can choose other versions that come with more powerful components – but the price tag will rise accordingly. We don't currently have a breakdown of how much the other configurations cost, but we'll update this review when we hear more. We also weren't told a release date, though we hope it isn't too far off. We've reached out to our Asus contacts to find out more, so check back here soon to find out when you can get the Asus ZenBook Flips S in your hands. Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 design Probably the most striking thing about the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 – and the aspect Asus is pinning its success on – is its design. As we mentioned, Asus is boasting that this is the world's thinnest convertible laptop – and with a body that's just 10.9mm thin, it certainly seems that this is no hollow claim. That's a fair bit slimmer than the older ZenBook Flip UX360, which has a 13.7mm thickness. Meanwhile the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1, another 2-in-1 that puts an emphasis on stylish design, is also thicker at 13.7mm. Not only is the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 incredibly thin, it's also impressively light as well, weighing just 1.1kg. Making such a thin and light laptop – especially one that can swap between laptop and tablet modes, is no easy feat, and Asus was keen to highlight the innovations it made when it comes to making the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 so svelte. This includes making the body out of aerospace-grade aluminum, an ultra-thin vapor-chamber cooling system and a 'ErgoLift' hinge, which allows the screen to flip 360 degrees, whilst also remaining incredibly slim. To make sure this hinge is as robust as possible, Asus subjects it to a 20,000-cycle open-and-close test – so it's unlikely this hybrid is going to snap in two any time soon. This results in the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 not only looking slim, but also carrying on the premium look that the ZenBook range has been known for, while also feeling both light and solid. It does feel fantastic to hold, and it's light enough to easily slip into a bag and carry around with you without causing any discomfort. The 13.3-inch screen features a 4K UHD display for stunning image quality (with a pixel density of 331 PPI (pixels per inch), and it includes multi-touch support for using Windows 10 with your fingers or a stylus – essential when it is in tablet mode.   Perhaps the most striking feature of the screen is the 'NanoEdge' technology, which means the screen is surrounded by incredibly thin bezels measuring just 6.11mm – leading to an impressive 80% screen-to-body ratio. Overall the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 is a beautifully designed laptop that feels great to use and carry around, and will likely garner impressed comments from anyone you show it to. Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 specs Although we were impressed by the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 at the launch event, we can't help but feel that Asus was a little cheeky – while it only disclosed the price for the lowest-specification Asus ZenBook Flip S, it also only revealed the specs for the highest-specification model.  That means we're not really sure what kind of specs the $1099 model will have, and nor do we know how much the Asus ZenBook Flip S with these specifications will cost. What we do know is that you will be able to get a Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 with up to an Intel Core i7 CPU (seventh generation), up to 16GB LPDDR3 RAM, and with a PCIe 3.0 SSD up to 1TB in size. Expect this to cost a fair bit more than the $1,099 that was announced. The ZenBook Flip S uses a specially-designed high-capacity 39Wh lithium-polymer battery that has been created to be as thin as possible, without compromising on battery life. While we haven't had a chance to fully test the battery life of the ZenBook Flip S just yet, Asus claims it has a 11.5-hour battery life, and that it uses fast-charge technology to reach 60% from empty in just 49 minutes – a weirdly specific claim. Check back for our full review of the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 when we will put Asus' battery claims to the test. Despite its ultra-thin design, the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370 doesn't skimp on ports, with two USB-C ports that support 4K external displays (as well as being able to power the device, and transfer data). A mini-dock is also included (this is to keep the size down), which expands the ports with HDMI, USB 3.1 and USB C.  The reliance on using a dock isn't the most convenient, but at least Asus is including it in the price – Apple take note. Early verdict Even with this early hands-on review of the Asus ZenBook Flip S UX370, we can tell that this is an excellent device. Its thin-and-light design really does live up to the hype, making this a hybrid laptop that you could comfortably carry around with you almost anywhere. It's also got a sturdy build quality, and it looks fantastic thanks to Asus' excellent designers. It really does feel like a premium device, and it comes with some impressive specs, and full Windows 10 support, so you can make use of Microsoft's handy new features such as Cortana, Windows Ink and Windows Hello biometric security.  The $1,099 (around £850, AU$1500) price tag is pretty decent, especially compared to its competitors, but this is where we have to add a note of caution.  We don't currently know what exact specifications a ZenBook Flip S with that price tag will come with, nor do we know how much the top-end ZenBook Flip S will cost.  Hopefully Asus will reveal that soon – as well as a release date, as we think the company could have a real hit on its hands with this.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Asus ZenBook 3 Deluxe is a more powerful, but costlier Surface Laptop alternative 0 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ May 29, 2017 at 8:40 GMT7 days ago It’s the Computex week, which means there is going to be a ton of new Windows 10-powered PCs coming out. One of the biggest Windows PC makers, Asus, today introduced a slew of new Windows 10-powered laptops. The most interesting device out of all the devices launched by Asus today, however, is the new ZenBook 3 Deluxe. That’s because the ZenBook 3 Deluxe can be considered as a direct competitor to Microsoft’s Surface Laptop. It’s a little more powerful, and it’s also a little more expensive than the Surface Laptop. First of all, the design of the ZenBook 3 Deluxe is pretty gorgeous — as long as you don’t mind the golden border and the Asus logo around the device. But more importantly, the device is only 12.9mm thin, which is thinner than the Surface Laptop. But it weighs only 1.1kg, making it lighter than the Surface Laptop as well. In terms of performance, you get the usual latest Intel’s 7th-gen Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and up to 1TB PCIe SSD. Unlike the Surface Laptop, there’s a Type-C port on the ZenBook 3 Deluxe. And to sweeten the deal a bit more, Asus has also packed in Thunderbolt 3 with support for 40GBps data transfers into the ZenBook 3 Deluxe — making it capable of powering 2 4K UHD external monitors. Asus says the ZenBook 3 will go on store shelves this summer, at a starting price of $1,199 which is $200 more expensive than the Surface Laptop.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 | MYT 3:38 PM Apple said to plan dedicated chip to power AI on devices An AI-enabled processor would help Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality. — Bloomberg Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands.  Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips.  Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence – such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment.  Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants.  An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world.  “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.”  Improved performance  Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance.  Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016.  That chip worked in Google’s datacentres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers.  The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year.  Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said.  Developer conference  Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp.  An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops.  In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. — Bloomberg  Related Stories You May Be Interested Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe Naspers to shut down Turkish e-commerce business Markafoni Australia's old media moguls unite to fight online giants 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read Motor racing - Rahal completes Detroit doubleheader sweep Support group for those with spina bifida AirAsia Free Seats promotion starts tomorrow advertisement Latest News Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

Pages Menu Home O nas Trobimo o najboljših Kontakt Categories Menu Univerze Inštituti Znanstveni dosežki Slovenian Knowledge Kreativnost Podjetništvo Start Up Spin Off Svet Galerije Fotografije Avdio Video Home » Start Up » ABC & EDG predstavljata začetek novega obdobja Posted on 29.05.17 in Start Up, Podjetništvo ABC & EDG predstavljata začetek novega obdobja V ABC Acceleratorju so  naznanili sodelovanje z EDG, vodilnim podjetjem v Silicijevi dolini na področju korporativnih inovacij. Pospeševalnik, ki je v svojem dveletnem delovanju organiziral že peti startup program, se je lotil pospeševanja še na korporativnem področju. EDG se je odločil za ABC, kar je ne samo veliko priznanje in uspeh za pospeševalnik, temveč tudi predstavlja globalni potencial za rast slovenskega gospodarstva. Predstavniki obeh podjetij so z velikim navdušenjem in medsebojno naklonjenostjo predstavili sodelovanje in njihovo vizijo prihodnosti. Miselnost, da je v središču človek, ki poseduje talent, jim je skupna in je tudi eden od razlogov, da so se odločili za sodelovanje. Živimo v času, kjer je spreminjanje miselnosti, reinventiranje produkta in storitev, povezovanje s podjetji, industrijami in startupi nujno potrebno. Podjetij, ki temu ne bodo sledila, ne čaka svetla prihodnost. »Kaj prinaša digitalizacija v resnici nihče ne ve, zato smo pripravljeni na karkoli. Izbrali smo najboljše partnerje, najboljše iz obeh svetov. Cilj je, da podjetja involviramo v startup svet in jih povežemo z največjimi podjetji na svetu,« je povedal Dejan Roljič, ustanovitelj in direktor ABC pospeševalnika. Urška Jež, soustanoviteljica in izvršna direktorica ABC pospeševalnika v Ljubljani, je podrobneje predstavila korporativni program predstavnikom podjetij, ki so vanj že vstopila, ali pa imajo to v načrtu. Gre za hitre delavnice, na katerih se na vseh nivojih spreminja miselnost in oblikuje strategijo, glede na prihajajoče trende. Ideja za združitvijo je prenesti del Silicijeve doline v Ljubljano in posledično spreminjati miselnost in ustvarjati trende. EDG s svojim butičnim pristopom svetovanja globalnim korporacijam prinaša impresiven seznam strank, kot so Apple, Audi, Airbus, Luthansa, Logitech, Panasonic, Intel, Unicredit, Johnson & Johnson in drugi. Vse svoje zkušnje in znanje bodo tako prenesli na evropski trg. S svojo 20-letno tradicijo je EDG tako rekoč največji pospeševalnik za korporacije na svetu. »Pomembno je vključiti ljudi, da inovirajo za boljšo skupno prihodnost. ABC in EDG sta vodilna vsak na svojem področju in se odlično dopolnjujeta. EDG vidi trende, startupi vidijo nove možnosti. Skupaj pa lahko vplivamo na svet,« je povedala Lisa Friedman, soustanoviteljica EDG. Lutz Junge, direktor inovacij iz Lufthanse je po udeležitvi v EDG programu je v podjetje vpeljal več sprememb med drugim tudi inkubator za inovacije. Junge je navdušen nad pospeševalnikom in pravi, da česa podobnega še ni videl. Sama lokacija v BTC-ju in ideja »mesta v mestu« ga fascinira in pravi »To je lahko vzgled in dober primer za veliko mest. Enostavno, ga moraš doživeti in ga obiskati«. V katero smer nas bodo vodile vse spremembe, ki se dogajajo, bo pokazal čas. Namen ABC in EDG je, da predstavita prihajajoče trende in smeri, v katere se bo razvijal svet. Ne glede na vse, pa so ključni še vedno ljudje, korporacije in inovacije. Foto: ABC Post a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Life is Strange is getting a sequel, but it might be getting a prequel too Cooler Master’s Case Mod World Series 2017 Winners are in By Marco Bozza Posted on May 29, 2017 2 min read 1 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Cooler Master, having successfully completed their third modding competition,  have stuck to their guns with their rebrand to “Make it Yours”. This third Case Mod World Series was the largest competition yet, with 121 completed submissions from 46 countries. There’s no reason to not show off some of the most sublime pieces of tech the creative minds of the world, but special mention must be given to Modder Crow from Thailand—he’s won for the third year in a row! “It was great to see so many amazing mods from both seasoned veterans and new comers submitted this year. Modding has inspired all of us to think about PCs differently, which will bring us a lot of ideas in developing future products.” said Raymen Wu, Marketing Director. “We couldn’t have made this happen without the support of the community and our partners: Intel, Asus, Segate, HyperX, BitsPower and Dremel.” To commemorate this achievement, Cooler Master will be showing off the “The Wheel Of Star” mod at Computex. There were four different awards this year, one “conventional” Tower category build, a Scratch build, a 25th Anniversary Category and a People’s Choice Award. Going through the many lists of mods, you get the sense that there is a strong undercurrent of modders who really want to create something as inspiring as car designers or any other hobby that requires that delicate mixture of elbow grease and a sketch pad. The “personal” in Personal Computer is also latched on, with each successful submission containing the ambitions and concepts for the cases that were eventually birthed. Art exists in many forms; in this case, a case in a canvas.

In anticipation of the event, Acer has announced two new machines, a 2-in-1 convertible and a budget gaming laptop. Acer Spin 1 The Spin 1 is a machine aimed at audiences who want something for entertainment while also being useful for productivity from time to time. It has an 11.8-inch display on the front with 1080p (1080 x 1920) resolution. The display can also be folded all the way to the back of keyboard to get to a “tent” or tablet mode. Clad in a metal frame, the Spin 1 weighs around 2.8 pounds and is 0.55 inch thick. Under the hood, you can get either a Pentium or Celeron processor, alongside 4 GB RAM and up to 128 GB of eMMC storage. For connectivity, you get 1 USB 3.1, 1 USB 2.0, HDMI, microSD and headphone jack. Wireless options include Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0. Battery life is said to last up to 8 hours. Acer Spin 1 starts from $329. Acer Nitro 5 The Nitro 5 comes in a slightly more conventional shell, and is targeted at budget gamers on the move. The display here is a 15.6-inch IPS HD panel. It is powered by processing options from both Intel and AMD, which is good news for AMD fans. The former can be paired with up to a GTX 1050 Ti processor with Core i5 or i7, while the the latter comes with a lower-end Radeon RX550 with A10, A12 or A-series FX APUs. The Nitro 5 is accompanied with up to 32 GB of 2400MHz DDR4 RAM, 512 GB SSD, and an additional HDD of up to 2 TB. The laptop comes with 1 USB-C, 1 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0, and 1 HDMI 2.0 port for connections. The design features red accent for a sharper look. Acer traditionally goes for the red in gaming laptops (as seen in the predator series). Pricing details for the Nitro 5 will be revealed at Computex, although you can expect it to fall in the $700 – $800 price range.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Apple said to plan dedicated chip to power AI 2017-05-29 08:39 - Mark Gurman, Bloomberg Post a comment 0 share: (Picture: AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Nokia, Apple bury hatchet in patent dispute Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay Rare Apple-1 auctioned for less than expected San Francisco - Apple made an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence - such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com and Alphabet in the booming field of artificial intelligence. READ: Apple's dilemma: what to do with $256bn cash pile While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. READ: Apple delivers higher profits, but iPhone sales slip An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Best Buy fitness watches for 2017 Find out which fitness watches and activity trackers can help you get the best results, and which ones you should avoid By Alison Potter 29 May 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Our latest series of test of wearables has uncovered an excellent Best Buy fitness watch that outperforms others costing more than twice the price. But it also found a malfunctioning device with a fleeting battery life and unresponsive controls, which is expensive to boot. The batch included five of the latest feature-packed fitness watches, ranging in price from £120 up to £325. It also included three fitness trackers which have traditional analogue watch faces and hidden activity tracking features, making them ideal for the style conscious who want to be able to discreetly record their steps. If you’re buying a new wearable device, you want to make sure it’s money well spent. At Which? we fully test every facet of a fitness watch or fitness tracker. We leave no stone unturned when it comes to examining just how accurately a wearable can measure your heart rate, how precisely the built-in GPS measures distance and whether the battery will barely muster a day or if it will keep going for a month. Scroll down to find out more about the latest wearables we’ve tested and whether they are worth investing in. For more help finding a perfect wearable device for your wrist, check out our fitness watch reviews and fitness tracker reviews.   New 2017 fitness watches on test TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music Unlike most fitness watches, TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music has 3GB of memory, which equates to roughly 500 songs. This means you can listen to music as you exercise without having to lug your smartphone about with you, too. It also has a slew of features for tracking running, cycling and swimming, including a wrist-based heart-rate monitor, in-built GPS and an accelerometer. To find out just how accurately it takes each reading, and how consistent it is in taking measurements, we repeated a number of different scenarios including a 5km woodland run. See if it managed to nail our tests by heading over to our TomTom Spark 3 Cardio + Music review. TomTom Runner 3 Cardio + Music Despite its name, TomTom Runner 3 Cardio + Music doesn’t just track running, but cycling, swimming and cardio sessions in the gym. Although it has a different strap to TomTom’s Spark 3 Cardio + Music and a slightly different name, it looks to be essentially the same watch and it uses the same TomTom Sports companion app. But if you want to know whether it performed identically to the Spark 3 in our tests, and if it’s a fitness watch that will push you to break your personal best, read our comprehensive TomTom Runner 3 Cardio + Music review. Garmin Forerunner 35 The Forerunner 35 is a surprisingly compact fitness watch and it weighs just 38g, which is 49g lighter than the Garmin Fenix 3 HR. It’s at the cheaper end of Garmin’s popular Forerunner range, but it still includes advanced fitness features such as a wrist-based heart-rate monitor and built-in GPS. It also has a water rating of 5ATM, which means you can wear it swimming and to a maximum depth of 50 metres. But is it a suitable fitness watch for keen swimmers and triathlon enthusiasts, and how long will the battery last before needing a charge? Read our Garmin Forerunner 35 review to find out what you need to know about this affordable fitness watch. NewBalance RunIQ The NewBalance RunIQ is a collaboration between sports-fashion brand New Balance and tech giant Intel. It boasts the latest Android Wear and Strava app compatibility, which is good news if you’re one of the millions who enjoys using Strava to track your exercise and compare your stats to other sportspeople who have taken the same route. Although it certainly looks good on paper, will the RunIQ blow fitness watches from established brands like Garmin and TomTom out of the water? Discover precisely what we loved about this wearable, and what we hated, by reading our NewBalance RunIQ review. Polar M200 Some fitness watches cost upwards of £300, but Polar’s M200 is priced at a very reasonable £120. Although it’s primarily intended for runners, you can add more than 100 activity profiles to the watch, and Polar has an exhaustive list including specific exercise classes, swimming, table tennis and golf. Similar to other fitness watches, it has a heart-rate monitor and built-in GPS, but how will it stack up against its much more expensive competitors such as Garmin’s Forerunner 735XT? Check out the test results and tech specs, and find out how our test participants got on with it in our Polar M200 review. New 2017 fitness trackers on test Garmin Vivomove Some fitness trackers can be ugly, bulky or both, but the sleek Garmin Vivomove looks like a traditional analogue watch rather than a fitness device. The activity tracker comes in three designs; the ‘sport’ which is sold with a rubber strap and plastic bezel, the ‘classic’ which comes with a leather strap, and the ‘premium’ version which has an elegant silver or gold-coloured stainless-steel bezel. But does the way it looks affect how well it records your steps? And what else can it do in terms of activity tracking? See if this tracker sailed through our meticulous tests by heading over to our Garmin Vivomove review. Misfit Phase The Misfit Phase is a combination of conventional analogue watch, fitness tracker and smartwatch. The brand itself has called it a hybrid smartwatch, because as well as tracking your steps, distance travelled, calories burnt and sleep, it also gives colour-coded alerts for calls, texts, emails and some social media platforms. But do the features of the Misfit Phase add up to a fitness tracker or a smartwatch? And is it any good as either? We assessed it in our test lab to find out and you can see how we got on in our Misfit Phase review. Withings Steel HR The unassuming Withings Steel HR looks like an analogue watch, but it has an OLED screen, a built-in heart-rate monitor, and can track steps taken, distance travelled, calories burnt and your sleep. It’s also waterproof to 50 metres so you can wear it in the pool, but that’s only advisable with the standard silicone strap as opposed to the separately bought leather strap. If that’s not enough, Withings claims that it has the longest battery life of any heart-rate tracker on the market. How will it compare to the other 40 fitness trackers we’ve tested? Head to our full Withings Steel HR review to discover whether it’s worthy of a place on your wrist.

The new Surface Pro will be available on June 15 starting at $799, but you can also opt for a demo version in Microsoft Stores. The enemy The Surface Pro is here to compete with Apple. Ryan Day from Microsoft made it clear that they designed Surface Pro for people who possess an iPad Pro. And I think the new Surface Pro is a lot closer to being a laptop replacement, unlike the 12.9inch iPad Pro. The Keyboard The Microsoft Keyboards always stand out. The new Surface Pro Type Cover Keyboard have a tiny distance between the keys which is a lot easier for all the fast typers out there, distance to fully push down a key and great tactile feedback. However, there are two issues that need improvement: The Keyboard Material The Alcantara material feels nice and looks good and is a high-end product, (you obviously need to take care of it) but over time it can become a little bit of a problem. The majority of laptops opt for all-metal surfaces because it’s more durable and difficult to stain. I’m not quite sure if the Alcantra will overdue the all-metal design option for the devices but we’ll see after a period of time. The Keyboard Is Selling Separately The Surface Pro is clearly nothing without the Type Cover Keyboard. It’s like buying a laptop without a keyboard and you need to pay an extra $160 for it, because $1,299 wasn’t much at all. Also, it comes in four different colors, giving users the possibility to choose one for their own taste. Baterry Life With a new Intel 7th Gen Core processor, the new Surface Pro boasts 50% longer battery life than the older version, meaning 13.5 hours rather than 9 on the Surface Pro 4. Display It has 12.3inch and a 2736px1824p (267ppi) resolution. The New Surface Pen It is selling separately for $99 with tilt support and 4096 levels of sensitivity pressure, perfect for those who use the device for making art.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Apple bringing artificial intelligence to chips Booming field: A man uses his phone as he walks past an Apple store in Beijing. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence (AI) software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence – such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices currently handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it is unclear if the component would be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also planned to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple planned to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to AI, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field.

Wright, George Mason University School of Law; and Edwin S. Rockefeller, Former Chairman, ABA Section of Antitrust Law, and author of The Antitrust Religion. Moderated by Douglas H. Ginsburg, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On May 11, Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney announced plans to restore an aggressive enforcement policy against corporations that engage in anti-competitive behavior. Specifically, the Justice Department was revoking legal guidelines that were adopted in September 2008 that made it more difficult to pursue antitrust cases. “The recent developments in the marketplace should make it clear that we can no longer rely upon the marketplace alone to ensure that competition and consumers will be protected,” explained the new head of the Antitrust Division. This policy reversal could be a shot across the bow of the tech industry, with Google and Intel now fearing the sort of legal action that plagued Microsoft in the 1990s. But should the government be going after profitable companies during weak economic times? What makes a merger anti-competitive or a business action monopolistic? How much does antitrust enforcement ultimately benefit the consumer?

Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: The main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field.

Bloomberg says the chip’s called the Apple Neural Engine internally, and could be used for “offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip.” By moving AI processing to a dedicated chip, battery life in devices could also see a boost since the main CPU and GPU wouldn’t be crunching as much data and gobbling as much power. The report says Apple plans to integrate the chip into its devices, but it’s unclear when that’ll happen, and if any iOS devices launching this year will have it. Apple’s work on an AI chip shouldn’t surprise anyone who’s paying attention to the competition. Virtually every tech company is working on improving AI processing on mobile devices. Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chip, which is already in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a special module dedicated to processing AI tasks. Years ago, Apple started designing its own mobile processors to improve performance and reduce power consumption, and it’s really paid off. Despite having fewer cores, the iPhone 7 still crushes the Galaxy S8 when it comes to sheer performance. iPhones and iPads also come with an Apple-designed “M”-branded motion coprocessor to collect sensor data from the various included sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc.). It’s this M chip that helps with tracking health and fitness data. Furthermore, in addition to the main Intel processors in the new MacBook Pros, there’s also a small Apple-made “T1” chip for powering the Touch Bar. Apple’s AirPods also have a custom W1 chip that helps with pairing them to iOS devices. Clearly, Apple loves making custom chips for things. We’re all for it, especially if that means longer battery life. If the future is AI everywhere (and it definitely looks like that’s where things are headed), it’s in Apple’s best interests to control the stack (like it always does) with its own AI chip. – Source: Mashable Apple Ghana News Ipads Iphones Marian Efe Ansah Tagged with: Apple Ghana News Ipads Iphones More on citifmonline.com US now conducts social media background checks before issuing visa June 4, 2017 Tech leaders defy Trump on climate deal June 4, 2017 YouTube clarifies ‘hate speech’ rules June 3, 2017 Google to let publishers charge users for ad-blockers June 3, 2017 Tech leaders defy Trump on climate deal June 2, 2017 Ghana to launch first satellite into space June 2, 2017 General News Faure Gnassingbè is new ECOWAS chair June 4, 2017 Ghanaian church celebrates Chelsea’s Premier League success [Photos] June 4, 2017 Rawlings calls for complete overhaul of NDC June 4, 2017 Galamsey fight: River Pra showing signs of improvement June 4, 2017 Capt.

The club unveiled its 2017/18 home shirt today... Business & Tech FCBarcelona.com 18:00 29 May 2017 Joseph Conroy 6 days ago The new FC Barcelona kit has been released today and it marks a 'changing of the guard' as the club's sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways has come to an end and there's a new logo across its shirt - Rakuten. You might not have come across it before - it's an online retailer which is Japan's answer to Amazon and Alibaba. It's one of the world's biggest e-commerce sites by sales. Last year, it agreed to pay the Catalan side €55m per year for four years to have its name on its blue and maroon jerseys. The deal also includes €1.5m bonus payments each time they win La Liga and a €5m bonus for bringing the Champion's League trophy back to the Camp Nou. It also has the option of extending the deal for a fifth season. According to the club, the road to the commercial sponsorship began when Barcelona defender Gerard Pique and his wife Shakira met Rakuten's owner, Hiroshi Mikitani, in 2015 during Barcelona's US pre-season tour. I'm with my friend Mickey visiting the Rakuten's office. Great time in Tokyo with him and his family! pic.twitter.com/cF8pFiBl1l — Gerard Piqué (@3gerardpique) June 27, 2015 "Gerard Piqué and Shakira are very close friends with Mr Mikitani ... It was in the summer of 2015, Gerard organised a dinner in San Francisco during our summer tour. At that dinner we met Mr Mikitani, who was, for us, an incredible person," Josep Maria Bartomeu, Barcelona's president, commented.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman „eRamp” strengthens Germany and Europe in power electronics Munich and Dresden, Germany – 29 May 2017 – One of the most important European research projects for energy efficiency, “eRamp”, is coming to a close. Over the past three years, 26 partners from business and science have explored innovative electronics components for using energy even more efficiently. Their focus was on the rapid introduction of new production technologies, such as packaging technologies for energy-saving chips. The eRamp project covered the entire power electronics value chain, from generation and transmission all the way to consumption. Infineon, the world market leader in power semiconductors, led the research, which was conducted in six European countries. The project strengthens Germany and Europe as centers of expertise for power electronics. “The eRamp results have created the prerequisites for keeping the production of power electronics in Europe competitive,” said Dr. Oliver Pyper, Senior Manager of Research, Development and Innovation Programs at Infineon Technologies Dresden and the eRamp project coordinator. “Power electronics guarantee an ever more efficient generation, transmission, and use of electric energy. And it is in this area that eRamp has significantly expanded our expertise in Europe.” The research results were tested for practical viability directly in the semiconductor production environment. The research partners used existing pilot lines and comprehensive production expertise at five sites: Dresden, Germany and Villach, Austria (power semiconductors based on 300mm wafers; Infineon) Regensburg, Germany (chip packaging technologies for power semiconductors; Infineon) Reutlingen, Germany (power semiconductors, smart power and sensors based on 200mm wafers; Bosch) Unterpremstaetten near Graz, Austria (3D/TSV pilot line; ams) In addition, Infineon, Osram, and Siemens worked together to construct testing equipment and demonstrators for the evaluation of a new chip embedding technology. The eRamp project will conclude on 31 May 2017. Europe’s key projects for strengthening the electronics industry The “eRamp – Excellence in Speed and Reliability for More than More Technologies“ project was financially supported by the European funding initiative ENIAC Joint Undertaking, as well as by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the largest national sponsor. Financial support also came from Austria, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, and the UK. eRamp is part of European research series dedicated to the development of power electronics based on 300mm wafers. Other projects in this series include EPT300, EPPL and PowerBase. In the four projects, a total of roughly 100 project partners is working to strengthen Europe economically and ecologically through the use of power electronics. In 2016, other initiatives were launched to strengthen European microelectronics, among which the IoSense project. It is a sensor technology initiative that is part of the ECSEL Joint Undertaking. As with the eRamp project, it is led by Infineon Dresden. Background: More energy efficiency through power electronics Power electronics comprises electronic components and the chips built into them, so-called power semiconductors. Power semiconductors help keep the loss of electrical energy as low as possible. They make sure that the greatest possible amount of energy generated by wind or sun is fed into the power grid and transmitted almost completely without loss over many thousands of kilometers from the generation site to the consumer. They then help minimize power consumption in a wide variety of applications, e.g. in household appliances, illumination technologies, servers and computers, in hybrid and electric drive systems for cars, commercial vehicles, construction and agricultural machines as well as in industrial energy technologies and production facilities. eRamp: 26 partners from 6 countries AMS AG (Unterpremstaetten), CISC Semiconductor GmbH (Klagenfurt, Austria), HSEB Dresden GmbH (Dresden), Infineon Technologies (Dresden, Regensburg, Munich, Villach, and Bucharest, Romania), JOANNEUM RESEARCH Forschungsgesellschaft GmbH (Graz), Intel (Villach), Materials Center Leoben Forschung GmbH (Leoben, Austria), NXP Semiconductors (Gratkorn, Austria and Eindhoven, Netherlands), Osram GmbH (Munich), Polymer Competence Center Leoben GmbH (Leoben), Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart, Germany), SGS INSTITUT FRESENIUS (Taunusstein, Germany), Siemens AG (Berlin, Munich), SPTS Technologies Ltd (Newport, UK), Stichting IMEC Nederland (Eindhoven), SYSTEMA Systementwicklung Dipl.-Inf. Manfred Austen GmbH (Dresden), Slovak University of Technology (Bratislava, Slovakia), Technical University Dresden, Technical University Vienna (Austria), University of Innsbruck (Austria), and the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences, Zwickau (Germany).

The G4 Powerbook leads the list. It is a 17-inch MacBook Pro that came out in 2009.  The list of vintage and obsolete products were first reported by 9 to 5 Mac. The lineup involves a mix of Mac notebooks, Mac desktops and peripherals. The devices will be made obsolete in most areas of the world except California and Turkey. The iPhone 3GS will no longer be supported, though it should not come as a surprise since only a handful still use that model.  For MacBook users, the changes through the years have obviously displaced the old Apple notebook. The latest ones out in the market come armed with powerful specs, so one can imagine how the early G4 Powerbooks would perform with the latest advancements in technology.  For those unfamiliar with the G4 Powerbook, the MacBook sported a 17-inch display and a 1 GHz G4 processor with a 167 MHz bus. Backing these up were 512 MB RAM and 60 GB of hard disk space. It originally shipped with OS X 10.2.4 and was originally priced at US$3,299 (AU$4,435). There were plenty of 17-inch MacBook variants that came out, each carrying processor, RAM or hard drive upgrades. The last batch shipped in 2011, and the Cupertino company has since ramped up the specs to appease the power-hungry Mac users.  There is no official number to show how many are still using the old Apple laptops, though support was meant to end soon. Apple does obsolete legacy devices, normally done when new devices or products are expected to take their place. Hence, the buzz on an upgraded MacBook Pro 2017 is expected to get louder.  As mentioned in a previous post, an upgraded MacBook Pro is expected at the WWDC 2017. The key change to expect is an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, the processor most had wanted to see on the MacBook Pro 2016.  The suggested release of the MacBook Pro 2017 has received mixed reactions, with some questioning if the change of release schedule would affect the Apple cycle moving forward. The same holds true for early-bird MacBook Pro 2016 buyers, most of them frowning at the specs.

By Sarmistha Acharya May 28, 2017 13:03 BST Apple working on a dedicated AI processorGetty Images/Don Emmert Apple is working on a processor dedicated to AI-related tasks, suggests a new report. Dubbed Apple Neural Engine, the chip would improve the way the devices handle tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. A source familiar with Apple's plan told Bloomberg that the AI-enabled processor would help Apple bundle more advanced features into devices like self-driving cars and augmented reality devices. While Apple devices currently handle artificial intelligence processes through the main processor and graphics chip, the new chip would allow Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated chip designed for artificial intelligence processing, improving the battery performance of the device. Apple's AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple products. The company even plans to use the chip on the iPhone and iPad, the source told Bloomberg. Apple has even tested iPhone prototypes with the chip. Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos app, parts of speech recognition and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the source added. The company is planning to offer developer access to the chip so that third-party apps can also lessen the tasks related to artificial intelligence. Apple may discuss some developments in AI at its annual developer's conference in June, the same event where the company is expected to introduce iOS 11 and updated Mac laptops with faster chips from Intel. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence" said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst.
