By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | December 18, 2016 -- 22:00 GMT (14:00 PST) | Topic: Hardware Make no mistake about it: The 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition laptop is wonderful. It's fast. Its display is gorgeous. And, at less than three pounds, you can carry and code with it anywhere. But, oh, that price tag! The Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition is a Linux programmer's dream machine. sjvn First, here's the good stuff. This is a really sweet design. The display bezel is only a quarter of an inch thick. This is as close to a real "edge-to-edge" display than I've ever seen. The 13.3-inch display itself is also sweet. It's a 3,200×1,800 touchscreen. For those playing along at home, that's 280 pixels per inch -- 40 more than my prized 2015 Chromebook Pixel and 60 more than a MacBook Pro with Retina. The display is powered by Intel's Iris 540 GPU. It looks, in a word, great. At 13.3 inches, the screen is a bit small for my taste, but I'm not complaining. There's one oddity here. To maximize the screen real-estate while leaving as little bezel as possible, the 720p webcam ended up in the bottom-left corner of the display. It matters less in practice than I thought it would, but it's still a little odd. The system itself is powered by a dual-core, 2.2GHz 6th-generation Intel Core i7-6560U Skylake processor. This is one fast system. It's meant for developers -- and they need all the speed they can get. It boasts 16GBs of DDR3 RAM and a half a terabyte PCIe solid state drive (SSD). This also helps make it a fast system. How fast? Using the installed Ubuntu Linux 14.04.3 with its developer tools, I was able to compile its Linux 3.19 kernel in about three minutes. If I'd optimized my tools, I think I could have dropped that to less than two minutes. Of course, you can compile Linux faster. To really compile in a hurry, try an Intel Xeon E5 chip. But on a laptop? I don't think you're going to do much better. The XPS 13 offers just two USB 3.0 ports: A Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.1 Type-C port, and a DisplayPort 1.2 video output port. It also comes with an SD card reader and an audio jack. I'm not sure what the Thunderbolt port is doing there. (Does anyone use Thunderbolt now?) But the USB 3.1 side of the chipset will get used. There are no HDMI or Ethernet ports. On the other hand, with the built-in Intel 8260 Wi-Fi chipset, maybe you don't need the Ethernet port anyway. The built-in Wi-Fi supports both 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. cnet Best Budget Laptops Of 2016 The era of the Netbook may be long gone but you can still find their successors. Read More The Wi-Fi is much better in this model than it was in earlier versions of the Dell XPS 13. These models, with their Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets, often proved troublesome. The keyboard is a pleasure to use. I'm not crazy about the touchpad, but then I've never met one I really liked. Give me a ThinkPad TrackPoint any day. Dell claims the XPS 13, with its 56wHR, 4-cell battery, has about a 12-hour battery life. Guess what? It does. I was impressed, too. The hardware is only part of the story here. Besides using Ubuntu 14.04 as its default operating system, this system is designed for developers. If you just need a system to roam the web or to do day-in and day-out office work, look elsewhere. This is a laptop by programmers for programmers. Dell will be offering the XPS 13 with the latest long-term support version of Ubuntu 16.04 later this year. In the meantime, you can also update the existing model to Ubuntu 16.04 or any other desktop Linux distribution that strikes your fancy, such as Mint 18. The price reflects this high-end goal. An ordinary XPS 13 with a Core i3 processor and Windows 10 Home starts at $799. The entry-level XPS 13 Developer Edition, with 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD, and an Intel HD Graphics 520 chipset costs $1,099. The next model up features Intel Iris Graphics 540 and costs $1,649.99. Finally, the top-of-the-line model, which is what I reviewed, comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and it will cost you $2,079. If you're a serious programmer, it's worth the money.

Every laptop that I've reviewed has taken this test, and the Spectre x360 will be no exception. I can tell you though that it will be fine, as I've been using this device as my daily driver for about a month and a half, as I've felt no need to use anything else for anything other than testing purposes. Needless to say, this is going to be a glowing review of HP's new flagship laptop, because to be honest, it's just a fantastic, well-built laptop. It's not perfect, as no device is, but this is a PC that I think I can recommend to just about anyone. The model that HP sent to me uses a dual-core Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, and 512GB of storage, so this device is pretty decked out. You can grab it for $1299 from Best Buy or HP.com, although HP.com also offers a 1TB model for $1499, as well as cheaper variants with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Specs Processor and graphics Intel® Core™ i5-7200U (2.5GHz, up to 3.1GHz, 3MB cache, 2 cores) + Intel® HD Graphics 620 Intel® Core™ i7-7500U (2.7GHz, up to 3.5GHz, 4MB cache, 2 cores) + Intel® HD Graphics 620 Display 13.3" diagonal FHD UWVA BrightView WLED-backlit touch screen (1920 x 1080) Memory 8GB, 16GB Storage 256GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD 1TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD Battery 3-cell, 57.8Wh Lithium-ion polymer battery Audio Bang & Olufsen; Quad speakers; HP Audio Boost Networking Intel® 802.11ac (2x2) Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® 4.2 Combo Ports 2 x USB 3.1 Type-C™ Gen 2 (HP Sleep and Charge, Thunderbolt Gen 3); 1 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Type-A); 1 headphone/microphone combo Body 12.03 x 8.58 x 0.54-inches, 2.85-pounds Day one Coming out of the box, it was clear that HP had built a premium laptop. It even comes with a sleeve to carry it in, which comes in handy, even if you're just going to throw it in a bag. Check out the unboxing and first impressions: Design The HP Spectre x360 is one beautiful PC. It features an all-metal design with a nearly edge-to-edge display. The bezels to the sides of the screen are just 5.45mm, compared to 15.12mm on last year's model. There are a number of other improvements over the 2015 model as well. It's 2.1mm thinner, coming in at 13.8mm. The size of the body is smaller as well, with 9.67mm shaved off of each side. Of course, this is allowed by the smaller bezel. Finally, it's 0.35-pounds lighter. The 2016 Spectre x360 has three USB ports, one of which is a standard USB Type-A, and the other two are Thunderbolt 3 capable, USB Type-C ports. Either of the Type-C ports can be used to charge the device and, since they also support Thunderbolt 3, they can be used to power up to two 4K monitors or one 5K monitor per-port. Of course, this laptop uses Intel HD Graphics, so I wouldn't exactly recommend a setup of four 4K or two 5K monitors. But the combination of ports is a winning one, which should keep you away from a dongle-filled life, something that you would get with Apple's new MacBook Pro. The Type-A port is there for all of your legacy peripherals, but then you also get the power and fast data transfer speeds that come with Thunderbolt 3. On the right side, you'll find a volume rocker and on the left, the power button. These are placed on the sides of the device to make it easier to use in tablet mode, which you'd get if you bend the screen all the way back (hence the x360 name). The volume rocker feels well-placed, but the power button does not. It's completely flush with the rest of the body, so it's not easy to find by simply feeling it out. I tend to spend some extra time looking for it when booting up. To be fair, it's not really a big deal. The webcam and Windows Hello camera are both placed above the screen, which I found to be good and bad at the same time. While the monitor is in an upright position, the webcam is in the perfect place; however, when it's in "tent mode", it's now on the bottom, making it hard to talk on video calls or even log in via Windows Hello. x360 OK, so I've referred to tent and tablet modes by this point, so I should probably explain what that all means. HP has a number of products that include the term 'x360', and that means that the display can be folded at 360-degrees. Because of this, you'll generally get four different ways to use the device. At a 90-ish-degree angle, that's your standard laptop mode, and it's probably how you're going to spend the majority of your time. Next, at about 270-degrees, you can place the laptop with the keyboard facing down and the screen facing toward you. The use case of this is about the same as tent mode, which is anywhere between 270- and 360-degrees, where you would stand the PC upright in a 'tent' position. These two modes are great for viewing something on the display. For example, it works well if you're watching a movie on Netflix or something along those lines. Finally, at 360-degrees, you have tablet mode. Personally, I tried to use this for playing games such as Halo: Spartan Assault and Asphalt 8, and to be honest, it's not very comfortable for such uses. The device is a bit heavy and thick for that. If you want a tablet for playing games, get an iPad or a Huawei MateBook. One of very few downsides to the Spectre x360 is that there is no pen support in this model. One of the major use cases for a tablet mode would typically be drawing, which you can still do, but you'd need to use a passive stylus. Windows Hello I have a confession to make; until HP sent me the Spectre x360, I'd never used a PC with facial recognition. I've used iris scanners on Windows phones, such as the Lumia 950 and 950 XL, fingerprint scanners on phones, such as the Alcatel IDOL 4S, and even a phone with an iris scanner and a fingerprint reader, the HP Elite x3. I've even used a fingerprint reader on a Windows PC, the Huawei MateBook. But between all of those devices, I had never used the third form of Windows Hello, which is facial recognition, and it's amazing. All you have to do is be in front of your PC when you're booting it up. I've always felt that a fingerprint reader makes more sense on a phone and facial recognition works better on a PC. After all, your face is in front of the PC when it starts up, and you use a finger to wake your phone. It's fast and it feels natural to log into the Spectre x360 with my face. There was never a single time that it didn't recognize me. In fact, when there were times that I'd be using another PC and I'd boot up the Spectre, I'd just turn around and stick my head in front of it when the lock screen came up, because it was that easy. Windows Hello was easily one of my favorite features of this laptop, and I don't know if I'll ever buy a PC without it ever again. The display As I mentioned earlier, the bezels on this device are incredibly thin, which gives the display a beautiful look. As you've undoubtedly seen from the pictures though, the top and bottom bezels are much larger, which is to make room for the webcam and Windows Hello camera on top. On the bottom, that seems to only make room for the HP logo. The display itself is stunning, and it's about as good as it can be for what it is. OK, let me explain that. The Spectre x360 uses a 13.3-inch 1920 x 1080 IPS LCD. The colors are vibrant; in fact, HP says it has a 72% color gamut. It's a beautiful display, but it's still 1080p, and you will be able to see pixels. It looks far better than other displays of similar sizes and resolution that I've used, but it's not what Apple would call Retina. To compare, the pixel density on the device is 166ppi, but on Microsoft's Surface Book - which uses a 13.5-inch display with a 3000 x 2000 resolution - the pixel density is 267ppi. Personally, I just wish that HP offered an option with a higher resolution because the Spectre x360 is just so close to being the perfect hybrid device. One other thing that I'd prefer on the display - and this is completely a personal preference - is a different aspect ratio. Surface uses 3:2, and even MacBooks use 8:5; 16:9 feels too widescreen on a laptop these days. The keyboard and trackpad I type for a living, so needless to say, I'm picky about the keyboards that I use. This one, however, grew on me quickly. I had no problem at all adopting the Spectre x360 as my daily driver, and I wouldn't mind continuing to use it. HP calls it an edge-to-edge keyboard, and it's about as wide as the display. The keys travel 1.3mm, which is just a bit more shallow than a standard 1.5mm, but you won't notice the difference. This keyboard is super comfortable to type on, and as I noted earlier, I'm using it to type this review. The glass trackpad is also awesome. I'm more of a mouse guy, but when I began using the Spectre x360, I immediately found it to be smooth and comfortable to use. Audio The Spectre x360 uses Bang & Olufsen speakers, which you'll find in a lot of HP's products these days. Naturally, they sound great. They're no substitute for standalone speakers, but you'll certainly find that they're much louder and the sound quality is much better than your average laptop. This device has four speakers, two above the keyboard and two on the bottom of the PC. This was a bit of an ingenious design on HP's part, as it allows for great audio quality no matter how you're using the device. For example, if you have it in tent mode, the speakers on the keyboard are now facing away from you, while the one underneath is now facing toward you. If you're really an audiophile, you're still going to want to use your favorite speakers, but for most people, you'll probably be happy with the B&O ones that ship with the Spectre x360. Some notes about software One thing that really bothers me about this laptop is that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (AU) isn't yet available for it. It shouldn't bother me, since there are any number of ways to get it, such as force-upgrading it, enrolling in the Release Preview ring of the Insider Program, or doing a clean install with the Media Creation Tool, but it just feels weird that it's been almost five months since the AU shipped and HP still hasn't rolled it out for its new flagship laptop. Indeed, this Spectre x360 is still running Windows 10 version 1511. For the purposes of reviewing the laptop, I chose to stick with the out of box experience. And by the way, that should say something about the software experience on this device, because on most laptops, I would do a clean install after getting a feel for the stock experience. As far as pre-installed software goes, it's very minimal on the Spectre x360. The only third-party app that comes with it is McAfee LiveSafe, which I found easy to uninstall. And to be clear, I do recommend uninstalling it, as it's an annoying app and there are better ways to protect your PC. Then there are the standard HP apps, such as HP Support Assistant, which is where you'll be able to update the drivers on the device. HP Recovery Manager and HP Recovery Media Creation are pretty self-explanatory. Performance and battery life I've been very pleased with the performance of the Spectre x360. As I've stated a few times, I've used it as my daily driver, meaning that I've written many articles on it, done my normal light Photoshop work, and compiled apps for the Windows Store. I find that in day-to-day use, the performance far exceeds my Surface Pro 3 (Core i7, 8GB RAM), which is my regular laptop daily driver. But battery life really blew me away. First of all, HP promises 15 hours, which I didn't expect to get, and neither should you. The battery life estimates that most OEMs report are measured under optimal conditions. However, I had no trouble getting a full day's work out of it, which is to say between 8-10 hours. This exceeds any machine that I've used that uses Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processors. If you ask me, it really speaks to the quality of the seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips that are going out now, and powers this machine. I used PCMark to benchmark the device. I performed three tests: baseline, creative, and work. Naturally, the baseline test is a sort of overall test, while creative checks things like video editing and such, and work is for productivity, such as documents and spreadsheets. Baseline Creative Work Conclusion If you've been following along, then you probably know how this conclusion is going to go. The HP Spectre x360 is definitely among the best laptops on the market right now. It's pretty inexpensive as well, starting at $1,149 but offering 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, and a Core i7 for just $1,299. Of course, there are more powerful alternatives, such as larger quad-core machines or laptops with a dedicated GPU. There are also PCs with pen support and displays with higher resolution. But this device is simply a great all-around PC. I'd love it if HP decided to introduce new models that offered the things I just mentioned, but unless you need them specifically, you're good to go with the Spectre x360. This is a device that I can recommend to almost anyone.   Gallery: HP Spectre x360 Tags Hp Spectre x360 Microsoft Windows 10 Review Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Previous Story Lenovo Phab 2 Pro review: The first Google Tango phone is a one-trick pony Next Story Lineage OS to continue the work of the CyanogenMod community Related Stories 7 Days: A week of Microsoft updates, more Yahoo hoohah, and Apple Watch wah-wah-waaahhh Dec 17, 2016 Lenovo Yoga Book (Windows) review: Windows Ink shines, but it won't be your next laptop Dec 10, 2016 · Hot!

Voor video is H.264 zo goed als de standaard met het nieuwere H.265 die langzaam maar zeker steeds iets beter geïmplementeerd wordt door de x265 encoder. Qua audio is Dolby wel de standaard en beste qua compatibiliteit. Voor thuisgebruik is AAC ook prima te gebruiken. Qua settings voor de x264 encoder moet ik je wel gelijk geven, dat kan een enorme jungle zijn. Reageer +1 gjmi @JackDashwood • 25 december 2016 14:01 Dat jij niet alles gebruikt is één ding. Handbrake ondersteund veel meer dan wat je opnoemt. H.264 is behoorlijk standaard maar niet overal op af te spelen. Dolby is ook niet overal af te spelen. Het is dus maar net wat je nodig hebt. Ik zie zo gauw 7 standaard encoding video formaten die ondersteund worden. En nog meer containers en formaten worden volgens mij ondersteund voor het decoden. En dan praten we nog niet eens over de audio formaten die ieder zelf nog weer allerlei opties hebben. En de ondertitel formaten? En dat is alleen nog wat Handbrake ondersteund. Als je het over het hele audio/video landschap hebt, dan heb je nog factoren(!) meer. Dus ja, het is wel een beetje een jungle.

Maar lees ik nou goed dat je minimaal een SkyLake CPU nodig hebt om x265 te encoden? Dus met mijn SandyBridge Core i7 lukt dat niet? Reageer +1 TimMer @Interstellar • 25 december 2016 22:49 Dat zal op hardware encoding slaan. Reageer 0 kamisama @Interstellar • 26 december 2016 21:30 Lukt perfect met je CPU, alleen zonder quicksync dan. Quicksync is de term die intel gebruikt om hardware acceleratie door de gpu aan te geven. Die functie is met skylake geïntroduceerd. Dus heb je voor quicksync te gebruiken een skylake of nieuwer nodig. Maar is die functie niet aanwezig, doet handbrake het wel gewoon zonder quicksync hoor.

Nu hoef ik niet meer met ffmpeg ernaast aan de slag. Het is namelijk de ideale codec voor films en series: hoge kwaliteit, lage bitrate, hybride stem- en muziek-modus, voorzien van surround-optimalisaties en volledig open en gratis. Voor archiveren zijn de nieuwe lossless codecs met hoge sampling rate erg fijn maar voor de overige gebruiken zorgt dit voor een flinke toename in de bestandsgrootte en eigenlijk heb je er bij het meeste materiaal vrijwel niets aan.

Reageer +1 alexvanniel @fbax • 25 december 2016 12:36 Het is niet zo dat in die 13 jaar er geen updates zijn geweest. Wat hier bedoeld wordt is dat er na 13 jaar eindelijk een 1.0.0 versie is. In de tussen tijd is er een hele schare aan 0.x.x releases geweest waarbij er steeds nieuwe codecs, features en fixes zijn toegvoegd. Reageer +1 Krokant @fbax • 25 december 2016 12:37 Ik weet niet of dat met agile te maken heeft, maar eerder met proberen relevant te blijven.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology How Apple alienated Mac loyalists Mac Pro Noah Berger / Bloomberg Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2013.  Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2013.  (Noah Berger / Bloomberg) Mark GurmanBloomberg To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.

Apple unveiled long-awaited updates to its Mac computers Thursday, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The breakout feature is, as widely speculated, a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple's top-of-the-line... (Tribune news services) While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history.

(Nate Lanxon, Ian King and Joel Rosenblatt) To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product.

You'd think it might have earned the name by applying maximum force while investigating alleged... (Gaspard Sebag, Dara Doyle and Alex Webb) In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Apple Inc. Apple iPhone Microsoft Corporation Microsoft Surface Intel Corp.

Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. apple Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Bloomberg Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

At one point in time, Oculus had support for OS X in the pipeline; in fact previous Rift dev kits supported Macs. As time went on, however, it was decided that the Oculus Rift would be Windows-only, at least initially. It’s with Luckey’s comments, and the lack of initial OS X support in mind, that I’ve decided to put together a Hackintosh machine that meets the minimum requirements outlined by Oculus, yet can still run OS X. In theory, this machine could support the Oculus Rift if the necessary software was made available for OS X. It can run the Rift now if you install a Windows partition on it… Minimum hardware requirements for Oculus Rift Here are the minimum requirements as outlined by Oculus: Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD 290 equivalent or greater 8GB of RAM HDMI 1.3 (or higher) video output Two USB 3.0 ports Hackintosh build hardware As you can see, the hardware that I’ve selected below meets the requirements outlined above. My goal was to build a Hackintosh for under $1,000 that met the requirements for Oculus. You can feel free to substitute other hardware in to save money. For instance, if you already have a USB 3.0 drive with at least 8GB of capacity, you can use that instead of purchasing a new USB drive. Keep in mind, however, that some items on this list were specifically selected because they meet the minimum requirements outlined for the Oculus Rift. In other words, you don’t want to stray too far, because compatibility issues can arise. Video overview Read Part II In the future, I plan on improving this build with additional RAM, better SSD, etc. Of course, I could always go with a faster graphics card as well, likely something from AMD since those cards provide noticeable performance increases for apps like Final Cut Pro X. It can be tedious, but the beauty of building your own PC is that it’s totally customizable and can be upgraded over time. Intel Core i5-4590 (6M Cache, 3.3 GHz) – $198.99 I opted for an Intel Core i5 processor, because it was relatively inexpensive and still packed a nice punch. Although quite a few in the Hackintosh community have adopted Skylake CPUs to work in their builds, I wanted something that has been tested through and through. More importantly, the Core i5-4590 meets Oculus’ recommended specs. Gigabyte H97 Extreme Multi Graphics Support UEFI DualBIOS Micro ATX DDR3 1600 LGA 1150 Motherboard – $82.99 The folks over at Tonymacx86 recommend this board, which is good enough for me. I decided to go with mATX for expandability, but I almost wish I would have stuck with my first inclination of going Mini-ITX, since it results in a smaller footprint. That said, it’s nice to know that the video card I selected would fit with no issues, and I have lots of room for additional RAM. Crucial Ballistix Tactical 8GB DDR3 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800) – $47.87 Ballistix Tactical RAM is proven to work well in Hackintosh builds. I opted for 8GB, which is Oculus’ minimum requirement. EVGA GeForce GTX 970 4GB SC GAMING, Silent Cooling Graphics Card – $337.99 The GTX 970 meets Oculus’ minimum spec for video cards. It’s also a card that works well in Hackintosh builds. I do plan on at least trying an AMD card since those cards work so much better for Final Cut Pro X. Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD –  $86.99 I didn’t need a huge amount of space for a boot drive, so I opted for the 250GB Samsung 850. It’s a proven drive that plays nice with Hackintosh rigs. If you want to spend a more for a larger drive, there are 500GB and 1TB options available as well. TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 Dual Band Wireless N900 PCI Express Adapter,2.4GHz450Mbps/5Ghz 450Mbps – $36.95 Although the TP-LINK works well, it features an Atheros chipset which doesn’t work with OS X’s Continuity features. That’s not a huge deal in my eyes, but there are other options that I plan on considering sometime down the road. IO Gear Bluetooth 4.0 USB Micro Adapter – $11.29 This little guy is cheap, and works out of the box with my Hackintosh build. It lets me connect my Magic Mouse to my Hackintosh with ease. Sentey Xplus Power Supply 725 Watt – $44.99 I went with this power supply because it was cheap and outputs plenty of power for my rig. I cheaped out on this, but I wish I would have gone with a modular power supply that was a bit quieter. This supply works well, but there are cleaner and quieter options available that I plan on investigating in the future. Thermaltake CORE V21 Black Extreme Micro ATX Cube Chassis –  $59.90 There is a ton of room inside of this case and plenty of room for multiple 2.5″ and 3.5″ drives. That being said, this case is a little larger than I expected. Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo CPU Cooler – $29.40 I wanted a CPU cooler that would keep my processor nice and cool, and I didn’t want to opt for the stock cooler that Intel included with the Core i5. The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo has great ratings, and does a good job of keeping the CPU nice and chill. PNY Turbo 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive – $9.99 The flash drive is used to house the software tools that you’ll need to get your Hackintosh going. I like these, because they include LED activity lights. Of course, if you already have USB flash drives with at least 8GB of storage, you can skip out on this. Case Speaker for POST – $5.49 The Thermaltake case lacks an on board case speaker, which is a necessity in my opinion. Having a speaker lets you hear beeps for POST, which helps you to troubleshoot the boot process. Since Hackintoshes usually require some granular tinkering, you should definitely add a case speaker to your repertoire if your case lacks one. AmazonBasics Wired Keyboard – $14.64 Unless your Bluetooth keyboard setup has access at the BIOS/UEFI level, chances are you’ll need a hard-wired keyboard. Amazon makes a cheap keyboard, but if you have a USB keyboard somewhere around the house, then just use that one instead. Approximate total hardware cost (as of this post): $968. I’ve created a full wish list that allows you to see all of the products outlined above on a single page. Keep in mind that hardware costs do fluctuate, so it’s entirely possible that the price may be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. Generally speaking, the price should lessen as time goes on. Software OS X El Capitan – Free for Mac users. Note: you will need access to a Mac to create the UniBeast boot disk. UniBeast – Free (Registration required) MultiBeast – Free (Registration required) More to come My main motivation behind this build was to create a workable Mac that featured internal components capable of driving an Oculus Rift. While it’s true that Oculus isn’t planning on supporting the Mac at this time, the point is that there are “Macs” that feature the hardware required to drive the Rift, they just aren’t Macs in the traditional sense. We’re publishing this now, ahead of the build post, so that you can buy the parts needed for building your own and have them ship in time for the next video. In the next post in this series, I’ll walk you through the software install of this Hackintosh build, including any issues or errors that I encountered during the process. As it stands now, I’m fairly happy with this build. It takes patience, but building your very own Hackintosh is a doable feat. Keep in mind that you can also dual boot Windows, which makes for a more than capable gaming rig that can outright drive the Oculus Rift with no issues. Stay tuned for more posts in this series, including a software how to, and additional exploration into the exciting world of Hackintosh.

First, apple machines may not have the most powerful components you can find, but they tend to use newer components than what is on the market. Sure you might find more powerful broadwell chips out there, but using skylake is just going to bump up the price. Second, compare apple’s prices to what sony used to offer and you’ll find that apple was on par if not cheaper. No wonder why vaio went out of business. Third, look at the resale value. No custom build or pre-built rig gets the same return 5+ years later when compared to an apple product. With apple you don’t have to compromise, you just get what you pay for.

You either have to disable critical security updates or your computer can wreck itself. Even if you do everything right, the time you will spend figuring out and working around issue makes it not worth it. However I do like the implied purpose of this news story: Apple had better release a real desktop computer, not a laptop wrapped in a screen, or it is going to lose market share fast. VR is not some passing fad. It is going to be huge and you can’t do it on a Mac. LikeLiked by 1 person Rich Davis (@RichDavis9) - 10 months ago Reply I’m sure Apple will release new products that will have the proper GPU to run this, it’s just a matter of time. As far as VR? Right now, it’s a small market. I don’t really see it as taking over the world type of product. Look at the failure of GoogleGlass. It failed. Even Sony’s version hasn’t done anything. It’s just not needed by everyone. It’s a novelty gaming device, it reminds me of 3D TV, it was exciting in the beginning, but the reality is that people simply don’t really use 3D glasses when watching TV. I see it as a POTENTIAL device for engineering people, but for anything else? it’s more of a novelty type product. As far as Apple’s concerned, having the GPU is just a matter of time. Right now, Apple is just caught in that time period where they don’t have a computer with the GPU that Oculus requires, but that doesn’t mean they won’t. I’m sure the upcoming MacPro upgrade, when that hits the market, it will will. I also see future laptops and iMacs having powerful enough GPU’s to run things like this, but it’s just a matter of time on when they’ll release those products. It’s not like people are lining up to buy these things. So, there is time, it’s not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination. Well all see what new Macs are released in the upcoming months. Apple is in the middle of clearing out inventories of current Macs which happens right before a new product refresh. And if it makes you feel any better, I believe Apple is in R&D of their own similar product. When and if they make that announcement is anyone’s guess, but based on recent Tim Cook remarks, they might have something next year. Remember, all of this stuff is very much in it’s infancy. Even Microsoft is only taking orders for $3,000 Development versions of Halolens, and there really aren’t that many games to actually run, so it’s got many years until this market matures. I personally don’t have a NEED for these things. I also don’t know anyone that’s really that interested in them either. Gamers? They will buy anything they can brag about to their friends as that goes with the territory. What cracks me up is they are only using an i5 processor, how special is that? It’s just the GPU, which is forth coming. That’s the ONLY thing that Apple doesn’t have currently. By the end of the year, probably most, if not all, of their products will have been refreshed and we’ll see which ones have the GPU’s to run this specific device, which is only one brand. To say that Apple doesn’t have a REAL computer is just nonsense. They have REAL computers, they just don’t have one with the GPU requirements of this specific device. They have computers with much better CPU’s than this thing needs, so that’s not the issue. It’s just the GPU and nothing else. LikeLiked by 2 people Rich Davis (@RichDavis9) - 10 months ago Reply I have a question. What is the percentage of all of the current PC’s that are in use that have the GPU’s to run this thing? I would say that of ALL of the current PC’s that are owned and in use, that only less than 1% have the requirements to run this thing. That’s not saying much about the PC market either. Most PC’s don’t come with a proper GPU to run this device either, and there are a ton of PC’s that can’t run it. How many laptops are there that have the GPU requirements to run this device? Do you have a list of them? if there are, there’s not a lot of different models and they are most likely very expensive laptops that most people aren’t buying. Has anyone tried to use a PCI card GPU card with a Thunderbolt 2 PCI chassis? I wonder if that would work. Maybe they should try that.

My computing time is much less stressful now that I have learned that I don’t “need” to tinker with my computer to use it. P.S. I agree with the commenters above about the article being a little improper. It would be like writing an article saying “Here’s how to download Windows by Bit Torrent and bypass the activation.” Sure, anyone with some knowledge can do it, but I bet any reputable Windows website would frown upon such an article. People don’t buy Macs for gaming. You don’t buy a Ferrari when you need to tow a boat. You buy a pickup truck. So, you need to do gaming or VR stuff? You buy a Windows PC. I don’t understand the whole “I wish I could game on my Mac” crowd. But that’s just me. LikeLiked by 1 person vertsub2015 - 10 months ago You don’t need to download windows via bit torrent. You can just download the installer straight from microsoft and then bypass using your activator of choice.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets AMD Ryzen leaked review, beats 6900K which costs $1000 Leaked review? Early results? Does Ryzen impress? Well, it beats the $1000 Core i7-6900K right now By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: 1 week, 1 day ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Things are really heating up for Intel just weeks away from the official launch of its next-gen CPU architecture, Kaby Lake - with a leaked review of AMD's new Ryzen processor.     The review had the new Ryzen CPU had its clocks limited to 3.15GHz base and 3.3GHz boost, but AMD has confirmed the enthusiast SKU of Ryzen will kick things off at 3.4GHz, with lots of headroom for overclocking. CPCHardware is a PC magazine in France that has been in operation since 2001, and is reportedly an engineering sample set out to the press under NDA.     There are some interesting benchmark results, with a bunch of render programs being run on the Ryzen CPU at 3.3GHz, against the $1000 processor from Intel in the form of the Core i7-6900K. Not only that, but we have the 6800K, FX-8370, and more.     The gaming benchmarks are not as good for AMD, but we're looking at unoptimized results here - with what I'm sure will be a very early motherboard sample, and low clocks. We have older games being run as well, including Battlefield 4, GRID: Autosport, and Anno 2070.     Power consumption on Ryzen is impressive, with 93W of power being consumed - up against the 138W on the FX-8370 and 96W on the 6900K. Good results, but it's still very warm right now even at 3.3GHz, so we might have a hotter round of CPUs with Ryzen and the Kaby Lake-based 7700K running at up to 100C, and 30C+ cooler with its TIM removed.

Enter this forum, this is all about Intel baby.   Thread Tools Display Modes Intel Newbie Boost Frequency overclocking questions   (#1) campcreekdude Master Guru   Videocard: Radeon 7970 crossfire Processor: FX8350 Mainboard: Crosshair V Memory: 16 gig DDR3 2133 mhz Soundcard: PSU: Antec Intel Newbie Boost Frequency overclocking questions - 12-25-2016, 02:38 | posts: 237 I've only build AMD systems for the past while and now I am new to Intel. With AMD I was able to do a modest overclock and the AMD boost frequency would be on-top of the overclock. Everyone says turn off boost speeds for the fullest potential of overclock (i know its true). With the AMD system I was able to test the boost frequency by launching dual or single threaded, tests with prime to measure/achieve stable performance. I switched over to 4 threads... watched the frequency bounce down... and switched to 2 threads or 3 threads.. it went up. I played back and forth for a long time. Anyhow, with intel will the boost speed be on top of the overclock speed? I read some people say its not... but that might be old information. I just got the i5-6600k (not in my hands otherwise I would have the answer). People say a safe overclock is 4.6 ghz... but I think (my threshold) for a safe overclock would be 4 ghz with a 4.6 ghz boost frequency (if that's possible). I always go a little under than what other people are doing. But that would be my plan with no over-volting and using 3000mhz ram. I have ordered the corsair H75. Anyone else overclocking intel and keeping the intel boost?     campcreekdude View Public Profile Find all posts by campcreekdude     (#2) sykozis Ancient Guru     Videocard: XFX RX 470 Processor: Core i5 6600K Mainboard: MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Memory: Corsair DDR4-2666 Soundcard: Creative SB-Z PSU: Corsair CX750M 12-25-2016, 05:06 | posts: 19,702 | Location: US East Coast With Intel processors, the "overclock" is applied to the boost frequency unless you disable Turbo Boost.... An overclock to 4ghz, isn't worth doing as the stock Turbo clock is already 3.9ghz. You'd only be gaining 100mhz. When you overclock with Turbo Boost enabled, you're increasing the Turbo Boost multiplier. When you overclock with Turbo Boost disabled, you're increasing the base clock multiplier.     sykozis View Public Profile Find all posts by sykozis   (#3) campcreekdude Master Guru   Videocard: Radeon 7970 crossfire Processor: FX8350 Mainboard: Crosshair V Memory: 16 gig DDR3 2133 mhz Soundcard: PSU: Antec 12-25-2016, 09:55 | posts: 237 Thanks, It is different than AMD. I am reading about it too. The default is a boost speed for all 4 cores is @ 3.6 ghz. (AMD does not have a 4 core boost) 3c @ 3.7 2c @ 3.8 1c @ 3.9 So if all I do is over clock it to 4.0Ghz at default boost settings that would mean it would be 4c 3.7 3c 3.8 2c 3.9 1c 4.0 I am also looking at the features of my motherboard in the manual. After I posted the question lol -downloaded the manual. Anyhow... The Bios of my motherboard has a few additional tweaks that I will play with. I will definitely not leave turbo to default and switch the multiplier. Apparently I can change the base clock and the Turbo Ratios. CPU Base Clock Allows you to manually set the CPU base clock in 0.01 MHz increments. (Default: Auto) Turbo Ratio Allows you to set the CPU Turbo ratios for different number of active cores.

As well I guess they need to be stable too lol You can't change the base clock multiplier without disabling Turbo Boost. With Turbo Boost enabled, the base clock multiplier stays 35 and you adjust the Turbo Boost multiplier. CPU Base frequency is 3.5ghz.....bclk (base clock) is 100mhz and bclk multiplier is 35. Turbo multiplier is 39. If you leave Turbo boost enabled and OC to 4.4ghz, you end up with bclk = 100mhz, bclk multi = 35, turbo multi = 44 (3.5ghz Base, 4.4ghz Turbo) bclk is essentially the bus frequency for Intel....lol     sykozis View Public Profile Find all posts by sykozis Onto a Different Bios Setting...   (#8) campcreekdude Master Guru   Videocard: Radeon 7970 crossfire Processor: FX8350 Mainboard: Crosshair V Memory: 16 gig DDR3 2133 mhz Soundcard: PSU: Antec Onto a Different Bios Setting... - 12-27-2016, 02:12 | posts: 237 What about the setting "CPU Flex Ratio" Quote from Reddit: CPU flex ratio is the minimum multiplier setting it'll go to. So the override is to set it to what you want. Quote from Hardops "I found the CPU flex ratio override setting. This was set to 20x which is basically the minimum non-turbo ratio the CPU will use under certain circumstances." I'm pretty stubborn. I just flipped pages in the bios manual and found a new setting. I just don't know what that "certain circumstances" by hard ops means... lol The manuals dont tell alot of useful information...lol CPU Flex Ratio Override Enables or disables the CPU Flex Ratio. The maximum CPU clock ratio will be based on the CPU Flex Ratio Settings value if CPU Clock Ratio is set to Auto. So if i set the clock ratio to auto... then change the CPU flex ratio... does it change the ratio of the minimum core clock speed. Is that what its there for? (then i can do what I want) Or do I have to set the clock speed to max Turbo Desire, then set flex ratio. Set Turbo Ratios... Remember I don't have the mobo yet its shipping to me. I can't test it. Yes I realize I am stubborn.

DDR4 version It's the cheapest one I could get that was Z170. While searching for the meaning of that setting I found that other boards (Alienware) had a "non turbo flex ratio" setting. I'm not sure if it interferes with powersaving features where it idles down the CPU to really low speeds. But it seems like it should change the minimum clock from what I am reading.     campcreekdude View Public Profile Find all posts by campcreekdude   (#11) campcreekdude Master Guru   Videocard: Radeon 7970 crossfire Processor: FX8350 Mainboard: Crosshair V Memory: 16 gig DDR3 2133 mhz Soundcard: PSU: Antec 12-30-2016, 18:45 | posts: 237 So I am just going to say whats happening with the overclock. I installed the CPU and left everything default - auto. All four cores activated it always ran at the turbo 3.6 ghz (not 3.5ghz core base). This is the same behavior when I set the turbo to 4.1 ghz and cpu flex ratio at 4.0 ghz. I ran prime95 last night. I don't get errors but I have annoyances. Even while running prime95 if I walk away after 10 minutes the computer went to sleep. So I disabled sleep. Then last night at around 3:05 am (the last log entry for prime) The computer decided to do Windows Updates and restart the computer. I was afraid that at 4.1 ghz my computer just failed and restarted. Then I looked at the update history and it did do some updates last night. Prime did not record any errors in the log. Prime prior to the restart lasted a little over 3 hours. Its possible that my computer failed at 4.1Ghz. But the windows update might be culprit. If it decides that it can sleep with prime running then it might decide restart. I've never had Windows 10 restart on its own for me on my computer but I normally use Pro not home edition of win 10. My temps are in the 50's they climb to 63 then the fan kicks in and they are back to 50's temps. Doing a tri-threaded test seems like a waste of time. It rarely bounces up to 4.2 ghz for a long duration on the cores. Its as if it knows 3 core but the other core is in use by anti-virus/and all other things running. So now I am doing a dual threaded test - its consistently above 4.1 ghz on all cores. However, I don't like the idea that my computer restarted last night. But is Windows Update a good explanation?     campcreekdude View Public Profile Find all posts by campcreekdude « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

We’ve seen some other chipsets used, but we’ve yet to see an option packing Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors which are more than capable of running the lightweight Chrome OS. Why is that? According to two ex-Googlers on Google+, the boiled-down reason is that Qualcomm doesn’t open-source or upstream the various drivers that enable operating systems to run stably with the company’s chipsets. The reason this becomes a roadblock is because Chromebooks are constantly updated for years after the release. There has been some work to develop Chrome OS hardware powered by Qualcomm chipsets. However, due to the risk associated with the possibility of Qualcomm abandoning the hardware, it hasn’t ever progressed to the point of showing up on actual hardware. One of the ex-Googlers further explains that Qualcomm prefers its business model on Android which, for the most part, is to “ship it and forget it.” One difficulty is Qualcomm’s reluctance to open-source and upstream the various drivers that make up Linux support for the embedded devices. If Qualcomm doesn’t demonstrate ongoing support for their devices in the Linux kernel, then Google (or a Chromebook OEM) would best significant engineering risk if an update needs to be made in the future. Qualcomm seems to prefer the business model of Android where they can “ship it and forget it”. So in summary, it’s very unlikely we’ll see a Chrome OS device powered by Qualcomm anytime soon. In the meantime, we’re still seeing expansion in what processors Chromebooks run on, such as the recent Acer R13 Chromebook which is the first powered by MediaTek.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Technology Why the Computing Cloud Will Keep Growing and Growing Bits By QUENTIN HARDY DEC. 25, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story SAN FRANCISCO — Jeff Bezos of Amazon, along with a couple of his rivals, may eventually control much of the $1 trillion global market for business computers and software. That is because Amazon Web Services, his big-business computing division, is starting to affect more than just the world of computer servers, data storage and networking at the core of computing. Increasingly, it is also entangled with mobile phones, sensors and all sorts of other devices in the so-called Internet of Things. It’s the same story at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, the other two big cloud companies. Start-ups and giant corporations rent the core resources, along with related software, instead of owning and running their own machines. What’s next? As innovations like artificial intelligence and connected devices become popular, customers are putting cloud components in mobile computing, home games and email marketing campaigns. In other words, the big clouds aim to be everywhere. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “When has Amazon ever thought about anything other than world domination?” said Lydia Leong, who follows cloud computing at Gartner. Not content to be in big centralized data centers, she said, “they want to be at the edges, whether that is a customer’s own computers or the Internet of Things.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story This aim for domination was clear at Amazon’s big customer conference, called Re:Invent, which was held in Las Vegas this month. About 32,000 people went to the fourth annual event. In one talk at the conference, an Amazon Web Services executive showed off the company’s 8,700-mile undersea cable, part of an A.W.S. global network that each day adds computing power equal to that inside a Fortune 500 corporation, and spoke about this expansion. He talked about crushing the costs of servers and networking, most likely sad news for old tech giants that make those things, like Dell and Cisco. In a nice bit of showmanship during the main keynote, Andy Jassy, the head of A.W.S., appeared onstage with an 18-wheel truck carrying a device that could suck 100 petabytes of data out of a customer’s computers and put it in the Amazon cloud. That is equal to two billion filing cabinets of paper, which a surprising number of companies now possess in digital form, thanks to things like video and sensors. Put that together with some software Mr. Jassy talked about that would be on chips made by Intel but capable of gaining access to the A.W.S. cloud, and you get the picture: There isn’t a part of computing Amazon doesn’t want to touch. It is easy to see why this matters to Amazon. In the third quarter, A.W.S. had revenue of $13 billion a year, growing at 55 percent annually. A.W.S. was 10 percent of Amazon’s revenue, but more than 100 percent of the company’s operating income. Amazon’s international retail business lost money, and United States retail sales are nowhere near as profitable. Amazon says it is hardly moving away from a core business of providing large-scale computing, but rather finding more ways to sell stuff related to it by moving to edge devices. “We see it less as a move from one to the other, and more of an extension,” an Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Camarata, wrote in an email Saturday. “We have an enormous number of customers excited about leveraging the capabilities.” But Amazon is not alone in this business, and the competition is getting more intense. A.W.S. now has 81 services, including ways to work on home video games. Microsoft’s 67 services include Internet of Things “hubs” and email marketing campaigns. Google has 53, including ways to deploy mobile software globally and steer performance with data analysis. Comparisons of services are difficult, as one company’s service may encompass two or three offered by another. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Machine learning — a method for computers to gain knowledge without being programmed with that information — is front and center for Alphabet’s Google, said Urs Hölzle, the head of technical infrastructure at Google Compute. Google has recently shown off its own global network of submarine cables, along with local devices like cloud-connected office whiteboards. Over the next year, Mr. Hölzle said, Google will open about one new Compute facility a month. Building out across the globe, with sometimes $1 billion or more in a facility, is critical in some cases to meet local data regulations. Equally, the big cloud companies all want to be as close to customers and their devices as possible. “Global proximity is a huge advantage,” said Corey Sanders, the director of program management at Azure. “This is a way to transform your business, including the way devices on the edge act.” There are profound consequences from the scale and ambition of this trend. Given their size, wealth and technical expertise, the big cloud companies are likely to build cheaper designs and demand lower prices for everything in computing. Who is to say they don’t affect the devices themselves? That is starting to dawn on the rest of the industry. On the first day of Re:Invent, Mr. Jassy had a private lunch with about 10 venture capitalists. It is an annual affair, where he indicates where A.W.S. is going, and they figure out how to make money from it. “He wasn’t explicit, but if you were hoping to invest in storage, computing — anything below applications — you are hosed,” said Dharmesh Thakker, a partner at Battery Ventures, who attended the lunch. “Andy is smart and approachable, but reading between the lines, I’m not sure this is good for the V.C. ecosystem.” A version of this article appears in print on December 26, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Why the Computing Cloud Will Keep Growing and Growing.

So this year, Religioso began planning “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments, where e-sports teams consist of one man and one woman. He also began laying the groundwork for a mentoring program to foster interest in e-sports among women. “These are baby steps so that we can get more women on the team,” he said. “We need to make the scene a welcoming place.”Religioso’s efforts are one of several recent moves by video game makers and publishers to increase diversity in e-sports, which is rapidly becoming one of the video game industry’s most visible segments. As more women play video games, the e-sports industry is starting to focus on getting more of them involved in professional competition to help the effort expand and become mainstream. Revenue from e-sports is expected to surpass $1 billion worldwide by 2018, yet the viewership for e-sports is only 15 percent female, according to the market research firm SuperData. There is little data on the number of women who actually play e-sports, but anecdotal evidence suggests the figure may be small. Efforts to increase diversity in e-sports go back more than a decade but have started gathering momentum. In 2003, the French e-sports company Oxent began organising annual women-only tournaments; 40 teams competed in the 2016 tournament in Paris, an increase of 25 percent over the previous year. Twitch, the Amazon-owned site that livestreams video game play, began hosting Misscliks, a support community for women in gaming, three years ago after some of its founders became dismayed by the lack of women in e-sports. Twitch also established Inclusivity City, an area for diversity organisations, at its annual convention, TwitchCon, which ran September 30 to October 2 in San Francisco. And this year, apart from Bandai Namco’s efforts, Intel and the e-sports company ESL partnered to form AnyKey, an advocacy organization that seeks to create support networks and provide opportunities for women in e-sports. Many women gamers welcome these efforts. With a predominance of professional male players, the culture of the video game industry has long been perceived as misogynistic. Women in e-sports have frequently faced heckling from teammates and anonymous threats of rape and murder. “It’s an extremely toxic environment for women,” said Stephanie Harvey, 30, who is a top competitor in e-sports tournaments for the game “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.” “To be a woman in e-sports, you have to have a thick skin.”How effective these efforts will be in drawing more women to e-sports is uncertain. Although Oxent, which has run the Electronic Sports World Convention for 13 years, has organised women-only tournaments for years for Counter-Strike, there is little evidence that they are encouraging more women to play competitively. Some gamers think the events reinforce the idea that women are not capable of competing with men.Lâm Hua, the head of content at Oxent, said the women-only tournaments were not entirely successful in drawing more women to e-sports, but after much debate, the company decided that they were “the first step in the grand scheme of women recognition in the sport.” For now, he said, they were “a necessary evil.” Other diversity efforts in e-sports have focused on normalising the idea of women in gaming. Anna Prosser Robinson, a programming manager and onscreen personality at Twitch, helped push the company’s diversity initiatives after seeing women rise up, then drop out of e-sports. “We would see these awesome, compelling women be excited” about e-sports, she said. “Six months later, they would be gone.” The goal of Misscliks, she said, was to provide support and resources to encourage those women to create a network on Twitch and stay in e-sports. Prosser Robinson also helped bring diversity to TwitchCon this year with Inclusivity City, a physical space on the convention floor that hosted several diversity organizations like AnyKey and Hack Harassment, as well as a Smash Sisters tournament for women who play Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. fighting games. “Inclusivity is a core value of our brand,” Chase, a Twitch spokesman who goes by one name, said of the diversity effort at the convention. “It was a success this year and definitely something we could consider for next year.”AnyKey, the creation of Intel and ESL to increase the number of women in e-sports, focuses on two areas. One is research and discussion of the diversity issue, headed by T.L. Taylor, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the other is initiatives and solutions, led by Morgan Romine, a former e-sports player. AnyKey organised a women-only e-sports tournament in March at one of the industry’s largest events, the Intel Extreme Masters competition in Katowice, Poland. Romine said she saw women-only tournaments as a way to strengthen players’ skills and move them into open competition.“There is a lot of work that needs to be done, giving more women confidence and experience in that space,” she said. Religioso of Bandai Namco said he began noticing the lack of female e-sports players at regional e-sports tournaments last spring, like Final Round in Atlanta and Combo Breaker in Chicago.With the growth in e-sports, he saw an opportunity to reinvigorate interest in the company’s Tekken franchise. Next year, Bandai Namco will release “Tekken 7,” a one-on-one fighting game that the company hopes will be popular among e-sports competitors. Women make up about 23 percent of the fan base for the Tekken fighting games, Religioso said, but few are playing them competitively.Rather than segregate men and women, Religioso wants them to work together in the “Bonnie and Clyde” tournaments. He also wants to introduce Western audiences to the Tekken Girl’s Club, a mentorship program in Japan in which professional players teach women to master the game’s mechanics. Another solution to encourage more women into e-sports would be to change the way video games are made and marketed. Stephanie Llamas, director of research and insight at SuperData, said women should be participating more on the business side of the industry and developing games with women in mind.“It’s difficult to understand the demographic if you are not part of that demographic,” she said.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Mulayam Singh avoids question on rift in...

STARTUP 17 NYC-Based Startups Ready To Take On 2017 These Startups Are Likely To Grab A Decent Bite of The Big Apple By Yoav Vilner Yoav Vilner is a tech blogger, growth hacker, and startup marketer. He's also the co-founder of Ranky, a startup marketing team. @YoavVilner Co-founder, Ranky@YoavVilner WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Advertisement On the one hand, New York City is one of the most expensive cities to build a startup, mainly due to sky-high real estate prices and salaries. On the other hand, the startup scene in New York City is booming, and the following list of startups proves it. Besides asking investors, entrepreneurs and colleagues, I also found special help in researching with Guy Franklin's " Mapped in NY" project, as well as with Guy Poreh who played senior roles in ad agencies and is now involved in the NYC startup community. These 17 NYC-based startups are diverse, creative and have the New York City grit to boot. Please note that they are listed randomly and not according to importance or priority. Lemonade Lemonade is a different type of insurance company, and they're shaking things up in the old-fashioned and bureaucratic insurance industry. Lemonade has no brokers so fees are lower than average. It's powered by AI on your smartphone, and the kicker is they actually donate your leftover claim money to nonprofits that you designate yourself. The company originally wanted to give policyholders back the unclaimed money, but current law in New York won't allow for that. Lemonade is actively trying to change the law. Lemonade raised $60 million in three rounds in a one-year period, including their $34 million Series B funding by General Catalyst Partners earlier this month. Currently operating in New York, Lemonade announced it had filed for a license in California and wants to expand to other states subsequently. Tailor Brands Founded in 2014 by Yali Saar, Tom Lahat and Nadav Shatz, Tailor Brands is teaching computers to design and present an online, automated full-service branding agency.

The platform also allows users to preview their designs before paying for them, and offers different price ranges and bundles, starting at $39. The company creates a new design every 2 seconds, and has recently secured $4 million in funding. HYPR HYPR manages a database that covers 1 billion social media accounts and over 10 million influencers searchable by audience demographic, psychographic and geographic data.

Gil Eyal, HYPR's founder, told me he realized that influencer marketing was an untapped field. He wanted to remodel it by providing tools that help analyze the audience of every celebrity and influencer in the world, as well as automate the ability to run measurable, targeted campaigns, at scale. The company received $5 million in seed funding last year. Siemplify Siemplify ThreatNexus is a security orchestration and incident response platform that assists analysts and security teams by contextualizing their day-to-day threat landscape.

The Siemplify ThreatNexus solution is designed for analysts to orchestrate and automate the full spectrum of security operations from a single pane of glass. The highly visual and intuitive product is used globally by some of the largest security teams to help prevent breaches and has become one of the tool analysts rely on to respond to and manage threats. BioCatch Financial fraud is taking a toll on banks and consumer confidence to the tune of $16B a year in the US alone.

Xiaomi, the tech company that has gained worldwide fame with its smartphones, concluded its new product rollout on Friday in Beijing with a notebook, the Mi Air 4G, after a tough sales year. Liu De, co-founder and vice president of Xiaomi, said this computer could be connected to the internet anytime, anywhere as there is a module enabling network service via an independent internet of things (IoT) 4G channel provided by China's largest telecom operator, China Mobile. He said hopefully this device will usher in the third era of how a computer can be connected to the internet. In the first era, the computer could be linked to the internet via a cable and in the second era, via Wi-Fi. The 12.5 inch version of the Mi Air 4G, whose configurations are the same as its predecessor, Mi Air, is priced at 4,699 yuan (6), while the 13.3 inch version, which features a new processor, the Intel i7-6500 U, is priced at 6,999 yuan, said Liu. Liu added that the internet service will be free during the first year but admitted that whether the service will be charged in future years is undecided. Xiaomi launched its first PC product, the Mi Air on July 27 this year. Liu said that the company had sold 220,000 units of Mi Air in the first three months. Mi Air was also the best-selling PC on Tmall during the 24-hour Single's Day shopping festival created by Alibaba Group. Liu said the Mi Air 4G, which is to be on sale in January 2017, will be exclusively available at the outlets of China Mobile, which has promised to sell 500,000 units for Xiaomi in the next year. Jacky Zhao, an analyst with IDC China, a market research firm, said that the embedded high-speed internet service is a good feature but it is hard to tell how the market will react to the new product. This feature might not be that attractive in China's key cities where Wi-Fi services are convenient, although not that safe, the analyst said. If the Wi-Fi environment improves a lot, Mi Air 4G may not be as attractive. Liu admitted that the Mi Air 4G's edge might not be that obvious in big cities but might be a must-have for civil servants in villages who are also university graduates. Compared to Mi Air, which is priced at 3,499 yuan and 4,699 yuan according to different configurations, Mi Air 4G might also lose its edge in pricing, Zhao said. But he added that Mi fans might be willing to accept the higher cost so this pricing strategy might be good for an image lift. Zhao said he is not sure about the logic behind the distribution arrangement of the Mi Air 4G but believes this will enhance its offline presence. The Mi Air 4G will enrich Xiaomi's overall product lineup, but it will be hard for Xiaomi to change the layout of the PC sector as it has done to the cell phone sector, Zhao said. "Because the PC sector had been rather mature when Xiaomi entered but the cell phone sector was to face a tremendous change as the smartphone was to prevail," the analyst said.

This announcement comes ahead of CES 2017, an event where manufacturers typically take the stage to showcase new devices. Despite the fact that many competitors have yet to reveal their cards for this year, the South Korean manufacturer boldly claims that the 13.3-inch variant is the lightest notebook in the market. The Notebook 9 laptops come in two sizes: a 13.3-inch version and a 15-inch one. They more or less share the same specs, including the seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i7, integrated graphics, an SSD up to 256 GB, 8 GB of RAM, Bluetooth 4.1, and 2×2 802.11ac, to name a few. However, the 13.3-inch model can have up to 16 GB of RAM, and it’s also available with a Core i5. They also have FHD displays, which amount to 1,920 x 1,080 resolutions. The 13.3-inch variant will be a tad sharper because of the smaller screen. Other features are the built-in fingerprint reader for security, Windows Hello support, and a 720p webcam for video calls. In terms of ports, they’re both equipped with two USB 3.0, a USB-C, an HDMI, and a microSD card slot. If that’s not enough, the 15-inch unit has an additional USB 2.0 port. It should also be pointed out that the USB-C is also for charging, and Samsung says users can plug it in and juice it up using a phone charger and get 2.1 hours of battery life in just 20 minutes or fully recharge it in an hour and 20 minutes. Arguably the most notable aspect of the new Notebook 9 laptops is their weight — 13.3-inch version at 1.8 pounds and the 15.5-inch one at 2.17 pounds.

But 2016 also had plenty of, er, high points. Marijuana producers left other stocks in a cloud of smoke, and miners unearthed some big gains after years of losses. But you didn’t have to be an expert stock picker to win big in 2016. Putting all of your money into an index – whether it was the S&P/TSX composite or the Dow Jones industrial average – would have worked out just fine. As easy as it was to make money, however, there were still plenty of ways to screw up, as the Stars and Dogs of 2016 reveal. Stars 🌟 Teck Resources (TECK.B-T) A year ago, if you’d told people you were planning to invest in struggling Teck Resources, they would have laughed at you. Then they would have called up their friends to laugh at you some more. Well, who’s laughing now? In one of the greatest comebacks for a Canadian stock since, well, since Teck Resources pulled off a similar feat in 2009, the diversified miner made yet another miraculous recovery in 2016 when it was the top-performing stock year-to-date on the S&P/TSX composite index. Lifted by rebounding prices for metallurgical coal – the kind used in steel-making – Teck’s beaten-down shares soared nearly tenfold from their January low of $3.65 to their November high of $35.67 before giving back some of those gains. Coal doesn’t get all the credit; cost-cutting, debt reduction and improving prices for copper and zinc also gave the shares a lift. Investors are laughing … all the way to the bank. – John Heinzl 🌟 Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA-I) The real reason U.S. stocks surged to record highs this year? The Clinton Foundation secretly funnelled money from the Saudi royal family into a Swiss bank account controlled by billionaire George Soros, who then hired employees of a pizza restaurant in Washington to execute a series of trades to deliberately drive up the prices of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and other Dow stocks. It’s so obvious, people! For those who aren’t swayed by conspiracy theories, there may be a simpler explanation: The U.S. economy is in good shape, corporate profits are recovering and president-elect Donald Trump is vowing to cut corporate taxes, deregulate industries and invest billions to rebuild infrastructure. Sure, his plan would add to the U.S. government’s already massive debt and probably take years to stimulate growth. But when Wall Street wants to party, nothing can stop it – except maybe a Chinese-led plot to unleash North Korean short sellers on the U.S. market in early 2017. You heard it here first. – JH 🌟 Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index An impeached president. The worst recession since the 1930s. A summer Olympics plagued by street crime, pollution and a diving pool that had to be closed after it turned a mysterious shade of green. These are not the sorts of conditions one normally associates with a healthy stock market, yet none of them stopped investors from diving back into Brazilian equities in a big way this year. Enticed by rebounding commodity prices, cheap valuations and hopes that Brazil’s economy – and its political problems – couldn’t possibly get any worse, capital poured back into South America’s largest and most populous country and sent Brazil’s main stock index to its highest levels since 2012. All of which proved the old investing adage that the best time to take the plunge into stocks is when the water looks the least inviting. – JH 🌟 Sleep Country (ZZZ-T) Money-saving tip: When you’re shopping at Sleep Country, lie down on a mattress and pretend to fall asleep. When the salesperson gives you a nudge, “fall” onto the floor as if you are hurt and yell: “Are you going to give me a 50-per-cent discount or do I have to call a personal injury lawyer?” Works every time. If you’d bought Sleep Country’s stock earlier this year, on the other hand, you could afford to pay full price. Shares of the mattress retailer surged as revenues and earnings rose, driven by new store openings, growing sales of pillows, linens and other accessories and – of course – the chain’s ubiquitous advertising (sing it with me: “Sleep Country Canada, why buy a mattress anywhere else?” Now good luck getting the stupid song out of your head for the rest of the day). With the third quarter marking the 13th consecutive period of higher same-store sales and Sleep Country continuing to expand, shareholders are sleeping like babies – rich babies. – JH 🌟 Nvidia (NVDA-Q) N-what-ia? Nvidia may not be a household name like its competitor Intel, but if you play video games, own a smartphone or drive a car with an on-screen navigation or entertainment system, chances are you’ve used one of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs). The top gainer on the S&P 500 by a wide margin this year, Nvidia owes much of its recent success to a new generation of “Pascal” chips that are taking aim at virtual reality games, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other applications requiring massive processing power. “Our new Pascal GPUs are fully ramped and enjoying great success in gaming, VR, self-driving cars and datacentre AI computing,” CEO Jen-Hsung Huang said after Nvidia’s third-quarter results crushed estimates – again. With Nvidia’s stock hitting record highs all year, there was nothing artificial about the intelligence of investors who saw Nvidia’s massive potential. – JH 🌟 S&P/TSX composite index (TSX-I) Prior to 2016, relative stock market performance offered up plenty to nourish a Canadian inferiority complex. For five calendar years straight, the S&P 500 index had outperformed the S&P/TSX composite index. In 2013, when the Canadian index rose by a respectable 10 per cent, the U.S. counterpart notched a 30-per-cent gain. In 2015, when U.S. stocks declined slightly, Canadian stocks fully corrected. The losing streak finally ended in 2016, and all it took was for the price of oil to double. But the year certainly didn’t start out promising. The ongoing collapse in commodity prices had ravaged the resource-heavy Canadian stock market, while China’s economic slowdown had stifled risk appetite. But an abrupt reversal in commodity markets sent Canadian stocks on a fairly steady upward trajectory beginning in January, and by the end of the year, the index was closing in on its all-time high of 15,657. That performance was good enough to claim the top spot among all developed markets’ major indexes. But far more importantly, we finally beat the Americans. – Tim Shufelt 🌟 Encana (ECA-T) Once Canada’s largest company by market capitalization, Encana spent the following several years steadily destroying its own value. From a pre-financial crisis peak in excess of $50 per share, the company’s stock over time declined by 95 per cent to hit an all-time low of $3 in February at the depths of the oil crash. The stock was a victim of global forces exacerbated by some extraordinarily bad timing. With the industry decimated by the financial crisis, the company decided to spin off its oil assets and focus on natural gas. Then oil prices promptly rallied while gas prices tanked. Encana eventually pivoted back into oil assets just in time for the worst crude oil crash in a generation. On the bright side, that long grind downward made for all the more potential upside upon the recovery in oil prices. Since hitting bottom, the stock has more than quadrupled, and occupies the sixth spot among the best stocks in the S&P/TSX composite index this year. – TS 🌟 TMX Group (X-T) It serves to show how much the Canadian stock market is dominated by resources that the top-performing non-resource stock is itself partly fuelled by the resource rally. Last year at this time, shares of TMX Group, which owns the Toronto Stock Exchange and the TSX Venture Exchange, were bearing the effects of the commodity rout through low trading volumes. Then Nasdaq announced its entry into the Canadian market, causing shares in TMX to end 2015 under considerable selling pressure. But the emerging competitive challenges, including the alternative trading platforms introduced by Aequitas Innovations Inc. last year, have yet to pose a mortal threat to TMX’s dominance. Combine that with the resource rally, and continuing cost-cutting, and the year was set up for a significant upswing. Then in November, TMX released third-quarter profits that beat estimates while announcing a dividend increase – the magic words for Canadian investors. That provided the last leg up in what proved to be more than a doubling of its share price. – TS 🌟 Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC-T) Buy one measly pot stock and pretty soon you could have yourself a nasty habit. Say you bought a small stake in Canopy at the end of last year. By November it would have swelled sixfold, crowding out the duller parts of your portfolio – stocks your parents kept telling you to own, like utilities. They were a drag anyway. Then you buy another pot stock, and another. It’s all very innocent at the start. Maybe you start spending a little more on video game and snack stocks than usual. Suddenly, you can’t focus at work so well, all you can think about is Canopy’s stock chart, checking in on it four, five times a day. Then one night you find yourself in a dank alley, buying a gun stock from a twitchy guy who says you need to diversify. This happened to a friend of mine. – TS 🌟 Caterpillar (CAT-N) It took all of one day for investors to go from dreading the idea of Donald Trump occupying the White House to humming Hail to the Chief while frantically buying into his agenda. Aside from financials, there is perhaps no greater example of the sudden faith the market has in the Donald’s economic platform than in Caterpillar’s shares. On day one after the Nov. 8 election, its stock rose by 8 per cent. Within one month, it was up by 15 per cent. To be fair, investors had been bidding on a recovery in heavy equipment well before the election, pushing the stock on a general upward trajectory through the year. But the promise of tax cuts, regulatory reform and a vast infrastructure spending program unleashed the bulls, who lifted Caterpillar to a two-year high. In early December, the company itself attempted to manage expectations, calling analysts’ estimates for earnings growth “too optimistic.” Investors responded by pushing up the stock a little more. – TS Dogs 🐶 Valeant (VRX-T) Side effects of investing in Valeant Pharmaceuticals may include, but are not limited to, staggering financial losses, delayed financial statements, regulatory investigations, repeated guidance reductions, screaming, crying, throwing chairs across the room and generally feeling a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair. Even as Valeant replaced its CEO and moved to pay down debt and restructure its operations, the stock – once the most valuable on the TSX – kept falling, as did shares of another debt-bloated, growth-by-acquisition Canadian drug maker, Concordia International. As Morgan Stanley’s David Risinger, one of the few analysts who had still been recommending Valeant, said in December when he cut the stock to the equivalent of a “hold” rating and slashed his price target: “Our investment thesis that management would stabilize the business and execute accelerated deleveraging via divestitures has been wrong.” You don’t say. – John Heinzl 🐶 First Solar (FSLR-Q) There’s a lot to like about solar power: It’s renewable, affordable and better for the planet than burning fossil fuels. Unfortunately for First Solar shareholders, those virtues don’t guarantee that investors will make money. Hurt by plunging prices for solar panels – with cheap Chinese imports the main culprit – the Arizona-based company announced plans to accelerate development of more efficient models to help it compete. The move will lead to layoffs for about one-quarter of its employees, a pretax restructuring charge of $500-million to $700-million (U.S.) and a net loss of $2 to $4 a share in 2016. The largest U.S. solar-equipment maker – it also designs utility-scale power plants – First Solar lost more than half of its value from March to November before recovering some ground in December. Even with the rebound, however, investors are still nursing a nasty sunburn. – JH 🐶 Nike (NKE-N) Like a sports dynasty that seemingly could do no wrong, Nike came into 2016 with a seven-year stock market-winning streak under its belt. Posting percentage returns well into the double digits for most of those years, the shares seemed as unstoppable as LeBron James going in for a layup. Well, even King James misses once in a while. Faced with growing competition from Adidas – whose casual athletic styles are appealing to a growing number of consumers – and from upstart apparel-maker Under Armour, Nike’s already wobbly stock blew out a knee in the fall when future orders missed expectations. If you’d predicted that Nike would be the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average in 2016, people would have thought you were nuts. But that’s the thing about sports dynasties – they all come to an end eventually. – JH 🐶 DH Corp. (DH-T) Back when it was called Davis + Henderson, the company now known simply as DH was famous for two things: printing cheques and paying dividends. Unfortunately for investors, it’s run into problems with both. Having spent the past several years diversifying into financial-technology solutions for things like lending and payments processing, DH’s stock posted double-digit annual returns from 2012 through 2014, only to see the gains almost totally evaporate over the following two years as its cheque-printing business declined faster than expected and banks slowed purchases of new technology. When DH’s third-quarter earnings came in well below analyst estimates in October, the shares plunged 43 per cent in a single day. A few weeks later – in a move that should not have surprised anyone – DH slashed its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share from 32 cents – a drop of 62.5 per cent. Well, it was fun while it lasted. – JH 🐶 British Pound The Brexit vote may have faded from the headlines – overtaken by an even more shocking vote across the Atlantic Ocean – but if Britain’s reeling currency is any indication, the fallout from its decision to leave the European Union may just be getting started. Defying predictions by some that the pound would recover after the initial Brexit shock wore off, the currency instead kept falling. By mid-December it had plunged all the way to $1.24 (U.S.), down nearly 17 per cent from $1.49 immediately before the June 23 referendum sent the currency into spasms. With Prime Minister Theresa May taking a hard line on immigration, investors are worried that trade may fall down the list of priorities when the details of Brexit are ultimately hammered out, potentially making it more difficult for British banks and other firms to do business in the EU. That fear is being reflected in a British pound that keeps on getting, well, pounded. – JH 🐶 BlackBerry (BB-T) BlackBerry has been an easy and frequent target over the years for short sellers and this column alike. In the years since BlackBerry shares peaked in mid-2008, the stock has been named as a dog in these pages no fewer than three-dozen times. This instalment is no exception. The problem this time around was largely one of timing. BlackBerry’s stock ended 2015 on a 60-per-cent run in the calendar year’s final quarter after introducing its latest handset. The company followed that with financial results that beat expectations on software and services revenue, setting up a difficult starting point for the stock in 2016. That brought out the shorts, which soon amounted to nearly 20 per cent of the company’s float. The short-lived rally ended up paying off for short positions – a refrain far too common for investors on the other side of the BlackBerry trade. Uncertainty surrounding growth in its software business – on which the company’s foreseeable future is almost exclusively riding – quickly snuffed out the rally, relegating the stock price to single digits for most of the year. – Tim Shufelt 🐶 TripAdvisor (TRIP-Q) Fall came early for TripAdvisor shares this year. As 2016 got under way, a global equity sell-off consumed investors over concerns for slowing global growth. Travel stocks, being particularly sensitive to global macroeconomic changes, were hit hard. TripAdvisor, and its contemporaries Priceline and Expedia, were all traded down in the order of 25 to 35 per cent in the first five weeks of the year. As the market frenzy fizzled out and major indexes bottomed, TripAdvisor’s competitor stocks rallied. TripAdvisor did not. It started out vulnerable because of a relatively high valuation. Then it disappointed on earnings. Even as online travel spending rose, TripAdvisor lost share to competing alternatives. The fierce competition saw TripAdvisor’s marketing costs soar even as profits from hotel bookings declined. – TS 🐶 Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG-N) Owning Chipotle shares this year was just as likely to produce a disquieting feeling in the pit of the stomach as scarfing down a large pulled-beef burrito. Since an outbreak of food-borne illnesses tied to lapses in food safety sickened more than 500 of the chain’s diners in 2015, Chipotle has made little headway in repairing its reputation. From its peak, the oncetrendy stock has declined by nearly 50 per cent, wiping away about $11-billion (U.S.) in market capitalization. An overhaul of food-safety measures, food giveaways and discounts, and a share-buyback program well in excess of $1-billion have all failed to reverse the losses in restaurant traffic or revive the company’s stock. In a kind of union of struggling brands, Bill Ackman, the activist investor fresh off a string of losing bets in Herbalife and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, announced a 10-per-cent stake in Chipotle in September. Badly in need of a big win himself, Mr. Ackman’s quest to rescue the burrito chain has yet to find any favour in the market. – TS 🐶 Mexican Peso Has anyone checked out the peso since Donald Trump won in the biggest election landslide ever in the history of elections? Way down, big trouble, dead! Total loser currency! Sad! Considering how much Mr. Trump targeted Mexico throughout the election campaign, the peso became a proxy for the expected outcome of the election. In two of the three presidential debates, following what were widely considered to be Hillary Clinton wins, the peso responded the day after with big upward moves. Having an incoming president promise to install a vast border wall at your expense and rip up the continent’s free-trade deal might be slightly negative for Mexico and its currency, according to the market. Going into election night, the peso, like most other markets, was priced for a Clinton victory. As the opposite result dawned on the markets, the Mexican currency buckled in response to its new reality, falling to a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar in the days after the vote. – TS 🐶 FTSE Milano Italia Borsa The ghosts of the European debt crisis awoke in Italy this year, as the financial system of the most indebted euro zone country not named Greece came under renewed scrutiny. Stress tests on European banks last summer identified Monte dei Paschi di Siena – the world’s oldest bank – in danger of collapsing. By early July, the Italian banks index was down by nearly 60 per cent, dragging the main Italian stock index into a 30-per-cent sell-off over the first half of the year. The fragility of the Italian financial system could even pose a threat to the recovery of the euro zone. Over the past month, talks of a rescue package for Italian banks have mitigated the worst of the equity losses, but that still wasn’t enough to save the index from dog territory, in a year when most of the developed world realized decent equity gains. – TS Report Typo/Error Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

Come January, it's going to be a lot harder for Millard high school students to say, "The dog ate my homework." A lot of their homework will be inside a laptop. All high school students in Millard Public Schools will be issued laptop computers when they return from winter break. The Omaha World-Herald (http://bit.ly/2hK2wZd ) reports Nebraska's third-largest school district will join the growing list of districts implementing one-to-one computer programs. One-to-one means putting a single, district-owned computer in the hands of each student rather than having them share classroom computers or visit computer labs. In January, district officials will distribute nearly 8,000 laptops to students and some teachers in grades 9 through 12 at Millard North, South and West and the alternative school, Horizon High. The plan is to eventually put about 5,500 devices in the middle schools too, phasing in those machines by August 2018. Millard officials said the timing was right for the launch, with the cost of devices, bandwidth and online curriculum materials coming down. Paper textbook costs are going up, and their content is fixed, said Ken Fossen, Millard's associate superintendent for general affairs. Meantime, technology is getting cheaper, and it's flexible, he said. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where the future is," Fossen said. The rollout comes as computer use in schools continues to be a controversial topic. Criticism abounds about kids spending too much time in front of screens. Some teachers complain that computers have reduced kids' attention spans and, ultimately, their ability to think. Some research suggests that computers in school have little to no effect on achievement. Other studies indicate that, when done right, such technology can have a positive effect. Some say computers cannot replace good teaching but they can enhance it. Millard officials said they are taking care to make sure the computers will be used wisely and not overused. "This is intentional use for a purpose," said Heather Phipps, the district's associate superintendent for educational services. "I'm not surfing Facebook. I'm not looking at Vines. I'm not on Snapchat." Officials said a big reason they chose one-to-one is that the annual costs are about the same as the district pays now for technology in its high schools and middle schools. "When we fully ramp this up, six through 12, we'll be spending about a million dollars a year," he said. Middle school students will keep the same computer through eighth grade. High school students will keep them through graduation. Once the system is up and running, the district will have to buy new computers for sixth and ninth grades every year. Millard officials said the popularity of Chromebooks and netbooks have driven down the price of computing devices. After trying out devices and getting input from students, the district chose the HP 360. It is a conventional Windows laptop with a solid-state hard drive, Intel processor and touch screen. At $327 apiece, including case and charger, the initial January rollout will cost about $2.6 million. The device is not a "Cadillac," said Kent Kingston, the district's executive director of technology. The laptop can fold into a tablet, a configuration many students find comfortable for reading and searching, he said. When it's time to write a paper, it converts to the laptop with a keyboard. District officials initially explored having students bring their own devices from home. But officials weren't eager to have students bring a dozen different devices to a classroom, with different specifications, capabilities and operating systems. "Instructionally, it is way better for them all to be using the same tool," Phipps said. "It would be like handing them four different math books and hoping that Page 17 is going to look the same for everybody. Of course it's not." Phipps said she has been using one of the HP 360s as her work computer. She said she wants to know exactly how various educational software works on it. "I want to know, as the instructional leader, what's the experience going to be like for kids," she said. If kids brought their own devices, the district would have needed "back-end" computer systems to ensure that each student was seeing the same things regardless of the device, Kingston said. "The amount of money that you start to spend on back-end systems becomes equal to or more than this," he said. The district also would have to set minimum standards for devices, below which the district couldn't guarantee each student would have the same experience, he said. "You create the 'scarlet letter' effect," he said. "Here are certain kids whose device doesn't meet the school spec." Kingston said people sometimes have the wrong impression that school computer systems can run like the wireless Internet at Starbucks: You just log on and start browsing. "But that doesn't mean great instructional things are happening," he said. The HP 360s will be loaded with G Suite for Education, Google's collection of education-focused applications. A key application is Google Classroom, used to keep classes organized. Teachers can use it to create, share and grade assignments. "Google Classroom is a great workflow manager for Google Drive, and assignments and calendars and message board," he said. "So that's where most of our staff will live with kids." The computers also will be loaded with Microsoft Office and Adobe, tools kids are likely to use in their careers. Students gave the HP 360 good marks in district pilots, he said. About a thousand of the devices are already in use in Millard schools. Some Millard South students used them in an early-college high school biology class this fall. Four freshman lab partners — Hayli Wheeler, Mikayla Brandl, Abbey Dyer and Emma Ricke — each had a laptop. For one assignment the teacher sent everyone the day's lab lesson on Google Classroom, with a link to a video of an instructor guiding them through the lab. Hayli said she likes the laptop to help organize her homework. She gives it a thumbs-up. It's better than shuffling paper. "I have my laptop on me all the time," she said. Paper homework is more likely to get ruined by a spill or by getting crunched in a backpack, she said. Students and parents must fill out a loan agreement. If they choose, they can enter into a cooperative loss agreement with the district to cover damages if the laptop is broken. Interest in one-to-one policies remains high among educators, despite a lack of consensus among researchers on their impact on achievement. More than half of U.S. K-12 students and teachers will have access this year to a school-issued personal computing device, according to a study by Futuresource Consulting reported by Ed Week, a periodical that focuses on U.S. education news and trends. For the 2016 to 2017 school year 104 Nebraska high schools report having one-to-one computer programs in ninth through 12th grades, according to the Nebraska Department of Education. Over 300 of the state's schools had one computer per student in at least one grade level. Although a lot of money has been invested in computers for education, the benefits are not clear. A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that despite considerable investments in computers, Internet connections and software for educational use, there is "little solid evidence" that greater computer use leads to better scores in mathematics and reading. Overall, data on computer use at school suggest limited use may be better than no use at all, but above-average use is associated with "significantly poorer results," the study found. Earlier this year, however, a study led by a Michigan State University researcher concluded that one-to-one computer policies, when done properly, can improve achievement and teach 21st-century skills. Researchers drew that conclusion after reviewing existing research. But they noted that a disproportionate amount of the research to date consists of small case studies in a handful of schools. And only a small number of studies have used reliable methods. At the Waldorf School of the Peninsula, featured in a 2010 New York Times story, the children of Silicon Valley parents are taught with a skeptical eye for computers. The school's website explains, "Exposing children to computer technology before they are ready (around seventh grade) can hamper their ability to fully develop strong bodies, healthy habits of discipline and self-control, fluency with creative and artistic expression and flexible and agile minds." Technological literacy — a crucial 21st century skill — can be mastered quickly, it said, when children reach adolescence and have the developmental maturity to know how, why and when to use technology as a tool. The website notes a 2012 study by Common Sense Media in which many teachers felt entertainment media — everything from TV to cellphones to online programming computer games — have hurt kids' academic skills. The biggest concern was attention span, but teachers also were concerned that students' writing skills were hurt. In October, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued new recommendations on children's media use. Noting that media have become "ubiquitous" in children's lives, the academy recommended that children ages 2 to 5 should spend only an hour a day on high-quality programs. For school-age children and adolescents, the academy calls for balancing media with other healthy behaviors. Kingston said he's wary of the pitfalls of too much computer time. "I'm an old social studies guy," he said. "We still want to sit in a Socratic circle and have a discussion. I still want kids to do that. I might actually say 'Close the laptops and shut it down.' " Phipps said that although each student will have a device, that doesn't mean students will be on that device in every class, all day, every lesson. "That doesn't instructionally make sense," she said. "When it's appropriate to be using a digital tool, you'll be using a digital tool. When it's appropriate to be having a conversation, you'll be having a conversation. When it's important to be working something on paper, you'll be working something on paper." To make for a smooth rollout, Millard officials have tried to think of all possible problems, including what happens when students turn them all on at the same time. To make sure the laptops were secure, officials invited students to try to hack them. The students discovered some vulnerabilities that needed fixing, Kingston said. Students will have a unique logon only good on that device. Filters will keep an eye out for inappropriate material — sexting, threatening behavior, bullying — even when the kids take them home, he said. If there's suspicion that a student's health or welfare is at risk, then school authorities will be alerted, he said. --- Information from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com An AP Member Exchange shared by the Omaha World-Herald.

As many as 275 companies visited the campus for placements, and the students received an average salary of Rs. 11.35 lakh as cost to company. Incidentally, there was high demand for those with dual degrees. The percentage of students with dual degrees receiving jobs was higher than those with single degrees. About 371 students of B.Tech, 301 students of M.Tech and 169 dual-degree students were placed in the first season of placements this year. “These days, the companies try to cut management and logistic costs by hiring those with dual degrees or inter-disciplinary students. This way, they save up on salaries of personnel. So, an oil company will not just hire a chemical engineer, but also someone who understands technology,” said Chandrashekhar Kulkarni, an engineering college professor, who has been observing the engineering placement scene for over two decades. The placement season of IIT-B seemed lacklustre this year. Information Technology giants like Infosys and Wipro, and big players like Microsoft and Google who offer huge salaries, were absent. Intel Technologies offered about 28 jobs, while Samsung came with more than 20 offers. Other companies that gave more than 20 offers were Citicorp and Dar-Al. Companies like Axis Bank, Goldman Sachs, DataXU, and Future First gave more than 10 offers. “IIT students used to be in huge demand earlier during the building era in the IT sector, when there was huge demand for programmer analysts. Later, the IIT students were taken up by the banking sector to build their infrastructure. Thereafter, the phase came when financial companies took them for cloud computing, to build and analyse their mathematical data. But with the banking and IT sectors saturated and stagnant, the jobs market will pick up only after the current crop moves out. Only then will the demand pick up,” Kulkarni said. The second phase of placements at IIT-B will take place in January 2017.

RQC plans to offer 'quantum cryptography’ that could propel India to the forefront of hack proof communication in sectors such as banking and national and homeland security. "We are ready to work with Indian colleagues. It (the technology) can't be bought from the United States as it deals with the government and security,” said Ruslan Yunusov, chief executive at RQC, in an interview. Established by Russia's largest global technology hub, Skolkovo in 2010, RQC conducts scientific research that could lead to a new class of technologies.These include developing 'unbreakable cryptography' for the banks and the government organisations. It also involves research in areas such as materials with superior properties and new systems for ultrasensitive imaging of the brain. The research is mostly funded by the government money. The 'Quantum cryptography' created by RQC depends more on physics, rather than mathematics. It is based on the usage of individual particles or waves of light (photon) and their intrinsic quantum properties to develop an unbreakable cryptosystem, according to TechTarget, a technology media firm. This is feasible as "it is impossible to measure the quantum state of any system without disturbing that system," according to TechTarget. Mr.Yunusov, a PhD in Physics from Lomonosov Moscow State University, said that RQC is willing to collaborate as Russia and India are part of BRICS, an association of five major emerging national economies.He also mentioned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that India is Russia's 'privileged strategic partner'. "I think if we start the work with the Indian partners, we will be supported by our governments also," he said. Banks hacked Experts say that a technology like 'quantum cryptography' is relevant at a time when hacking targets are multiplying in India as the country goes digital. Researchers in India at cybersecurity company FireEye recently discovered phishing websites created by cybercriminals that spoof 26 Indian banks in order to steal personal information from customers. In another incident, the security of about 3.2 million debit cards got compromised in the country. Technology company Yahoo too faced a huge data breach when it discovered a hacking attack dating back to 2013 that may have affected more than one billion of its user accounts. "If IT giants like 'Yahoo' are vulnerable, we can well imagine the cyber risks that banks or financial institutions can experience, with the current surge in digitisation," said Trishneet Arora, an ethical hacker and chief executive of cybersecurity startup TAC Security, in a statement. However, hacking attacks cannot only be performed using normal computers. Mr.Yunusov of RQC said that as 'quantum computers' get sufficiently powerful they would be able to easily decrypt today's internet communication. Quantum computers exist today but are experimental, small and include only few quantum bits. Companies like Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft are already working on it. This year Google announced that it is working on protecting Chrome against possible attacks of quantum computers. The search giant is doing this by deploying post-quantum cryptography in an experimental version of the browser. Quantum key distribution The traditional encryption depends on transmitting a decryption key along with the secret information. The recipient then uses that key for deciphering that secret data. But hackers can clone this key and steal the information. To address this problem the most promising application of quantum cryptography is Quantum key distribution (QKD). RQC said that two users can establish QKD session, that allows them to obtain a random private key. QKD is distinct as it encrypts this key on light particles called photons. A hacker trying to clone or read such a key would automatically change its state, due to fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. It would also leave a hacker fingerprint. This means the recipient and the transmitter can easily detect the attempts to read or intercept the information. Mr.Yunusov said the QKD solution developed by the RQC was used for establishing quantum keys between two bank offices in Moscow. RQC said the developed solution can be a central point of quantum-safe infrastructure for banks, financial and governmental institutions "ensuring absolute security of communication."

WD Blue 250GB SSD Linux Benchmarks Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 25 December 2016 at 12:39 PM EST. 6 Comments While I have owned many Western Digital hard drives over the years, last week was my first time trying out one of the company's new solid-state drives (SSDs) under Linux. Some Linux benchmark results to share for reference today are of the WD Blue 250GB (WDS250G1B0A) SATA 3.0 SSD. The WD Blue SSD line-up currently comes in 250GB / 500GB / 1TB capacities and in M.2 or 2.5-inch drive form factors. The WDS250G1B0A is the 250GB SATA 3.0 2.5-inch model. This model is rated for sequential reads up to 540MB/s, sequential writes up to 500MB/s, random reads up to 97k IOPS, random writes up to 79k IOPS and an endurance of 100 TBW. Western Digital backs their WD Blue SSDs with a three year warranty. From a technical perspective, the WD Blue SSD line-up isn't anything too exciting by modern SSDs and pretty much puts it in line with other SATA 3.0 solid-state drives from other vendors. This 250GB SATA 3.0 SSD currently retails for $78 USD on Amazon.com. For running some Linux benchmarks I compared the WD Blue 250GB SSD performance to the PNY CS1211 120GB, Toshiba/OCZ TR150 120GB, VisionTek 240GB SATA 3 SSD, Samsung 850 EVO 1200GB SSD. Then on the NVMe SSD front for reference was the Samsung 950 PRO 256GB, Samsung 960 EVO 256GB, and Intel 600p 256GB. The FIO results put this WD Blue SSD on Ubuntu Linux as performing in line with the other consumer SATA 3.0 SSDs while of course the NVMe SSDs offer much better performance at a higher cost. In some workloads the WD Blue SSD does outperform the other low-cost SSDs. You can view more results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. If you wish to compare your own Linux system's disk performance to the results in this article, simply install the Phoronix Test Suite and then run phoronix-test-suite benchmark 1612254-TA-WDSSD598276. More details on this SSD via the Amazon product page. 6 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

RQC plans to offer 'quantum cryptography’ that could propel India to the forefront of hack proof communication in sectors such as banking and national and homeland security. "We are ready to work with Indian colleagues. It (the technology) can't be bought from the United States as it deals with the government and security,” said Ruslan Yunusov, chief executive at RQC, in an interview. Established by Russia's largest global technology hub, Skolkovo in 2010, RQC conducts scientific research that could lead to a new class of technologies.These include developing 'unbreakable cryptography' for the banks and the government organisations. It also involves research in areas such as materials with superior properties and new systems for ultrasensitive imaging of the brain. The research is mostly funded by the government money. The 'Quantum cryptography' created by RQC depends more on physics, rather than mathematics. It is based on the usage of individual particles or waves of light (photon) and their intrinsic quantum properties to develop an unbreakable cryptosystem, according to TechTarget, a technology media firm. This is feasible as "it is impossible to measure the quantum state of any system without disturbing that system," according to TechTarget. Mr.Yunusov, a PhD in Physics from Lomonosov Moscow State University, said that RQC is willing to collaborate as Russia and India are part of BRICS, an association of five major emerging national economies.He also mentioned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that India is Russia's 'privileged strategic partner'. "I think if we start the work with the Indian partners, we will be supported by our governments also," he said. Banks hacked Experts say that a technology like 'quantum cryptography' is relevant at a time when hacking targets are multiplying in India as the country goes digital. Researchers in India at cybersecurity company FireEye recently discovered phishing websites created by cybercriminals that spoof 26 Indian banks in order to steal personal information from customers. In another incident, the security of about 3.2 million debit cards got compromised in the country. Technology company Yahoo too faced a huge data breach when it discovered a hacking attack dating back to 2013 that may have affected more than one billion of its user accounts. "If IT giants like 'Yahoo' are vulnerable, we can well imagine the cyber risks that banks or financial institutions can experience, with the current surge in digitisation," said Trishneet Arora, an ethical hacker and chief executive of cybersecurity startup TAC Security, in a statement. However, hacking attacks cannot only be performed using normal computers. Mr.Yunusov of RQC said that as 'quantum computers' get sufficiently powerful they would be able to easily decrypt today's internet communication. Quantum computers exist today but are experimental, small and include only few quantum bits. Companies like Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft are already working on it. This year Google announced that it is working on protecting Chrome against possible attacks of quantum computers. The search giant is doing this by deploying post-quantum cryptography in an experimental version of the browser. Quantum key distribution The traditional encryption depends on transmitting a decryption key along with the secret information. The recipient then uses that key for deciphering that secret data. But hackers can clone this key and steal the information. To address this problem the most promising application of quantum cryptography is Quantum key distribution (QKD). RQC said that two users can establish QKD session, that allows them to obtain a random private key. QKD is distinct as it encrypts this key on light particles called photons. A hacker trying to clone or read such a key would automatically change its state, due to fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. It would also leave a hacker fingerprint. This means the recipient and the transmitter can easily detect the attempts to read or intercept the information. Mr.Yunusov said the QKD solution developed by the RQC was used for establishing quantum keys between two bank offices in Moscow. RQC said the developed solution can be a central point of quantum-safe infrastructure for banks, financial and governmental institutions "ensuring absolute security of communication."

YERUSHALAYIM - According to experts in international law, the U.N. Security Council resolution that passed Friday condemning Israel’s settlement policy opens the door for international sanctions against Israel – but speaking to Yediot Achronot Sunday, Dr. Yaakov Sheinin, one of Israel’s top economists, said that it was unlikely such sanctions would be imposed any time soon. With that, he said, there needed to be a change in the attitude among international politicians about Israel, in order to ensure that the country continues to thrive economically. The resolution condemns “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem,” and expresses grave concern that continuing Israeli settlement activities are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-state solution based on the 1967 lines. It also lays the basis for sanctions against Israel, “calling upon all States to distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied since 1967.” But Sheinin does not expect that to happen in the immediate future. “With that, there could be changes in the way business is done, and Israeli exports could be harmed. We are in a slow period for international investments – the only major investment in recent years has been that of Intel’s,” which recently invested several billion dollars in revamping its Kiryat Gat fabrication plant. Among the exposed organizations are Israeli banks, most of which have branches in Yehudah and Shomron, but Sheinin does not expect the banks to close branches in the region either. In general, he does not believe that the resolution will unduly harm the economy – but it certainly won’t help. “We are barely growing the economy by 3 percent a year, but we could be growing at 5 percent, and thus we are facing huge losses. I don’t expect boycotts of Israel, but I would like investors who have alternatives to prefer investing with us, which would be more likely if we were better liked in the world. Unfortunately, the resolution will hurt us in that way.”   Filed under: Security, U.N., Yehudah and Shomron Print Email Gmail Related Israeli, PA Officials: U.S. Planned to Abstain on U.N.

For one family fitting that description, the answer is Williams Lake. "We have been here for two days," said Lin Wei as her husband Hao Geng and their two sons Weilson, 8, and William, 5, skated,  behind her on the ice that has covered Williams Lake for about a week now. The family had just finished building themselves a little igloo on the ice near the boat launch at Scout Island and agreed to have a photo taken. "My husband is from a very cold part of China so we wanted to find somewhere cold," Lin said.  "We started driving north to see what we could find and ended up here." They have been staying at the Lakeside Motel and are planning  to depart Saturday, for a destination yet to be determined. Hao is a cancer researcher and Lin works at Intel in Portland. She met her husband in Portland, she said. Other families were using the frozen lake today as well, with one father pulling his children around on sleds dragged behind an ATV and another man parasailing.           With temperatures forecasted to remain below zero, hovering in the minus teens, between Christmas and New Year's, it is anticipated that more people will be seen on the lake in the coming days.

The video was released by news websites close to the Islamic State, and the two victims identify themselves as Turkish soldiers taken hostage. One of them had been reported kidnapped by the Islamic State in Syria last year, and had been held in a prison in Raqqa, according to local media. Advertisement Turkish officials didn’t immediately comment on the video or respond to requests seeking verification of its content. The state-run news agency Anadolu reported that 31 suspected Islamic State members were detained in raids in Istanbul on Friday. Another 10 suspected members of the group couldn’t be located, it said. The footage release comes amid a rising casualty count in Syria for Turkey, which has had 35 soldiers killed since the military started a cross-border operation in August.

The video was shared by SITE Intel Group on its Twitter account, which monitors jihadist social media. Turkish authorities blocked access to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube immediately after the video became public. Access to social media websites was restored Friday morning, with noticeable slowing.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Mirai “internet of things” malware from Krebs DDoS attack goes open source 05 Oct 2016 10 Botnet, Malware Post navigation Previous: Me-OUCH! Facebook shuts accounts over image of cat wearing suit and tie Next: Unmasking Tor users with DNS by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Last week, we wrote about a DDoS attack on well-known investigative cybercrime journalist Brian Krebs. To explain. A DDoS attack is an aggressive sort of DoS attack, where DoS is short for denial of service. A DoS is a bit like getting into the queue at the station to buy a ticket for the next train, only to have a time-waster squeeze in front of you and slow you down. By the time the miscreant has asked, innocently enough, about the different sorts of ticket available, and whether it costs extra to take a bicycle, and how much longer it would take if he were to change trains in Manchester, only to walk off without buying a ticket at all… …you’ve watched your train arrive, load up with passengers, and depart without you. A DDoS attack is worse: it’s short for distributed denial of service attack, and it’s much the same thing as a DoS, except that the trouble-stirrer doesn’t show up on his own. Instead, he brings along a big posse of innocent-looking accomplices to flood the whole station with time-wasters. Genuine customers who are mixed in with the trouble-makers end up waiting far longer than usual – a problem that usually gets more and more frustrating as the backlog grows. Sophos Home Destroy malware in your sleep Learn More In the attack on Krebs’s site the crooks were able to generate an astonishing combined total of over 600 gigabits per second of time-wasting network traffic. That’s equivalent to about 60,000 fast home networks all turning their entire bandwith onto Krebs at the same time, or a whopping 600,000 regular ADSL connections at once (assuming a one megabit per second upload speed). If we assume that even a voracious reader of Krebs’s articles would use at most 10% of a home ADSL connection’s bandwidth when browsing the site, then the cost of neutralising this level of attack is the same as supporting at least six million concurrent legitimate users. The perpetrators in the mega-DDoS haven’t been identified, but the attack happened not long after Krebs outed a DDoS-for-hire service called vDOS, leading to the arrest of two young hackers in Israel. (Sophos experts Chester Wisniewski and John Shier discuss this attack, and the story behind it, in this week’s Chet Chat security podcast. [Starts at 1’08”.]) LISTEN NOW (Audio player above not working? Download MP3, listen on Soundcloud or access via iTunes.) The reason we mentioned home networks above, by the way, is that’s exactly where this attack seems to have originated. Not from malicious bot or zombie software on regular computers, as might have been the case a few years ago, but from so-called Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as routers, web cameras and perhaps even printers. If you’re surprised to hear that, don’t be. Although a typical router or webcam has just a fraction of the computing power of your laptop, it’s more than capable of filling a typical home network with outbound traffic. (After all, your powerful new laptop relies on your router to handle all that outbound traffic, so if your laptop can fill up the network connection, that’s only possible because the router can fill it on your laptop’s behalf.) Sadly, in the aftermath of the assault on Krebs, the source code of the malware used in the attack was openly published. It’s been removed from the hacking forum on which it was originally outed, but it still widely available “for research purposes” to anyone willing to look. Mirai, as the malware is known, is badly programmed and unfinished, but that doesn’t matter. It works, and it’s effective primarily because of bad programming in the very IoT devices it uses to do its dirty work. The Mirai malware package The Mirai bot, called simply bot in the source code, is written in C, and has three main components: A call-home system that connects to a command-and-control server (which could be another insecure IoT device) to download details of whom to attack, and how. A set of attack routines that can generate a range of legitimate-looking but purposeless streams of network traffic to eat away at the victim’s network capacity. A network scanner that searches randomly across the internet and tries to login in various ways to build and report a list of insecure IoT devices for the next wave of attacks. The Mirai source code package also includes a command-and-control tool, called cnc, written in Go. Cross-platform support is one of Go’s strong points: the compiler directly supports seven different computer architecures, including the 32-bit and 64-bit Intel chips in most modern laptops and servers, and the AMD and MIPS chips common in price-sensitive home IoT devices. In other words, both the attack bot and the control server can be built to run on regular computers as well as many commonly-used hardware devices. There’s a list of just over 60 built-in usernames and passwords that the Mirai bot uses to scan for other vulnerable devices; by all accounts, even this modest password dictionary is enough to find hundreds of thousands of easily-owned devices at a time. How to steal 600 Gbit/sec As we suggested above, between 60,000 and 600,000 home networks connecting simultaneously is, indeed, enough for a monster-sized attack of 600 gigabits per second. We’re disappointed, but not at all surprised, to hear that malware like Mirai has things so easy. After all, when SophosLabs researchers recently looked into a strain of malware called Mal/Miner-C, they noticed that it was widely found on network attached storage (NAS) devices from a well-known vendor. In this research, SophosLabs quickly found 7000 NAS devices that were publicly writable via the internet, using the FTP protocol, with no password at all. Of these, 5000 (more than 70%) already contained a copy of the Mal/Miner-C malware, deliberately left behind by the crooks for future malware distribution campaigns. When investigating the Miner-C malware, our researchers focused their investigation carefully. They looked only at NAS devices, only for public FTP servers with no password, and only for the presence of Mal/Miner-C. Malware such as Mirai has no such scruples when it goes looking for vulnerable devices, which is why it can quickly find hundreds of thousands of devices to abuse. Following the attack on Krebs, and his fascinating reports on what happened, he wrote that: Many readers […] asked for more information about which devices and hardware makers were [targeted by Mirai]. As it happens, this is fairly easy to tell just from looking at the list of usernames and passwords included in the Mirai source code. As you can see directly from the list above, and from a few tries with your favourite search engine, Krebs is right. Some of the entries don’t even need a search engine: username/password pairs such as root/­realtek, root/­dreambox and ubnt/­ubnt speak for themselves. But even obscure-looking credentials such as root/­7ujMko0vizxv are easily traced. And that’s just the problem with hardwired “backdoor” passwords, as we’ve pointed out many times before. Security through obscurity lasts only until someone penetrates that obscurity and shares the necessary secret, after which anyone can search for it, and so everyone knows it. What to do? If you’re a device vendor, this list is for you: Don’t use hardwired passwords. Those “secret codes” that let your own support staff get in and fix problems cheaply for forgetful users are an injury to us all, because they also let crooks get in and create problems cheaply for everyone. Don’t set default passwords. At least, don’t have default passwords that exist after the device has been set up for use. After a firmware reset, or on first bootup, prevent the device going online at all until the user has connected up directly to it and chosen unique passwords. Don’t allow unauthenticated or unencrypted protocols for inbound connections. In particular, that means no Telnet (use SSH instead), no FTP (use SFTP instead) and no web administration via HTTP (use HTTPS instead), even for connections from the internal network. Don’t open administrative connections on the outside interface by default. Most users don’t need to login from the internet, so don’t open up their devices by default for crooks to have a crack at logging in remotely. Let users opt in to remote access, instead of expecting them to remember to opt out.

Follow him on Twitter: @duckblog 10 comments on “Mirai “internet of things” malware from Krebs DDoS attack goes open source” SubSurge says: October 5, 2016 at 6:19 pm Naked Security, in your stories the INsecure devices are often highlighted; could you point us to a list or database of IoT vendors who DO take security seriously, for those of us who like to play without becoming part of the botnet? Reply Paul Ducklin says: October 6, 2016 at 12:42 am That’s tricky, at least for now… …maybe we should start trying to collect things like “official security manifestos” from various vendors. One huge part of the problem is that the IoT world is a bit like Android: even if the OEM fixes a security problem, how long until that fix percolates through all the products in the ecosystem that use that OEM’s technology in one way or another? Reply Larry M says: October 5, 2016 at 7:32 pm There’s hope. My last few AT&T U-verse VDSL modems (by Motorola, Arris, and Pace) have had unique passwords. Why have I had so many? Lots of outside line problems here, but the silly AT&T protocol requires them to change the modem first. And then I have to go through an hour of re-defining my internal networks, wi-fi parameters, static IP addresses for printers, etc. Reply Bryan says: October 6, 2016 at 9:33 pm I’ve got my fingers crossed your next modem lets you save a config file (and that the following gear is still compatible with said upload). Reply Bob Stromberg says: October 6, 2016 at 1:57 pm A very useful article. What is a device owner — for example, a homeowner — to do? How do we detect the presence of malware on one or any of our IoT devices? It would be a start to be able to tell if our home network was a source of outbound DDoS traffic.

Reply Paul Ducklin says: October 26, 2016 at 2:56 pm We’ve written about them before…first bad and then good, as they’ve tried to improve security.

from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. (EMAILWIRE.COM, December 23, 2016 ) A solid-state drive (SSD) is a kind of an electronic disk that is built out of silicon microchips and is used for data storage. It uses the same I/O interface design as hard disk drives and stores data in solid-state memory in the form of electric charge. It is made out of silicon microchips. Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and negated AND (NAND) are most commonly used storage components used in many devices. Semiconductor-based devices such as NAND have no mechanical or moving parts. This reduces the risk of failure and allows higher read and write speeds in SSDs. The number of applications of SSDs has also increased as they can withstand extreme shocks, consume less power, deliver high consistency, and can be integrated into devices that are used in harsh environments. Publisher's analysts forecast the global peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 33.24% during the period 2016-2020.

World 15:39, 24 December 2016 REUTERS Subu Kota, who pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling the material to an FBI agent posing as a Russian spy, is one of two board directors at the company, Boston-based Brainwave Science. During years of federal court proceedings, prosecutors presented evidence they said showed that between 1985 and 1990 Kota met repeatedly with a KGB agent and was part of a spy ring that made hundreds of thousands of dollars selling U.S. missile defense technology to Russian spies. Kota denied being part of a spy ring, reached a plea agreement in the biotech case and admitted to selling a sketch of a military helicopter to his co-defendant, who was later convicted of being a KGB operative, Bloomberg wrote. Flynn served more than three decades in the military and rose to become director of the Defense Intelligence Agency before he was fired by President Barack Obama in 2014 over policy disagreements. He formed a private consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, which has sought business with an array of cyber security firms and defense contractors. He began collaborating with Brainwave Science last spring.  Read alsoYahoo News: Amid 'arms race' kerfuffle, Trump releases friendly Putin letterFlynn, who has been widely criticized for close associations with Russia, has declined repeated requests during the past month to be interviewed about his company's business ties. A spokesman for the Trump transition team, Jason Miller, said in an email that Flynn has never met or spoken with Kota and that he has ended his association with Brainwave Science. In a phone interview on Thursday, Kota described his criminal charges and dealings with the KGB as misunderstandings.

FILE PHOTO | JOSEPH KANYI | NATION MEDIA GROUP  In Summary Here at home, the world famous phone-based money transfer service, M-Pesa, was launched in 2007 by Safaricom. The service has tens of millions of users in Kenya and Tanzania, where most of its clients are, and is growing experientially. Every so often, we learn of new countries that are adopting M-Pesa, including Afghanistan, South Africa, India and Romania. From the days of mainframe computers, information and communication technologies have become easy and natural for people to use. Ten years ago, to use a computer, one needed college level training. That is no longer the case. Advertisement By SAM WAMBUGU More by this Author In just a week, the world will welcome 2017 — a significant year in many ways on the technology front. It will mark a decade since most of the technology we enjoy today came to light. From Facebook, Airbnb, Kindle by Amazon, to M-Pesa, many tech toys and services were conceived a decade ago. Many of the leading tech companies emerged around 2007. These firms have changed our lives in many ways. A decade ago, Facebook, a social networking site initially confined to college students, was opened to anyone 13 years and above. It expanded rapidly to virtually all corners of the world. Ten years later, Facebook has one billion active users, almost the population of Africa. In 2007, micro-blogging site Twitter, which had been part of a broader start-up, took a different and independent turn, spreading its tentacles worldwide. Before then, twitter was simply a sound made by some birds. Now Twitter has about 317 million monthly active users. In the same year, Amazon released Kindle, a device that enables users to download and read e-books; the same year Airbnb was conceived. Here at home, the world famous phone-based money transfer service, M-Pesa, was launched in 2007 by Safaricom. The service has tens of millions of users in Kenya and Tanzania, where most of its clients are, and is growing experientially. Every so often, we learn of new countries that are adopting M-Pesa, including Afghanistan, South Africa, India and Romania. From the days of mainframe computers, information and communication technologies have become easy and natural for people to use. Ten years ago, to use a computer, one needed college level training. That is no longer the case. A 10-year-old child with only a few hours of tinkering with a phone can teach the parents some fine features of the phone. It’s like children are these days born fully-loaded with tech skills. Computers have shrunk in size from mainframes to desktops, to laptops and now to smartphones and tablets. Their power improves every so often. Just days after you acquire a new piece of technology and think you have the latest version in town, you realise you are wrong. What can we expect in the next decade, starting in 2017? Can experiences from the past 10 years help us predict the direction technology will take? To answer this question, we need to refer to Moore’s Law. In 1965, Gordon Moore postulated that the speed and power of microchips — computational processing power — would double every year without increasing its cost. Moore’s Law is not a law in the sense of, say, Newton’s laws of motion. But Intel, which has for decades been the leading maker of microprocessors, and the rest of the industry, turned the prediction into a self-fulfilling prophecy. This law has held true for the past 50 years. Going by Moore’s Law, we can expect technology to expand even to the remotest parts of the country, providing farmers, fishermen, pastoralists and blue chip companies alike with technology to make lives better, cheaper and efficient. Broadband technology will expand and become cheaper, enabling more people, especially the youth, to go online and do business across counties and countries. Continuous education will be the norm as more and more skills become replaced by technology. The workforce will have to adapt quickly to changing technology, or shape out. Thankfully, there are many online resources to keep all of us up to speed. Happy holidays, everyone! Wambugu is an informatics specialist.

Those graphs are way better than what I expected. And all this coming from an early ES underclocked chip without the proper driver support. I never expected to be so close to Intel's offerings.

It's still possible the base clock will be similar or even higher than Skylake.     draizze View Public Profile Find all posts by draizze   (#29) Lane Ancient Guru   Videocard: 2x HD7970 - EK Waterblock Processor: I7 4930K H2o EK Supremacy Mainboard: Asus X79 Deluxe Memory: G-Skill C9 2133mhz 16GB Soundcard: X-FI Titanium HD + SP2500 PSU: CM 1000W 12-25-2016, 01:54 | posts: 6,263 | Location: Switzerland The tests have been done a good time ago... as pointed in the magazine, they are not representative of the final product. theres many things to consider: board are obviously too engineer samples with bios as they are, let alone the cpu, who was clocked effectively really low. ( as stated in the article, the performance are relative to this clock speed. ). Let alone, early ES samples like that can even got some little things, here and there disabled. We dont have the individual numbers, so hard to see in what softwares and games, they are close, faster or slower. And when i see the result on a system like that, at thoses clock speed, im really surprised in good. Its a 8cores, so turbo boost will have some limitations, 4 cores could been clocked even way higher then on the final products.

BUT the price will be everything and i don't think that until winter next year we will get a good price. Still we may hope and pray :p (i don't think AMD will go under 25% of what Intel has toady). And as long as consoles only use 8 core few games will be optimize for more ! So only for a work station you will need more. My opinion. Still at the moment welcome back AMD ! Still got a new I6700k (@260 Euro) after i won a new MAXIMUM RANGER VIII and a 16 GB ram DDR4. So will have to wait some time for the next gen CPU's until i will upgrade again (i wanted to get a ZEN to last for a few year ( ) but my money is scares so free MB and memory made my choice. I'm not that optimistic about AMD prices.

If AMD can manage to sell Zen cpu's for less than 400 US$, than AMD can and will have a great success with Zen, otherwise I think that they will miss this great chance for a comeback from surviving corporation to a successful corporation.     robintson View Public Profile Find all posts by robintson   (#42) robintson Member Guru     Videocard: GTX980M@1261gpu5508vram Processor: i74860HQ@3.57GHz Mainboard: Asus_G751JY Memory: 32GBDDR3_1600MHzCAS10_1T Soundcard: Creative X-Fi HD USB PSU: DeltaElectronicsADP-230EB 12-25-2016, 20:54 | posts: 63 Quote: Originally Posted by kastriot Well @3.7GHz would be only 10% slower than 6900K so if final cpu-s can oc up to say 4GHz it would be win depending how much it will cost now that's tricky part, if it's only 10-15% cheaper than intel equivalent then i guess Amd is in big trouble but time will tell..

Well tbh if this is close to skylake in ipc then it is way faster then mine or yours clock for clock. Sky lake is in the end quite a bit faster then similarly clocked ivys or sandys. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sx1kLGVAF0 Is maybe the best comparison I've seen regarding similar cpu performance on same clocks.     Ryu5uzaku View Public Profile Find all posts by Ryu5uzaku   (#47) Lane Ancient Guru   Videocard: 2x HD7970 - EK Waterblock Processor: I7 4930K H2o EK Supremacy Mainboard: Asus X79 Deluxe Memory: G-Skill C9 2133mhz 16GB Soundcard: X-FI Titanium HD + SP2500 PSU: CM 1000W 12-26-2016, 14:29 | posts: 6,263 | Location: Switzerland Guys, you jump fast on price and performance, based on this test ( who is not and was not intended as a review, but for compare the evolution of multiple architectures ( including the seven generations of Intel cores. ) - ES Samples with extremely low clock ( specially on turbo boost as said in the french newspapers ), we dont have the clock, but we cant even know if it was run at 3.2 ghz on games. ) early AO samples, can mean even some parts are disabled. ( turbo not working as intended etc, senseMI features etc ). - We dont know the scaling of clock vs performance. ( is 100mhz on Intel mean 100mhz on Zen ? ) - Beta motherboard, with test bios ( as mentionned in the article ). - We dont have individual numbers, so its impossible to know if the results are close, far, better and in what case, softwares, games. So by all mean there, what you have is hardly more than a minimum. If you want to compare IPC, we will need clock to clock tests in different scenarios. Some professional benchmark suite ( as 3Dmax 2015) are not forcibly yet completely optimized anyway and dont forcibly represent the 3Dmax 2017 performance same goes for other softwares.

So you could start with a 8 core and move up to a 12 core when necessary. He also mentioned that the socket is going to be circular in the final build - you'll be able to turn it like a screw to unlock higher frequencies...

Honestly given these results and what we know about the final clockspeeds (base being 3.4) I'd think $500 is a good deal. I was personally getting ready to drop a $1000 on a 8 core Intel but I waited to see what Zen could do. For me the performance looks close enough that I'd rather give AMD the money. Even if Intel drops prices to match AMD, as long as Zen is within a few % I'll sacrifice it for the cause. Tired of Intel tbh.

Companies cut hiring costs since referral hires take less time, start the job quicker, and stay at companies longer. The referral hires themselves report higher levels of satisfaction. And the original employee who did the referring often gets a nice cash bonus and a new work friend.  It's a nice, closed-loop system that works out well for everyone—that is, unless you don't have the right network to get the job. Referral hiring isn't great for diversity. "Referral networks can lead to lesser diversity or—to put it another way—exacerbate between-group inequality," said Ian Schmutte, an economics professor at the University of Georgia. "It's very clear that people who get referrals tend to get referrals of the same race, gender, ethnic group, or national origin." Schmutte's research has found that people tend to look to their social circles for referral hiring. Those groups are often made up of similar people, a phenomenon known as homophily. Using a data set from Boston that matches individuals to both their home and work locations, Schmutte found that a pair of workers living in the same block are three times more likely to work at the same company than a pair of workers living in the same neighborhood. These effects are stronger for workers of the same race and the same gender.  It's not just a matter of valuing diversity for its own sake. Companies with more diverse workforces tend to perform better. A McKinsey report from 2015 found that among 366 companies, those with gender diversity outperform those without it by 15 percent; those with ethnic diversity outperform those without it by 35 percent. For every 10 percent increase in racial and ethnic diversity on the senior executive team at a U.S. company, earnings before interest and taxes rise 0.8 percent, the report found. As a result of findings like these, organizations spend millions of dollars on inclusion programs, which largely don't work. For all the talk of diversity, companies love referral programs, which are, perhaps unwittingly, hurting their chances of diversifying workplaces. John Sullivan, a professor of management at San Francisco State University and an expert in human-resources strategy, has called referrals a "powerful" way to build a competitive workforce. It's cheap and leads to better hires. What better way to market a company than through an enthusiastic review of a current employee?  But many of the companies that rely most on employee referrals for hiring also have alleged commitments to diversity that they fail to meet. Palantir got in trouble with the federal Labor Department for relying too heavily on referral hiring, which has led to a homogenization of its workforce. Google, Facebook, and Twitter all landed on a recent Glassdoor list of the top 30 companies that use referrals for hiring and have had a hard time hiring non-white and non-Asian male workers. Google, for example, pledged just under $1 million to a nonprofit group that teaches technical skills to black and Latino college students. Facebook, in an attempt to move its numbers, altered the recruiting process to incentivize hiring for diversity; recruiters would get more points for diversity hires, which lead to better performances reviews, bonuses, and raises. These efforts haven't worked. Only 4 percent of Facebook's U.S. employees are Hispanic and 2 percent are black, as of summer 2016—and those numbers haven't moved in two years. Google's staff is now 69 percent male, down from 70 percent male a year ago, according to its own diversity report.  Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email.

"Social interactions provide information that is useful to firms that are trying to screen workers for jobs where the skill set is not that obvious or easy. You want to know: Is somebody going to show up to work? Are they going to be a good worker?" Schmutte said. "But because they operate along lines of race or ethnicity, they might still block people off from certain types of jobs."  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
