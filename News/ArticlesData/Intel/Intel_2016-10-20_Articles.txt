Are Intel's modems to blame for poor iPhone 7 Plus network reception? by Joe Roberts 21 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments New York-based research firm Cellular Insights, has blamed Intel modems for poor data connections on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple used Intel's modems in iPhone 7 Plus models sold outside of China, Japan and the US, while phones sold in those countries come with modems made by Qualcomm. Cellular Insights conducted tests using networking equipment which showed iPhone 7 Plus models with both Qualcomm and Intel modems provided similar network performance under ideal conditions. Related: iPhone 7 But, as network conditions deteriorated, iPhone 7 models with Intel modems performed poorer than their Qualcomm-powered counterparts. As the research states: "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem." This is the first time in five years that Apple has used a supplier other than Qualcomm for its handsets' modems, with Intel gaining a big client for its cellular modem business at a crucial time. The report continues: "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. "Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the US only, we cannot imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor." In the tests, the Intel-based iPhone 7 Plus models yielded results that were at least 30% worse than the Qualcomm models, and in some cases there was a gap as large as 75%. The upshot is that the Intel phones will have poorer 4G reception than the Qualcomm versions, as well as slower download and upload speeds. For those interested in the technical details, here's Cellular Insight's wording: "At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. "As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical." If nothing else, the research is a reminder that, as the report puts it "OEM's implementation of baseband, RF front-end and the antenna design could play its role" in poor network reception, and network providers aren't always to blame.

The feature is only available on MacBook Pros that have two graphics processing units (GPU). The reason it only exists on certain models of the MacBook Pro is not all Macs have dual GPUs, and the desktop Macs that do don’t need a low power mode since they don’t rely on batteries and are connected to a power source all the time. How to tell if you have dual GPUs You can tell if you have two GPUs by going to  → About this Mac → System Report → Graphics/Displays on your Mac. As you can see from my report, my 2012 15” MacBook Pro with Retina display has both an AMD Radeon M9 graphics card and the Intel Iris Pro integrated graphics: If you only see one graphics source in this list, it means you don’t have two graphics processing units. More than likely this is going to be the case if you have a lower end MacBook Pro. You might see some variant of Intel integrated graphics, whether it’s the Intel Iris Pro or Intel HD graphics. How Automatic Graphics Switching works Automatic Graphics Switching is a great feature because it helps give your Apple notebook phenomenal battery life. Without this feature, your power-hungry discreet graphics card would slide your battery life to a fraction of the time it lasts right now. Thanks to powerful software in your Mac, macOS is capable of detecting when your computer needs more graphical horsepower and it can seamlessly switch over to the discreet graphics card if you’re doing something graphic intensive, such as gaming. When you’re done, it moves back to the integrated graphics source to save power. When it does, your computer not only uses less juice, but it also runs much cooler and the fans will be quieter as they won’t have to spin so quickly to keep the machine cooler. Depending on how you use your MacBook Pro on a daily basis, you may or may not need to utilize the Automatic Graphics Switching setting. If you’re always tethered to a power source, then you might not care as much about the power efficiency of your MacBook Pro. This is typically the case with gamers who want the best graphical performance. These users don’t need Automatic Graphics Switching as much as a typical user and can let the computer run off of the discreet graphics card all the time because they’re typically connected to a power source to keep their game playing from killing their computer too quickly. On the other hand, if you want to turn it on to conserve power for an on-the-go lifestyle, like most people buy notebooks for, then this option should be important to you because you won’t want to waste battery life by using your discreet graphics card to render normal macOS interfaces and view video playback when you don’t need that kind of horsepower to drive that stuff. How to toggle Automatic Graphics Switching on or off To toggle Automatic Graphics Switching on or off, follow these simple steps: 1) Launch the System Preferences app on your Mac and open the Energy Saver preference pane. 2) Locate the Automatic Graphics Switching checkbox at the top of the preferences pan you see and add a check mark to toggle it on, or remove the check mark to toggle it off. The changes are going to take effect immediately after you make your choice. You don’t need to restart your computer. What did I just do? If you turned the feature off, then you’ve just made it so your Mac can utilize the high power discreet graphics card 100% of the time rather than using the power-sipping integrated graphics. Conversely, if you just turned the feature on, then your Mac can now save energy when it doesn’t need the high power graphics by switching to the low power graphics source instead, and this will yield improved battery life.

I’ve heard that the adhesive in the ipod that holds the battery is really difficult to get off among other things. leart terrible thing. have to remove everything ,, tons of screws … adhesive… and for the best, the battery is soldered on a very delicate place that if heated to much it’s damaged forever lol.. just changed the battery on one of my iphone 4.. it had 1100 cycles lol, in 3 minutes… 4/4s probably have the best quality build ever for a mobile phone leart https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/59f2d1bced5bfc9b1e87af2b50e9ddb42fdf5581410a74860b2060438c3f9647.jpg Chris Owen 1,100 cycles wow lol. I agree the 4/4s was like brick that you couldn’t break lol leart 1100 cycles and still it was at 70-75% of designed battery life… a beast lol Chris Owen Man… lol Y2J: Keeper of the List Ah, glorious days leart sadly nothing is working on older firmwares anymore, that device was on 2.2.1.. even iTunes and AppStore was crashing lol 3.1.3 and up are still fine Mr_Coldharbour When everything about Apple and jailbreaking was intriguing. Now it’s all lost its flair. leart yeah… glorious days… that magic it lasted till iOS 6 i guess… obada I have a 2014 13″ Macbook Pro Retina and I don’t have dual graphics. What’s the deal here? Anthony Bouchard The option is only available on higher-end MacBook Pros, as noted in the post. I have the more expensive 15″ model. obada so bigger screen = “higher-end”?? Okay… Anthony Bouchard You can research Apple’s model lineup and specs here: http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ Daniel Waske Is there any way to disable the dGPU entirely? I’m asking because since Sierra even Apps like coconutBattery make my 2010 15″ MBP switch to the dGPU for no reason… Mr_Coldharbour You’re welcome. As for manually switching to the integrated GPU, if you only have one GPU then the app is rendered redundant because your Mac already has the one GPU which is already in itself power-efficient. Those apps / tools are made for those with multiple GPUs, hence the manual switching. I know that this is something everyone dreads, but have you considered restoring your HDD/SSD and starting over a fresh clean install of whatever current OS you have if you haven’t already done one recently? I hear Chrome (and flash – not to mention it’s unsafe for your system) is brutal on battery life on the majority of websites particularly those with video content probably have already switched to HTML5 so if you use Safari and you’re on OS 10.9.X Mavericks at the very least you should enjoy most websites flash-free which will be very lenient on battery life. Or stick with Opera or Firefox, but Chrome I hear and read is not the most battery-friendly web browser. And speaking of battery calibration, weekly calibrations is way too much, it is recommended no more than once a month. The idea is to have as little as charge cycles as possible. No need to obsess over it though. If you average about 80-100 charge cycles per year you’re good. Slightly more is not an issue but if you’re reaching the red every other day or every day then you’re wearing your battery out. As I said, if you work a lot from home or the same place and that Mac doesn’t go anywhere much, you game a lot, watch lots of videos, connecting to external displays, graphics intensive work or just overall your Mac is sitting on a desk and you work from that desk most of the time then leave it plugged in so long as you’re working from there and when you’re done unplug of course. Work from battery power about once a week. They say the battery is “happiest” when in the 20% to 80% range. Just as a reference, the MBP’s battery will retain about 80% of its overall health when it’s reached 1000 charge cycles. I hope this helps. e brake Thanks for the reply! And I guess the only option is for me to keep my MacBook Pro running optimal until the decision of upgrading becomes a possibility. I’m highly interested in the line up of new devices Apple debued last week. I restored my hdd earlier in the year, same time around when I used keystrokes to reset the pram and other settings. Lately I’ve seen my memory usage running a little higher in idle mode if you will so I’m currently looking into that as well. Usually if Opera is open and I’m casually navigating the web with a couple of open tabs my cpu usage would be around 8-12%, which is roughly 2-3gb of memory. Now it’s between a 4-4.5gb of memory with only one open app. I’ve obtain a couple of system defragmenter apps and already my memory usuage decreased to the normal limits. I’ve noticed that to maintain equipment or anything you intend to preserve and expect performance from, you need to do routine maintenance and become more familiar with the device/component to a strong sense to know how it’s suppose to operate the way you want it to.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Daily Deals: $30 off Sony PlayStation 4 Pro, $70 off Beats Solo3 headphones, and more Apple seeds watchOS 3.1.1 beta 3 to developers Beloved butt-looking peach emoji is back in iOS 10.2 beta 3, looks even more like a butt Jony Ive discusses 20 years of iconic Apple designs and that pricey new coffee table book Apple removed nearly 50,000 apps from App Store in October   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

The combination of a premium build, unmatched system performance, and tightly integrated software and services delivers what’s considered to be the gold standard in smartphone user experience. Over the past five years, Apple’s modem supplier was Qualcomm, but this year, Apple has taken a different approach with the decision to source two instead of one baseband chipset suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel. This created two distinct RF SKUs, one limited to GSM/WCDMA/LTE support (A1778, A1784), powered by Intel’s modem, and one with GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE support (A1660, A1661) powered by Qualcomm’s modem.  On the one hand, most high-end flagship devices launched this year are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820, with X12 Category 12 integrated modem (MDM9645M discrete part). The X12 modem is capable of up to 600Mbps peak downlink speeds, 3-Way Carrier Aggregation with 256 QAM, and also 4×4 MIMO on a single component carrier. Note that it is up to the smartphone manufacturers to decide which of these powerful capabilities will be integrated into their final product. The Verizon, Sprint and SIM Unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus variants are powered by Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, accompanied by two transceivers: WTR3925 and WTR4905. Out of all supported features by Qualcomm’s solution, Apple has chosen to implement 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink for contiguous Band 7 or Band 41. Higher Order Modulation (DL-256QAM, UL-64QAM), and Higher Order MIMO (4×4 MIMO) have not been implemented. Therefore, the peak theoretical downlink speeds are limited to 450Mbps when aggregating three 20MHz wide LTE component carriers. We have achieved the maximum 450Mbps by aggregating 20MHz wide Band 20, Band 1, and Band 7. EVS (Enhanced Voice Services), also known as Ultra HD Voice, offers significantly improved audio quality, numerous efficiencies at the physical and IP layer, and is fully supported by Qualcomm’s modem. However, Apple has made a decision to disable this feature likely to level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel varaints. On the other hand, the iPhone 7 represents Intel’s first major design win in a long time. In many ways this iPhone appears to be Intel’s make or break it in the cellular modem business. Similar to Samsung’s in house Shannon LTE modem found in Exynos based devices, Intel has decided to license CEVA DSP cores for the XMM7360 modem coupled with in-house SMARTi 5 RF Transceivers and X-PMU 736 RF Power Management. The Intel XMM7360 modem also supports 3-Way Carrier Aggregation on the downlink and 2-Way Carrier Aggregation on the uplink, but lacks support for EVS, DL-256QAM/UL-64QAM, 4×4 MIMO. Ironically, mobile operators such as T-Mobile USA and Telstra which have been offering these advanced LTE features, are being supplied with the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem. While there haven’t been a shortage of iPhone 7 unboxing videos, subjective camera reviews, and more, we have been hard pressed to find any meaningful mention of cellular performance. This goes for any other flagship device on the market. In this day and age with mobile internet consumption at the all time high, we believe that a mobile device is only as good as its ability to seamlessly connect and maintain its connectivity with the mobile network. Most of the time mobile operators get blamed for dropped calls or session timeouts, but it’s often forgotten that the phone OEMs implementation of baseband, RF Front-End (RFFE), and the antenna design could play its role. We have been using the Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) CMWflexx setup containing two R&S CMW500 and one R&S CMWC controller, as well as the R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box with four Vivaldi antennas. This study has been done entirely independently, and Cellular Insights takes full responsibility for the analysis and opinions in this report. We have self-funded the procurement of iPhone 7 Plus units through commercial retail channels. All units have been preloaded with the latest version of iOS (10.0.3) Consistent with our previous reviews, our focus has been on measuring the highest achievable LTE throughput in clean channel state, starting at RSRP value of -85dBm, and incrementally reducing radiated power level while maintaining Block Error Rate (BLER) under 2%. This allows us to measure RF sensitivity of the device under test while eliminating inter-cell interference and fully controlling the radiated environment. This also allows for high reproducibility and consistency of our tests, and takes into account the performance of the entire RFFE subsystem.  We’ve tested three unique LTE frequency bands, Band 12 (10MHz), Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO configuration using Transmission Mode 4. While both devices achieved the maximum sustained data rates at the cell center, simulating edge of cell scenarios by reducing power level did cause each iPhone to display two very different personalities. As the device attaches to eNodeB, it reports its LTE capability. To get this out of the way, 4×4 MIMO and 256QAM features are not supported on the iPhone 7 Plus. FDD LTE Band 12 is part of the lower 700MHz band plan, covering 15 MHz of contiguous spectrum across three blocks (A, B, C). Most LTE Band 12 deployments are either 5 MHz or 10 MHz wide even though Band 12 can theoretically be deployed up to 15 MHz widths. Coincidentally, LTE Band 12 capable devices are only certified to support up to 10 MHz operation. As opposed to mid and high band spectrum, low frequency such as 700MHz Band 12 can propagate further, penetrate the concrete structure better, and often times is the only LTE layer reaching the device. For this particular reason, high sensitivity of a smartphone receiver is extremely important in challenging signal conditions, and it could make a difference between completing and dropping a VoLTE call. Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. We are hoping that this sudden dip in performance at a specific RSRP value will be further investigated by the engineering and hopefully resolved. At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant.  Band 4 is the most commonly deployed LTE spectrum band in North America, while Band 7 deployments are spread across the rest of the globe. Mid and high spectrum bands are used to densify LTE networks and provide incremental capacity. Just like during our Band 12 tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem continues to struggle even at relatively higher RSRP values with unexplainable sharp dips in performance. The gap between the two variants is consistent and north of 30% again in favor of the Qualcomm variant. To put this into perspective, we have compared the edge of cell performance of a few other flagship devices to see how these iPhones compare in less than favorable conditions In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem. We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple’s decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone. Considering that the iPhone with the Qualcomm modem is being sold in China, Japan and in the United States only, we can not imagine that modem performance was a deciding factor. When all said and done, the iPhone 7 Plus is a beautifully designed smartphone, with arguably the best-in-class camera and system performance. It’s also the best iPhone ever. We hope that next year’s iPhone delivers best-in-class LTE performance.  banner 25 prev postSamsung Galaxy S7, the first 4×4 MIMO smartphone Milan M.P. view all post Leave a comment Comments (72) Reviewer • 4 weeks ago This is a great article.

I know of reports on AT&T and Sprint, and some European carriers--in UK I think. Many, but not all, report 10.0.3 or 10.1 fixed this. reply alex logvin • 4 weeks ago Excellent article, Milan! Love the charts. reply Georgi Dimitrov • 3 weeks ago It would have been an excellent one, if power measurements have been conducted too. Without it, it's nothing more than politics. reply Travis • 4 weeks ago Yes please review the Pixel radio compared to other phones. Out of all the reviews I have seen online for the Pixel no one actually reviewed the "phone". After all we demand these devices work well when no WiFi is around. reply Thomas Anderson • 4 weeks ago Please do not review Google Pixel. I don't care the result of it. Thank you. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Please dont read the article on the Pixel. Thank you reply John • 4 weeks ago Any way to determine which variant is in my personal iPhone 7 plus? reply Steven H. • 4 weeks ago Yes, easily. The article noted which carriers are selling the one with the Qualcomm modem. If you bought it outright, was it for use on one of those carriers? reply Holger • 4 weeks ago The model number of your iPhone is printed on the back of the device. reply Brian B. • 4 weeks ago You can also find the model number by going to Settings > General > Regulatory. reply ilikemyprivacy • 4 weeks ago A few thoughts: 1. Thanks for doing this, so little information available on RF performance of phones which is so critical for performance, battery life, etc. 2. I would be interested to see you rerun this test with the iOS 10 Beta. The latest beta includes modem firmware 1.25.00 on the Qualcomm version which seems to help significantly with a variety of issues 3. If possible, it'd be great to look at a comparison for other RF front end features like envelope tracking, antenna tuning, etc. between the Intel and Qualcomm models as we.. reply Walt French • 4 weeks ago Great article; thanks. Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see in the article what features in the new Intel modem differed from the 6S's MDM9635M. As the comparison chart makes the two parts look very similar, what appears is that the 9645's new features are (today) a year ahead of the 9635 and the Intel part. reply Marcus • 4 weeks ago My question is the one with the Qualacom modem vs Intel was there any correlation between battery life too? If the qualacom works better does it use more battery power based on tests than the Intel. Just trying to gage it if i do decide to purchase a iPhone 7 reply Flash • 4 weeks ago Thanks for sharing. Was this test conducted using the latest update iOS 10.0.3 which includes a fix for a bug that could cause issues with cellular connectivity, a problem that only affected the new iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus? Thanks. reply Dazza • 4 weeks ago Yes. It says so in the article reply Tom • 4 weeks ago Great article, I really liked your introduction paragraph! reply Maxwell • 4 weeks ago Can you do a review on the ZTE Axon 7 signal strength and LTE performance please and thank you reply Prasad • 4 weeks ago Marcus, Assume you are downloading a file that is 70MB in size. If your iPhone with Qualcomm chip downloads this in half the time, it will be able to go to sleep that much faster. It is not necessary that the performance is obtained at the cost of power. reply VP • 4 weeks ago So if this is the case my iPhone 7 Plus purchased thru T-Mobile should not have any Verizon or Sprint connectivity. However when accessing carrier in settings it scans for available networks & finds T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon & Sprint. It should not be possible due to hardware limitations. I couldn't get mine on release day even with pre-order. Could the demand & backlog have prompted Apple to add Qualcomm modems to all models? reply WiWavelength • 4 weeks ago VP, the available network scan on your 3GPP only baseband is detecting the LTE networks for VZW and Sprint, not their CDMA2000 networks. The latter use PRL based network selection, not user initiated network selection. AJ reply Eric • 4 weeks ago It would be great if you could provide a picture of the test setup. reply Yang • 4 weeks ago Without testing environment and setup specified, this type of comparison is less meaningful reply Jupiter Antunes • 4 weeks ago One important point must be kept in the picture, not only the modems makes the differences but the Antenna with the Modems. One significant information should be the Return Loss of the antenna scanning the channels in a Band. If a LAB is reading this could do it for us... thanks. reply Ehsan • 4 weeks ago Qualcomm should ask Apple for "Qualcomm Inside" sticker on the phones with Q chip. reply no • 4 weeks ago no reply Joe • 4 weeks ago If you swapped an Intel variant iPhone out at the Apple Store under warranty, would they supply you with another Intel or do they use the Qualcomm version for warranty replacements? reply Justin • 4 weeks ago Whenever you turn in a warranty claim, most likely you will receive a refurbished unit. Not a brand new one when you first buy/order. I would return it under the 30 day window and purchase another one personally. Although the phone is new, you could still potentially get a refurb reply Robert • 4 weeks ago It wold be interesting to see how the two different transceiver (RF + modem) compare in case of carrier aggregation that are in harmonic relationship, such as B12 as the primary carrier transmitting at 710 MHz and B4 as the secondary carrier with receive frequency at 2130. In this case the 3rd harmonic of the B12 transmitter lands right in B4 receiver thus potentially de-sensing it and degrading the throughput when the B12 TX power is high (cell-edge scenario). reply Ed • 4 weeks ago I am still waiting for Anandtech to do their digging. And offering some explanation to why. The Intel Modem is based on TSMC 28nm. Qualcomm X12 is on 20nm. ( Only the X16 is on 14nm FinET I believe ). X12 is / could be even better then the coming Intel offering 7480, which is STILL manufactured by TSMC. Why did Apple decide to use the newer X12 when they know the older MDM9635 was enough compared to Intel's 7360? Not supporting 4x4 MIMO in X12 was a rather simple decision because less then 10% of the network in the world support it, and no phone has yet to manage 4x4 MIMO inside. A some other details like X12 wasn't a true 4x4 MIMO and require separate chip to do so, while X16 is a true 4x4 MIMO. And I am pretty sure an Software update could make EVS possible. Whether or not they will do it is entirely different matter. What cost / patent issues are involved? reply Luka • 4 weeks ago How it could be achived more than 150M for SGS7edge on one carrier Band4? reply PD • 4 weeks ago 4X4 MIMO reply R • 4 weeks ago 2X2 MiMo single carrier using 64QAM is 75Mbps x 2... 150Mbps and 3CA with same config is 150Mbps x 3 giving 450Mbps peak.... too bad Apple did not use 256QAM! reply Luka • 3 weeks ago Then I would expect more than 180Mbps reply Bjoern • 4 weeks ago Nice rewiew, and measurements on the poewer drawn by both modules when performing differently? reply Mark • 4 weeks ago This is a great article. I happen to live in an area that gets marginal reception but I never knew it because I had a Nokia 928 from Verizon. When i finally had to trade it in after a couple of years, I tried the iphone 6S and found the reception to be horrible. I traded it in for a Galaxy S6 and was told "no more trades" so I was forced to keep it. That also had horrible reception at my house. My signal varies from -105 to -115 and calls constantly get dropped. My girlfriends Galaxy S5 worked great at my house and I took that as a sign as the antenna design changing in the Galaxies between the S5 and the S6...which I found to be true. When her phone was ready for replacement I searched around and found no bad things were said about the HTC10 reception. At my encouragement, she got the HTC 10 and gets great reception at my house. I have been searching for some sort of articles on antenna testing and this report is just what I was looking for. I would, however, like to see a wider range of phones tested. It would be interesting to see how that HTC10 does against the iphone and galaxy. And, I would also like to see how the new Droid Z and the Pixel fare. thank you again reply Alexander • 4 weeks ago Thank you for your effort, Milan. It would be nice to see the error bars on the graphs and the statistical comparison for the low signal LTE examples. Given the low average current networks speed limits (9-40 Gbs) it would be crucial to magnify graphs accordingly. I am going to use my phone mostly on the European GSM networks, so having A1661 with CDMA capability would not grant automatic CDMA network switch with European sim or ...?And of course after all it would be nice to prove the efficiency of your 30% discrepancy in real world or close to real world situation...What would be battery impact? reply John • 4 weeks ago The disabling of HD Voice - is it permanently disabled or is that a function that Apple could enable in the future? reply Adam • 4 weeks ago Lab test isn't field test. If you do field test,the results are almost same. reply Darrell Brand • 4 weeks ago Just called Apple and mentioned my concerns- I bought my iPhone 7 unlocked and no plan Apple has no response. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago The SIM unlocked version is the Qualcomm modem, according to the article. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago Only Qualcomm in the US and a couple of other places, it's Intel in Europe (1778 model is supplied as the unlocked one). reply JohnL • 4 weeks ago What was the modem firmware used in the tests please? Also IMHO worth repeating in 3-4 months to see if Intel have made significant improvements to a young product.. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago I note 10.1 updates the modem firmware (Intel model) from 10.0.3's version 1.00.05 to 1.01..13, which seems like quite a bit. I don't know what was in 10.0.2 I'm afraid. reply JohnL • 2 weeks ago 10.1.1 takes it to 1.1.15 reply Jacq • 4 weeks ago This article made for great reading. A couple of things I would be interested in seeing in the future articles. 1. Testing this on Google's Pixel device along with every major flagship release. This is information that would influence a purchase decision. I also from daily use between the 5x and 6p felt the 5x was horrible and which you tested the 6p's signal as well, 2, Was there a measure of power consumption at the different signal strength between the two chipsets? Wondering if this affected the performance as well. Thanks - JSH reply Alessia Campoli • 4 weeks ago Good to see that iPhone 7 will be IP67 waterproof! When concerning about the waterproof function of mobile, I found an very interesting video about it. On this video, they drop VKworld T1 Plus, a budget 6.0-inch smartphone to the mud and clean it directly with water for long time, that is unbelivalble. reply VG • 4 weeks ago Even if you leave apart the intel vs qualcomm modem differences, the article clearly tells that SD 820 based devices will have far better connectivity as compared to any iPhone7 reply AP • 3 weeks ago If I'm on the AT&T network, is there anyway to check if I'm getting a Qualcomm version before I purchase/open the box? reply Alexis • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. The ATT model uses the Intel modem. If you want the qualcomm then buy a unlocked version reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago My research indicates that there is no AT&T Qualcomm phone available. I am looking into the SIM unlocked Qualcomm version for use on AT&T. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago I live in Tokyo and use KDDI Au. I can't find out which model they are using. AU shops say "it might be either, but you can't tell until purchasing and opening the box to look." All the floor models I've seen have the model number with the Intel chip though. I'm wondering how much of an issue this is and if I should upgrade my iPhone 6 Plus now. reply karyn • 3 weeks ago the model number is written on the outside of the box. You could read it without breaking the seal or opening the box. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago You're right! I can see that on the back of my iPhone 6 Plus box. That precludes being able to upgrade online, but perhaps I can do that in a store. Assuming there is even more than one model sold here in Japan for AU. I still haven't been able to confirm that yet. reply Kari • 3 weeks ago Let's wait a little and see what's Apple's response is, before jumping into conclusions. reply Doug Lerner • 3 weeks ago Actually, it turns out that the model sold here in Japan is neither the A1784 nor the A1661. For the iPhone 7 Plus it is the A1785. The details are at http://www.apple.com/jp/iphone-7/specs/ but the modem supports the following: FDD-LTE（バンド1、2、3、4、5、7、8、11、12、13、17、18、19、20、21、25、26、27、28、29、30） TD-LTE（バンド38、39、40、41） TD-SCDMA 1,900（F）、2,000（A） CDMA EV-DO Rev. A（800、1,900、2,100MHz） UMTS/HSPA+/DC-HSDPA（850、900、1,700/2,100、1,900、2,100MHz） GSM/EDGE（850、900、1,800、1,900MHz） I don't know if that means it's Qualcomm or Intel. The Japan model also supports FeliCa, which allows people to use it like Suica/Pasmo cards to ride the trains and subways. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago it's a qualcomm variant, not intel. reply Pei • 3 weeks ago this article has been seen in China. Only Qualcomm variants are sold here. Many apple users are not satisfied with APPLE because iPhone is expensive while Apple used a bad modem. reply JohnD • 3 weeks ago All devices with qualcomm have issues in the field. Lab vs field tests are completely different. The mobility tells how feasible a device is. Not speaking about the fact that in real NW the eNB will never give yous such a bandwidth. I really don't understand why you people struggle to have in the pocket the newest devices on the market... reply ElmCha • 3 weeks ago All Qualcomm devices have problems in the field? How so? Kindly elaborate. reply Alexhander • 3 weeks ago Great article! Very nicely detailed and accurate information based on the currently released iPhones. reply salman Khan • 3 weeks ago Both intel and Qualcomm modems are capable of supporting more than 400Mbps.if LTE network give them enough resources. and channel conditions are good. This means that performance of the intel modem may not be limitation here. It depends on test conditions, transport protocol parameters, both mobiles (Qualcomm and Intel) exact locations and many other factors. As a user, I dont care much if my downloading speed is 150Mpbs or 140Mpbs because I rarely run any application on my mobile phone that requires this much high data rate on my mobile(HD video stream needs few Mpbs speed). But I would be more interested in power comparison and battery life with these two modems. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago My burning question is whether the inferior Intel modem I would get in my AT&T 7 Plus would also have inferior receptivity to my AT&T iPhone 6. If so, I will wait to upgrade until the 8. I already have spotty reception at home with my 6 and I can't afford to make it worse. Is there already a way to compare this or does it require a new test? Thanks. reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I posted a question here that was held up for curation and then disappeared. It seemed perfectly harmless. What happened? reply Bob H • 3 weeks ago I had a chance to answer my question by doing a field test on my 6 at home and learning I was getting a reading of -114 in most places, and then bringing home a 7 Plus (with the inferior Intel modem) and getting readings between -108 and -112. Glad to learn that "inferior" doesn't mean worse than a 6, in my location at least, so I'll keep the 7 Plus. reply landoncube • 3 weeks ago Could you repeat the testing now that iOS 10.1 has been released? I have an A1784 iPhone 7 plus. reply JohnL • 3 weeks ago It is depressing how much my 1778 is slower than my 5s for LTE. A quick 4G test (or few) this evening gives 65.7MB/s down/14.1 up for the 5s and 60.0/6.5 for the 7... Plus I only tested it as I'd seen a trend so this wasn't a one-off. A bigger concern is the 5s holds onto a 4G signal much better, the 7 does like to be on 3G (iOS 10.1). reply Jos • 1 week ago There is a very interesting article about phone reception quality. Its writen by professor Gert Frølund Pedersen, from Denmark's Aalborg University. The direct link to the PDF: http://www.pts.se/upload/Rapporter/Tele/2016/MobilephoneTest2016-augusti-2016.pdf I ran some tests myself on the 3 Belgian providers. Reception quality inside my house is very bad where I live (bad coverage) with signal levels between -95 and -113 dBm. By the way, I'm an engineer and have quite some RF knowledge. Tested with a brand new iPhone 7 (Intel modem), iPhone SE, Nexus 5, Lumia 925 and Lumia 800 (both Lumia's are still Nokia design, not Microsoft). Tests are pure subjective, on different places in my house with all the phones and swapping SIM cards every time. With a signal of -95 dBm, the iPhone 7 often doesn't receive or can't make calls and text messages can't be send. More or less the same story with the iPhone SE. The Lumia's perform the best, the Nexus 5 sits between them. The Lumia's always have a better signal then the other phones. I don't care about LTE performance (I only get 3G at best over here) since I have Wifi in house. Don't understand why reviewers talk about all the gadgets of the phones, while the basic functionality (making phone calls) isn't even decently tested in an area with bad reception. Of course it's much more interesting to compare stuff like camera functionality, screen colours, quality of the Gorilla glass, bending phones etc, but it's all non-essential. I'd love to have a phone that bends when you sit on it, but at least has a good reception and can be used to make a call. Just want a phone with the best receiver sensivity. For each 3 dB decrease in level, the singal power is reduced by about one half. So a more sensitive phone just works better in environments with weak signals. That also includes using it in your car, a bad environment for a mobile phone (metal cage). And most of the time, the receiver in the phone is not the problem, but the antenna plays a much bigger role... As professor Pedersen suggests in his article, it becomes time manufacturers are open about this in the specs of the phone. reply Massi • 6 days ago What process node is the Intel modem? Would be very interesting to see power comparison between Intel and Qualcomm reply Psymon • 2 days ago Great article.. I found it just in time! Having just purchased an iphone 7 plus, 32GB on contract in the UK for use on the Three network. Without any hesitation I have now returned the device and will wait until the i8 appears. Here's why... I live in a network fringe area of Cornwall and also trunk travel quite a bit. The fringe signal at home for the i7 displayed a significant decrease on the previous i5 and i5s signals. 4G has been incredibly sporadic everywhere had appeared to offer no performance increase over 3g. Another immediate issue was a very sharp spike in data usage, I have been using the Three, All You Can Eat Data plans for years, peaking at 25gb in the heaviest usage months... In just five operational days of the i7 the daily use started to top 3gb when streaming music, using google maps and general browsing, close to 50% more than I had ever seen before. I spoke with Three technical for a few hours, explaining everything in great detail, in an attempt to overcome the issues or at least gain a good explanation. Three almost immediately admitted that the 4g was not working on the i7 properly and a solution was being sought between Apple and Three (Apple deny this) Three technical suggested turning off the 4g until being advised of an update that resolves the issue. There was no explanation as to why the signal was poorer on the i7 compared to all previous devices, but now I am starting to understand why, your article makes perfect sense. The Data usage increase was also not met with a good explanation but was dismissed by pointing out that I already have All You Can Eat Data, so why worry.. point taken... but be aware if you are paying for capped data limits! By the way the upgrade to iOS 10.1.1 has made no observable difference.! I also ran a performance test on the i7 using a little app "Performance Test" just to see whether the phone performed as advertised.. A friend also purchased an i7 with 256gb at the same time as me giving me the opportunity to compare both. What was remarkably disappointing was the write speeds... the read speeds were very similar but the write speed was significantly slower on my 32gb i7. Close to 50% less capable slowing the device down by 50% when writing to its memory. This was also observable when browsing images on both phone with maximum signal strength. (My friend has also retuned his iPhone 7 for the same reasons) As a final pass before returning the i7, with your article in hand, I made an appointment with Apple to see if they were prepared to shine some light on the issues. To be fair, they were not really interested, they did however offer me a replacement but with the Intel Model numbers. They confirmed that the Models with the Qualcomm component installed were not available in the UK. If you have an iPhone 7 with the model numbers A1778 or A1784 or are considering buying a new phone.. DON'T it really isn't worth the grief and they will be virtually worthless once the issues are widely known.. These phones WILL give you trouble, perhaps not so much in the city but rural and travelling they simply do not meet a price tag of £50.00 for a phone let alone £780.00 , they really are no more than just a very expensive camera/ipods. reply Cancel Reply Please be polite.

Justice denies Michigan's appeal to halt sex offender ruling News News There are two versions of the iPhone 7 -- and one is way slower Two different modems used By MATT MCFARLAND Posted: 3:08 PM, October 21, 2016 Updated: 3:13 PM, October 21, 2016 Stephen Lam/Getty Images WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) - All iPhones may look the same, but under the hood it's a different story. Some iPhone 7s use a Qualcomm modem, while others have an Intel modem. That distinction could make a difference in how fast an iPhone 7 Plus can send messages and load your favorite app. A new report from Cellular Insights found that the Qualcomm modem performed 30% better than Intel's. The researchers only tested the iPhone 7 Plus, but the two types of modems are also used in the iPhone 7. So how do you make sure you don't end up with the slower iPhone? If you have a Verizon, Sprint or SIM-free model, you're in good hands, according to the Cellular Insights report. Another preventive measure is to make sure you buy your phone in the United States, China or Japan. Those are the only countries where the speedy Qualcomm version is sold. Yet not every iPhone purchased in the U.S. has the faster modem. iPhones from T-Mobile, AT&T and Telstra include the Intel modem. To determine if your iPhone has the Intel modem, check the model number, found in small print on the back of your smartphone. The Intel modem is in Model A1778 and Model A1784. While the Intel modem is slower, it may not be slow enough to bother users. Cellular Insights ran comparison tests, showing that the Intel-powered iPhone 7 Plus was in the ballpark of the iPhone 6S in areas with poor reception. It's unclear why Apple is offering iPhones with two different speeds. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some reports have suggested that by shifting some of its modem business to a Qualcomm competitor, Apple gains leverage to extract better prices from Qualcomm. Copyright 2016 by CNN NewSource.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) All iPhones may look the same, but under the hood it's a different story. Some iPhone 7s use a Qualcomm modem, while others have an Intel modem. That distinction could make a difference in how fast an iPhone 7 Plus can send messages and load your favorite app. A new report from Cellular Insights found that the Qualcomm modem performed 30% better than Intel's. The researchers only tested the iPhone 7 Plus, but the two types of modems are also used in the iPhone 7. So how do you make sure you don't end up with the slower iPhone? If you have a Verizon, Sprint or SIM-free model, you're in good hands, according to the Cellular Insights report. Another preventive measure is to make sure you buy your phone in the United States, China or Japan. Those are the only countries where the speedy Qualcomm version is sold. Yet not every iPhone purchased in the U.S. has the faster modem. iPhones from T-Mobile, AT&T and Telstra include the Intel modem. To determine if your iPhone has the Intel modem, check the model number, found in small print on the back of your smartphone. The Intel modem is in Model A1778 and Model A1784. While the Intel modem is slower, it may not be slow enough to bother users. Cellular Insights ran comparison tests, showing that the Intel-powered iPhone 7 Plus was in the ballpark of the iPhone 6S in areas with poor reception. It's unclear why Apple is offering iPhones with two different speeds. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some reports have suggested that by shifting some of its modem business to a Qualcomm competitor, Apple gains leverage to extract better prices from Qualcomm.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Czech Police Apprehend Alleged LinkedIn Hacker Intel Gets a Boost in Lengthy Appeal of $1.4 Billion EU Fine Dell Introduces Portfolio of Endpoint Security Products Qualcomm Eyes Snapdragon Chips for Connected Cameras, 5G       Today's topics include the apprehension of an unnamed person suspected of being involved in the 2012 hack of LinkedIn, Intel's appeal of the $1.4 billion fines imposed by the European Union, Dell's introduction of new endpoint security products and Qualcomm's plan to focus on connected cameras and 5G modem chip sets. The long arm of U.S. justice may well have finally caught up with one of the individuals behind the 2012 breach of social networking site LinkedIn. Czech police on Oct. 18 announced that with the help of an international Interpol alert, they apprehended an unnamed man who was wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges related to the LinkedIn breach. According to the Czech police statement, the suspect was arrested in a hotel near the center of Prague and noted that the alleged hacker's extradition to the United States will now be decided by judicial authorities. Intel is getting some help in its years-long effort to appeal a $1.4 billion fine levied in 2009 by European antitrust regulators. The chip maker has appealed the fine up through the European Union judicial system despite a series of setbacks, eventually reaching the European Union Court of Justice In an opinion this week, ECJ Advocate General Nils Wahl said the case should be sent back to the court that initially ruled against Intel and levied the record fine. In his opinion, Wahl questioned whether regulators had proved that rebates the chip maker had given to system makers in Europe had amounted to an abuse of its market dominance and harmed competition. Dell EMC is pulling together parts from both companies to create a new broad portfolio of endpoint security and management offerings. The new Dell Endpoint Data Security and Management Portfolio, introduced at the Dell EMC World 2016 show in Austin, Texas, also comes as organizations are looking to pare down the number of security vendors they deal with. The lineup of offerings draws on technology from Dell and Mozy by Dell as well as from former EMC businesses RSA and VMware's AirWatch. Executives from both Dell and EMC worked together from the time Dell announced its bid to buy EMC for more than $60 billion in October 2015 to plan out how to align their respective product portfolios. As a result, the combined company has been able to unveil enhanced products and lineups just six weeks after the deal closed. At Qualcomm's 4G/5G Summit in Hong Kong this week, company officials unveiled plans to expand its reach in the camera space by developing hardware and software designed for video and imaging devices beyond the cameras found in mobile devices. The portfolio also includes a camera reference design based on the Snapdragon 625 system-on-a-chip (SoC). At the same time, the company announced that it is designing a 5G modem chipset that it will start sampling later next year to enable OEMs to build into their cellular devices and that carriers will be able to use in their early 5G trials.  Qualcomm also rolled out three new Snapdragon chips that deliver improved performance and enhanced features over earlier versions.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The Intel® Joule™ module is the newest addition to a line of powerful, multi-purpose development boards from Intel® Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. Overview The Intel® Joule™ module is the newest addition to a line of powerful, multi-purpose development boards from Intel®. This small package contains an Atom™ quad-core processor, clocked at an impressive 1.7 GHz, 4 gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM, Dual band Wi-Fi* antenna, Bluetooth*, and an Intel® HD Graphics Processing Unit. These specs make the Intel® Joule™ module more powerful than any development board previously created by Intel. This new class of processor allows it to do things that its predecessors, the Intel® Edison platform, and Intel® Galileo platform, could not previously achieve; from advanced computer vision, to machine learning. Now in order to get a better feel for the Intel® Joule™ module, let’s perform a comparison between it and the Intel® Edison module. We’ll start with a quick hardware comparison, before moving on to a software comparison, then a size evaluation, and finally an appraisal of usability. Hardware Quick Comparison Intel® Joule™ Module Intel® Edison Module 1.5 or 1.7 GHz Intel® Atom Processor 500 MHz Intel® Atom Processor 3 or 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM 1 GB of DDR3 RAM 8 or 16 GB of eMMC Flash 4 GB of eMMC Flash 802.11ac WiFi* with MIMO Dual band 5.0 GHz and 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi* Bluetooth* Bluetooth* Intel® HD Graphics Processing Unit No Graphics Processing Unit As you can see, the Intel® Joule™ module has an extremely powerful processor for its size. It includes a quad-core processor, giving it four usable executions threads. The Intel® Edison module, on the other hand uses a dual core Intel® Atom processor, clocked at 500 MHz. This means that you get half of the execution threads at less than one third of the processing speed of the Intel® Joule™ module. This means that it has the ability to process more input in a given amount of time. For instance, if you have a bunch of sensors taking in information, the Intel® Edison platform might have to forward it to a Gateway or desktop in order for the data to be properly processed. An Intel® Joule™ module on the other hand could process the data, and send the resulting information to wherever it needs to go. In addition, the Intel® Joule™ module’s graphics processor allows it to do several things that the Intel® Edison module simply cannot do. It can process video and images on board, taking information from them for use elsewhere. It also gives you a graphical user interface, which can make the system overall easier and faster to use. When it comes to memory, the Intel® Edison module only has 1 GB of DDR3 RAM and 4 GB of eMMC flash memory, which means that you only have about 2 GB of memory to work with after the Operating System is installed. This limits how much you can install on the device, as well as how much memory any one program can rely on while running. The Intel® Joule™ module on the other hand, comes with either 8 or 16 gigabytes of eMMC flash memory, depending on what you need, as well as 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM. This increased memory means that a single Intel® Joule™ platform can be used in more one application; simultaneously. All of this ends up meaning that Intel® Joule™ module can handle a much larger workload than an Intel® Edison module can. It can also handle many smaller workloads at once, even if they are graphics processing threads. All in all the Intel® Joule™ module is simply more powerful than Intel® Edison module, allowing it to process more information in a shorter period, as well as the ability to process graphics. Software The software differences between the Intel® Joule™ platform and the Intel® Edison platform are minimal because the development environment is similar with support for both the Intel® XDK and the Intel® System Studio IoT Edition . Intel® Edison platform uses a version of Linux, known as Poky, which gave the device a terminal only interface. This forced a user to work with a Linux terminal in order to do anything. In contrast, the Intel® Joule™ platform comes with a reference Linux for IoT. This flavor of Linux is an interesting platform, and conforms a bit more to a "classical" Linux distro. Like Linux Mint or Ubuntu it offers a root access terminal, which can be output via HDMI or over a serial interface, such as PuTTY. You can use the terminal to get down and dirty with the board, and work with all of the Linux commands you know and love. This flavor also offers a classic desktop in the form of the user-friendly X interface. This interface allows people who are new to Linux to work with a more entry level graphical interface. While interaction with the terminal will still be required, it is minimized in this mode. Physical Size The Intel® Edison compute module measures a meager 35.5 by 25 millimeters, with a thickness of 2.9 millimeters. The small size allows you to use the Intel® Edison module in many mobile applications, allowing its power to be taken on the go. The Intel® Joule™ module is slightly larger at 48 by 24 millimeters, with a height of 3.5 millimeters. This increase in almost 600 cubic millimeters provides Intel® Joule™ compute module with better temperature and power management, as well as better Wi-Fi* and Bluetooth*. Though the bigger package does mean that it might be harder to make it into a ‘wearable’, the extra power the compute module packs could prove very useful. Usability The Intel® Edison platform is a relatively mature, so it can be a very useful tool. Many people are already comfortable working with it; however getting to that level of comfort presents a steep learning curve. If you don’t know how to use a Linux terminal, you might get stuck rather quickly. Even when taking into consideration the various tools that have been developed specifically to help the Intel® Edison platform be more user-friendly, working knowledge of Linux is required to use it fully. The Intel® Joule™ platform overcomes that issue by offering more ways to work with the device, including the previously mentioned X interface. Introducing people to reference Linux distribution with an easy to use graphical interface as a means of working with Joule™ makes the learning curve less steep. But the OS still provides the classical terminal access that someone who knows how to use the Intel® Edison platform might prefer. This makes the Intel® Joule™ platform far easier to learn how to use compared to the Intel® Edison platform. In addition, support for Windows 10 IoT Core* and Ubuntu Core (Snappy)* is coming later this year. The Uses for the Intel® Joule™ Platform The Intel® Joule™ platform provides a more powerful punch for a similarly sized package compared to the Intel® Edison module, but you might be asking, "What can I do with it?" The answer is, almost anything you want. You can create better, faster wearable technology, embed it into manufacturing systems, build drones, or use it for face recognition applications. The possibilities are endless. I personally have been working with this platform for two months as of the writing of this article. The power that this development platform can deliver has given me plenty of ideas on what the Intel® Joule™ module can be used for. I can’t wait to see the community that will blossom from this device, and what they will achieve! If the Intel® Edison platform and its predecessor the Intel® Galileo platform, have taught us anything, it’s that people push these technologies to their upper limits; the Intel® Joule™ module will be the same. It’s exciting to think of what people are going to make with this new device, and if its ancestors are anything to go by, we’re going to see some impressive stuff. What will you make?

The goal was to develop components that finally integrated optical and electronic signaling on the same silicon device, allowing high-bandwidth data communication over distances that copper conductors simply could not reach. Let's take a closer look at the basic ideas behind silicon photonics and some of the benefits and challenges they can present for data center teams. Q. What is silicon photonics technology and how does it affect the data center? Silicon devices are the foundation of every processor, chipset, ASIC and memory component. At the same time, photonic devices -- components built to carry photons of light, rather than electrons, over great distances -- have been a mainstay of modern networks, providing high-bandwidth connectivity between buildings, across continents and around the world. Silicon photonics uses existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor chip fabrication technologies to build transistors and optical components on the same silicon die at the same time, rather than separate electrons and photons on different devices. Silicon photonics fabricate the microscopic components needed to make direct conversions from electrical signals to light signals and back again, as well as the supporting optical components, to guide and separate optical wavelengths. Signals between silicon photonics chips are connected using optical fibers. So how does silicon photonics technology affect the data center? The initial crop of components in the market seems similar to conventional optical network adapters, which use fiber cables to connect devices across distances of a mile or less. This can service high-speed network connections between buildings, though the components can also be used for high-bandwidth interconnections between data center servers. As time goes on, silicon photonics technology should allow for additional optical applications, bolstering the connectivity between servers and allowing for alternative compute models, such as server disaggregation. Q. Are there any silicon photonics products currently available for data centers? Practical silicon photonics products are still in their infancy, so it's challenging to predict how they will evolve. Intel currently touts two silicon photonics products: the Intel Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 QSFP28 Optical Transceiver and the Intel Silicon Photonics 100G CWDM4 QSFP28 Optical Transceiver. Both products support Ethernet switch, router and telecom connectivity for large enterprise and cloud-scale data centers with 100 gigabit Ethernet low-power optical links using single-mode optical fiber. Both products also share features, such as a maximum of 3.5 watts of uncooled power dissipation and an electrical-side interface that supports the IEEE 802.3bm CAUI-4 standard, using four 25 gigabits per second (Gbps) data lanes. In addition, the products both employ a compact Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable form factor to allow many modules to be deployed in a relatively small area. The products are also controlled through an inter-integrated circuit bus that supplies a serial link between chips for management and diagnostics. These early products represent just a sampling of the potential for silicon photonics. As the technology develops, the supported distances may shrink to facilitate faster connectivity options for systems and devices that are closer together. Q. How does silicon photonics support data center disaggregation? To understand the potential for silicon photonics, it's important to understand disaggregation in the data center. Servers are traditionally monolithic entities, so all their components are assembled -- or aggregated -- into the same box. When a server cannot deliver more resources, a business needs to buy more servers in their entirety -- even though it may not need all of those additional resources. For example, if an application needs more CPU cores, an organization can deploy another server to service those added cores. But the memory and other resources in the server may sit idle. The concept behind server disaggregation is to rethink the server into independent, functional subsystems. For example, processors, memory, storage and other key resources are divided into functional modules, and IT teams can add and rearrange those modules as desired within a common rack. Racks of disaggregated components would then fill the data center. Moving forward, silicon photonics technology could be a crucial part of the connectivity between future disaggregated compute components, providing fast, reliable and low-cost optical/electronic translations that would work between modules sitting next to one another, scattered within a rack or mounted on racks across a data center. Q. How will silicon photonics technology evolve into future data center products? Practical silicon photonics products are still in their infancy, so it's challenging to predict how they will evolve. However, there are some possible directions for data center professionals to consider. Initially, products like the Intel Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 and CWDM4 QSFP28 Optical Transceivers will provide simpler, low-power and high-speed networking alternatives for large enterprise and cloud-scale data centers. This can encourage volume adoption of high-bandwidth network technologies within data centers and across metropolitan area network deployments. Over the longer term, silicon photonics technology should continue to support even faster networking speeds, allowing the eventual move from 100 Gbps to 400 Gbps touted on network development roadmaps. But the truly exciting future of silicon photonics technology is in chip-to-chip communication, allowing data to move between individual chips rather than between boxes or buildings. Nonvolatile memory chips have been demonstrated, offering the potential to store not just single bits per cell, but multiple bits per cell. The use of silicon photonics for memory poses the potential for vastly increased memory speed, as well as an enormous jump in memory density. This may allow silicon photonics to play a key role in the next major leaps in enterprise computing power.

Comments By John Ribeiro Follow IDG News Service | Oct 21, 2016 3:50 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Security IT Industry Intel Comments Intel does not object to John McAfee using his personal name in connection with his business, but it objects to the use by the maverick entrepreneur and security expert of the McAfee trade name and trademark in a way that could confuse or deceive consumers or dilute the brand. The issue came up when John McAfee teamed with MGT Capital Investments, which had been until recently mainly into gaming sites, and announced in May that it is in the process of acquiring a diverse portfolio of cybersecurity technologies. MGT also announced that it intended to change its corporate name to “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.” with John McAfee at the helm of the new company. MGT has meanwhile launched a network security product called Sentinel, and Intel points in its filing to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that MGT has a promotional video on its website that “now displays the new trade name and trademark ‘John McAfee Global Technologies.’” Intel announced in September that it had signed an agreement with TPG for a deal that would see its Intel Security business as a separate cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. Intel would also receive US$3.1 billion in cash. The new company would be named McAfee. Intel said in its filing Thursday that it does not object to “John D. McAfee’s use of his personal name or personal reputation in connection with his business ventures.” Elsewhere in the filing, the company said it admits that John McAfee “did not forfeit the right to use his name as a personal name, which Intel has never challenged.” The company, however, objects to John McAfee and MGT “using their new MCAFEE trade name and trademark, and any other MCAFEE trade names or marks, in a manner that creates a likelihood of confusion or deception among consumers, or that dilutes Intel’s famous MCAFEE brand." Intel is arguing that the use of its trademarks by the renamed company for security products could lead consumers to assume mistakenly that they come from a common source, in this case Intel. Intel said it completed in February 2011 the acquisition of McAfee Inc, and had continued to use and promote the McAfee mark on and in connection with security products, services and publications for consumers and businesses. The company claims to own through McAfee Inc. a number of U.S. registered trademarks such as the MCAFEE, MCAFEE SECURITY, MCAFEE PROVEN SECURITY and the stylized “M” on a shield marks. In June 2016, Intel sent a letter to MGT Capital warning it of legal action if it changed its name “to one that includes the MCAFEE trademark or otherwise use the MCAFEE name as a trademark.” John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security-related goods and services, Intel added. John McAfee and MGT soon after filed a suit in the New York court seeking a judgment declaring that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT,  does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. In the filing, John McAfee claimed that he had entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a predecessor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. But at no point did he “assign the rights to his personal name, via assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agree to restrict his right to do business using his own name,” according to the filing. He had not filed for or registered the trademark to “John McAfee” or “McAfee” or any other variation of the name at the time of the agreement. Some of MGT's other plans have run into issues. Its agreement to acquire anti-spy software company D-Vasive had to be halted because of the refusal by NYSE MKT to list the 43.8 million shares that would need to be issued to complete the merger. The New York Stock Exchange this week initiated proceedings for delisting MGT's common stock.

Wednesday 16 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 10:34 / GMT - 07:04 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Oct 21, 2016 1:24 iPhone 7s with Intel Modems Struggle Badly in Low-Signal Areas Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph here is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.         LATEST STORIES (10) American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US Eleven Killed, Wounded in Terrorists' Rocket Attack in Western Damascus Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syrian Army Discovers Terrorists' 700-Meter-Long Tunnel in Khan Al-Sheih Connecting Damascus to Quneitra Protests, Students Walkouts Mark Week after Trump's Win Yemen Water Crisis Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Operations against ISIL Terrorists West of Mosul Iraqi Forces Take Back Ancient City of Nimrud from ISIL Iraqi Popular Forces Safeguarding Peace in Newly Gained Territories near Mosul Police Violence during Anti-Trump Protests Iran and US: A Tale of Two Elections Supermoon in Iran's Sky Iran Eyeing NITC Listing in Int'l Stock Markets VP: World Admitting Iran's Constructive Role in Maintaining Regional Security Iraqi Interior Minister: Nearly 1,000 ISIL Terrorists Killed, Over 100 Captured in Mosul Operation American Students Join Anti-Trump Protests across US TEHRAN (FNA)- Protesters were not slowing down six days after Donald Trump's election, many of them high school students leaving class by the hundreds to carry signs and flags on the streets of several US cities.

against €1.06bn competition law fine The EU's highest court has been urged to uphold an appeal brought by the computer processing giant Intel against a €1.06 billion fine it was served for breaching competition rules.21 Oct 2016 EU and UK competition law EU & Competition TMT Advanced Manufacturing & Technology UK Europe Germany France An advocate general to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) outlined a number of reasons why the appeal should be reheard by the EU's General Court in a non-binding opinion published on Thursday. Robert Erikkson, a competition law expert at Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said that if the CJEU follows the approach recommended by the advocate general, it could become harder for the European Commission to enforce EU competition laws extraterritorially in future. In 2009 the European Commission ruled that Intel breached rules that prohibit companies from abusing a dominant market position under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) when it offered rebates on the sale of central processing units (CPUs) to some computer manufacturers and by paying a retailer, Media-Saturn-Holding, to sell computers with only Intel chips installed in them. At the time the Commission also said that Intel had paid three computer manufacturers to delay, cancel or restrict the launch or distribution of computers containing CPUs made by its main rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Intel had also engaged in efforts to try to conceal its infringing activities, the regulator found. The Commission concluded that Intel had pursued a strategy of trying to foreclose AMD from the CPUs market between October 2002 and December 2007. This conclusion was supported by the General Court in a ruling in 2014 in which it dismissed Intel's appeal against the €1.06bn fine the Commission had imposed. Intel has appealed against the General Court's decision to the CJEU. Advocate general Nils Wahl was tasked with providing an independent and impartial opinion to the CJEU in this case before the Court reaches its decision. He has scrutinised Intel's appeal and now made recommendations on how the CJEU should rule. A CJEU judgment is typically handed down by the Court a number of months after an advocate general opinion is issued. The CJEU is not bound to follow the opinions of its advocate generals but often it does. In its appeal, Intel has claimed that the General Court erred in law when reaching its decision to uphold the fine imposed by the Commission. It has raised six grounds of appeal. Advocate general Wahl said it is his view that five of the six grounds of appeal should be upheld and that the judgment of the General Court should therefore be "set aside". The case should be referred back to the General Court for a rehearing of Intel's appeal, he said. Eriksson of Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said that it would be a major blow for the Commission if Intel’s appeal was upheld and the original decision was abolished, partly because it is "a recent key precedent as regards what types of rebates are abusive". "Moreover, it was the first major General Court Article 102 judgment after the issuing of the Commission's 2009 guidance on enforcement priorities in applying Article 102 of the TFEU to abusive exclusionary conduct; and the Commission had stated that the Intel decision was in line with the orientations set out in that guidance," Eriksson said. Among the faults Wahl said exist with the General Court's ruling is with the "legal characterisation" it had given to rebates Intel paid to some computer manufacturers for exclusivity in relation to use of its microchips in their machines. Wahl said the General Court had erred in classifying the rebates in a way which meant that it did not consider whether the payment of the 'exclusivity rebates' were justified under EU competition laws in the round. The advocate general said: "The General Court erred in law, first, in finding that ‘exclusivity rebates’ constitute a separate and unique category of rebates that require no consideration of all the circumstances in order to establish an abuse of a dominant position contrary to [EU competition laws]. Second, it erred in law in its alternative assessment of capability by failing to establish, on the basis of all the circumstances, that the rebates and payments offered by [Intel] had, in all likelihood, an anticompetitive foreclosure effect." Another ground of Intel’s appeal is on jurisdiction where it has argued that the General Court erred in law when agreeing that the Commission had jurisdiction to enforce Article 102 of the TFEU. Intel claimed that its conduct was neither implemented in the European Economic Area (EEA), nor had it any substantial effect in that area, and that, therefore, the Commission lacked jurisdiction to take Article 102 enforcement action.  Eriksson said that it is recognised in case law that if EU competition law could only be applied where, for example, an agreement was formed or adopted within the EU territory, that would provide businesses with an easy way to escape EU competition law. In its ruling the General Court had said two ways to establish a sufficient link between the conduct in question and the territory was the 'implementation' criterion or a 'qualified' effects criterion. In Wahl’s opinion he said the implementation criterion requires that at least part of the conduct should have been implemented, executed or put into effect in the EU's internal market. The qualified effects criterion requires that the conduct had immediate, substantial and foreseeable effects in the internal market. "From a UK perspective post-Brexit, this is an important ground of appeal where it will be very interesting to see if the CJEU takes the line of the advocate general," said Eriksson. "The easier it is for the Commission to claim jurisdiction to enforce EU competition law, the greater the likelihood that UK companies in the future will be subject to EU competition law as regards conduct within the UK, which then is outside the EU territory and, it seems, will also likely be outside the EEA." According to Wahl, nothing in the relevant Intel conduct could be characterised as having been implemented, executed or put into effect in the internal market, as the conduct alleged as abusive arose from an agreement between Intel, a US company, and a Chinese company, concerning sales of CPUs made and sold outside the EU for incorporation into computers made in China, limiting only the possibility for another US-based company (AMD) of selling CPUs on the Chinese market. In Wahl’s view, the General Court erred in concluding the implementation criterion was met purely on the basis of customer behaviour in the downstream notebook market, which concerned Lenovo's decision not to sell a certain computer model worldwide. As regards the ‘qualified’ effects criterion, Wahl thought this should not be satisfied where, for example, the effect in the EU is merely hypothetical or of minor significance. The anti-competitive effect resulting from the conduct appeared to Wahl to be "rather hypothetical, speculative and unsubstantiated". Wahl noted that the General Court itself had stated that the number of computers affected was "modest" and that it was unclear whether some of those were to be sold in the EEA. He stressed that it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove that the effects of alleged abusive conduct within the internal market may be appreciable. Wahl considered that the General Court had failed in asking the crucial question as to whether the conduct immediately or directly could have diminished competitors’ ability to compete for CPUs within the internal market.  "It is worth noting that Wahl does not rule out that the conduct could have significantly impeded AMD’s capacity to make and market CPUs worldwide, including in the EEA, as Intel’s exclusion of the only viable competitor in the market for CPUs could be achieved regardless of whether it chose to target customers that have operations in the EEA or elsewhere," said Eriksson. "However, he found it ‘regrettable’ that no such analysis had been carried out by the General Court." "If the CJEU agrees with Wahl, then it could be harder for the Commission to enforce EU competition law extraterritorially in the future," Eriksson said.

However, after 7 consecutive quarters of declining tablet sales, it is hard to see how Apple’s second best product, the iPad will soon see a slow death despite the fact that it outdid Micrsoft’s Surface tablet PCs as per the last IDC report. The Apple iPhone may be the company’s hero product, but with falling smartphone and tablet sales, Apple now seems to be focussing on a forgotten line of products that started it all, the Mac. Apple’s Mac lineup has been ignored for quite some time now. The only Mac product that Apple sells with an up to date chipset is its recently announced 2016 MacBook. There’s the Mac Pro that stuck with an Intel Ivy Bridge-E CPU, which was last updated in 2013, the MacBook Pro 15-inch which features an Intel Haswell CPU and was updated in 2014 and finally the MacBook Air with an Intel Broadwell CPU. Steve Jobs unveiled the Macbook Air from an envelope and it still looks the same 8 years later. The MacBook Air despite being on of the best value for money buys in Apple’s Mac lineup has yet to see a redesign or an update. It packs in an old TN display with non Retina resolution and a fifth-generation chipset, while Asus, Dell offer the latest for roughly the same price. While I would love to sit and admire Apple’s marketing team (since people are still buying these old systems) it is easy to tell, that Apple’s focus in the past two years was on its iPad. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch Apple launched the powerful iPad Pro models last year (November 2015), and it was clear that the company was looking to get PC users under its fold with the same. Soon enough Apple added another Pro variant with the 9.7-inch model with the hopes that those who found the 12-inch too-big would be happy to go in for this one. But that turned out to be a flop show as well. The company lost out because not only were the Pro models priced too high, but they ran the same iOS as its smartphones, which is not something a power user who usually pays for an ultra-book would be interested in. Adding to the mess was Apple’s idea to ape Microsoft with a soft keyboard, that somehow did not cover up for its lacking software productivity. With the tablet sales still declining Apple seems to have woken up and is now for once actually holding an event for its updated Mac lineup. Think of it as a Plan B where the Plan A with the iPad seems to have failed, despite repeated efforts. Apple MacBook 2016 So wit the iPad out fizzing out (they are still planning three new models next year), the next mobile device in line would have to be the old and neglected laptop lineup. So why is the Apple iPad failing? As Digital Trends points out, it is the upgrade cycle. Tablet users simply do not feel the need to upgrade to a new or the latest model, as they are often used for secondary tasks. With smartphones screen sizes getting bigger, more can be accomplished with the device that is in your hand, rather than the one in your bag, that well… needs two hands. Why would one need an iPad Pro (Rs 93,000 256GB) when you have MacBook (Rs 1,00,000 512GB, 8GB RAM) that is equally light, priced the same and can do so much more? Microsoft’s Windows 10 and its manufacturers have moved ahead of Apple when it comes to hardware and software, let’s hope Plan B works out as smartphones and tablets are just not cutting it, while Plan C with the Apple Car just got shelved.

After GSMArena pointed out how the 32GB version of the iPhone 7 uses a much slower storage module, there is now another report by Cellular Insights that points to varying levels of network reception in places where the network signal could be a bit weak. Apple this year, with its iPhone 7 models used Qualcomm modems on some and Intel modems on others devices. While the consumer thinks that both in reality should perform identically in the same conditions, testing by Cellular Insights in a report by Apple Insider show irregularities. While both Qualcomm and Intel-based units performed the same in areas with good coverage, in areas with a fainter signal, Qualcomm units outperformed the Intel ones. By how much? Well, that performance gap would be roughly 30 percent. To give better insight (rather making things worse) following tests also included other smartphones for comparison like the iPhone 6s, LG G5, Nexus 5X and the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. From the report, its clear that Intel-based iPhone 7 got left in the dust while the Galaxy S7 edge was the winner. For now it isn’t clear how much of a difference this has made to users of the iPhone 7 (or whether they have even noticed the reception problem). Moreover, Apple recently pushed out an update that addressed earlier reception issues, and customers don’t seem to be reporting too many problems with reception as well (for now).

Intel achieved margins of 63.3%, up 0.3% year-over-year, and their operating income increased 6% to $4.5 billion. Net income for the quarter was $3.4 billion, up 9%, and earnings per share came in at $0.69. Intel Q3 2016 Financial Results (GAAP)   Q3'2016 Q2'2016 Q3'2015 Revenue $15.8B $13.5B $14.5B Operating Income $4.5B $1.3B $4.2B Net Income $3.4B $1.3B $3.1B Gross Margin 63.3% 58.9% 63.0% Client Computing Group Revenue $8.9B +18.7% +5.7% Data Center Group Revenue $4.5B +12.5% +9.9% Internet of Things Revenue $689M +20.4% +18.6% Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group $649M +17.1% -0.9% Intel Security Group $537M flat +6.1% Programmable Solutions Group $465M -8.6% - All Other Revenue $44M +10% -42.8% Intel also announced Non-GAAP results, which exclude certain things like acquisition-related adjustments, deferred revenue write-down, restructuring, and more. For a full list, please check out their lengthy explanation on their earnings report. On a Non-GAAP basis, revenue was the same $15.8 billion, margins were up 1.3% to 64.8%, and operating income was up 18% to $5.1 billion. Net income was up 21% to $3.9 billion, and earnings per share were up 21% to $0.80. Intel’s internal divisions are broken down into six groups. The Client Computing Group, which is PCs, tablets, phones, and wired and wireless communication. The Data Center Group focuses on enterprise and the cloud. Internet of Things is retail, transportation, industrial, building, and home use electronics. Non-Volatile Memory Solutions is mostly Intel’s SSD efforts. Intel Security Group is security software (McAfee) and new for fiscal 2016 is the Programmable Solutions Group, formed after the acquisition of Altera, and features field-programmable gate arrays and related products. For Q3, the Client Computing Group had revenues of $8.892 billion, which is up from $8.506 billion a year ago. Unit volumes were actually down 4% compared to the same point a year ago, and volumes are down 11% for the year compared to the first three quarters of 2015, but average selling prices (ASP) continue to increase. For this quarter ASP was up 6% compared to a year ago, and is up 12% for the year so far. Breaking it down a bit further, Intel has had 4% growth in notebook platform sales for this quarter (year-over-year) with ASP up 3% in the notebook segment. Desktops dropped 6% in volume, but have kept the same average selling price, and “tablet platform volumes decreased” which is a non-numerical way to say that Intel is getting out of the dedicated tablet market altogether. The Data Center Group had revenues of $4.542 billion this quarter, up from $4.140 billion a year ago. Unit volumes increased 12% this quarter compared to Q3 2015, and for the year unit volumes are up 9%. Average selling price has decreased though, down 3% this quarter, and down 2% for the year so far. Intel doesn’t break out the numbers as specifically for the remaining groups, but Non-Volatile Memory Solutions had revenue that was more or less flat at $649 million for the quarter, compared to $655 million a year ago. Internet of Things continues to grow, up to $689 million in revenue, compared to $581 million in Q3 2015. The Intel Security Group increased revenue from $506 million to $537 million, and the Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million, with no comparison to last year since it is a newly acquired product group, but up 6% compared to Altera’s numbers from last year. Intel has made some announcements in this quarter as well. Intel started sampling Stratix 10 in this quarter, which is the only 14 nm FPGA. They also announced they will sell 51% of the Intel Security Group, and establish an independent McAfee security company with the private equity firm TPG. Intel is also shipping “thousands of samples” of their new 3D XPoint to customers, and should have it qualified by the end of this quarter. Speaking of qualified, the Intel 7480 modem was qualified for AT&T this quarter, which is about a year after the 7360 modem got qualified. Looking forward, Intel is forecasting revenues for Q4 at $15.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and margins of 61%. Intel has continued to diversify its portfolio, and has been building out other divisions to assist with growth while the PC market continues to decline, and while the Client Computing Group continues to be their largest division, they have had strong growth in other areas like the Data Center Group which had record revenue this quarter, and IoT which continues to grow quickly.

POST A COMMENT 6 Comments View All Comments twotwotwo - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link I bet one can make decent guesses at all of these things with enough research, but there are a lot of more granular things that the topline numbers make me wonder. Who's paying Intel a half a billion dollars a quarter for Internet of Things things? How do volume and margins for datacenter stuff break down into the handful of big cloud customers vs. everyone else? Likewise for Apple's client purchases vs. the rest of the client market. None of that is to fuss with success, just interesting if you're trying to figure out how the larger trends out there will affect Intel and what they might look like in a few years. Reply dealcorn - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link I believe Intel's IoT group includes retail, factory automation and transportation such as in vehicle or drones. Wearables are not a strength. Many/most big purchasers have workloads where Intel is able to enhances value through customized solutions. Customized solutions that enhance value are typically higher margin. Reply witeken - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link If you are -- like me -- honestly interested in those things, reading Intel's earnings reports can be a good place to start, although the topics are very investor focused. So the best thing would actually be to watch their yearly Investor Meeting presentations, which go in more depth about some of their businesses. They are held every November and this one's from last year: http://intelstudios.edgesuite.net/im/2015/start.ht... That's about the deepest you can go. Another indicator by the way are acquisitions. Reply witeken - Friday, October 21, 2016 - link The reason data center ASPs declined is actually because Intel in the last few years has been gaining a lot of momentum in the network market. They had a share of 10% in that market in 2015, but this year the big players have started moving from proprietary stuff (I thought ASICs) to Intel architecture because of the advantages -- you can understand that that is process that takes many years. However, those guys don't buy heavy E5s, but they tend to buy the cheaper stuff. So for Intel this is maybe a $10B market that they are currently just a small player in, but they have consistently grown their MSS in the last few years from 5 to 7 to 10% from 2013-2015. So this is a separate market for their data center business which causes volume to go up but ASP down. This is actually the opposite of what happens in the rest of the data center, certainly in the 30% growing cloud market, that they tend to move up the stack because of TCO -- total cost of ownership. Just saying. Reply Annabella24 - Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - link Are you single tonight?

Prior to this, Apple had pretty much used Qualcomm’s modems exclusively. When it was discovered that Intel’s modems are being used, we also wondered how this might impact performance. Turns out there is some difference. According to some tests that have been conducted, it was discovered that Qualcomm’s modems appear to have better reception in places where the signal is fainter. This means that if you’re inside a building or underground, the tests seem to suggest that the Qualcomm model will provide you with better service than the Intel model. The disparity in performance was not just limited to the iPhone 7. Cellular Insights, who performed the test, brought in other phones as comparisons which included the iPhone 6s, LG G5, Google Nexus 5X, and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It seems that the Intel iPhone 7 got left in the dust while the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge proved to be the clear winner. Now whether or not this will affect your daily usage remains to be seen. So far there doesn’t appear to be too many complaints regarding reception (there were issues with reception but those were addressed with software fixes), meaning that maybe in real-world usage the disparity can’t be felt as much. It also reminds us of the time the iPhone 6s was discovered to have chipsets made by Samsung and TSMC, with the latter proving to have better battery life than the former, although like we said then, those were merely tests and real-world usage is probably what really matters.

The Commission had found that Intel gave hidden rebates to computer makers including Dell and Hewlett-Packard on condition that they bought all, or almost all, of their main processors from Intel. Intel also made direct payments to Europe's largest PC retailer - Media Saturn Holdings - on condition that it stocked only computers with Intel processors. The chipmaker, which employs about 4,500 people in Ireland, also made payments to some computer makers to stop or delay the launch of products containing a rival's processors. But yesterday, an Advocate General for the European Court of Justice - Nils Wahl - said that the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and PC maker Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission's 2009 decision. The opinion from Mr Wahl - who has said a judicial review of the EC decision is needed - isn't binding, but the advice of Advocate Generals is typically adopted by the court. His opinion is a setback for the European Commission, which has prided itself on taking on giant corporations. The opinion delivered yesterday comes as Ireland prepares to launch its appeal against the European Commission's ruling this year that tech giant Apple must pay Ireland €13bn in back taxes for allegedly benefiting from a sweetheart deal here. The Government and Apple have denied that such a deal ever existed. In 2014, Intel's first appeal in its case was rejected by the Court of Justice. The Commission said that decision it justified its pursuit of Intel's anti-competitive conduct. In its latest appeal, Intel argued that the Commission had failed to analyse "all relevant circumstances" to determine if the rebates did in fact result in rivals being squeezed out. Mr Wahl's opinion is a good omen for companies seeking guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. US chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates.

And according to a new report, the latter version offers better cellular performance than the former. Cellular Insights compared two different iPhone 7 Plus models, one with an Intel XMM7360 modem and one with a Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. The tests were conducted with signal testing equipment on LTE bands 4, 7, and 12, and the phones were compared at different signal strengths. According to this report, both the Intel modem and Qualcomm modem performed similarly when they had a strong signal. However, as the signal got weaker, cellular performance of the Intel modem dropped off much farther than the Qualcomm modem. On LTE band 4 at -110dBm, the Intel modem put up speeds of around 60Mbps, while the Qualcomm modem was putting up speeds of 100Mbps. The story was similar with LTE band 12 performance, the Intel modem saw speeds of around 36Mbps at -110dBm, while the Qualcomm model put up speeds of around 64Mbps. According to this report, the average performance difference between the two modems was around 30 percent. “In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem,” explains Cellular Insights. The iPhone 7 with the Intel modem is the model for AT&T and T-Mobile, while the iPhone 7 with the Qualcomm modem is the version for Sprint and Verizon. Qualcomm’s modem is also in the SIM-free iPhone that Apple sells on its website. Apple hasn’t revealed why it’s using Intel modems in some iPhone 7 models and Qualcomm modems in others. Judging by the results of today’s report, though, it’s the Qualcomm modem that you want to get if you’re buying a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. That means that Sprint and Verizon customers are good to go, but if you’re on AT&T or T-Mobile and want a device with a Qualcomm modem, you’ll need to buy SIM-free from Apple.

Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Patches Updated For Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 20 October 2016 at 07:39 PM EDT. 4 Comments Intel has updated its currently out-of-tree Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 patches for compatibility against the Linux 4.9-rc1 kernel plus made other improvements to the code. These patches have been worked on the past few months after Intel PR initially claimed no TBM 3.0 Linux support. The patches have gone through several public revisions but sadly didn't make it for integration into the mainline Linux 4.9 kernel. But the V6 patches are now out with support for 4.9-rc1 plus making other improvements for supporting this performance-boosting technology found on newer CPUs such as the Broadwell-E Core i7 6800K. I'll be trying these latest patches against Linux 4.9 on my i7-6800K shortly for seeing how it affects the performance. Hopefully these patches will be mainlined for Linux 4.10. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search CANDI Integrates with Intel® Building Management Platform to Provide Edge-to-Cloud IoT Data Access CANDI PowerTools software offers seamless, secure access to legacy and new Internet of Things (IoT) devices and data within smart buildings.   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Powertools * Intel BMP * Smart Building By Industry: * HomeOAKLAND, Calif. - Oct. 20, 2016 - PRLog -- CANDI today announced that its PowerTools software has been integrated with theIntel® Building Management Platform (Intel® BMP) (http://www.intel.com/bmp), which is now available. Intel® BMP is a manageable IoT platform with built-in security that enables cloud-based smart building applications and services with easy access to the data and things in small to mid-sized buildings. CANDI-enabled gateways simplify smart building deployments (https://candicontrols.com/how-it-works/) by making it quick and easy—and often automatic—to integrate smart products such as meters, switches, thermostats, lights, sensors, cameras, and building controls. The PowerTools device and data management platform bridges the most popular building IoT protocols, providing secure and easy access to normalized data through standard APIs. "The IoT is rapidly expanding across industries. In the facilities and energy management markets, robust new solutions for smart buildings such as the Intel® BMP are industry-changers," said CANDI CEO Steve Raschke. "CANDI PowerTools software provides the bridge between the Intel® BMP and the end applications that makebuildings smart and connected. We make it easy to access and use more data from more devices, with a cost-effective, cloud-based solution." CANDI's bidirectional edge-to-cloud data services enable an ecosystem of partners to provide comprehensive solutions for energy and facilities management, remote monitoring and control, predictive maintenance, and other compelling smart building applications. Traditionally, the high cost of building management systems (BMS) has been difficult to justify for 90 percent of North America's commercial buildings that are under 100,000 square feet. But the proliferation of low-cost, advanced IoT technologies and open, cloud-based platforms are transforming building automation technology. Until now, the challenge has been bridging disparate legacy and IoT protocols to make smart building capabilities cost effective and easy to deploy for the small to mid-market. Easy-to-Deploy Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Platform Accelerates Solution Providers' Time to Revenue PowerTools (https://candicontrols.com/what-we-do/get-candi/) software includes easy-to-use discovery and management tools that enable integrators to quickly find and provision hundreds of installed devices to collect data, and bridge systems across a wide and growing range of protocols. The software also provides unique two-way communication capabilities to unlock remote control and management of building systems for cloud-based provisioning, monitoring, and control. This Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform reduces development time and effort for solution providers with a pre-integrated building management platform that helps them quickly deploy, monitor, and maintain data and devices for complete smart building applications. As a result, solution providers can quickly offer exciting new solutions that scale across more sites, reduce cost of deployment, access more data, and deliver new services to new markets.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Yahoo Earnings Report Shows Ad Revenue Still Eroding Intel Record Q3 Revenue Offset by Disappointing Forecast Dell EMC Brings PowerEdge Servers to VxRail, VxRack Google Enables Web Support for Firebase Cloud Messaging       Today's topics include the continued decline of Yahoo's desktop advertising revenue, Intel's strong quarterly revenue report masks weaker prospects, hyperconverged data center products from Dell EMC, and Google's new support for Firebase Cloud Messaging. Yahoo canceled its quarterly conference call with analysts this week, leaving questions about its financial wellbeing and data security unanswered. While its reported earnings exceeded expectations, the company's primary source of revenue—desktop advertising—dropped for the seventh time in the past eight quarters. According to Yahoo, it canceled the talk because of the pending offer in July from Verizon Communications to buy the web company for $4.8 billion. While a recent 14 percent drop in core ad revenue was a likely topic, Yahoo is also avoiding questions about last month's news that hackers broke into its data stores and stole about 500 million personal account information packages. Intel saw a strong Q3 in most of its business segments, but the outlook might not be as positive. The chip-making company's most recent quarterly financial numbers showed record revenue of $15.8 billion—a 9 percent increase over the same 2015 period. Profits also grew 9 percent, with growth not only in Intel's data center and internet of things divisions, but even in the slower PC business. However, the global PC market is continuing to contract as mobile devices rise in popularity, and analysts with both IDC and Gartner say that worldwide shipments for PCs fell significantly in the third quarter. As a result, Intel's overall business growth is projected to slow in the coming quarters. Ten months ago, Dell announced it would buy data storage vendor EMC for more than $60 billion. The deal closed in September, and now the two tech vendors have revealed the groundwork for how they're merging their respective product portfolios. The highlight of their work, revealed at Dell EMC World 2016, has been the hyperconverged infrastructure offerings. The Dell PowerEdge servers have been integrated into the VxRail and VxRack systems inherited in the EMC deal. Hyperconverged systems like these offer compute, storage, networking, virtualization and management software resources in an appliance that's easy to manage. Starting this week, Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging technology can be used to push notifications from software applications and services to browsers outside Chrome, including Firefox and Opera, all through a JavaScript library Google recently implemented.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas iPhone 7s with Intel modems struggle badly in low-signal areas By Joel Hruska on October 20, 2016 at 4:23 pm Comment Apple has a reputation for tight supply chain management and demanding rigorous quality control, but the company may have a modem problem on its hands. Previously, Apple has tapped both Samsung and TSMC to build its SoCs, but stuck with the same Qualcomm modem for all its hardware. With the iPhone 7, Apple adopted an Intel modem for its AT&T and T-Mobile variants, while the factory-unlocked devices, Sprint, and Verizon hardware all use Qualcomm’s modem silicon (MDM9645M if you want to get technical). According to an analysis performed by Cellular Insights, both devices perform equally well if you have a strong signal, but the Intel modem (XMM7360, pictured at top) drops off significantly as signal strength weakens. Cellular Insights tested multiple LTE bands (Band 4, 7, and 12) in a 4×2 MIMO configuration. The graph below is from Band 4, which Cellular Insights describes as the most common band for North America LTE deployments. Image and data by Cellular Insights RSRP is a measure of LTE signal strength and is expected to range from ~-75dBm when measured directly on top of a cellular base site to -120dBm at the edge of coverage. What we see here is that the Intel modem can’t sustain the same throughput as the Qualcomm device, particularly at the -105dBm threshold. At -115dBm, the gap between the Intel and Qualcomm modems is roughly 2x — meaning the Qualcomm device is sustaining about twice the network throughput on the same signal strength. Cellular Insights also compared the two devices against the Galaxy S7 Edge, the iPhone 6s, the LG G5, and the Nexus 5X. Image and data by Cellular Insights First of all, kudos to Samsung; the S7 Edge does extremely well in all cases. The Intel XMM7360, in contrast, is the worst overall performer of the lot — though the 6s doesn’t exactly distinguish itself well, either. That might explain why Apple was willing to work with Intel in the first place, but the Intel XMM7360 doesn’t keep up with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M. It would be interesting to see a battery life comparison between Intel and Qualcomm devices and it’s possible that Apple could improve the Intel modem’s performance via a software update. If you really care about LTE performance on an iPhone or live in an area with marginal LTE coverage, the factory-unlocked version of the device is definitely your best bet — right now, the Intel modem isn’t performing where it ought to be. Winning the iPhone 7 was a huge victory for Intel’s beleaguered modem division, but that victory was predicated on the idea that the Intel and Qualcomm modems would offer equal performance. So far, that doesn’t seem to be the case. It’s not clear how much this impacts the iPhone 7’s range, network timeouts, or other issues that might arise in areas where cellular connectivity is weak, but the general implication is that the Qualcomm modem offers better performance and possibly better range when operating in low-signal areas.

If you want the best iPhone 7, you need to get the one with a Qualcomm modem. According to a new study by Cellular Insights, the Qualcomm iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus units—that's the Verizon, Sprint and factory-unlocked models—have more than 30 percent better performance in weak signal conditions than the AT&T and T-Mobile models, which have Intel modems. Cellular Insights bought several iPhones at retail, and hooked them up to a box that simulates cellular networks to eliminate variables. We don't have that expensive equipment here. They tested the iPhones on LTE band 4—which is used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon—as well as band 12, which is used by AT&T and T-Mobile. Both models of iPhone work equally well in strong signal conditions. We couldn't tell the difference with good signal, Cellular Insights couldn't, and you won't be able to, either. But when the signal weakened to about -105dBm—think of that as one bar of signal—the testers saw a major difference. At -110dBm on Band 4, the Qualcomm iPhone pushed 100Mbps while the Intel iPhone only reached 60Mbps, the report says. "In all tests, the iPhone 7 Plus with the Qualcomm modem had a significant performance edge over the iPhone 7 Plus with the Intel modem," the report says. There are some other shenanigans going on, too. Qualcomm's X12 modem supports a coding scheme called 256 QAM, which further speeds up LTE connections. That hasn't been activated on the iPhone 7, possibly to level the playing field with the Intel modem, which doesn't have the feature. //Related Articles If You Want to Switch Carriers, Buy Verizon's iPhone 7 "Ironically, mobile operators such as T-Mobile USA and Telstra, which have been offering these advanced LTE features, are being supplied with the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem," the report says. If this makes you ask the question of why Apple decided to go with an inferior Intel modem in the first place, you're not alone. Apple isn't saying. But as I've spoken to independent analysts, a picture became clear. Qualcomm is the leader in LTE, and Apple has been using their modems since the iPhone 4s generation. But Qualcomm tends to drive hard bargains. Intel hasn't had a big modem win with its XMM7360 devices before, so the company may have been an easier partner for Apple to deal with. That said, for consumers, the choice is clear: if you care about getting the best connection with weak signal on your iPhone, it's worth grabbing one of those unlocked models from the Apple Store. They will have the superior Qualcomm modem. Back to top Previous : Verizon Gets Its First Mediatek-Powered Phone, the LG Stylo ...

X Intel wins support in battle to overturn EU antitrust fine European court’s final decision could affect Apple fight over €13bn Irish tax bill Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 17:22 Intel, based in Santa Clara, California. The technology giant has been fighting to overturn a €1.06bn EU antitrust fine. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         Intel’s fight to overturn a record €1.06 billion European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving US tech giants, from Google to Apple. Intel’s appeal should be totally re-examined by a lower court, which blundered by ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips, advocate general Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice said in a nonbinding opinion on Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within six months. “If the court follows, this could be the most important ruling of the past 25 years because it’s the complete destruction of the judgment of the General Court, but also of the European Commission’s position,” said Damien Geradin, a lawyer at Edge Legal in Brussels. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The commission in Brussels and Intel declined to comment. Spotlight on Apple A victory for Intel would throw the spotlight on EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of an investigation that culminated in the iPhone maker facing a €13 billion tax bill. The Intel ruling may also affect the EU’s handling of investigations into Google and Qualcomm that could ultimately lead to fines. Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the €497 million penalty against Microsoft in 2004. It represented about 4 per cent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 per cent of yearly sales that regulators can impose. ADVERTISEMENT In light of “the errors committed” by the General Court, Mr Wahl said a final ruling by the top tribunal was not possible at this stage. “That is because a decision on the merits hinges upon the examination of all the circumstances of the case,” he said, and of “the actual or potential effect of Intel’s conduct on competition” in the EU. If Intel ultimately prevails, it would be the commission’s first defeat in a case concerning so-called abuse of dominance by a company for many years, said Trevor Soames, a competition lawyer in Brussels. “The line of success on the part of the commission will be stopped in its tracks. “One of the big problems in dominance cases over the last 10 years has been a lack of confidence that, on appeal in Luxembourg, there would be a substantive review” and “that basically you were almost inevitably going to lose a dominance appeal”, Mr Soames said. While urging a review of the case, Mr Wahl said the fact that the fine was record-breaking doesn’t necessarily mean it was inappropriate – provided it is eventually shown that Intel broke EU law. Impeded competition The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002-2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 per cent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5 per cent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices, which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The EU ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Added details Mr Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the investigation and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Advanced Micro Devices, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and did not intervene in the EU court hearings. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Damien Geradin Nils Wahl Trevor Soames Intel Read More Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs Brexit casts shadow over Irish retailers in run-up to Christmas Mixed-use commercial building in Galway on sale for €1.3m Revamped mock Georgian offices on Leeson Street for rent Britvic’s Kilcarbery Business Park warehouse has price tag of over €15m Agent gets 17.5% above asking price using BidX1 technology Lynam’s Hotel bought by private investor for nearly €6m Ciarán Hancock: Buying Peacock will take Greencore to new level Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Major Bray shopping and cinema complex to go ahead Ulster Bank HQ expected to attract UK financial institutions UK group secures €22m profit on Irish Nationwide's Dublin HQ Lundin sells Clare site to new mining company Unions to seek rises of 4% for workers in private sector companies Martin McGuinness says he was ‘in the dark’ over Project Eagle Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Global perspective. advertisement Europe court advisor issues opinion favoring Intel appeal against antitrust fine Thursday 20 October 2016 at 1:40 PM ET by Ashley Hogan ©  WikiMedia (M.O. Stevens) [JURIST] Advocate General Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice [official website] issued an opinion [text, PDF] on Thursday in favor of Intel in the dispute over a €1.06 billion EU antitrust fine imposed for anti-competitive behavior. Wahl questioned whether the fine received for abuse of Intel's dominant position, namely in giving rebates to customers and certain deals made with Lenovo, had really harmed competition. While the opinion given by Wahl is not binding on the court, it is suggested that the General Court's decision to dismiss Intel's appeal in regards to the fine imposed by the European Commission should be set aside and the question referred back to the General Court to examine all the circumstances of the case to properly determine the actual or potential effect of Intel's conduct on competition within the EU internal market. The ECJ will consider the opinion and decide in the coming months. The European Commission, the executive of the EU, has taken action against many large companies operating in the European market. In August the European Commission ruled [JURIST report] that Ireland may recover up to €13 billion from Apple [corporate website] after the company benefited from undue tax breaks. The commission ruled the tax breaks were illegal based on EU law because the tax benefit meant that Apple paid less taxes to operate in the country than other businesses, resulting in an unfair economic advantage. In April the Commission opened a probe [JURIST report] into the international business practices of Google concerning the tech giant's relationship with other Android developers, questioning whether Google's practice of requiring mobile phone producers to pre-load Google applications on new devices could hinder innovation and might violate international antitrust law.

Intel's 7th generation Core CPUs for laptops were launched at the end of August, and we have already seen some products sporting these new efficient processors, but we have to wait until January 2017 for 7th gen desktop processors to become officially available. Tech site WCCF Tech took note of a pair of interesting reports from China where users are apparently testing out officially unreleased Intel Kaby Lake desktop chips. One source tried overclocking an Intel Core i7-7700 on LN2, another an Intel Core i5-7600K on air. Both used a 100-series motherboard with the latest Kaby Lake supporting BIOS. Intel Core i7-7700K HKEPC Hardware has had its hands on an Intel Core i7-7700K and decided to give it a test run to its limits using LN2 cooling. The system was based upon an ASRock Z170M OC Formula motherboard with GALAX HOF DDR4 memory installed. An x67 multiplier was used to achieve a clock speed of 6.7GHz. The bus speed wasn't tweaked and we don't have any details regarding voltages, unfortunately.   Intel Core i5-7600K A person/group by the name of FacebookHK has been twiddling with an Intel Core i5-7600K chip for at least a week now. Using an ASUS Maximus VIII Gene motherboard and air cooling it was possible to coax the Kaby Lake i5 to achieve 5.1GHz using just an air cooler. The chip ran at an x40 multiplier, the bus speed was tweaked to 127.51MHz, with the voltage set to 1.504V. This system was reported to be stable with good temperature readings, no core went above 46C when taxed. Last but not least, Expreview has had its hands on a 'retail' Core i5-7600K chip and reports that the substrate should not suffer from bending under cooler attachment pressure. Thankfully Kaby Lake's PCB and its heatsink package appear to be more robust than on Skylake chips.

October 20 AAPL: 117.06 -0.06 Report: iPhone 7 models w/ Qualcomm modem feature better cellular performance versus Intel Jeff Benjamin - 4 weeks ago @JeffBenjam iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In this latest iPhone generation, Apple has brought to market two iPhone 7 variants: the GSM/WCDMA/LTE with Intel modem version, and the GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE version with Qualcomm hardware. A new report is highlighting the first performance differences between the iPhone 7 featuring Intel’s modem hardware compared to the iPhone 7 featuring Qualcomm modem hardware. The report from Cellular Insights finds that iPhone 7’s equipped with Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem, which powers the (A1660, A1661) Verizon, Sprint, and SIM-free models, features better cellular performance than the (A1778, A1784) Intel version. Not only that, but the Qualcomm version’s ability to take advantage of Ultra HD Voice has been disabled as well according to the report. Ultra HD Voice The first interesting point gleaned from Cellular Insights’ report is that Qualcomm’s MDM9645M modem is capable of Ultra HD Voice, which is the marketing name for the Enhanced Voice Services codec, or EVS. EVS can result in significantly improved audio quality over cellular connections, but according to this report, Apple decided to disable this feature. It’s a decision that Cellular Insights claims may be an attempt to level the playing field with the Intel-powered version of the iPhone 7. As of now, only T-Mobile has deployed EVS on its network, so coverage is limited in the US. T-Mobile says that EVS brings several notable benefits to its customers, including the following: EVS improves voice call reliability in areas of weaker signal, which means the rare dropped call on LTE will happen even less frequently. EVS provides even higher-fidelity calls than the HD Voice. EVS does this with a broader audio frequency range, which translates to richer, more realistic-sounding voice audio. It’s ironic, because T-Mobile customers are being supplied with the iPhone 7 (Intel version), which isn’t capable of supporting this feature from a hardware perspective. It should be noted that at least two other T-Mobile-compatible phones, the LG G5 and the Samsung Galaxy S7, support EVS. If you’re not on T-Mobile, then this isn’t a big deal, as no other carriers appear to support Ultra HD Voice at the moment. That could change in the future, however, and since the AT&T and T-Mobile versions aren’t capable of supporting the feature from a hardware perspective, we probably won’t see support for EVS until future iPhone models are released. But the EVS/Ultra HD Voice details aren’t the only interesting data points to trickle in from this report. The information contains RF tests that pit the Qualcomm version of the iPhone 7 Plus vs the Intel version. Cellular Insights says that it procured the iPhone 7 Plus units and all test hardware from Rohde & Schwarz using its own funding for independent analysis. Cellular performance The report begins by measuring the LTE throughput for both devices in order to compare data between the Intel-powered and Qualcomm-powered iPhone 7 Plus models. The findings are quite interesting. Both versions of the iPhone 7 Plus were able to achieved maximum sustained data throughput while at cell center, but when reducing power levels to simulate edge of cell scenarios, each phone responded differently. For example, in the graph above, you can see how Band 12 (10MHz) performance differs between the two basebands during a controlled environment test. Notice how the throughput drops drastically on the XMM7360 (Intel) version as power levels are reduced. Band 12, which is a low frequency band, can propagate further, and penetrate walls better than high frequency bands. In other words, it’s a band that is frequently needed when using LTE inside of buildings. Note the significant difference in throughput around -108 dBm. Cellular Insights tested two additional LTE bands as well: Band 4 (20MHz), and Band 7 (20MHz) in 4×2 MIMO. The results, as you can see, follow the same trend. Be sure to check out Cellular Insight’s test page for the full explainer. There you’ll find details on testing methods used, hardware used, etc. You can also find its results and corresponding graph when testing Band 7, and see how the iPhone 7’s modem performance stacks up to other devices, like the Galaxy S7 and the LG G5. It’s an enlightening read on a technical level that’s well worth the time. Conclusion After testing, the conclusion is that the iPhone 7 hardware with the Qualcomm-powered modem has a significant cellular modem performance edge over the Intel variant. As to why Apple has sourced two baseband suppliers after years of using Qualcomm hardware exclusively, it likely has much to do with broadening its supply chain. In this case, however, it looks like supply chain diversification has resulted in a measurable performance difference between the two models in a lab-controlled environment. Of course, controlled tests differ from real world usage and scenarios, but these findings are nonetheless interesting. I tend not to read too much into this data, because Apple has no-doubt tested both models, and found that each performed satisfactorily in real world usage. Also worth noting is that the iPhone 7 with the Qualcomm modem is only being sold in China, Japan and in the United States, which means that Apple deemed the Intel version to be good enough for every other territory. That said, if you’re buying an iPhone 7 for full price in one of the aforementioned territories, then I highly recommend going with the Verizon/Sprint/SIM-free version. Not only does this version seem to perform better from a cellular modem perspective, but it’s also capable of working with most cellular carriers in the US and abroad.

Page 1 of 3. 13 Comments It's been a while since last running any major Linux graphics tests with Intel Haswell era hardware, but in preparing for a big Linux 3.x/4.x kernel comparison with a Core i7 Haswell, I ran some fresh graphics benchmarks with OpenGL and Vulkan. The system used for testing is an Intel Core i7 4790K Devil's Canyon rig with HD Graphics 4600. The system had a clean install of Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 where i ran some out-of-the-box tests followed by tests of Mesa Git (12.1-dev this week, now 13.0 Git) and then a third run with the Mesa Git Padoka PPA stack paired with the Linux 4.9 Git kernel. Thus it's a very fresh look at the Vulkan and OpenGL experience with Haswell. With the upcoming Mesa 13.0 release (and on Mesa Git master), OpenGL 3.3 is still the latest version exposed... Floating around for a while has been the FP64 patches for Haswell Mesa to enable OpenGL 4.0 with this generation of Intel GPUs, but they have yet to be merged and thus will not be found in next month's Mesa 13.0 stable release. So sadly Haswell is still at GL 3.3 for now but hopefully it won't be too much longer before it sees FP64 for GL 4.0. Broadwell and newer graphics hardware has OpenGL 4.5 with the upcoming Mesa 13.0. Also tested was Dota 2 with Vulkan. The Intel "ANV" Vulkan driver does work for Haswell GPUs. The Intel ANV driver exposes Vulkan 1.0 with Haswell. I believe this is my first time testing Vulkan with Haswell compared to my extensive Broadwell and Skylake testing. While Haswell is much slower, Dota 2 was running and it appeared to render the game correctly. Other Phoronix readers though have reported Haswell Vulkan Linux issues previously with this combination not being as well vetted by the open-source drivers as with the newer and more powerful hardware. During the testing of this latest code, I did encounter what appeared to be some messed up damage tracking when using Firefox on this system. Well, on the following pages are some results of this i7-4790K Haswell system with OpenGL and Vulkan on Mesa Git and Linux 4.9. All tests done by the Phoronix Test Suite.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home Press Releases Laptops Razer unveils new Razer Blade Pro gaming notebook Posted: Oct 20, 2016 5:37 pm | Laptops Press Releases | Stock Ticker: NASDAQ:ADBE, OTCMKTS:HTCXF, NASDAQ:INTC, NASDAQ:NVDA, NASDAQ:FB Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Razer, the leading lifestyle brand for gamers, today announced the new 17-inch Razer Blade Pro. Completely redesigned from ground up, the system is made specifically for enthusiasts and power users who want desktop performance but don't want to sacrifice portability. Packed with more power than ever before possible in a notebook under an inch thick, Razer's latest system is capable of handling virtually any task, anytime, anywhere.     The new Razer Blade Pro debuts as the thinnest and lightest desktop replacement in the world with a 17.3-inch G-Sync IGZO display, Intel's latest quad-core i7 CPU, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, up to 2 TB of SSD storage and an ultra-low profile mechanical keyboard   The new Razer Blade Pro features the latest Intel Core i7 quad-core processor and next-generation NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. It is the most powerful system ever built by Razer and the thinnest notebook available with a GTX 1080. Other highlights on the new Razer Blade Pro include Thunderbolt 3 for advanced connectivity options, 32 GB of DDR4 dual-channel memory, up to 2 TB of PCI M.2 SSD in RAID 0 storage and a built-in SD card reader.   While other similarly equipped desktop replacements are more than two inches thick and weigh more than 10 pounds, the new Blade Pro retains its iconic form factor. Its unibody CNC aluminum chassis still measures just 0.88 inches thin while weighing less than eight pounds. The included AC adapter also dwarfs similarly powered systems and complements the overall mobility of the Blade Pro.     Even more remarkable is the system's thermal management system. This all new thermal management system in the Blade Pro now includes the worlds thinnest manufactured vapor chamber cooling solution in a notebook. The vapor chamber reduces heat resistance and hotspots by spreading heat quickly, evenly and efficiently. A custom fan design and dynamic heat exchanger are paired with the vapor chamber to maximize heat dissipation. This allows the Razer Blade Pro to be the most powerful computer ever assembled in such a thin chassis.   The rest of the desktop replacement notebook offers a similar no-compromises approach. A stunning 17.3-inch 4K IGZO monitor with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology produces the smoothest possible framerates. The display offers 100 percent Adobe RGB color accuracy to deliver stunning visuals to gamers and professionals.   Additionally, the Razer Blade Pro is the first notebook to utilize Razer's Ultra-Low-Profile Mechanical switches. Each switch features a true actuation and reset point. Presses are registered with 65 grams of force, mimicking the feel of full-size mechanical keyboards. The keyboard and trackpad are also Powered by Razer Chroma. This technology unlocks a virtually endless array of dazzling lighting effects that can be customized by the user or synced to display in-game events.   The specs for the Blade Pro exceed minimum hardware requirements of HTC Vive , Oculus Rift and OSVR HDK 2, making it one of the most mobile VR-ready devices for enthusiasts and developers.     "The original 17-inch Blade was the first laptop that truly blended power and portability in a PC," says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. "We've taken that approach another step further with the new Razer Blade Pro. The thermal engineering behind it is staggering. It's incredible how far we've come, from having one product and a small team, to today, with a full catalog of gaming systems and a large group of engineers and designers pushing what a portable gaming machine can do."   "It's impressive what Razer was able to pack into the new Razer Blade Pro," said Mark Aevermann, senior product lead for GeForce gaming laptops at NVIDIA. "They have managed to design a gaming laptop with our flagship GeForce GTX 1080, in a form factor gamers can take with them on the road."   The 17-inch Blade Pro joins the rest of Razer's award-winning systems lineup. The 14-inch Razer Blade sets the benchmark for mobile gaming, while the 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth was named the "Best PC" at CES earlier this year for its combination of performance, value, expandability and portability. Both models recently announced refreshes that are shipping now.   For more information on the new Razer Blade Pro, and to register to be notified about on-sale timing, visit razerzone.com/bladepro.

Razer Blade vs Stealth vs Pro: Which gaming laptop is best? by Sean Keach 20 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments Razer Blade vs Stealth vs Pro: What's the difference? To the eternal disappointment of UK fans, Europe had always missed out on Razer’s hugely popular line of gaming notebooks. But that’s all changed, as Razer unleashes three new gaming laptops on the continent: Razer Blade Stealth, Razer Blade and Razer Blade Pro. What’s the difference, and which one should you buy? Related: Best gaming laptop Razer Blade The Razer Blade is the mid-tier option out of Razer’s new laptop trio. It’s a gaming laptop that's been designed to be as portable as possible, which explains why it’s lighter than a MacBook Pro, and only marginally thicker than a MacBook Air. What’s exciting about the Razer Blade is that, unlike the old model, it features a proper desktop GPU – specifically, Nvidia’s new GeForce GTX 1060. That means it’s VR-ready, and should be capable of playing most games at Full HD resolution. Note also that this is the full-fat 6GB GDDR5 VRAM version of the GTX 1060, rather than the cheaper 3GB variant, which is good news. Unlike the other two Razer laptops, the new Blade is using an older 6th-generation Intel processor. You’ll also get a choice between 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options, and either a Full HD or QHD+ 14-inch display. The Razer Blade is attractively designed, a sports a thin, black aluminium chassis that won’t look massively out of place in a home or work environment. It’s the ideal choice for people who need computing heft on the move. Here are the Razer Blade’s key specs: Screen: 14-inch IGZO QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) multi-touch / IPS Full HD Matte (1,920 x 1,080) CPU: 6th-gen Intel Core i7-6700HQ (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5 VRAM) Storage: 256GB / 512GB / 1TB PCIe SSD RAM: 16GB DDR4 (2,133MHz) Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, 3x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm Battery: 70Wh Size: 17.9mm x 345mm x 235mm Weight: 1.89kg (Full HD) / 1.95kg (QHD+) You can pre-order the Razer Blade now at Razer’s online store in the UK, US, Germany and France, with shipping expected to begin “within a couple of weeks”. It costs £1,749, $1,799 or €1,999, and comes with a free Razer Mamba Tournament Edition gaming mouse and Razer Mercenary backpack. Razer Blade Stealth The Razer Blade Stealth is the cheapest option, and is arguably just a plain, old ultrabook, rather than a gaming notebook. It’s thinner and lighter than a 13-inch MacBook Air, and features a new 7th-generation Intel Core i7 processor. It also packs an impressive 16GB of RAM, but misses out on dedicated graphics. You’ll have to settle for integrated Intel HD Graphics 620, which rules out any high-performance gaming. But don’t fret, because Razer has a workaround in the shape of the Razer Core. The Core is a dedicated external graphics enclosure that sits on your desk, and connects to your laptop via Thunderbolt 3. It’s fully compatible with the latest Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, including the top-end GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. The Stealth will cost you £999, while the Core will set you back a further £399, which means that both of them together still cost less than a Razer Blade. And importantly, there’s the potential to have the Stealth running on a GPU that’s even more powerful than the Blade’s built-in GTX 1060. Of course, you'll have to actually pay for a GPU to stick in the Core, so you'll need to factor that cost in. That said, when you’re on the go, you’ll have to settle for slightly less processing power. But if you use your laptop for basic tasks on the move, and only really play video games at home, the Blade Stealth is a seriously impressive alternative – especially considering the 4K display option. Here are the Razer Blade Stealth’s key specs: Screen: 12.5-inch IGZO multi-touch – QHD (2,560 x 1,440) / UHD (3,840 x 2,160) CPU: 7th-gen Intel Core i7-7500U (2.7GHz / 3.5GHz) GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620 (integrated) Storage: 128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB PCIe SSD RAM: 16GB LPDDR3 (1,866MHz) Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, 2x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0a, 3.5mm Battery: 53.6Wh Size: 13.1mm x 321mm x 206mm Weight: 1.29kg You can buy the Razer Blade Stealth in the UK, US, Germany and France for £999, $999 or €1,099. It also comes with a free copy of the FL Studio photo editing software, worth €189. And if you buy one before the end of October, you’ll get a Razer Orochi gaming mouse and a Razer Kabuto mousepad for free. Meanwhile, the Razer Core external graphics enclosure costs £499 or €599. But if you buy it at the same time as you purchase a Razer Blade Stealth, the price is reduced to £399 or €449. Razer Blade Pro The Razer Blade Pro is the crème de la crème of Razer’s gaming notebook trio. It’s envisioned as a true desktop replacement, and the spec sheet makes it clear why. First off, you’re getting Nvidia’s flagship desktop graphics card built-in – that’s the GeForce GTX 1080, with 8GB of GDDR5X VRAM. That sits alongside Intel’s 6th-gen Core i7-6700HQ, which has a mighty peak clock speed of 3.5GHz. That's still a laptop processor, mind, but it'll beat some desktop chips all the same. The multi-touch display spans 17.3-inches, and features a 3,840 x 2,160 pixel resolution. Better still, it’s got Nvidia’s anti-screen tearing G-Sync technology built-in. You can choose from three different PCIe SSD storage options (512GB / 1TB / 2TB), with all models shipping with 32GB of dual-channel 2,133MHz DDR4 RAM. Perhaps one of the standout features is the low-profile mechanical keyboard, which is unique among gaming laptops. Despite looking like a traditional chiclet keyboard, all keys feature mechanical switches and individual backlighting, which means that the laptop is also fully Chroma-enabled. The Razer Blade Pro is comfortably the biggest laptop of the trio, with a height of 22.5mm and a weight of 3.54kg. But it’s only a few millimetres thicker than a MacBook Pro, and features seriously impressive hardware that will rival (and likely beat) many advanced desktop PC configurations. If you’re not keen on having a giant desktop PC in your home, the Razer Blade Pro is seriously worth considering. Add in the fact that, despite being heavy, it’s still technically portable – moreso than a desktop PC, anyway – then the value is clear. But it’s a tough sell to most gamers thanks to its staggeringly high price tag. Here are the Razer Blade Pro’s key specs: Screen: 17.3-inch IGZO UHD (3,840 x 2,160) multi-touch (with Nvidia G-Sync) CPU: 7th-gen Intel Core i7-6700HQ (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X VRAM) Storage: 512GB / 1TB / 2TB PCIe SSD RAM: 32GB dual-channel DDR4 (2,133MHz) Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, 3x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0, 3.5mm, SDXC card reader Battery: 99Wh Size: 22.5mm x 424mm x 281mm Weight: 3.54kg You can buy the Razer Blade Pro in the UK, US, Germany, and France for £3,499, $3,699 or €4,199. Which Razer Blade laptop should I buy? Here, we have three laptops designed for three very different kinds of gamer, and you’ll find good and bad points about each. If performance is the only metric you measure a laptop’s worth by, then the Razer Blade Pro (£3,499) is the obvious choice. It’s absolutely a ‘money is no object’ purchase; many gamers wouldn’t dream of dropping nearly four grand on a laptop. But if you’re done with desk-hogging PCs and you’re flush with cash, then the Razer Blade Pro is hard not to recommend. That said, it’s very bulky, so if you want to use this laptop on the move, consider an alternative Blade. The Razer Blade is far more portable that the Blade Pro, but it’s significantly less powerful. If you can deal with toning down the graphics settings or resolution on more demanding games, this is a great choice. Better still, you can use this laptop for video editing, and just about any other work too. But at £1,749, it’s hardly cheap, so you have to consider whether a Stealth would suit your needs better. Razer's Blade Stealth laptop could be perfect for at-home gamers in need of an ultrabook The Razer Blade Stealth is the thinnest and lightest of the bunch, and will hardly be noticeable when lugged around in a backpack. And at £999, it’s really competitively priced. But the trade-off is that you won’t be able to game seriously unless you’re connected up to the Razer Core graphics enclosure. Still, there’s potentially good value to be had. A Razer Blade Stealth £999 paired with a £399 Razer Core, plus an Nvidia GTX 1080 (~£670), will cost you £2,068. That’s pricier than the Blade, but it’ll get you a GTX 1080 rig for far less than a Blade Pro would cost. Of course, you’ll still have to settle for a smaller screen, less RAM and a weaker processor, but it’s ideal for the at-home gamer looking for an ultrabook. Only you know whether any of the new Razer Blade laptops will suit your needs, but there’s no denying that all three are impressive products, and are all definitely worth your consideration.

And, could you point me to the buy stealth + core offer ? The core only has a "notify me" option right now. Sean Keach October 21, 2016, 9:51 am Hi Crazyjc, thanks for commenting! There are Blade and Blade Stealth models that were released earlier in 2016 that use 6th generation models. But according to the press release and briefing, the new Stealth and new Pro use 7th gen, while Blade uses 6th gen. However, I'll contact the Razer PR team now to clarify this and make sure the info is correct! crazyjc October 21, 2016, 10:11 am Awesome! Thanks Sean ! Super excited these are finally here, and was wondering why the latest models aren't. James Adina October 30, 2016, 5:08 am Are you on the American site? I am in Australia and the 7th gen processor razer blade stealth aswell as the core (has 'notify me') aren't available here but they are in America. Jason Dimopoulos November 7, 2016, 2:56 pm The website says the the Blade is compatible with the Core as well. Would there be much benefit from using the core with a blade seeing as the blade has an almost full spec graphics card already? Or would they actually work together to make a monster of a graphics handling system? FYI, I'm interested for 4k video editing rather then pure gaming.

The A1778 and A1784 iPhone models use a GSM-only Intel XMM7360 modem while the A1660 and 1661 iPhone models use a GSM/CDMA-compatible Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. Apple's decision has already caused some disappointment among customers because the GSM-only Intel modem is not compatible with as many carrier networks as the GSM/CDMA Qualcomm modem, and now independent testing conducted by Cellular Insights suggests there are some significant performance differences between the two modems, with the Qualcomm modem outperforming the Intel modem. Using an R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box, two R&S CMW500, one R&S CMWC controller, and four Vivaldi antennas, Cellular Insights created a setup to simulate LTE performance at different distances from a cellular tower using two iPhone 7 Plus devices, one with an Intel modem and one with a Qualcomm modem. The goal of the test was to measure the highest achievable LTE throughput starting at a Reference Signal Received Quality of -85dBm (a strong signal) and gradually reducing the power level to simulate moving away from a cellular tower where signal is weaker. Three LTE bands were tested: Band 12, Band 4 (the most common band in North America), and Band 7. In all three tests, both the iPhone 7 Plus models offered similar performance in ideal conditions, but as power levels decreased, Cellular Insights saw "unexplainable sharp dips in performance" in the Intel modem, finding a gap "north of 30%" in favor of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus. In the charts, the Qualcomm modem maintains noticeably higher throughput speeds than the Intel modem as signal strength decreases. In real world conditions, this would suggest the Qualcomm modem does better in areas where the cellular connection is weak, with faster throughput speeds. Cellular Insights describes the Band 12 test below: Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. [...] At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the QualcommCellular Insights also created a chart that compares the edge of cell performance of several different smartphones. The increasing numbers on the X-axis below represent increasingly poor signal strength, while on the Y-axis, a higher throughput number indicates better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem demonstrates the poorest performance of all phones tested. According to Cellular Insights, in every single test, the iPhone 7 Plus with a Qualcomm modem "had a significant performance edge" over the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem. For more information on the testing methodology and greater technical detail on the results, make sure to check out Cellular Insights' full comparison article.

First, it is severely constrained when traveling abroad. And now, even when at home, it is inferior to the same price Qualcomm version. Shame on you Apple. Give a partial refund to customers with an Intel modem. You sell two products at the same price, one is clearly inferior to the other, but you don't tell customers. You should charge less for the Intel version.

(Photo: Intel) Even with good grades, after high school graduation, Maria Reyes did not think of herself as a future engineer. Thankfully, a college recruiter helped her understand otherwise. “I was good in math and science, but I didn’t even have any idea what an engineer was,” she recalled. Reyes did go on to become a civil engineer and earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the field. Today, she is the dean of Industry and public service for Phoenix College. In that role, she is afforded the opportunity to shape the minds and careers of today’s Latinas, a sub-group that makes up only about 2 percent of the scientists and engineers in the country, according to the National Science Foundation. Although STEM degrees for both Latinos and Latinas are rising, there is still plenty of room for improvement. So, rather than have future Latinas second guess their career paths as she did, Reyes wants them to know that a STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) career is certainly possible - if they’re willing to make the commitment. Programming Latinas for success More than 12 years ago, Reyes partnered with Intel Corp. to create Hermanas, a program where valley high school and middle school Latinas attend a day-long seminar at a select Maricopa Community College location. "The Hermanas conference has been so successful that the model has been replicated at other Intel sites including Oregon and Guadalajara,” said Intel’s Director of Public Affairs, Carlos Contreras. The events have three critical components: A hands-on STEM activity conducted by a community college faculty member; a Latina Town Hall where Latina STEM professionals share their stories and answer questions, and an educational resource fair that allows attendees to receive STEM-tailored advising for high school and beyond. “The conferences are designed to expose them to role models, first and foremost. … We also want girls to envision themselves as scientists or working in technology.” Reyes added. “We are targeting young women who may not have ever thought about these careers.” There are six events per year. Fall gatherings target middle schoolers while spring events seek high school Latinas. The program has served more than 4,000 attendees since inception. The effort, now in its 12th year, received Intel seed funding early on and now sees financial support from the Intel Involved Matching Grants program, which allocates $10 for every volunteer hour the company logs to the nonprofit. Events have been held at Phoenix College, Estrella Mountain Community College, South Mountain and Chandler-Gilbert Community College and several other campuses. Hermanas partners with valley school districts whose counselors evaluate students they feel would benefit from the event. Hermanas also taps Intel’s Latino Employee Network and Latina Working Group for speakers and mentors. “This is a true public-private partnership,” Reyes noted. “We draw on Latina role models in STEM from anywhere we can.” And-or Maria Harper-Marinick, chancellor of the Maricopa Community Colleges District, frequently speaks at Hermanas events. Harper-Marinick, who arrived in Arizona in the 1980s as a Fulbright Scholar and then launched her career in education in the Grand Canyon State, always attempts to connect with young Latinas by seeing them as her own children. “I speak to them, in many cases, as I would my daughter. Part of what I tell them is that you don’t need to choose between being an engineer or a mother. These aren’t ‘or’ choices. We have ‘and’ choices,” she said. “We have not been told that that’s a choice. Some of it is cultural; some is myth that it’s too hard for us to be both. … Then, for reasons I don’t know, many (Latinas) think ‘I’m not good at math.’ … Part of what we’re trying to say is that maybe you’re better than you think.” Harper-Marinick appreciates Hermanas’ attempts at, first and foremost, making the science activities during each program fun. Then, during the second half of the day, she sees the advising opportunities as critical. They allow Latinas interested in STEM careers to tailor high school classes in a way that would be beneficial for attending college without then needing to take too many remedial courses. “Some of them want it, but they may not take the right courses in high school,” she added. “It’s so important to help them understand that piece.” For more information about how to engage with Hermanas visit: www.cgc.edu/hermanas.

In May 2009 the European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 1.06 billion on the US-based microchip manufacturer for abusing its dominant position on the market for x86 CPUs (central processing units), in infringement of EU antitrust rules. In addition, the EU executive ordered Intel immediately to bring an end to that infringement in so far as it had not done so already. Intel, it said, had abused its dominant position on the worldwide market for x86 CPUs from October 2002 to December 2007, by implementing a strategy aimed at foreclosing a competitor, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), from the market. As Intel held a market share of roughly 70 per cent or more, it was extremely difficult for competitors to enter the market, said the Commission, and to expand as a result of the unrecoverable nature of investments to be made in research and development, intellectual property and production facilities. According to the Commission, the abuse was characterised by several measures adopted by Intel vis-a-vis its own customers (computer manufacturers) and the European retailer of microelectronic devices, Media-Saturn-Holding. Accordingly, Intel granted rebates to four major computer manufacturers (Dell, Lenovo, HP and NEC) on the condition that they purchased from Intel all, or almost all, of their x86 CPUs. Similarly, Intel awarded payments to Media-Saturn, which were conditioned on the latter selling exclusively computers containing Intel's x86 CPUs. According to the Commission, those rebates and payments induced the loyalty of the four manufacturers listed above and of Media-Saturn, and thus significantly diminished the ability of Intel?s competitors to compete on the merits of their x86 CPUs. Intel's anti-competitive conduct thereby resulted in a reduction of consumer choice and in lower incentives to innovate. On the basis of the 2006 Guidelines, the Commission imposed a fine on Intel of EUR 1.06 billion. Intel brought an action against the Commission's decision before the General Court, seeking the annulment of that decision or, at least, a substantial reduction of the fine. The EU's General Court had dismissed Intel's action in its entirety in 2014. But Intel appealed on several points, including the nature of 'exclusivity rebates', the assessment of market coverage, the interpretation of EU law and the amount of the fine. Advocate General Nils Wahl notes in today's opinion that the General Court found that the rebates granted to Dell, HP, NEC and Lenovo are 'exclusivity rebates' and, because of this classification, did not consider it necessary to consider the capability of such a rebate to restrict competition. The Advocate General concluded that the General Court erred in finding that 'exclusivity rebates' constitute a separate and unique category of rebates that require no consideration of all the circumstances in order to establish an abuse of dominant position. In addition, he determined that the General Court erred in law in its alternative assessment of capability by failing to establish, on the basis of all the circumstances, that the rebates and payments offered by the appellant had, in all likelihood, an anti-competitive foreclosure effect. The Advocate General also upheld the second ground of appeal,concluding that Intel's market share was inconclusive for the purposes of establishing a restriction of competition. The Advocate General reiterated his view that no separate category of 'exclusivity rebates' existed, on the basis that 'exclusivity rebates' would be conditional upon the customer purchasing ?all or most? of its requirements from the dominant undertaking, which is not satisfied in the circumstances of this case. HP and Lenovo could still purchase significant quantities of 86 CPUs from AMD. He also concluded that EU legislation requires the Commission to record interviews to ensure that undertakings suspected of infringing EU competition rules can organise their defence, and that the EU courts can review whether the Commission exercised its powers within the law. Consequently, in his view, the General Court erred in law in holding that the Commission was not in breach of EU law by failing to organise and record a meeting as required under the applicable rules. In fact, the Advocate General does not agree that such a procedural irregularity could be remedied by the later note to file provided by the Commission since that note does not record the substance of the interview that the Commission had with the Dell executive. The Advocate General therefore considers that the fourth ground of appeal must also be upheld. Regarding the fine imposed, the Advocate General considers that the fact that the fine imposed was record-breaking at the time does not in itself make it disproportionate and Intel has failed to point to any legal error committed by the General Court which would permit the Court to assess the proportionality of the fine. As regards the retroactive application of the Commission?s 2006 fining guidelines to conduct that partially predated them, the Advocate General considers that it is EU legislation which defines the limits of the Commission?s discretion in imposing a fine for the infringement of EU competition rules, not the fining guidelines. Provided that the fine imposed remains within the limits of that legislation, Intel cannot rely on the principle of non-retroactivity to contest the fine imposed. So the judgment of the General Court should be set aside, said the Advocate General, and the case referred back for the General Court. While the Advocate General's Opinion is not binding on the Court of Justice, it is rarely overturned.

ASLR (address space layout randomization) is widely used as a defense against attempts by hackers to exploit software vulnerabilities to take control of computers. By randomising the locations of kernel and application components in memory, ASLR limits the ability for evil code, injected into a system, to reliably exploit programming flaws and hijack the attacked application or operating system. Hackers need to know where key components lie in memory in order to successfully exploit a bug, a process that ASLR frustrates. For example, take a booby-trapped PNG file that exploits a bug in an image editor. The software opens the PNG and is tricked into handing control of the processor to code smuggled within the picture – but the exploit code is now running blind. It cannot assume the location of key components that are needed to pivot from basic exploitation to a full compromise of the application and, next, the whole system. ASLR has juggled the libraries and other dependencies around at random, so an algorithm is needed to work out where things have been hidden. The Intel chip flaw can be abused by hackers to bypass this protection, thus ensuring their attacks are much more effective. In order to pull off this technique, miscreants must be able to at least start running their malicious code within an application or operating system on the target machine. The hack takes advantage of the CPU's branch target buffer, a mechanism present in many microprocessor architectures including Intel Haswell CPUs. Exploiting the buffer was demonstrated by the researchers on a Haswell-powered PC running Linux, and this attack is potentially effective against other platforms. The BTB provides a history of branches taken by the processor as it runs through its code: after the CPU is told to make a decision, it usually jumps to another part of the program based on the outcome of that decision. For example, if something fetched from memory has a value greater than zero, then jump to location A or jump to location B if not. If a jump location is in the history buffer then the CPU knows this branch is usually taken so can start priming itself with instructions from the jump landing point. That means branches routinely taken execute with minimal delay. By flooding the BTB with a range of branch targets, hackers can observe the BTB refilling with values of regularly taken jumps. This allows the miscreants to work out where in memory the operating system has randomly placed the application's vital components. It takes a few tens of milliseconds to perform, we're told. The eggheads say this allows an “attacker to identify the locations of known branch instructions in the address space of the victim process or kernel.” Their research, Jump Over ASLR: Attacking Branch Predictors to Bypass ASLR, by boffins at State University of New York at Binghamton and the University of California, Riverside, can be found here [PDF]. Alfredo Pironti, senior security consultant at IOActive, said the vulnerability shows that the security of physical IT (including chips) needs to be considered alongside more commonplace and less esoteric software flaws. “Software isn’t always the easiest point of entry, particularly for those hackers that have a deeper knowledge of hardware and its vulnerabilities,” said Pironti, who added that the ASLR bypass attack is an example of a hardware side-channel attack, an already recognised class of assault. “These attacks are often more expensive and time consuming to conduct, compared to classical software attacks,” Pironti explained. “Usually they also have stricter conditions, such as running a specific software on the victim’s machine and being able to collect CPU metrics. However, this doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be vigilant. Cybercriminals are more sophisticated, well-funded and – worst of all – patient than ever before, and are always looking for new and surprising ways to infiltrate. “This is why it is vital that companies have their chips pen-tested during the development stage, as the cost and complexity of re-mediating an attack of this kind is enormous,” Pironti concluded. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Boffins turn phone into tracker by abusing pairing with – that's right – IoT kit Black Hat EU Security researchers exploit vulns in Belkin home automation product 11 Comments Yeah, that '50bn IoT devices by 2020' claim is a load of dog toffee IDTechX report takes a swipe at other analysts' 'hype bubble' 28 Comments Dell bundles bundle of systems-bundlers into its IoT van Secure or not, it's great if someone's making money Google knifes Eclipse Android Developer Tools Android Studio 2.2 beckons, because what choice is there? 15 Comments Building IoT London: Still working on your pitch?

X Intel wins support in battle to overturn EU antitrust fine European court’s final decision could affect Apple fight over €13bn Irish tax bill Thu, Oct 20, 2016, 17:22 Intel, based in Santa Clara, California. The technology giant has been fighting to overturn a €1.06bn EU antitrust fine. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         Intel’s fight to overturn a record €1.06 billion European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving US tech giants, from Google to Apple. Intel’s appeal should be totally re-examined by a lower court, which blundered by ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips, advocate general Nils Wahl of the European Court of Justice said in a nonbinding opinion on Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within six months. “If the court follows, this could be the most important ruling of the past 25 years because it’s the complete destruction of the judgment of the General Court, but also of the European Commission’s position,” said Damien Geradin, a lawyer at Edge Legal in Brussels. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The commission in Brussels and Intel declined to comment. Spotlight on Apple A victory for Intel would throw the spotlight on EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of an investigation that culminated in the iPhone maker facing a €13 billion tax bill. The Intel ruling may also affect the EU’s handling of investigations into Google and Qualcomm that could ultimately lead to fines. Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the €497 million penalty against Microsoft in 2004. It represented about 4 per cent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 per cent of yearly sales that regulators can impose. ADVERTISEMENT In light of “the errors committed” by the General Court, Mr Wahl said a final ruling by the top tribunal was not possible at this stage. “That is because a decision on the merits hinges upon the examination of all the circumstances of the case,” he said, and of “the actual or potential effect of Intel’s conduct on competition” in the EU. If Intel ultimately prevails, it would be the commission’s first defeat in a case concerning so-called abuse of dominance by a company for many years, said Trevor Soames, a competition lawyer in Brussels. “The line of success on the part of the commission will be stopped in its tracks. “One of the big problems in dominance cases over the last 10 years has been a lack of confidence that, on appeal in Luxembourg, there would be a substantive review” and “that basically you were almost inevitably going to lose a dominance appeal”, Mr Soames said. While urging a review of the case, Mr Wahl said the fact that the fine was record-breaking doesn’t necessarily mean it was inappropriate – provided it is eventually shown that Intel broke EU law. Impeded competition The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002-2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 per cent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5 per cent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices, which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and NEC were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The EU ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Added details Mr Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to rule that regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the investigation and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Advanced Micro Devices, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and did not intervene in the EU court hearings. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Damien Geradin Nils Wahl Trevor Soames Intel Read More Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs Brexit casts shadow over Irish retailers in run-up to Christmas Mixed-use commercial building in Galway on sale for €1.3m Revamped mock Georgian offices on Leeson Street for rent Britvic’s Kilcarbery Business Park warehouse has price tag of over €15m Agent gets 17.5% above asking price using BidX1 technology Lynam’s Hotel bought by private investor for nearly €6m Ciarán Hancock: Buying Peacock will take Greencore to new level Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Major Bray shopping and cinema complex to go ahead Ulster Bank HQ expected to attract UK financial institutions UK group secures €22m profit on Irish Nationwide's Dublin HQ Lundin sells Clare site to new mining company Unions to seek rises of 4% for workers in private sector companies Martin McGuinness says he was ‘in the dark’ over Project Eagle Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Back in 2009, the EC imposed a €1.06bn penalty - 4.15 per cent of Intel's turnover - following a multi-year legal battle but Chipzilla has since twice appealed for the decision to be quashed. An opinion offered by the Advocate General, Nils Wahl, has offered encouragement to Intel's legal eagles; Wahl said a ruling by the EU's General Court — which dismissed Intel's first appeal — was flawed and needed to be sent back to the General Court for review. Wahl's non-binding opinion stressed the dismissal of Intel's appeal was delivered on iffy legal ground, and that the EU's General Court should have another look at the decision because it had overstated the degree to which Intel's rebates to OEMs had distorted the market. Additionally, Wahl noted that Intel's actual agreements with HP and Lenovo – two of the OEMs which Intel had awarded the conditional rebated (Dell and NEC were the others) – did not prevent those companies from purchasing plentiful amounts of x86 processors from rival manufacturers such as AMD, which brought the initial complaint. He added that Intel's market share was contracting towards the end of the ten year period that the General Court looked at, and that in 2007 it simply did not have enough market share for its activities to lessen competition. Wahl's opinion comes ahead of a European High court judgment, expected early next year, to whom the case has been escalated as Intel continues to fight the claim that in awarding conditional rebates to companies based on those companies purchasing the majority of their x86 CPUs from Intel, they were unfairly damaging competitiveness. For the 10 years ending 2007, Intel held 70 per cent of the global market share in x86 CPUs, according to the original ruling against Intel, which didn't bother to answer whether it was necessary to distinguish three separate x86 CPU markets in desktop PCs, notebooks and servers. Intel's conflict with AMD - the only other major x86 manufacturer - is longstanding, with Intel accused of suppressing access to its rival's chips in the first complaint AMD filed to the EU in 2000. It wasn't until May 2004 that the European Commission began to investigate these issues, and in 2009 found that Intel had indeed "implemented a strategy aimed at foreclosing a competitor, AMD, from the market for x86 CPU microprocessors." In his background to the proceedings, Wahl noted how prior to the turn of the millennium "there were several manufacturers of x86 CPUs. However, most of these manufacturers have since exited the market. According to the decision at issue, Intel and AMD are essentially the only two companies still manufacturing x86 CPUs." Intel scored an own goal is supporting OEMs to integrate its chips - some would say this directly accelerated the collapse of the local PC builder community, with the likes of Elonex, Evesham, Tiny and Time going bust as they were unable to compete with the might of the multi-nationals. In 2009, the European Commission found that in its rebates offered to the four aforementioned businesses, Intel had "induced the loyalty of the key OEMs" which "significantly [diminished] competitors’ ability to compete on the merits of their x86 CPUs. As a consequence, Intel’s anti-competitive conduct resulted in a reduction of consumer choice and in lower incentives to innovate" and it subsequently fined Intel €1.6bn.

Maintaining cover: A guide to business insurance Let's have a meeting in the echo chamber Download Current Issue If you cast your mind back to 2009 one of the memorable headlines from that year concerned the EC handing Intel a €1.06bn fine for abusing market dominance. The fine was accompanied by an order from the EC that Intel had to stop giving illegal rebates to PC manufacturers and other practices that were designed to underline its arch rival AMD. Apart from Intel, its lawyers and those in the EC involved in the case the majority of people might have forgotten about the case, but it has come to the fore again with reports that an EU court adviser has backed the chip maker’s appeal against the fine. The fine, which remains the largest ever given to a single company by the EU for antitrust infringement, is naturally something that Intel has been fighting to have reduced. According to Reuters, the firm has some sympathy from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union. Whale is quoted as saying that Intel’s appeal should be upheld, which gives a fresh twist to a seven year old saga. The case came to life in 2009, when Intel was found to have abused its dominant position in the chip market for five years, from late 2002 to the end of 2007 and to have used its market leading position to muscle out AMD. At the time resellers have evidence as part of the investigation and various companies claimed that the anti-competitive behaviour contributed to them going out of business. The case first came to light when AMD filed a complaint in 2000 that alleged that manufacturers had been paid not to use its chips. Up until the Intel fine the highest penalty handed out by the EC was to Microsoft for €474m in 2004 for abusing its dominant market position.​ MicroScope+ Content Find more MicroScope+ content and other member only offers, here.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 20, 2016 at 9:25AM Chris Walker, Intel vice president for its client computing group and general manager of notebook product marketing. Image source: Intel.  After market close on Oct. 18, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported its financial results for the third quarter of the year. One part of this generally strong report that stood out was the fact that the company's operating profit in its client computing group, or CCG for short, jumped substantially year over year. In the third quarter of 2015, Intel's CCG reported $2.433 billion in operating profit, representing a substantial plunge from $3.053 billion in the year prior. This year, not only was CCG able to make up for the decline that it saw last year, but it actually managed to push past the profit levels seen in the third quarter of 2014, achieving a whopping $3.327 billion in operating profit (up 36.74%). Stacy Smith, Intel's EVP of manufacturing, operations, and sales, attributed this growth to three key factors: increased revenue, lower product costs, and lower investment levels. Let's take a closer look at each of these drivers.  Revenue leverage The first factor is simply that Intel's CCG took in more revenue last quarter than it did a year ago. Sales were up from $8.506 billion in the same quarter last year to $8.892 billion. All else being equal (operating expenses, gross profit margins), greater revenue is going to translate into higher profits. Better product manufacturing costs Investors may recall that last year, Intel transitioned a large portion of the products that it sold into the personal computer market from its older, mature 22-nanometer manufacturing technology to its newer, less healthy 14-nanometer technology. Although the move to 14 nanometers helped the company deliver better products for both notebooks and desktops, Intel faced significant manufacturing yield challenges in trying to build chips on this technology. This manifested itself as increased chip manufacturing costs that ultimately hurt Intel's gross profit margins, since Intel couldn't just pass those increased costs onto its customers. A year later, Intel's 14-nanometer technology is much more mature and manufacturing yields have improved a great deal. This has manifested itself as lower product costs, which means that year-over-year gross profit margins in this product segment have gotten better -- helping to bolster the segment's operating profits. Reduced operating expenses Operating profit doesn't just depend on gross profit margins, which are a function of production costs and average selling prices. Operating expenses in the form of research and development and marketing costs play an important role in determining operating margin. Intel announced a fairly dramatic restructuring program back in April of this year designed to lower the company's operating expenses pretty significantly. Since the company indicated that it actually planned to increase its investments in faster-growing areas such as the data center, non-volatile memory, and Internet of Things, it's likely that the bulk of the cost-cutting came from CCG. Indeed, Intel specifically said that one of the key drivers of the operating margin improvement in CCG was that "investment levels declined." Where does this business go from here? Although this business has seen robust profit growth throughout 2016, that outsized profit growth relative to revenue has largely been due to factors that only really come into play once. I don't expect Intel to make further significant operating expense reductions in this segment (cut spending too much and it's hard to deliver leadership products at a rapid cadence), and I doubt that revenue will grow much from here given the state of the personal computer market (flat to down). What I do anticipate is that, going forward, CCG will see roughly flat revenue -- up some years, down some other years, but no big moves -- and fairly stable and substantial operating income.

Click here for this report: http://sa-link.cc/1h4 Continue Reading Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161017/429324 According to this Strategy Analytics research report Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek and Samsung LSI captured the top-five revenue share rankings in the tablet AP market in 1H 2016. Apple led the tablet AP market with 35 percent revenue share, followed by Qualcomm with 18 percent and Intel with 13 percent. Sravan Kundojjala, Associate Director, commented, "The tablet AP market continues to decline and all major tablet AP vendors suffered in 1H 2016. We estimate that ARM-based tablet APs increased their share to 89 percent in 1H 2016 from 83 percent in the same period last year. Intel's tablet AP shipments halved in 1H 2016 as the company shifted its focus away from Atom-based low-end Android tablets and towards Core-based tablets.  Windows-based tablets accounted for the majority of Intel's tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016." Stuart Robinson, Executive Director of the Strategy Analytics Handset Component Technologies service, added, "Our calculations show that baseband-integrated APs accounted for one-third of total tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016. Qualcomm, MediaTek and Spreadtrum represented over 80 percent of total baseband-integrated tablet AP shipments in 1H 2016 and Intel's recent decision to de-emphasize integrated APs will benefit these three vendors in the next few quarters."

Comments By Peter Sayer Follow IDG News Service | Oct 20, 2016 4:39 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Computer Processors Windows PCs Technology Law & Regulation Comments Intel's hope of recovering a record antitrust fine have improved with a recommendation from a top European Union judge on Thursday that the case be reviewed. The company paid the €1.06 billion (then US$1.4 billion) fine in 2009 after the European Commission found it guilty of abusing its dominant position in the market for x86 processors. Since then, it has been seeking to have the judgment overturned, first by the EU's General Court and then, since 2014, by the EU's highest legal authority, the Court of Justice. The CJEU heard that appeal in June, and now Advocate General Nils Wahl has issued his recommendation to the court. The opinions of the court's advocates general are not binding, but it often follows them. Wahl recommended Thursday that the case be referred back to the General Court for review. He disagreed with the lower court's findings on a number of points of law raised by Intel. Those points concerned the Commission's treatment of rebates Intel paid to four computer manufacturers, Dell, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard and NEC on condition that they purchased almost all of their x86 CPUs from it, and payments it made to electronics retailer Media-Saturn on condition it sold only computers containing Intel’s x86 CPUs. The rebates and payments, the Commission said, made it harder for Intel’s competitors to compete on the merits of their x86 CPUs, reducing consumer choice and lowering the incentive to innovate. In his analysis of the General Court's handling of Intel's appeal, Wahl found the court's treatment of the rebates and payments as "exclusivity rebates" led it to overlook the capability of such rebates to restrict competition. Further, he wrote, in the case of HP and Lenovo, there was no question of exclusivity because they were still allowed by their agreements with Intel to purchase significant quantities of x86 processors from AMD. Wahl also doubted whether Intel's market position was dominant enough to be abused. By averaging Intel's market share between 2002 and 2007, he wrote, the court failed to take into account that the company's share was shrinking and by 2007 was no longer sufficient for it to restrict competition. The Commission's failure to record an interview with a Dell executive in accordance with EU law was another point on which Wahl found fault with the lower court's ruling. He even went so far as to question whether the Commission had jurisdiction over some of Intel's alleged market abuse. The lower court failed to assess whether certain agreements between Intel and Lenovo had immediate and foreseeable anticompetitive effects within the European Economic Area, of which the EU is part, he wrote. Intel failed to win Wahl's support on one point, however: the size of the fine. Although it was a record for the EU at the time, that alone doesn't make it disproportionate, and Intel did not point to any legal errors on the part of the General Court in its assessment of the fine. "I agree with the Commission that the arguments put forward by the appellant in relation to the proportionality of the fine must be declared inadmissible," he wrote. The company will now have to wait until next year for the Court of Justice to determine whether to refer the matter back to the lower court.

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo By Pia Oppel and Foo Yun Chee | LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS Intel's (INTC.O) fight against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.16 billion) EU antitrust fine received a boost on Thursday when a top Europe court adviser questioned whether the U.S. chipmaker's actions had really harmed competition. The opinion from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) amounted to a rare setback for the European Commission, underlining the tough battle ahead as it takes on Apple (AAPL.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Google (GOOGL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) in various competition cases. "Intel's appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review," Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission's 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel's challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser's opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl's opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. "The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general's opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong," he said. "Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases." U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel's fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement. The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co (HPE.N), NEC (6701.T) and Lenovo (0992.HK) for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) (Reporting by Pia Oppel, writing by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Mark Heinrich) Next In Technology Photos Twitter to upgrade some features to thwart cyber-bullying Twitter, facing pressure for not doing enough to curb abusive behavior on its platform, said on Tuesday it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in 2009 slapped a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.16 billion) on Intel after it said the company had offered clients price rebates to use its own computer chips in preference to rival AMD. Intel then appealed to the General Court, second only to the European Court of Justice, but lost the case in 2014. In dismissing the appeal that year, the lower EU court had "erred" and the case should now be referred back for the General Court "to examine all the circumstances of the case," the ECJ's Advocate General Nils Wahl said in a statement. The ECJ is not obliged to follow the advocate general's rulings when it hands down its final decision but it frequently does. A victory for Intel would be rare defeat for the European Commission that is facing a similar court battle with Apple over its decision in August to force the iconic iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, in 2009 slapped a record fine of 1.06 billion euros ($1.16 billion) on Intel after it said the company had offered clients price rebates to use its own computer chips in preference to rival AMD. Intel then appealed to the General Court, second only to the European Court of Justice, but lost the case in 2014. In dismissing the appeal that year, the lower EU court had "erred" and the case should now be referred back for the General Court "to examine all the circumstances of the case," the ECJ's Advocate General Nils Wahl said in a statement. The ECJ is not obliged to follow the advocate general's rulings when it hands down its final decision but it frequently does. A victory for Intel would be rare defeat for the European Commission that is facing a similar court battle with Apple over its decision in August to force the iconic iPhone maker to pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland.

Kate needs to replace an ancient laptop and for ergonomic reasons she’d like an all-in-one PC instead The Asus Zen AiO ZN220 comes highly recommended. Photograph: Asus Jack Schofield Thursday 20 October 2016 05.34 EDT Last modified on Thursday 20 October 2016 09.08 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger I have an ancient laptop that needs replacing as soon as possible. I have a desk at home and do not need the portability of a laptop, but I would like an all-in-one to stop me hunching over the screen. I will use it for web browsing, sending emails, collating photos, and tasks like my ancestry research. What would you recommend? Kate All-in-one computers generally use much the same technologies as laptops, but they are packaged differently. You are correct in thinking that all-in-ones are much better ergonomically, and they usually have bigger screens than laptops – typically 20-30in rather than 10-17in. All-in-one PCs are much tidier than desktop PCs, especially if you use a wireless keyboard and mouse. Also, they take up less room and are easier to move around. However, they are not as easy to repair or to expand. Buying more power and more memory than you need will provide some future-proofing. Either way, I recommend you visit a retailer than stocks all-in-ones, such as John Lewis or Currys PC World, so that you can check the screen, construction quality and finish first hand. The keyboard and mouse are not so important as you can easily upgrade these later. Recommended systems For best results, go for an all-in-one with an Intel Core processor, 8GB of memory, a 1TB or larger hard drive, and Microsoft Windows 10. You should be able to do everything you want with a Core i3, but if you can afford it, it’s better to have a Core i5. You don’t need to pay for the extra power of a Core i7. At the time of writing, I’d go for the Asus Zen AiO ZN220IC. This has a 21.5in touch-screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Core i3-6100U processor, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive, all for £579.99. The same AiO PC is also available with a faster Core i5-6400T for £665 or less. Prices and services vary so shop around. There’s also a version with a Core i3 and only 4GB of memory for £499.99. If that’s as far as your budget stretches, it will do the job. The Zen AiO is built like an Apple iMac all-in-one – from the back, they look almost identical – but cheaper. The main drawback is that it’s extremely difficult to open, to add more memory or a faster hard drive. Don’t like the Zen? Dell sells a similar but less stylish all-in-one, the Inspiron 22 3000, with a Core i5-6200U, 8GB of memory and 1TB hard drive for £649 including delivery. Be careful not to confuse it with the older model, which had a kick-stand. HP offers the HP Pavilion 23-q252na with a Core i5-6400T, 8GB of memory and a 2TB hard drive for £749.95. I suspect that’s too much for you. Budget options If you want to spend as little as possible, look at the Lenovo C20. It has a 19.5in non-touch screen, an Intel Celeron J3160 processor, 4GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive and a built-in DVD for £319.99 at PC World, Argos and other stores. It’s obviously not a premium product, but it’s terrific value for money. It has two drawbacks. First, the screen resolution is only 1366 x 768 pixels. Like your old laptop, it’s HD instead of Full HD. Second, the Celeron J3160 is fairly a slow processor, roughly equivalent to an Intel Atom x7-Z8700. The J3160’s main advantage is on-chip support for H.264 and VC1 encoding and decoding, which helps when playing videos. There’s a slightly cheaper version of the Lenovo C20 with a 500GB instead of a 1TB hard drive for £299.99. There’s also a slightly more expensive version (£349.99) with a Pentium J3710 processor. However, this is basically the same chip with a slightly faster graphics unit. In Intel branding terms, Pentiums are better than Celerons, but in this case, it’s not really worth the extra cost. However, both the Celeron J3160 and Pentium J3710 are better than the old Celeron N3050, which only has two processor cores instead of four. John Lewis also offers a C20 variant with the slightly better Pentium J3710 processor and 8GB of memory instead of 4GB, which is reasonable value at £379.95. However, at that level, you’d be better off paying £399.99 for the 21.5in HP 22-b020na. This has a Full HD screen (1920 x 1080 pixels), a Pentium J3710 processor, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive and DVD. It looks nicer than the Lenovo C20, and the extra £80 buys some significant advantages: much better screen resolution, twice the memory, and a slightly faster processor. (Note: be careful not to buy an HP 22-b000na, which has a dual-core Celeron J3060 instead of the quad-core chip.) Upmarket all-in-ones There are plenty of options for users with up to £2,000 to spend on an all-in-one PC. The extra money usually buys you high-resolution 24in, 27in or larger screens, faster Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, dedicated graphics cards, 16GB or 32GB of memory, and very responsive SSD (solid-state disk) drives instead of slow rotating hard drives. There are lots of more powerful versions of the Asus Zen AiO, up to and including the Z240. This has a 4K (3840 x 2160-pixel) screen, an Intel Core i7-6700T with 32GB of memory, an Nvidia GeForce GTX960M graphics card with 4GB of memory, a 1TB hard drive and a 512GB SSD for £1,999.95. HP’s Envy range also has some interesting widescreen models. The Curved 34-a090na, for example, has a 34in widescreen with a resolution of 3440 x 1440 pixels, a Core i7-6700T processor and 8GB of memory for the same £1,999.95 price. For people who prefer the macOS operating system, there are several all-in-one iMacs. The entry level model has a 21.5in screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, a Core i5, 8GB of memory and a 1TB hard drive for £899. A 4K Retina display and a faster Core i5 pushes the price up to £1,119. You can also get iMacs with 27in 5120 x 2880-pixel screens, Core i5 processors and 8GB of memory for £1,449 to £1,849. Upgrading the top model to a fast Core i7, 32GB of memory etc enables you to spend from £2,500 to well over £3,000. However, Apple is launching some new PCs next Thursday (27 October) in San Francisco. I’m not expecting the iMacs to change dramatically, but best wait and see. The Apple event will take place one day later than a Microsoft launch in New York. This could include a rumoured Surface AIO all-in-one, but it won’t be cheap. Have you got another question for Jack?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:50 PM, October 20, 2016 Updated: 6:40 PM, October 20, 2016 LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS - Intel's <INTC.O> fight against a record 1.06 billion euro ($1.16 billion) EU antitrust fine received a boost on Thursday when a top Europe court adviser questioned whether the U.S. chipmaker's actions had really harmed competition. The opinion from Advocate General Nils Wahl at the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) amounted to a rare setback for the European Commission, underlining the tough battle ahead as it takes on Apple <AAPL.O>, Qualcomm <QCOM.O>, Google <GOOGL.O> and Amazon <AMZN.O> in various competition cases. "Intel's appeal against the imposition of a 1.06 billion euro fine for abuse of its dominant position should be upheld. The case should be referred back to the General Court for a fresh review," Wahl said in a non-binding recommendation. He said the General Court failed to establish that the rebates and payments offered by Intel were anti-competitive and that certain deals between the firm and Lenovo harmed European consumers. These were key elements of the Commission's 2009 decision. The General Court rejected Intel's challenge two years ago, saying that the European Commission had not acted too harshly in handing down the record sanction amounting to 4.15 percent of Intel's 2008 turnover against a possible maximum of 10 percent. The ECJ, which usually follows the adviser's opinion in the majority of cases, is expected to rule in the coming months. The Commission declined to comment. Wahl's opinion is a good sign for companies looking for guidance on what kind of rebates should be considered harmful, said Ian Giles, a partner at London-based Norton Rose Fulbright. "The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant. The advocate general's opinion says - on the Intel facts - the Commission got it wrong," he said. "Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the Commission revising its approach in ongoing cases." U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm is fighting EU charges of using anti-competitive methods, including giving rebates, to squeeze a rival. It will lay out its arguments at a hearing on Nov. 10. Intel's fine remains the largest for a single company for an EU antitrust infringement. The EU antitrust enforcer penalized Intel over what it called tactics aimed at stifling rival Advanced Micro Devices <AMD.O>, including giving rebates to PC makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co <HPE.N>, NEC <6701.T> and Lenovo <0992.HK> for buying most of their computer chips from Intel.($1 = 0.9115 euros) REUTERS mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players Yum unit Taco Bell to have 8,000 U.S. outlets by end-2022 World debut: Jaguar unveils all-electric I-Pace SUV With 'change in the air', PM May asks business to help on economy While India plugs black money holes, Indians find leaks What’s most worrying about the current economic climate?

Intel’s appeal should be totally re-examined by a lower court, which blundered by ruling against the company’s system of rebates for PC makers using its chips, Advocate General Nils Wahl of the EU Court of Justice said in a non-binding opinion Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within about six months. “If the court follows, this could be the most important ruling of the past 25 years because it’s the complete destruction of the judgment of the General Court but also of the European Commission’s position," said Damien Geradin, a lawyer at EDGE Legal in Brussels. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The commission in Brussels and Intel declined to comment. EU Spotlight A victory for Intel would throw the spotlight on EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of a probe that culminated in the iPhone maker’s 13 billion-euro tax bill. The Intel ruling may also affect the EU’s handling of probes into Google and Qualcomm Inc. that could ultimately lead to fines. Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004. It represented about 4 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. In light of “the errors committed” by the General Court, Wahl said a final ruling by the top tribunal wasn’t possible at this stage. “That is because a decision on the merits hinges upon the examination of all the circumstances of the case” and of “the actual or potential effect of Intel’s conduct on competition” in the EU. Given this involves a revision of the facts in the case, it will have to be sent back to the lower EU court, he said. The EU’s top court can only analyze points of law. ‘Very Many Years’ If Intel ultimately prevails, it would be the commission’s first defeat in a case concerning so-called abuse of dominance by a company for “very many years,” said Trevor Soames, a competition lawyer in Brussels. “The line of success on the part of the commission will be stopped in its tracks.” "One of the big problems in dominance cases over the last 10 years has been a lack of confidence that on appeal in Luxembourg there would be a substantive review” and “that basically you were almost inevitably going to lose a dominance appeal,” he said. While urging a review of the case, Wahl said the fact that the fine was record-breaking doesn’t necessarily mean it was inappropriate -- provided it is eventually shown that Intel broke EU law. The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002 until 2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 percent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5 percent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Dell Meeting Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp., were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The EU ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to say regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the probe and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Sunnyvale, California-based AMD, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and didn’t intervene in the EU court hearings. The case is:  C-413/14 P, Intel Corporation v. Commission. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

However, after 7 consecutive quarters of declining tablet sales, it is hard to see how Apple’s second best product, the iPad will soon see a slow death despite the fact that it outdid Micrsoft’s Surface tablet PCs as per the last IDC report. The Apple iPhone may be the company’s hero product, but with falling smartphone and tablet sales, Apple now seems to be focussing on a forgotten line of products that started it all, the Mac. Apple’s Mac lineup has been ignored for quite some time now. The only Mac product that Apple sells with an up to date chipset is its recently announced 2016 MacBook. There’s the Mac Pro that stuck with an Intel Ivy Bridge-E CPU, which was last updated in 2013, the MacBook Pro 15-inch which features an Intel Haswell CPU and was updated in 2014 and finally the MacBook Air with an Intel Broadwell CPU. Steve Jobs unveiled the Macbook Air from an envelope and it still looks the same 8 years later. The MacBook Air despite being on of the best value for money buys in Apple’s Mac lineup has yet to see a redesign or an update. It packs in an old TN display with non Retina resolution and a fifth-generation chipset, while Asus, Dell offer the latest for roughly the same price. While I would love to sit and admire Apple’s marketing team (since people are still buying these old systems) it is easy to tell, that Apple’s focus in the past two years was on its iPad. Apple iPad Pro 9.7 inch Apple launched the powerful iPad Pro models last year (November 2015), and it was clear that the company was looking to get PC users under its fold with the same. Soon enough Apple added another Pro variant with the 9.7-inch model with the hopes that those who found the 12-inch too-big would be happy to go in for this one. But that turned out to be a flop show as well. The company lost out because not only were the Pro models priced too high, but they ran the same iOS as its smartphones, which is not something a power user who usually pays for an ultra-book would be interested in. Adding to the mess was Apple’s idea to ape Microsoft with a soft keyboard, that somehow did not cover up for its lacking software productivity. With the tablet sales still declining Apple seems to have woken up and is now for once actually holding an event for its updated Mac lineup. Think of it as a Plan B where the Plan A with the iPad seems to have failed, despite repeated efforts. Apple MacBook 2016 So wit the iPad out fizzing out (they are still planning three new models next year), the next mobile device in line would have to be the old and neglected laptop lineup. So why is the Apple iPad failing? As Digital Trends points out, it is the upgrade cycle. Tablet users simply do not feel the need to upgrade to a new or the latest model, as they are often used for secondary tasks. With smartphones screen sizes getting bigger, more can be accomplished with the device that is in your hand, rather than the one in your bag, that well… needs two hands. Why would one need an iPad Pro (Rs 93,000 256GB) when you have MacBook (Rs 1,00,000 512GB, 8GB RAM) that is equally light, priced the same and can do so much more? Microsoft’s Windows 10 and its manufacturers have moved ahead of Apple when it comes to hardware and software, let’s hope Plan B works out as smartphones and tablets are just not cutting it, while Plan C with the Apple Car just got shelved.

By Matt Bach on Oct 19, 2016, 4:45 PM 16 comments TechSpot Editor’s Note: Matt Bach is the head of Puget Labs and has been part of Puget Systems, a boutique builder of gaming and workstation PCs, since the early days. This article was originally published on the Puget blog. While not yet a common term, over the past year or so we have started to see a rise in the usage of the term "Aggregate CPU Frequency" as a way to estimate the performance between different CPU models. This term appears to be used most often when people are discussing high core count Xeon or dual Xeon CPU configurations, but lately we have seen it used when looking at CPUs with as few as just four cores. At first glance, this term seems reasonable enough: it simply takes the frequency of the CPU (how fast it can complete calculations) and multiplies it by the number of cores (the number of simultaneous calculations it can perform) to arrive at a total or "aggregate" frequency for the processor. For example, below is the number of cores and base frequency for four different CPU models along with their calculated "aggregate frequency": No. of cores Base frequency Aggregate frequency Intel Core i7 6700K 4 cores 4.0 GHz 4*4 = 16 GHz Intel Xeon E5-1650 V3 6 cores 3.5 GHz 6*3.5 = 21 GHz Intel Core i7 6850K 6 cores 3.6 GHz 6*3.6 = 21.6 GHz 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 cores 2.6 GHz 28*2.6 = 72.8 GHz Unfortunately, in the majority of cases trying to estimate the relative performance of a CPU in this manner is simply going to give you inaccurate and wrong results. So before this term begins to be used more commonly, we wanted to to explain why "aggregate frequency" should not be used and give some examples showing how (in)accurate it really is. There are quite a few reasons why "aggregate frequency" is an inaccurate representation of CPU performance, but the largest primary reasons are the following: It is typically calculated using the advertised base frequency Most modern Intel CPUs have a wide range of frequencies they run at including the base frequency (the frequency that is advertised in the model name) and the various Turbo frequencies. Turbo Boost allows the CPU to run at higher frequencies depending on three main factors: the number of cores being used, the temperature of the cores, and the amount of power available to the CPU. On modern desktop systems with quality components, however, the cooling and power considerations are pretty much non-factors which means that the frequency of an Intel CPU should only be limited by the number of cores that are being used. In fact, Turbo Boost is so reliable on modern CPUs that, except in a few edge cases, every system that ships out our door is checked to ensure that it is able to maintain the all-core Turbo Frequency even when the system is put under an extremely heavy load. How big of a difference would it make to use the all-core Turbo Boost frequency instead of the base frequency? If you were to calculate the "aggregate frequency" for an Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 CPU, you would get a result of 36.4 GHz since that CPU has 14 cores and a base frequency of 2.6 GHz. However, if you instead use the all-core Turbo frequency of 3.2 GHz (which any well-designed and adequately cooled workstation should be able to achieve indefinitely), the aggregate frequency changes to 44.8 GHz which is a difference of 30%. It does not take the rest of the CPU and system specs into account including the amount of cache, architecture, and chipset Processors are extremely complex, and just looking at the number of cores and frequency ignores everything else that can make one CPU faster or slower than another. This can include the amount of cache (whether it is L1, L2, L3, or Smart Cache), the bus type and speed, and the type and speed of memory it can use. However, more than almost anything else it ignores the architecture and manufacturing process that was used to produce the CPU. While the amount of difference all of these other specs can make varies from application to application, as an example we saw up to a 35% difference in SOLIDWORKS between a Skylake CPU and a Haswell-E CPU when both were operating with 4 cores at 4.0 GHz. It assumes that programs can make perfect use of all the CPU cores More than anything else, this is the main problem with aggregate frequency. Using the base frequency can throw things off, but in most cases probably only by a maximum of about 10-30%. Likewise, as long as you only compare CPUs from the same product family, the architecture of the CPUs likely won't come into play. But working under the assumption that a program is going to be able to make perfect use of all of the CPUs cores is just so wrong that that it makes using an "aggregate frequency" less accurate in most cases than simply choosing a CPU at random. It appears that most people who use this term understand that there are some programs that are single threaded (parametric CAD programs are a prime example), but many of our articles have shown over and over that even if a program tries to use all the available cores, how effectively it can do varies wildly. The reason depends on a number of factors including how the program is coded, how well the task lends itself to multi-threading, and how much the other components in the system (including the hard drive, GPU, and RAM) affect performance. There are some programs that are very effective at utilizing multiple CPU cores in parallel, but even the best of them (such as offline rendering) are at best only ~99.5% efficient, and often as low as 90% efficient. This is extremely good, but still low enough that it will throw off any attempt to use an "aggregate frequency" to estimate performance. Unfortunately, the only way to know how well a program can use multiple cores is to do comprehensive testing on that specific application. We have tested a number of programs including Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, SOLIDWORKS, Keyshot, Iray, Mental Ray, and Photoscan, but this is only a tiny drop in a giant bucket compared to the number of programs that exist today. Examples We can talk about all the reasons why we believe "aggregate frequency" is wildly inaccurate, but there is no substitution for specific examples using actual benchmark data. To help prove our point, we are going to look at a number of different applications and compare the performance between a variety of CPUs using the "aggregate frequency" and the actual performance in reality. We like to be fair, so to give this term the best chance possible we are only going to use CPUs with same architecture (Broadwell-E/EP). If you were to mix older and newer architectures (such as a Core i7 6700K versus a Core i7 6850K or a Xeon V3 versus a Xeon V4), expect the "aggregate frequency" to become even more inaccurate. To make it easier to see how close or far from reality the "aggregate frequency" is, whenever the expected performance using the "aggregate frequency" is within 10% of the actual performance, we will color the results in green. Anything that is 10-50% off will be in orange, and anything more than 50% off will be in red. Example 1: Cinema4D CPU Rendering Offline rendering of 3D images and animations is among the most efficient tasks you can run on a CPU which makes rendering engines like those found in Cinema4D exceptional at using high numbers of CPU cores. This also makes it a best-case scenario for the term "aggregate frequency": CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 156% (off by 17%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V4 20 Cores, 2.2 GHz (2.4-3.1 GHz Turbo) 44 GHz 204% 207% (off by 3%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 358% (off by 21%) We run CineBench R15 on nearly every system that goes out our door, and the results above are taken directly from our benchmark logs. Comparing the expected performance to the actual performance between the different CPUs, in every case the "aggregate frequency" ended up expecting lower performance than what each CPU was able to achieve in reality. The most accurate result was the dual Xeon E5-2630 V4 in which the expected performance difference compared to the i7 6850K was only off by about 3% which is actually extremely accurate. However, the other two CPU results were off by about 20% which means that although "aggregate frequency" has a chance of being fairly accurate, it also has a good chance of being off by a moderate amount. Example 2: Premiere Pro We have found in previous testing that Premiere Pro is decently effective at using a moderate amount of CPU cores, but with modern hardware there is little need for something like a dual CPU workstation. Still, there are many recommendations on the web to use a dual Xeon workstation for Premiere Pro, so lets take a look at how the actual performance you would see in Premiere Pro compares to what you would expect from the "aggregate frequency": CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 123% (off by 16%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V4 20 Cores, 2.2 GHz (2.4-3.1 GHz Turbo) 44 GHz 189% 117% (off by 77%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 111% (off by 226%) The results in the chart above are taken from this Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2015.3 CPU Comparison article where we looked at exporting and generating previews in Premiere Pro with a variety of codecs and resolutions. While the results aren't too far off with somewhat similar CPUs, the "aggregate frequency" expected the i7 6950X to be about 16% faster compared to the i7 6850K than it is in reality. This isn't completely out in left field, but the difference between a 39% improvement in performance and a 23% improvement from a CPU that is more than twice as expensive is likely to make quite a big difference if you are trying to decide on which CPU to purchase. For the dual CPU options, the "aggregate frequency" was much further off from reality being about 77% off on the dual Xeon E5-2643 V4 and a huge 226% off on the dual Xeon E5-2690 V4. In fact, where the "aggregate frequency" predicted the dual E5-2690 V4 CPUs to be the fastest option, they were in fact slower than the dual E5-2643 V4 CPUs (or even the Core i7 6950X) while costing significantly more. Example 3: 3ds Max 3ds Max is a 3d modeling and animation program that is primarily single threaded, so you would expect it to be a worst case scenario for "aggregate frequency". You may argue that no one should use this term for these types of lightly threaded tasks, but we have started to see this term pop up even when talking about single or lightly threaded tasks so we wanted to show just how inaccurate it may be when someone uses "aggregate frequency" as a catch-all term for CPU performance: CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 102% (off by 37%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 89% (off by 248%) The results in the chart above are taken from this AutoDesk 3ds Max 2017 CPU Performance article where we looked at animations, viewport FPS, and scanline rendering with a variety of projects. As expected from a mostly single-threaded application, the "aggregate frequency" was very optimistic in each case. Depending on which CPU you look at, the expected performance if you used the "Aggregate frequency" compared to the actual performance ranged from being 37% off to being 248% off! On the extreme end - with a pair of high core count Xeons - this means that instead of more than a 3x increase in performance compared to a i7 6850K, in reality you would actually see a 10% decrease in performance. Example 4: After Effects After Effects is an interesting application because it used to be very well threaded and benefited greatly from high core count workstations. However, in the 2015 version Adobe changed it's focus from multi-threading to GPU acceleration. In the long-term this should greatly improve performance for AE users, but the result is that with modern hardware there is little need for a CPU with more than 6-8 CPU cores and often actually a decrease in performance with higher core count and dual CPU setups. So while you may think a single-threaded application like 3ds Max would be the worst case for the term "aggregate frequency", After Effects should be even worse: CineBench R15 Multi CPU Specs Aggregate Frequency Expected Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Actual Performance Compared to Core i7 6850K Intel Core i7 6850K 6 Cores, 3.6 GHz (3.7-4.0 GHz Turbo) 21.6 GHz 100% 100% Intel Core i7 6950X 10 Cores, 3.0 GHz (3.4-4.0 GHz Turbo) 30 GHz 139% 96% (off by 43%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V4 20 Cores, 2.2 GHz (2.4-3.1 GHz Turbo) 44 GHz 189% 90% (off by 99%) 2x Intel Xeon E5-2690 V4 28 Cores, 2.6 GHz (3.2-3.5 GHz Turbo) 72.8 GHz 337% 86% (off by 251%) The results in the chart above are taken from the 2D Animation portion of our Adobe After Effects CC 2015.3 CPU Comparison article which tested rendering and timeline scrubbing across six different projects. As you can see, trying to use an "aggregate frequency" to estimate the difference between different CPU models is going to be wildly inaccurate. Compared to the i7 6850K, the other CPU choices - which should be anywhere from 39% faster to over 3 times faster - are instead all slower than the Core i7 6850K. In fact, the faster the "aggregate frequency" predicted a CPU configuration to be, the slower it ended up being in reality! The allure of an all-pervasive specification like "aggregate frequency" is something we completely understand. It would be great if there was an easy way to know which CPU will be faster than another and by roughly how much, but unfortunately there is no magic bullet. To be completely fair, for highly threaded tasks like rendering, the "aggregate frequency" should be close enough that you at least wouldn't end up spending more money for lower performance, but it still isn't going to be great at estimating precisely how much of a performance increase you would see with one CPU over another. Outside of rendering and a few other highly parallel applications, however, there is no way to know whether the "aggregate frequency" is going to be accurate or not without detailed benchmarking. For example, simulations are often touted as being highly parallel (which means it should be perfect for this term), but we have found that performing simulations in SOLIDWORKS is only moderately efficient - worse in many cases than Premiere Pro! Other simulations packages like ANSYS or COMSOL should be more efficient, but without specific testing there is no way to know for sure. So if "aggregate frequency" is not accurate, what should people use to decide which CPU to purchase? Like we said earlier, there is no magic bullet for this. If your application is CPU-bound (the GPU, HD, and RAM don't impact performance significantly), you could use Amdahl's Law which taken into account the parallel efficiency of the program to calculate the theoretical performance difference between two CPUs. If you are interested in this, we recommend reading our guide on how to use Amdahl's Law. You are still limited to CPUs of the same architecture, it doesn't take into account things like CPU cache, and you have to do a lot of testing up front to determine the parallel efficiency of the program - but this method should be much more accurate than simply multiplying together a CPU's cores and frequency. If your application does utilize the GPU to improve performance or if you want to compare CPUs with different architectures, however, there is really no easy way to estimate which CPU will be faster than another and by how much. In these situations, the only reliable method is good old-fashioned benchmarking. Again, we wish there was a better method that was still accurate - it would save us so much time! - but this is simply the fact of reality. This is why we at Puget Systems have started to benchmark different CPUs on as many professional applications as we have the time and expertise to handle to ensure that we are recommending exactly the right CPU to our customers. We unfortunately can't test every program we wish we could (or really even a majority), but keep on an eye on our article list as we expand our testing across more and more applications.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 19, 2016 at 9:26PM Image source: Intel.  On Oct. 18, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Arguably, the most disappointing aspect of the results -- even though they were, in aggregate, quite good -- was the fact that the company's data-center group, or DCG, grew at just 10% year-over-year, missing expectations. Although the top-line miss in this segment was disappointing, some investors might also be concerned that, even with 10% revenue growth in this segment, operating profit actually declined year over year from $2.13 billion to $2.11 billion. Or put another way, operating margin in this segment fell from 51.45% to 46.46%. What drove this operating margin reduction? Let's take a closer look. The ramp of 14-nanometer server chips In the third quarter of 2015, Intel's latest server processors were manufactured in the company's mature 22-nanometer technology. By the third quarter of 2016, however, Intel's main server processor lineup had transitioned to the company's newer 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. This transition to chips built on this newer technology is a driver of the reduced profitability in Intel's data-center group, according to Intel. The transition to the 14-nanometer tech allowed Intel to cram more processor cores into its new chips than it was able to with the 22-nanometer parts, thereby improving performance. However, because Intel's manufacturing yields on the newer technology still haven't reached full maturity, these new chips are more expensive to build than their predecessors. Increased investments The drop in profitability year over year isn't just driven by the transition to 14-nanometer technology -- operating expenses are on the way up, too. "We have been very consciously increasing investment [in DCG] there; we see tremendous long-term opportunity, so that's been an ongoing process for us," Intel Executive Vice President Stacy Smith said on the call. It makes perfect sense for Intel to bolster its spending in this segment. Many chip companies have been quite public about their efforts to try to capture share from Intel in the server market, so the appropriate response on Intel's part is to invest more to make sure its future products are at least as competitive relative to other offerings as its current products are today. Looking ahead The good news is that Intel is likely to see the margin headwinds associated with the 14-nanometer ramp fade next year as manufacturing yields are expected to continue to improve. So in a scenario where operating expenses stay flat and revenues grow for the year, I would expect Intel's operating profit to grow nicely next year. However, it's not clear what Intel's plans are with respect to operating expenses in this segment going forward. It wouldn't be surprising to see Intel continuing to increase its investments here given the importance of DCG to the company's long-term future, but the magnitude of such an investment increase is something that won't become clear until the company's investor meeting in February of next year. The good news, though, is that, as the 14-nanometer margin headwind abates, the company should have room to increase its investments while still delivering some level of profit growth -- assuming similar business dynamics to what this business saw in 2016.

Revenue at the world’s largest semiconductor maker will be $15.7bn (€14.26bn), plus or minus $500m (€456m), the company said, falling short of analysts’ estimates of $15.9bn (€14.5bn). Intel’s third-quarter sales reached a record, lifted by processor orders from PC makers that decided to shore up their chip supplies ahead of the holiday shopping season. So far, demand hasn’t come surging back, meaning that customers will again pare orders as they work through those stockpiles of chips. It also backed off an annual forecast for double-digit revenue growth in server chips for data centres and corporate networks, its most profitable business. “We’re not going to raise the flag and say everything’s good again,” chief executive Brian Krzanich said. Intel shares are now 3.5% higher than at the start of the year. Third-quarter net income rose to $3.38bn (€3.08bn), compared with $3.11bn (€2.84bn) in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.1% to $15.8bn (€14.4bn). The company’s client computing group, which sells PC chips, posted third-quarter sales of $8.89bn (€8.11bn), a gain of 4.5% from a year earlier. Demand for PCs will increase in the fourth quarter in line with normal seasonal gains, the company said. “It’s my concern that we just have an inventory build that could carry on into the first quarter,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. While the PC market isn’t getting worse, it’s still shrinking. Worldwide shipments fell 3.9% in the third quarter, market researcher IDC said earlier this month, a smaller drop than the decline of 4.1% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, Dutch chip-making equipment manufacturer ASML, a key supplier to Intel and Samsung yesterday reported a 23% rise in third-quarter profit, missing analyst estimates. Net profit reached €396m for July-September from €322m in the same period a year earlier. However, sales of €1.82bn beat analysts expectations of €1.72bn on the back of higher sales of ASML’s newest machines. ASML forecast fourth-quarter revenue of €1.7bn-€1.8bn. Perhaps of greatest interest to company watchers, ASML reported three orders for the new machine, the NXE:3400 EUV system. CEO Peter Wennink said six customers were “now actively engaged in the EUV introduction in both memory and logic.” As a result, the company booked €1.42bn worth of new orders in the quarter. ASML shares in Amsterdam rose 2.2%. READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, finance, economy, intel, shares, sales © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Compromised machines, following orders from as-yet unknown masterminds, threw massive amounts of junk traffic at servers operated by US-based Dyn, which provides DNS services for websites large and small. The result: big names including GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Netflix, AirBnb and so on, were among hundreds of websites rendered inaccessible to millions of people around the world for several hours today. We're told about a hundred thousand gadgets using millions of IP addresses were press-ganged into shattering the internet. A lot of these commandeered gizmos were running the Mirai malware, the source code to which is now public so anyone can wield it against targets. Dyn tells us its services are coming back online after seeing out the storm and putting up new defenses. Here's what we know: Starting from 1110 UTC, a distributed denial-of-service attack knocked Dyn's DNS nameservers offline. This continued throughout the day in three independent waves as hackers targeted Dyn's data centers one by one, including its US East Coast facility. By 2037 UTC, the situation is said to be under control after mitigations were put in place to block ongoing attacks. Dyn is a crucial component in the internet's infrastructure because when you visit a website that uses Dyn's DNS servers, Dyn is supposed to help your browser or app find the right system to connect to. When Dyn does down, your software can't find the website you want to visit. A spokesperson for US Homeland Security said the agency is "investigating all potential causes" of the mega-outage. Dyn's chief strategy officer Kyle York told The Register by phone that devices behind tens of millions of IP addresses were attacking his company's data centers. A lot of this traffic – but not all – is coming from Internet-of-Things devices compromised by the Mirai botnet malware. This software nasty was used to blast the website of cyber-crime blogger Brian Krebs offline in September, and its source code and blueprints have leaked online. That means anyone can set up their own Mirai botnet and pummel systems with an army of hijacked boxes that flood networks with junk packets, drowning out legit traffic. One online tracker of Mirai suggests there at least 1.2m Mirai-infected devices on the internet, with at least 173,000 active in the past 24 hours. Mirai spreads across the web, growing its ranks of obeying zombies, by logging into devices using their default, factory-set passwords via Telnet and SSH. Because no one changes their passwords on their gizmos, Mirai can waltz in and take over routers, CCTV cameras, digital video recorders, and so on. York said the waves of attacks were separate and distinct – there are multiple bot armies out there now smashing systems offline. "We're expecting more," he added. Public DNS providers, such as Google and cable ISPs, that act as a go-between were also unable to reach Dyn's systems and were unable to resolve domain names for netizens. OpenDNS was the hero of the day, thanks to its smart caching of lookups: anyone having connectivity problems as a result of Dyn's outage should switch to using OpenDNS's public resolvers. Websites are moving away from Dyn to avoid any further downtime. Dyn has released some more details on the assault here. Infosec biz Flashpoint, which has been investigating the attacks with Dyn staffers, has shed more light on today's crippling assaults: Flashpoint has confirmed that some of the infrastructure responsible for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Dyn DNS were botnets compromised by Mirai malware. Mirai botnets were previously used in DDoS attacks against security researcher Brian Krebs’ blog “Krebs On Security” and French internet service and hosting provider OVH. Mirai malware targets Internet of Things (IoT) devices like routers, digital video records (DVRs), and webcams/security cameras, enslaving vast numbers of these devices into a botnet, which is then used to conduct DDoS attacks. Flashpoint has confirmed that at least some of the devices used in the Dyn DNS attacks are DVRs, further matching the technical indicators and tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with previous known Mirai botnet attacks. While Flashpoint has confirmed that Mirai botnets were used in the October 21, 2016 attack against Dyn, they were separate and distinct botnets from those used to execute the DDoS attacks against “Krebs on Security” and OVH. Earlier this month, “Anna_Senpai,” the hacker operating the large Mirai botnet used in the Krebs DDoS, released Mira’s source code online. Since this release, copycat hackers have used the malware to created botnets of their own in order to launch DDoS attacks. It is unknown if the attacks against Dyn DNS are linked to the DDoS attacks against Krebs, OVH, or other previous attacks. Given the proliferation of the Mirai malware, the relationship between the ongoing Dyn DDoS attacks, previous attacks, and “Anna_Senpai” is unclear. As of 1730 EST, the attacks against Dyn DNS are still ongoing. Flashpoint is coordinating with multiple vendors and law enforcement to track the infected devices that constitute the botnet being used to conduct these attacks. Flashpoint will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that our clients are provided with timely threat intelligence data. Chris Sullivan, general manager of intelligence at Core Security, also gave us some insight into today's meltdown: This outage appears to have resulted from a new breed of very high volume DDoS, or denial-of-service attacks, that will be difficult to handle with the defenses that most enterprises have in place today. The really frightening part of this is not that we will be struggling with these new attacks for some time, but that the underlying weakness which makes them successful can and will be used to unleash more serious attacks that steal credit cards and weapons designs, manipulate processes like the SWIFT global funds transfers, and even destroy physical things the 30,000 PCs at Saudi Aramco. IoT devices are the very cheap computers that we use to control the heat, lights and baby monitor in your home or tell UPS when a truck needs service – some cost less than $1. Unlike your PC or your phone, IoT devices don’t have the memory and processing to be secured properly, so they are easily compromised by adversaries and it’s very difficult to detect when that happens. This is what’s driving the new ultra-high volume DDoS attacks like we saw today. Ultra-large IoT botnets are instructed to make so many superfluous requests of the target that legitimate requests cannot get through. No real damage is done but service is denied for legitimate users. Maybe you can’t get to twitter for an hour. But these same devices also have access to what we think are highly secured corporate, nations state and defense networks. They can be used to launch attacks on those networks from the inside where all of the net-generation firewalls, intrusion prevention and user based analytics tools won’t even see them. Companies should move immediately to get control of this situation both to protect themselves and because, in the wake of these new high profile events, it’s likely to be mandated by new law. What is required now is the deployment of systems that don’t try to control the IoT devices but rather watch and learn how they behave so that we can identify malicious activity and isolate them when necessary. El Reg has been banging about IoT security for ages: Mirai is now targeting cellular gateways. Not enough is being done to patch insecure gadgets. Do gizmos need some sort of security-warning labels? The blame here is not with Dyn. It is not even with the owners of the hijacked devices. It lies with the botnet operators – and, perhaps more crucially, the dimwit IoT manufacturers who crank out criminally insecure hardware that can be compromised en masse. Particularly China-based XiongMai Technologies, which produces vulnerable software and hardware used in easily hijacked IP cameras, digital video recorders and network-attached video recorders. These crappy devices were at the core of today's attacks, according to Flashpoint. Until there is a standards crackdown, and vulnerable devices are pulled offline, this will continue on and on until there is no internet left. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 222 Comments More from The Register Dyn dinged by DDoS: US DNS firm gives web a bad hair day Reddit, Github, Airbnb and pals affected 31 Comments A successor to Mirai?

Google bolstering attention on AI, cloud synergies (Seeking Alpha) The “best is yet to come” from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Wunderlich said as part of its upgrading the stock to Buy from Hold after the company’s first quarter revenue and EPS topped the Street on growth in Azure and adoption of Office 365. “We believe the upcoming quarter to be an inflection point for MSFT as the company will complete the sale of its feature phone business and the acquisition of LinkedIn, signifying the end of the old and the beginning of the new,” analyst Ryan MacDonald wrote in a note. MacDonald believes the integration of LinkedIn Corp (NYSE: LNKD) will boost the value proposition of Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. Related Link: Microsoft On The Brink Of Inflection Point In Cloud Services Looking ahead, the company guided second-quarter revenue to a range of $24.65 billion–$25.45 billion, below consensus at $25.8 billion. This guidance includes a 100bps FX headwind. Commercial unearned revenue is expected to be in the range of $21.05 billion - $21.25 billion. Meanwhile, the analyst cut his FY17 revenue estimate to $93.893 billion from $94.462 billion, but raised FY17 EPS estimate to $3.06 from $2.94. Shares of Microsoft currently trade at a P/E of 18.7x his FY17 estimate of $3.06, a discount to the large-cap software group mean of 23.4x. The analyst also raised the price target on the stock by $10 to $70, which assumes shares trade at 22.9x, a discount to the peer group multiple. “As such, we believe the best is yet to come as we expect revenue growth acceleration and margin expansion based on improving profitability metrics for commercial cloud,” MacDonald added. At the time of writing, shares of Microsoft rose 4.92 percent to $60.07. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Regulators now speak of sandboxes and national charters for fintech companies, and some of the young guns on the scene are starting to add more features to their products. Now, a large fintech lender is getting recognition for the quality of its loan securities. CommonBond, a fintech lender that uses data technology to lower the costs of student loans, today announced a $168 million securitization of student loan debt backed by $178 million in collateral. The package received an A1 rating from Moody's Investors Service. Barclays PLC (ADR) (NYSE: BCS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) ran the books and jointly managed the account for the transaction. Related Link: The Startup That Wants To Bring Expert Networks To Every Investor "CommonBond has built a sterling reputation in the capital markets due to our meticulous, data-driven underwriting," said Morgan Edwards, CommonBond's chief financial officer, in a press release. "We continue to be excited to see new investors participate with each transaction we bring to the market and expect to see the diversity of investors increase with subsequent deals." The securitization is the company's third, following a $150 million package in April of this year and a $100 million offering last June. "This securitization represents a progression in the sophistication in our capital markets team and CommonBond as a whole," said Phil DeGisi, CommonBond's chief marketing officer, in an interview with Benzinga. "We're excited that the strength of our underwriting is being recognized by some of the most respected ratings agencies in the country." The company's first securitization was the first time Moody's had ever given an investment-grade rating to an inaugural marketplace issuer, DeGisi added. CommonBond announced the closing of $300 million in fundraising in July, as well as the acquisition of Gradible, a company that offers insights on how to manage student loan debt. The company is backed by investors including Vikram Pandit, former Citi chief, and Tom Glocer, former CEO of Thomson Reuters. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Now, Microsoft hopes it can do the same for desktop PCs. The firm is rumoured to be putting the finishing touches to an all in one desktop PC - and new patent drawings appear to reveal the machine Microsoft will unveil in New York on the 26th October. Scroll down for video  The patent designs show an iMac-like machine, with a screen testing on two arms According to Mary Jo Folet at ZDnet, the new device is codenamed Cardinal, and will come in three sizes - with a 21, 24 ,or 27 inch screen.  'I've heard that Surface Cardinal could be positioned as a product that can turn your desk into 'a studio',' she wrote. The device is expected to be unveiled at an also rumoured late October event where the firm's tablets could also get an upgrade. According to Windows Central, it will have a 'modern and elegant' design. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Think you're more tech-savvy than your gran? Think again:...

Microsoft also recently revealed it will launch a mixed reality version of Windows next year. The move will bring a 3D holographic version of the platform to Windows 10 users who own a virtual reality headset. Announcing its plans at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Microsoft said user interface will be available to run on mainstream PCs.  Lenovo already makes a 27inch tablet/PC hybrid, called to Yoga 900 HOW WILL IT WORK?  According to Microsoft, the Holographic shell UI for Windows 10 will enable users to put on a headset to navigate their Windows desktop. It will mix 2D apps such as email and calendars - which could be overlaid onto surfaces with augmented reality - with fully immersive 3D apps, such as a virtual reality tour of a location. The exact look and feel will be dependent on the headset used - where an Oculus Rift style VR headset being fully immersive, while a Holoens style headset enabling AR and mixed reality. Users will be able to select applications using a point and click selector, like a Wii controller.  The new Holographic shell desktop UI will enable users to run Windows 10 through a VR headset hooked up to a standard PC, opening up the experience beyond those with high end gaming machines.  Writing in a blog post, Microsoft's executive vice president for Windows, Terry Myerson, said: 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.' Microsoft is working with chip-maker Intel on a specification for mixed reality PCs and head mounted displays, in an effort to open up the market and its platform. The device is expected to be unveiled at an also rumoured late October event where the firm's tablets could also get an upgrade.

According to ZDnet, it will come in three screen sizes, 21, 24 ,or 27 inch and will have a 'modern and elegant' design. 'Our shared goal is to enable our hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets,' wrote Myerson. A promotional video demonstrates how the interface will look, running at 90 frames per second, triple that of most HD televisions. It shows a woman wearing a headset in a virtual room running a mix of 2D and 3D apps as she checks email, books flights, navigates a diary and takes a virtual tour of the Pantheon in Rome. The virtual dog in Windows holographic shell UI bears a close resemblance to Rover, the assistant character which made appearances in earlier Microsoft software Veteran Windows users will also notice the similarity between the virtual dog and Rover, an assistant character in Microsoft's less than successful Bob software and who later made an appearance in Windows XP. According to Microsoft, using a 'six degrees of freedom' headset, the interface can be manipulated using a point and click Wii-type controller.

OCULUS RIFT GETS AN OFFICIAL UK LAUNCH DATE The Oculus RIft has been the most talked about tech for years, with the first developers kits sent out in 2012. The latest official news is that the kit will launch in the UK, Europe and Canada on 20 September, with a price tag of £549 or €699. It's already available in the US priced at $599.  A number of outlets are already taking orders for the headset, including John Lewis, Amazon and Game, and the kit will come with platform game Lucky's Tale, along with hundreds of videos and VR movies. Oculus will be rolling out demo experiences at retailers across the UK in the coming weeks, with titles including: The Climb, Henry, Farlands and Oculus Dreamdeck.  Read more: Windows Holographic experience available for mainstream Windows 10 PCs next year | Windows Experience Blog Microsoft begins taking preorders from developers for the HoloLens | Daily Mail Online Windows Holographic Shell Demo - YouTube Microsoft's Surface all-in-one PC said to headline October hardware launch | ZDNet Microsoft is working on Surface All-in-One PC destined for your living room | Windows Central Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Most watched News videos Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The Pros of Investing in the Technology Sector U.S. News & World Report - Money 10/21/2016 Leslie Thompson © (Getty Images) Millennials will make a big impact on tech stocks. Technology has been the clear standout sector within the Standard & Poor's 500 index. The sector returned 12.4 percent for the third quarter and some of the largest names – like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Intel Corp. (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Facebook (FB) – reported positive second-quarter earnings results. Popular Searches Audi AG AUDVF ▼ 656.20 -11.30 -1.69% Dick's Sporting Goods Inc DKS ▼ 56.71 -4.18 -6.86% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 158.67 +0.46 +0.29% LGL Group Inc LGL ▲ 4.49 +0.18 +4.28% There is reason to believe that positive results will continue. August data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows record high consumer spending in technology-related categories – at 4.1 percent year-over-year growth, this is the fastest growth since the first quarter of 2010. A standout has been computer spending growth – the 7.4 percent year-over-year growth in personal computers and peripheral equipment is the best growth since fourth quarter of 2011 and represents 26 percent of total consumer technology spending. Consumer spending on software also accounted for 23 percent and grew 2.5 percent year-over-year. Broadly speaking, technology remains attractive with its strong cash position and lack of sensitivity to rising oil prices and interest rates. In fact, rising interest rates could increase interest earnings for cash-rich companies, such as Apple. Over the next three to five years, global consumers will likely adopt faster 5G wireless technologies and significantly faster wireline technology, such as optical fiber to the home. [See: 9 Blue-Chip Powerhouse ETFs to Buy.] Millennials will make an impact, too. Many couples in this demographic will purchase single-family homes, like previous generations before them, and purchase their first TV or upgrade their current TV to a larger 4K screen. Furthermore, newly constructed homes will likely be equipped with the latest internet of things technology to monitor appliances, activate a home security system and to minimize energy consumption. Likely beneficiaries of these trends include semiconductor company Broadcom Limited (AVGO) and technology retailer Best Buy Co. (BBY). Following the combination of Avago and Broadcom, the new Broadcom is levered to growth in the areas of advanced wireless technologies, smartphones, data center spending, IP traffic and the internet of things. These areas are expected to grow at strong double-digit compounded annual growth rates over the next several years. As the uses of wireless technologies continue to multiply, Broadcom's sophisticated FBAR (Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator) filters ensure wireless devices capture the right signal for the right device. Consumers and corporations are upgrading to faster and more data intensive computer hardware, and this new hardware will be embedded with the latest communication semiconductor chips from suppliers like Broadcom. It is also important to note that Apple represents 20 percent of Broadcom's revenue, and competitors, such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) aggressively vie for this business.  Post-merger, Broadcom carries $15 billion of debt versus $2 billion of cash. However, this debt load is manageable given the company is expected to generate almost $5 billion of free cash flow in 2017, of which only $900 million will be used to fund the dividend. At 12.5 times estimated calendar year 2017 earnings, Broadcom offers an attractive valuation: a 1.1 percent dividend yield and an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 15 percent. As for how technology-related devices are purchased, given the rapid growth of online retailers, many investors have written off traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, Best Buy trades at 12 times estimated calendar year 2017 earnings versus 78 times for online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN). Investors are ignoring several important trends, as domestic sales have turned the corner and have grown for the last several quarters. Best Buy's domestic online portion grew 24 percent last quarter and now represents 10.6 percent of U.S. sales. Expenses are expected to grow at a slower rate as the company transitions to more online sales. This offers the potential for margin expansion over time. Since faster data speeds enable higher quality video, consumers are more likely to visit showrooms and consult with employees as to which TV stand or audio technology will complement their home theater experience. Some customers may also hire Best Buy to install sophisticated technology or purchase an extended warranty. Best Buy is estimated to generate $1 billion of free cash flow next year. An estimated $500 million will be returned to shareholders in the form of a dividend and $300 million will used to repurchase stock. Best Buy currently yields 2.8 percent and long-term earnings are estimated to grow 11 percent per year. In the past 10 years, the company has repurchased 33 percent of its shares outstanding. Technology has impacted much of the world, and the financial industry is no different – companies in this sector are seeing the effects firsthand, as investors look to find profit.  Disclosure: Leslie Thompson and clients of Spectrum Management Group own AVGO, BBY, AAPL, MSFT, CSCO and FB.

It should be noted that, while higher than expected, revenue was the lowest reported in more than five years, largely due to a loss of a Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) contract, which had accounted for roughly 8 percent of all money spent using AmEx cards in 2015. Next week, Visa Inc (NYSE: V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA), Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) will report their quarterly financial results. Barclays Expects PayPal To Continue To Take Market Share In P2P, Money Transfer And E-Commerce Will they be able to deliver better than expected performance, same as American Express did? Let’s take a look at what the Street has in mind. Voices From The Street Visa will report its Q4 results on Monday afternoon, and analysts are modeling EPS of $0.73 on revenue of $4.241 billion, up from $0.62 and $3.571 in the same quarter last year. The Vetr crowd has a 3.5 Stars (Buy) rating on shares of Visa. Its average price target of $87.75 implies a potential return of 6.8 percent from current valuations. MasterCard’s report is scheduled for Friday morning, and the Street envisions Q3 EPS of $0.98 on revenue of $2.735, versus $0.91 and $2.53 billion seen a year ago. The Vetr crowd maintains a 3.5 Stars (Buy) rating on shares of MasterCard. Its average price target of $110.07 implies a potential return of 6.8 percent from current valuations. Finally, there’s Capital One Financial Corp. and Discover Financial, which will announce their results on Tuesday. For the former, Wall Street is anticipating EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $6.355 billion, versus EPS of $2.10 on revenue of $5.9 billion registered in the same quarter last year. Lastly, analysts believe that Discover Financial will post EPS of $1.48 on revenue of $2.28 billion, up from $1.38 and $2.188 billion delivered in the same period a year ago.

Shares of PayPal were soaring in Friday's session, up over 9.5 percent at time of writing. Barclays highlighted PayPal's first mover advantage, brand awareness and best–in-class position in each channel as key catalysts for continued market penetration. Analysts are expecting mid- to high-teens EPS growth over the next three years with even more potential from possible buybacks and M&A activity. Medium Term Top-Line Guidance PayPal provided its FY17 and three-year outlook and is looking for revenue growth in FY17 to come in around 16–17 percent. Operating margins are expected to be flat, as some revenue and cost initiatives will be offset by incremental expense related to customer choice initiatives.

News & Analysis TSMC, GF/Samsung Battle at 7nm Intel may take back seat to foundries Rick Merritt 10/21/2016 01:09 PM EDT 53 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — TSMC will go head-to-head with the partnership of IBM, Globalfoundries and Samsung to publicly detail rival 7nm processes at a technical conference in December. The trio’s process will use extreme ultraviolet lithography to achieve impressive gains, but TSMC likely will get to market first due to challenges getting EUV into production. Using EUV, GF and Samsung claim they will deliver “the tightest contacted polysilicon pitch (44/48nm) and metallization pitch (36nm) ever reported for FinFETs,” in an abstract for the International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM). The pitches leapfrog the 56nm gate pitch Intel announced in August for its 10nm process, claiming industry-leading density for the node it aims to have in production next year. Observers have started to suggest both TSMC and Samsung might leapfrog Intel which has slowed the pace of releasing new process technologies as progress in Moore’s law becomes more complex and costly. For its part, TSMC will describe at IEDM a 0.027µm2 SRAM test cell made in its 7nm process using immersion steppers. The 256-Mbit, six-transistor SRAM has the smallest cell size reported to date, TSMC claimed, and sports “full read/write functionality down to 0.5V,” it added. The abstract echoed claims for the 7nm node that TSMC first made at an event here in September. The process will deliver “more than three times the gate density and either a speed gain (35-40%) or power reduction (>65%) versus the company’s commercial 16nm FinFET process,” the abstract said. IEDM is clearly the coming out party for 7nm, said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research. The key message is Moores law is not stopping because customers are moving to 7nm," he said. On Monday when Samsung announced its 10nm process, it said it would skip a version of 7nm using today’s immersion lithography. Instead it said it will roll out 7nm with EUV targeting production before the end of 2018. For its part, TSMC said it will have at least limited production in 2017 for its 7nm process with immersion steppers. The net result is in the course of 18 months chip designers will see at least three variants of 7nm -- separate immersion variants from TSMC and Globalfoundries and the EUV version from GF/Samsung. Intel has yet to detail its 7nm node, but said it expects density to rise and cost per transistor to fall. To speed signaling, the GF/Samsung 7nm process will use “dual-strained channels on a thick strain-relaxed buffer virtual substrate to combine tensile-strained NMOS and compressively strained SiGe PMOS for enhancement of drive current by 11% and 20%, respectively,” its abstract said. The approach uses a “novel trench epitaxy to minimize the resistance of the highly scaled contact regions,” it added. In September, GF said it developed its own 7nm process using immersion steppers that will be in production in 2018. It did not mention it was still collaborating with Samsung on the EUV version. The 7nm immersion process will have a logic density of 17 million gates/mm2, a spokeswoman said. The TSMC 7nm process uses “a raised source/drain epitaxial process that strains the transistor channel and reduces parasitics, a novel contact process, and a copper/low-k interconnect scheme featuring different metal pitches and stacks,” the abstract said.

The uniqueness of 7nm is that 7nm at the bottom and 4nm at the top is so narrow that the entire channel is fully inverted as seen in a double gate transistor, resulting in large drive currents. Therefore, implementation of III-V or Ge channel is unnecessary or even detrimental because it dose not provide higher transistor drive currents than the fully inverted channel that I talk about here.

I had the (apparently wrong) impression that TSMC 10nm was already close to Samsung 10nm.

With any process the minimum pitch is a tradeoff between yield and density, but is also linked to other factors like fin spacing, size/spacing/resistance of contacts to gate/source/metal, and restrictive design rules with colouring -- even though 38nm may be a manufacturable metal pitch, it may not be usable in actual layouts for other reasons, or may end up increasing cost or reducing performance. It's the difference between what can be done in the lab (and published in a paper) and what is the best solution for real chips... [note that Intel increased pitches for their 14nm v2 process, which suggests they pushed them down too hard for v1 where it's well known they had yield problems] Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank CEO Re: I Already Covered this with Density Comparisons realjjj   10/25/2016 5:58:43 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate They likely include fin height and standard cells heights in the math to determine where they get the best cost and perf. With 14nm Plus they increase gate pitch and fin height (and who knows what else), likely smaller cells to keep overall transistor density and reached a claimed 12% perf gain. Chances are yields are better too. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: I Already Covered this with Density Comparisons ScottenJ   10/25/2016 5:42:57 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Thanks I think it depends on the process. Just my opinion, but even with restrictive design rules logic is still less regular than memory so maybe 40nm for logic but 38nm for memory. I know Intel at one point said 80nm was the single pattern limit and since SADP is pitch doubling that would imply 40nm. Beyond that I think you need SAQP and it is doable but expensive, particularly for metal layers with block masks where if you need more than one block mask the process gets really complicated.

In trading on Friday, telecommunications services shares fell by 0.94 percent. Meanwhile, top losers in the sector included AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T), down 4 percent, and NTT Docomo Inc (ADR) (NYSE: DCM), down 2 percent. Top Headline McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter on Friday. While net income dipped 3 percent from $1.309 billion to $1.275 billion, EPS grew 7 percent from $1.40 to $1.50 and came in above the estimates of $1.49 a share. Similarly, McDonald's revenues fell 3 percent from $6.615 billion to $6.424 billion. However, this is higher than the Street analysts' expectations of $6.28 billion.

British American Tobacco PLC (ADR) (NYSE: BTI) made a $47 billion takeover offer for the roughly 58 percent of Reynolds American that it doesn’t already own — a move that would cement the two cigarette giants’ longstanding trans-Atlantic ties and create the world’s largest listed tobacco company by revenue and market value. BAT owns 42.2 percent of Reynolds, and is offering cash and BAT stock worth $56.50 a share for the rest of the company. Everyday Health Inc (NYSE: EVDY) shares were also up, gaining 11 percent to $10.45 after the company disclosed that it struck a definitive deal with Ziff Davis, LLC, which comprises J2 Global Inc (NASDAQ: JCOM), enabling the latter to buy it for $10.50 a share in cash. This would translate in an enterprise value of approximately $465 million.

Shares of Skechers USA Inc (NYSE: SKX) were down 17 percent to $19.01 after the company reported downbeat results for its third quarter and issued a weak forecast for the fourth quarter.

But Obama, one of the great orators of modern politics, was influenced by great authors long before he got national security clearance. In our November issue, the president gave WIRED a crash course in the books that shaped him. Like all diligent overachievers, we take our homework seriously. So we calculated how much time you’d need to read everything on Professor Obama’s syllabus. You’re looking at 89 hours with great minds like Abraham Lincoln, James Baldwin, and Elizabeth Kolbert. Obama appreciates an excellent novel like John Steinbeck’s In Dubious Battle, but doesn’t shy away from hard-hitting nonfiction, like Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. And he’s got a soft spot for biographies of great American forces of change, from Andy Grove to Martin Luther King Jr. Of course, you could space that reading out over a manageable amount of time. But you also could work on your taxes for an hour a week and have them done by March. So next time you’ve got a week to spare, kick up your feet and cram for your freshman lit seminar in the Oval Office. There’s never been such a good excuse for avoiding conversation with extended family over the holidays; let the binge-reading begin! The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln Yeah, Abe authored the Gettysburg Address—but he also wrote plenty beyond his speeches, including personal letters, pardons, and orders for war supplies. If you’re a fan of one of the 21st-century’s best orators, spend some time with the great words of his predecessor.

For better or for worse—many point to his work as cause for urban decline in the late 20th century—he’s one of the greats of American industry.

To many a spectator's surprise, the newly unveiled gaming PC wasn't a desktop, but another laptop destined for the maker's stable. However, Razer is straplining the new 17-inch Razer Blade Pro laptop as "the ultimate gaming desktop in a laptop." As mentioned in the intro, this is a large 17-inch laptop, the screen is 17.3-inches in diagonal to be exact. It is one of the many premium hardware components in the new Razer Blade Pro. The screen is made by Sharp, one of its IGZO UHD panels with LED backlighting. This 16:9 ratio screen with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels offers 170 degree viewing angles, a 100 per cent Adobe RGB gamut, and capacitive multi-touch interactivity. With such a screen you would want a top class graphics accelerator and Razer doesn't disappoint with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X VRAM) equipped. This is backed up with the potent mobile processing power offered by Intel's Core i7-6700HQ processor (6MB Cache, up to 3.50GHz). An easy to glance-over bullet point spec list for the Razer Blade Pro follows: 17.3-inch IGZO UHD G-SYNC, 16:9 ratio, 3840 x 2160, with LED backlight, with capacitive multi-touch Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X VRAM) Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.6 GHz / 3.5 GHz) 32GB Dual-Channel System Memory (DDR4, 2133 MHz) 512GB SSD RAID 0 (2x 256GB PCIe M.2) or 1TB SSD RAID 0 (2x 512GB PCIe M.2) or 2TB SSD RAID 0 (2x 1TB PCIe M.2) options Razer Chroma lighting Windows 10 64-bit, no bloatware Anti-ghosting individually backlit ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard Killer DoubleShot Pro: Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth 4.1), Killer E2400 (Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), USB 3.0 port x3 (SuperSpeed), HDMI 2.0 video and audio output, SDXC card reader Built-in stereo speakers, Dolby Digital Plus Home Theatre Edition, 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI), 3.5 mm headphone/microphone combo port Built-in webcam (2.0 MP) Array microphone Razer Synapse enabled with programmable keyboard, trackpad, backlighting, and fan control Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) security chip embedded Compact 250W power adapter, Built-in 99Wh rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery Approx. Size: 0.88 in. / 22.5 mm (Height) x 16.7 in. / 424 mm (Width) x 11 in. / 281 mm (Depth), Approx. Weight: 7.80 lbs. / 3.54 kg In supplemental details the Razer Blade Pro is constructed using a unibody CNC aluminium chassis. Important in this class of laptop is an efficient thermal solution and Razer has implemented "the worlds thinnest manufactured vapour chamber cooling solution in a notebook," to keep the Pro purring along smoothly under duress. Another interesting feature is the RGB mechanical keyboard and trackpad configuration as you can clearly see below. Talking about the new Razer Blade Pro flagship, Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO reflected on his engineering team's achievements and how the firm had grown over a relatively short time. He referred to the new cooling system capabilities as "staggering". The Razer Blade Pro is expected to ship via RazerZone from November, in the US and in Europe. Pricing starts at US$3,699 / €4,199 / £3,499. Razer Blade Laptops available in Europe Razer's newest 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth ultraportable laptop and the 14-inch Razer Blade gaming have come to Europe. "The demand in Europe for a thin, powerful and portable laptop for gamers has inspired us every waking moment since we launched the Razer Blade five years ago," said Razer CEO and Co-Founder Min-Liang Tan before telling the crowd that the firm now had everything in place to sell and distribute these signature Razer systems "throughout Europe in 2016". The Razer Blade Stealth is a thin (13.1mm), light (1.29Kg), portable and powerful ultrabook. Buyers can choose from a 12.5-inch QHD or 4K screen. Razer describes it as the best choice for "gamers that go". Its thin and light construction means that it relies upon the Intel Skylake Core i7-7500U processor's integrated HD Graphics 520 when on the road. However, it is meant to come home to your desk to sit alongside the Razer Core (connects via Thunderbolt 3) to provide desktop class graphics and further expandability and connectivity. Razer thinks it has the ultimate laptop for those who definitely want integrated graphics but value portability with its new 14-inch Razer Blade. This laptop melds the power of a 6th gen Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, 16GB of dual-channel memory, and PCIe-based SSD storage up to 1TB. It fits these components with a 14-inch full HD or QHD display in a slim (17.9mm) unibody aluminium chassis weighing in at approx 1.9Kg, depending on configuration. The 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth and 14-inch Razer Blade are available now in the UK, Germany and France priced at £999/ €1,099 and £1,749 / €1,999 respectively. They all ship with localised keyboard layouts for the buyers' region. You can buy them directly via Razerzone.com.

Print “From using enough green power to meet 100 percent of electricity needs to signing long-term contracts to enable new renewable energy projects, these organizations are demonstrating leadership by furthering the case for accessible, affordable green power use,” EPA said in a statement. There were five categories of winners and further details are available here: Excellence in Green Power Use Award: Biogen (Cambridge, Massachusetts);, BNY Nellon (New York City); Forest County Potawatomi Community (Crandon, Wisconsin); Goldman Sachs (New York City); Government of the District of Columbia (Washington, DC); Intel (Santa Clara, California) and SC Johnson (Racine, Wisconsin.) Green Power Partner of the Year Award: Cisco Systems (San Jose, California); Jackson Family Wines (Santa Rosa, California) and University at Buffalo, the State University of New York (Buffalo). Sustained Excellence in Green Power Award: Apple (Cupertino, California) and Kohl’s Direct Project Engagement Award: General Motors / GM Orion Assembly Plant (Lake Orion, Michigan); Google (Mountain View, California) and HARBEC (Ontario, New York). Green Power Community of the Year Award: Maplewood Community, Missouri. The awardees were selected based on a multitude of criteria, including the size and scale of their green power use, leadership and innovation in purchasing and generating green power, internal and external communications efforts, as well as organizational strategy for investing in green power. EPA’s Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that goes “above and beyond” regulatory requirements and encourages organizations to use green power as a way to help reduce the environmental impacts associated with conventional electricity use. EPA defines green power as electricity that is generated from renewable sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, and low-impact hydroelectric sources. Green power does not produce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change.

Intel is getting some help in its years-long effort to appeal a $1.4 billion fine levied in 2009 by European antitrust regulators. The chip maker has appealed the fine up through the European Union judicial system despite a series of setbacks, eventually reaching the European Union (EU) Court of Justice (ECJ). In an opinion this week, ECJ Advocate General Nils Wahl said the case should be sent back to the court that initially ruled against Intel and levied the record fine, questioning whether regulators had proved that rebates the chip maker had given to system makers in Europe had amounted to an abuse of its market dominance and harmed competition. The European Commission (EC)—the antitrust arm of the European Union—in 2009 fined Intel the $1.4 billion, saying the chip maker abused its market position to illegally try to keep PC makers from using x86 processors from rival Advanced Micro Devices. The General Court ruled that Intel acted improperly in offering loyalty rebates to PC makers like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Acer, Lenovo and NEC between 2002 and 2005 if they bought all or most of their chips for their systems from Intel. Intel also was accused of putting stringent restrictions on the other 5 percent of PCs not using its processors, and of paying Media-Saturn, a retail chain in Germany, to only sell systems powered by Intel chips. As a result, AMD was effectively shut out from participating in the European PC market and deprived PC makers and end users of being able to take advantage of lower prices that may have been available in a more competitive market. Along with the fine, antitrust regulators also ordered Intel to stop offering illegal rebates. Intel officials have disputed the claims, saying the company competed aggressively against AMD and others but that its business practices never violated antitrust or other laws. They also appealed the fine, saying it was too harsh. The EU General Court in 2014 disagreed, ruling that regulators were correct in their assessments and that the fine was legitimate. The "fine is appropriate in the light of the facts of the case," the court said at the time in its ruling. The chip maker appealed to the ECJ in Luxembourg, making its arguments during a hearing June 21. In his opinion issued Oct. 20, the ECJ's Wahl agreed with many of Intel's arguments, saying that the General Court erred in ruling that the rebates and payments the chip maker made to OEMs created a non-competitive environment and harmed AMD or consumers in Europe. At the same time, Wahl also questioned whether deals made between Intel and Lenovo had similar impacts. "In the light of the nature of the errors committed by the General Court … the state of the present proceedings does not in my view permit final judgment to be given," Wahl wrote. "That is because a decision on the merits (whether or not the rebates and payments offered by Intel constitute an abuse of dominance contrary to Article 102 TFEU, as well as whether the Lenovo agreements had any immediate, substantial and foreseeable anticompetitive effect within the [European Economic Area]) hinges upon an examination of all the circumstances of the case and … of the actual or potential effect of Intel's conduct on competition within the internal market. That, in turn, involves an assessment of the facts which the General Court is better placed to carry out." Given that, "I propose that the Court should refer the case back to the General Court for a fresh review," he wrote. Wahl's opinion is non-binding, but the ECJ reportedly tends to follow the recommendations of its advisers. If the fine is eventually overturned, it could have a significant impact on similar cases the European Union is pursuing against other tech vendors, including Apple, Google and Qualcomm. "The extent to which the advocate general disagrees with the Commission is significant," Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright in London, told Reuters. "The advocate general's opinion says—on the Intel facts—the commission got it wrong. Assuming the court follows this opinion, this is a good outcome from the perspective of competition policy, and may lead to the commission revising its approach in ongoing cases."           LATEST PC HARDWARE ARTICLES   Factors You Need to Consider When Replacing Aging Laptops New Microsoft Surface Books, Surface Dial Go on Sale Microsoft Nixes Xbox Streaming Stick AMD Targets Gaming, VR Content Creators With New Radeon Graphics Cards Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Completely redesigned from ground up, the system is made specifically for enthusiasts and power users who want desktop performance but don't want to sacrifice portability. Packed with more power than ever before possible in a notebook under an inch thick, Razer's latest system is capable of handling virtually any task, anytime, anywhere. The new Razer Blade Pro features the latest Intel® Core™ i7 quad-core processor and next-generation NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1080 GPU. It is the most powerful system ever built by Razer and the thinnest notebook available with a GTX 1080. Other highlights on the new Razer Blade Pro include Thunderbolt 3 for advanced connectivity options, 32 GB of DDR4 dual-channel memory, up to 2 TB of PCI M.2 SSD in RAID 0 storage and a built-in SD card reader. While other similarly equipped desktop replacements are more than two inches thick and weigh more than 10 pounds, the new Blade Pro retains its iconic form factor. Its unibody CNC aluminum chassis still measures just 0.88 inches thin while weighing less than eight pounds. The included AC adapter also dwarfs similarly powered systems and complements the overall mobility of the Blade Pro. Even more remarkable is the system's thermal management system. This all new thermal management system in the Blade Pro now includes the worlds thinnest manufactured vapor chamber cooling solution in a notebook. The vapor chamber reduces heat resistance and hotspots by spreading heat quickly, evenly and efficiently. A custom fan design and dynamic heat exchanger are paired with the vapor chamber to maximize heat dissipation. This allows the Razer Blade Pro to be the most powerful computer ever assembled in such a thin chassis. The rest of the desktop replacement notebook offers a similar no-compromises approach. A stunning 17.3-inch 4K IGZO monitor with NVIDIA G-SYNC™ technology produces the smoothest possible framerates. The display offers 100 percent Adobe RGB color accuracy to deliver stunning visuals to gamers and professionals. Additionally, the Razer Blade Pro is the first notebook to utilize Razer's Ultra-Low-Profile Mechanical switches. Each switch features a true actuation and reset point. Presses are registered with 65 grams of force, mimicking the feel of full-size mechanical keyboards. The keyboard and trackpad are also Powered by Razer Chroma™. This technology unlocks a virtually endless array of dazzling lighting effects that can be customized by the user or synced to display in-game events. The specs for the Blade Pro exceed minimum hardware requirements of HTC Vive™, Oculus Rift and OSVR HDK 2, making it one of the most mobile VR-ready devices for enthusiasts and developers. "The original 17-inch Blade was the first laptop that truly blended power and portability in a PC," says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO. "We've taken that approach another step further with the new Razer Blade Pro. The thermal engineering behind it is staggering. It's incredible how far we've come, from having one product and a small team, to today, with a full catalog of gaming systems and a large group of engineers and designers pushing what a portable gaming machine can do." "It's impressive what Razer was able to pack into the new Razer Blade Pro," said Mark Aevermann, senior product lead for GeForce gaming laptops at NVIDIA. "They have managed to design a gaming laptop with our flagship GeForce GTX 1080, in a form factor gamers can take with them on the road." The 17-inch Blade Pro joins the rest of Razer's award-winning systems lineup. The 14-inch Razer Blade sets the benchmark for mobile gaming, while the 12.5-inch Razer Blade Stealth was named the "Best PC" at CES earlier this year for its combination of performance, value, expandability and portability. Both models recently announced refreshes that are shipping now. For more information on the new Razer Blade Pro, and to register to be notified about on-sale timing, visit razerzone.com/bladepro.

Grace Hopper organizers struggle to practice the diversity they advocate Posted Oct 20, 2016 by Megan Rose Dickey (@meganrosedickey) 0 SHARES Next Story The Nike Mag sneaker raffle raised $6.75 million for Parkinson’s research Advertisement The Anita Borg Institute, the organization responsible for the annual Grace Hopper Women in Computing Celebration taking place right now in Houston, has a problem with racial diversity and not practicing what it preaches, according to several current and former employees. These critics see this as problematic because ABI positions itself as a leader in efforts around diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. Aside from throwing this huge women in computing conference, ABI evaluates companies based on their gender diversity and parental leave policies, and works with partners like Google, HP and Intel to make the workplace more welcoming to women. But current and former employees say that ABI has lacked focus on people of color and leadership has been resistant or dismissive when asked to make inclusion of POC a priority. They have also said that the maternity leave policy at ABI is “abysmal.” That has left current and former employees questioning whether the organization is committed to including people of color and wondering when ABI will follow the same best practices it recommends to other companies. In the last year, there have been instances in which members of ABI’s leadership team have allegedly said that racial diversity is not a priority. Even though ABI’s slogan is “Measure what matters,” it’s not clear where racial diversity fits into the organization’s plans, according to my sources. One source told me that, at a marketing and organizational transformation meeting on June 17, 2016, a senior leader allegedly said that “race is not a priority metric for us to target or to measure.” A different source described their takeaway from that same meeting as being that women of color are not a priority in terms of event programming. To further highlight the organization’s issues around racial diversity, one person told me that a member of the board of trustees allegedly expressed that she didn’t know why “racial diversity was such a big deal” and didn’t understand why ABI had to focus on it or why it was necessary. “I do remember her saying it was a hassle,” the source told me. On a basic level, a current employee said, there is a discomfort when it comes to talking about race at the leadership and executive levels. When racial diversity comes up, that’s when some leaders start to stutter, this source said. “Senior leaders have a superficial understanding,” the source said. “They don’t want to get in the weeds of diversity as it relates to race and LGBTQIA people.” There is only one black person in a leadership role. That person is Rosario Robinson, who is the director of ABI communities. I asked Telle Whitney, the CEO of the Anita Borg Institute, about some of those comments made by certain members of ABI’s senior leadership team. “We have a great senior leadership team,” Whitney responded. “We’ve often talked about gender diversity and I’m not aware of anybody on my direct staff or actually in the company has ever, under any circumstances, [who] has said that diversity is not important. I know that sometimes we live in a fish bowl and sometimes comments can be misconstrued, but it’s certainly important to me and it’s a commitment we make to the organizations that we work with, but not just with diversity. We really are looking hard at what we’re telling companies to do and how do we take those lessons learned and move them into our staff development plans for the ABI.” She went on to say, “I don’t know who [from the leadership team] said that, but I don’t agree.”   For what it’s worth, my sources told me that Whitney was not present during those meetings and interactions. Still, some former and current employees are under the impression that senior leaders are not committed to racial diversity. So, in an attempt to clarify, I asked Whitney, “so, racial diversity is a priority?” “Diversity,” Whitney affirmatively said. “We don’t set targets, but we do have a very ethnically diverse staff and I do think it’s because we are welcoming to all kinds of different people.” ABI has never released a diversity report, but it plans to by the end of this year, Whitney told me. In terms of what it will entail, Whitney said, “for us, the biggest in terms of diversity is men. Because we work with women we actually only have a few men, but we also look at ethnic diversity. Our staff, we have about 10% African-Americans, about 7% Latino. What’s also important to us is age diversity.” It seems that having enough men on the team is more important than racial diversity. Using Whitney’s own words, it’s the “biggest in terms of diversity.” The Board of Trustees, for instance, has more men (10) than it does people of color (one). Shoutout to Aicha Evans of Intel, the sole black person on the Board of Trustees. “We can do better,” Whitney said. “There’s no question we can do better, but it has been in the focus area and we have seen some changes and we expect to see more. It’s interesting on our board because of our model, we actually have people come from different companies so you’re balancing trying to find the right position at those companies but also ensuring that we have diversity.” Meanwhile, ABI’s maternity policy is not up to snuff. Whitney confirmed that the ABI does not have a parental policy in place. Instead, those who need to take leave due to a pregnancy need to go on disability. “ABI has an abysmal maternity leave policy, and it ranks companies (through its Top Companies program) on paternity leave policies,” Brianne Huntsman, a now-former content curator and social media specialist at the ABI told me. “ABI is announcing the top companies award winner at GHC, and it is so hypocritical, given its own policies.” Whitney says that ABI is small enough that it hasn’t needed to put in an official policy. Though, she went on to say, “it’s certainly something that we expect to look at.” As Huntsman noted, ABI puts out a yearly ranking of the top tech companies for women. That ranking is based on things like maternity and paternity leave policies, flexible time, pay equity, accountability for gender diversity and leadership development programs. “They wouldn’t qualify for their own leadership index,” another former employee told me. “They can’t eat the food that they’re demanding everybody else eat.” Ultimately, there’s a lack of cohesive thought and intention around efforts of diversity and inclusion at the organization, a current employee said. ABI simply doesn’t have plans or action-oriented goals around the inclusion of LGBTQIA people and people of color. “The sentiment in general was we don’t practice what we preach, especially in our studies, research, papers and research that we promote,” one former employee told me. “Yet, we had a program to help companies re-develop their culture in a way that was more inviting for communities, but we didn’t even test that or practice what we preached within. There was a lot of that when I left. A lot of folks were not surprised that I was leaving, but surprised that it was so short.” Related Articles Palantir says it didn't racially discriminate against Asian people Salesforce's shift into equality Tech companies like TaskRabbit are engaged in affirmative action, and that’s ok ABI is also suffering from turnover, according to a source. Whitney confirmed that there has been a lot of turnover at the organization over the past year, and contributed it to the 50% growth in employees from the end of 2014. “I come from the world of startups,” Whitney said. “And that kind of growth in that small of a company is hard. There’s just nothing easy about it. We’ve made some mistakes. There’s no question we’ve made some mistakes.” One mistake, for example, is that ABI hasn’t internally applied the learnings from the training they provide to companies. Whitney said the organization hasn’t moved fast enough to put things like staff training and management training in place. Last year at Grace Hopper, not a single black woman was included as a headline speaker, but they were able to make room for two white men as special guest speakers. The conference did feature Janet George, Chief Data Scientist at SanDisk (who a source tell me was a last-minute addition) and Maxine Williams, Chief Diversity Officer at Facebook — both women of color — as panelists or plenary speakers, not headline speakers.  Whitney referenced last year in our chat, saying that “one of the things that came up last year were some pretty good and important comments from our community about our diversity for the conference overall, so we took those comments seriously.” This year, women of color are making up 30% of the speakers on the main stage, Whitney said. On Friday, for example, the “What Are Tech Tools Doing That the Best Diversity Initiative’s Aren’t” features one Latina person and one black woman. It’s also moderated by Slack engineer Erica Baker. Baker, who is black, was one of the first people to call out the Grace Hopper conference last year for its lack of racial diversity on stage. “I have mixed feelings about being here in general just because the conference itself still isn’t diverse,” Baker told me on day one of Grace Hopper. “It still has a white dude speaking as the keynote speaker.” Baker was referring to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who is giving the keynote on Friday. “He’s literally taking up space,” Baker said. “And that ABI allows him to do that and empowers him to do that feels kind of gross.” But ABI didn’t completely whiff in terms of keynote speakers. One of the keynote speakers on day one of GHC was Dr. Latanya Sweeney, a black professor in government and technology at Harvard University and founder of the Data Privacy Lab. ABI also honored three black women. Whatever reluctance there is to include women of color on the leadership team hasn’t stopped the organization from including women of color in its event programming. “It’s marketing,” a source said in regards to the event kicking off with Dr. Sweeney. “It needs to be authentic. They can’t even put [diversity] in their own organization.

Needs Yahoo! Inc. to Stay Alive (VZ) Verizon stock has solid management to back it up, but the company lacks customers By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Oct 20, 2016, 9:38 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 10 Stocks to Buy If Donald Trump Becomes President Recent Posts: Why Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) and Home Depot Inc (HD) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Owners Should Ask Tougher Questions Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Holders Are in for a Wild Wednesday View All Posts While Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has been busy trying to decide how it was going to handle its now uncertain acquisition of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), it has still been running a telco business. Last quarter’s results remind us why Verizon is seeking out such a growth opportunity. Although the reported per-share earnings figure topped estimates, that was the only real “win” for the report. VZ stock fell in response, and understandably so. Source: Via Flickr In its recently completed third fiscal quarter of 2016, VZ earned an operating profit of $1.01 per share, and reported revenue of $30.94 billion. Analysts were expecting income of only 99 cents per share on $31.09 billion worth of revenue. For the third quarter of 2015, the company earned $1.04 per share of Verizon stock on sales of $33.16 billion. Verizon stock had topped earnings estimates in five of the prior six quarters, making this the sixth beat of the last seven. The bar had been set relatively low for most of those quarters though. Operating income for Q3 came in at $6.5 billion, while operating margins were 21.1%. Non-GAAP EBITDA reached $10.5 billion, while non-GAAP EBITDA margin came in at 33.9% for the quarter. 7 Stocks That Will Hit the Skids by Christmas CEO Lowell C. McAdam commented: “Verizon continues to deliver strong financial and operational results in highly competitive markets while positioning itself for future growth. While we transform our company in a challenging environment, we have maintained the financial flexibility to invest in our industry-leading networks to better serve customers, add scale to bring innovation to the mobile media and Internet of Things (IoT) markets, and increase dividends for a 10th consecutive year.” Verzion Earnings Show It Still Needs Yahoo Verizon was the winning bidder for struggling web company Yahoo, offering $4.8 billion for the company’s web properties in July of this year. That offer excludes the company’s stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) and Yahoo Japan, which make up the bulk of Yahoo’s value at this time. Although most everyone agrees Yahoo needs plenty of work to become the powerhouse it used to be, in the right hands it could return to its previous greatness. VZ acquired Yahoo rival AOL last year and has already shown forward progress with the newly bought property. With Yahoo in the mix, even more synergies could be achieved. A deal with Yahoo would also give Verizon access to web users who may also be interested in Verizon’s digital video ambitions like Go90 or even a so-called “skinny” cable television bundle that it has expressed interest in before. AOL’s video presence was a key reason Verizon nabbed it in 2015. Now though, VZ may back of out the Yahoo deal. In September, it was revealed that Yahoo didn’t disclose a major data breach that occurred in 2014. The company has also quietly been working with law enforcement officials, taking measures that some would say is a violation of privacy. Both gaffes damage the Yahoo brand, adding to the burden Verizon stock will bear if it goes through with the deal. Revenue Headwind for Verizon Stock VZ stock can certainly use the added revenue. While it’s still a cash cow, it has not been a growth machine in a while. Revenue for the prior three quarters has effectively been flat on a year-over-year basis, and earnings growth hasn’t been much more impressive. A saturated wireless and television market in conjunction with a decreasing need for landlines are the culprit for that stagnation, leaving wireless subscriber market share as the only sizeable growth engine. Wireline revenue fell 2.3% to $7.8 billion.

So What? No major surprises can only be a good thing for the recovering natural gas pipeline operator By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Oct 20, 2016, 9:45 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Rest of 2016 10 Stocks to Buy If Donald Trump Becomes President Recent Posts: Why Nokia Corp (ADR) (NOK), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (TEVA) and Home Depot Inc (HD) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Owners Should Ask Tougher Questions Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Holders Are in for a Wild Wednesday View All Posts Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) may have technically booked a loss of 10 cents per share for its recently ended third quarter, but its distributable cash flow of 48 cents per share of KMI stock on $3.33 billion worth of revenue was more than enough to pay for the 12.5 cent quarterly dividend the company intends to pay shareholders in early November. The difference will continue to support the ongoing improvement of the company’s financial situation. Source: Roy Luck via Flickr Analysts were collectively calling for earnings of 16 cents per share on revenue of $3.47 billion. Both numbers were lower than the year-ago distributable income of 19 cents per share of KMI stock and sales of $3.71 billion. The midstream pipeline (mostly natural gas) operator earned 15 cents per share in its second fiscal quarter of the year. President and CEO Steve Kean commented: “We had a good third quarter and once again, we demonstrated the resiliency of our cash flows, generated by a large, diversified portfolio of predominantly fee-based assets. We generated a loss per common share for the quarter of $0.10, primarily as a result of non-cash charges discussed below. That said, we produced distributable cash flow of $0.48 per share relative to our $0.125 per share dividend, resulting in $801 million of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend.” KMI Stock: Putting a Lid on Costs The company has been, and continues to be, diligent about containing costs, only focusing on projects that offer strong ROIs. Kean said after the release of Q2’s results that the company’s backlog stands at $13.5 billion worth of projects. That figure has since been whittled down to $13 billion as the company completed some work during the quarter. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Ride Healthcare to Riches But it’s still finding plenty of good ones. In the statement delivered with last quarter’s numbers, the company expects its current backlog to generate an average capital-to-Ebitda multiple of approximately 6.5. RBC Capital Market recently noted its backlog of projects should lead to revenue growth, funding the firm’s expectations of $1 worth of dividends per share of KMI stock in 2018. The current annualized dividend payout is 50 cents per share. RBC expects the natural gas company to continue raising its dividend, considerably, through 2020 when it could reach $2 per share. It’s easier for Kinder Morgan to complete lucrative projects than its smaller peers, as it’s able to leverage its size and build new pipelines more cost effectively. Capitalization Progress In early October, Stifel downgraded KMI stock from a “buy” to a “hold” after a runup had pushed the value of KMI stock up 50% for the year. Analyst Selman Akyol explained “While Kinder Morgan’s natural gas dominated asset base and improving balance sheet remain attractive, we believe the current valuation largely reflects the positive attributes of the KMI story. As a result, we are downgrading shares of KMI to Hold.” That balance sheet improved in the meantime, with long-term debt pulling back to $36.7 billion versus $40.6 billion a year earlier and $38 billion a quarter ago. Debt levels remain uncomfortably high, however, while the company continues to decrease its debt leverage. At the end of the second quarter Kinder Morgan’s net-debt-to-Ebitda pulled back to 8.8 — the first decrease for the prior seven quarters. Last quarter marks the second quarter of net-debt reduction, and there’s another $750 million already earmarked to lower debt levels for the quarter currently underway. Moody’s recently projected that Kinder Morgan would continue to whittle down the debt-Ebitda ratio down to 5.4 by the end of next year, restoring creditworthiness and access to new funding sources … if needed. Its plans, though, broadly steer the company away from taking on more debt. Chairman Richard Kinder plainly stated “We do not expect to need to access the capital markets to fund our growth projects for the foreseeable future beyond 2016.” Kinder added, “We are ahead of our plan for 2016 year-end leverage and we’re pleased with the progress toward reaching our targeted leverage level of around 5.0 times net debt-to-Adjusted Ebitda.” It should be at 5.3 by the end of the year.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Copyright Ethan Miller, Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp.’s (IW 500/20) fight to overturn a record 1.06 billion euro (US$1.16 billion) European Union antitrust fine received a boost from an adviser to the bloc’s top court in a case that could have ramifications for a growing list of disputes involving U.S. tech giants from Google to Apple Inc. Intel’s appeal should be totally reviewed by a lower court, which was wrong to rule against the company’s system of rebates, Advocate General Nils Wahl of the EU Court of Justice said in a non-binding opinion Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within about six months. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out “exclusivity rebates” paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court’s analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The European Commission in Brussels declined to comment. Popular Now Procurement 2025: 10 Challenges that Will Transform Global Sourcing Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement A victory for Intel would be rare setback for EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of a probe that culminated in the iPhone maker’s 13 billion-euro tax bill. The Intel ruling may also have affect the EU’s handling of probes into Google and Qualcomm Inc. that could ultimately lead to fines. Intel’s 2009 antitrust fine was the EU’s biggest, more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004. It represented about 4% of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10% of yearly sales regulators can impose. While urging a review of the case, Wahl didn’t criticize the size of the fine, saying Intel failed to prove the amount was disproportionate. The EU’s eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002 until 2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95% of chips for PCs from Intel. Intel raises restructuring charge to $2.3B, beats with Q3 sales of $15.8B, EPS $0.80 https://t.co/CTp90JKLFj — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) October 19, 2016 The EU regulator said Intel imposed “restrictive conditions” for the remaining 5%, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp., were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm Eyes Intel Case Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Wahl was critical of the EU’s handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to say regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU’s tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the probe and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based AMD, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and didn’t intervene in the EU court hearings.

Intel's appeal should be totally reviewed by a lower court, which was wrong to rule against the company's system of rebates, Advocate General Nils Wahl of the EU Court of Justice said in a non-binding opinion Thursday. The top court will decide whether to back his views in a ruling expected within about six months. The lower tribunal was wrong to single out "exclusivity rebates" paid to customers who bought most or all of their chips from Intel, he said. The General Court's analysis failed to show that the rebates harmed competition. The European Commission in Brussels declined to comment. Rare Setback A victory for Intel would be rare setback for EU antitrust regulators facing a court clash with Ireland and Apple over the fairness of a probe that culminated in the iPhone maker's 13 billion-euro tax bill. The Intel ruling may also have affect the EU's handling of probes into Google and Qualcomm Inc. that could ultimately lead to fines.Intel's 2009 antitrust fine was the EU's biggest, more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against Microsoft Corp. in 2004. It represented about 4 percent of Intel's $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. While urging a review of the case, Wahl didn't criticize the size of the fine, saying Intel failed to prove the amount was disproportionate. The EU's eight-year investigation found that Intel impeded competition by giving rebates to computer makers from 2002 until 2005 on the condition that they buy at least 95 percent of chips for PCs from Intel. The EU regulator said Intel imposed "restrictive conditions" for the remaining 5 percent, supplied by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which struggled to overcome Intel's hold on the market for processors that run PCs. Dell Meeting Acer Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo Group Ltd. and NEC Corp., were among computer firms coaxed to use Intel chips, the commission said in 2009. The ordered Intel to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors, an instruction that Intel complained was unclear. Qualcomm will be watching the Intel case as it battles EU allegations that it paid an unidentified phone manufacturer to use its chipset. It will defend itself next month at a closed-door hearing examining a second set of charges that it sold chips below-cost to harm a smaller rival. Wahl was critical of the EU's handling of evidence it gathered against Intel, saying the lower court was wrong to say regulators could add details of a meeting with a Dell executive long after the fact. Any ruling on this point may echo challenges that Ireland and Apple are preparing against the process leading up to the EU's tax decision in August. The appeals may argue that EU regulators unfairly kept them in the dark during the probe and neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, people with knowledge of their case have said. Sunnyvale, California-based AMD, which initiated the EU antitrust case, is no longer involved in the case and didn't intervene in the EU court hearings. © 2016 Bloomberg L.P Tags: Intel, Google, EU, European Union, Antitrust How Apple Is Helping Builders Make iPhone-Controlled Homes a Reality Intel Gets Support to Overturn $1.16 Billion EU Antitrust Fine     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Micromax Canvas Spark 4G Porsche Design Huawei Mate 9 Meizu Pro 6s Samsung W2017 Huawei Mate 9 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » RDP ThinBook 1430B 14.1 I...

The multiplier on the 7700K was upped to x67, while the bus speed wasn't touched. We don't know what voltage was used, but with HKEPC using LN2, we're sure it was pretty high.     Intel's upcoming Core i5-7600K was also overclocked, hitting a very respectable 5.1GHz on air, all done on the ASUS Maximus VIII Gene motherboard by facebookHK. The multiplier was increased to x40, while the bus speed was adjusted slightly to 127.51MHz, and the voltage set to 1.504v.   Intel has used its latest 14nm+ process node, with 8MB of L3 cache and a TDP of 91W - we should expect the Core i7-7700K to fall somewhere around the $370 mark. Intel's more mid-range Core i5-7600K is a quad-core processor on the same 14nm+ node, with 3.8/4.0GHz+ clocks for base/boost, respectively - while it has 6MB of L3 cache and the same 91W TDP, the price will be lower at around $250.

US internet repeatedly disrupted by cyberattacks on key firm Associated Press | LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. Attacks came in waves and from IP addresses from around the world, shifting geographically. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, on a call with reporters. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. ___ Bajak reported from Houston.

World Breaking News Attack on US firm disrupts internet access Deutsche Presse AgenturOctober 22, 2016 1:57pm A cyber attack that downed popular internet sites including Twitter, Paypal, Netflix and Spotify - by targeting the service that allows users to connect to them - has been resolved, US-based DNS provider Dyn says, after hours of outages that spread around the world. The wave of several distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Dyn began at 1110 GMT on Friday (8pm AEDT on Thursday). While the outages initially affected only the eastern United States, later users in Europe and Asia reported problems connecting to dozens of major websites. In a DDoS attack, systems are intentionally flooded with data to slow or stop legitimate users from accessing them. Dyn said it had not received any communication from the attackers and did not know who was responsible, CNBC reported. A senior US intelligence official told US broadcaster NBC that authorities do not believe the attack was state sponsored, instead identifying it as a case of "internet vandalism". Dyn told CNBC that Friday's attacks were "well planned and executed, coming from tens of millions of IP addresses at the same time". The attacks were carried out partly through the "internet of things" - physical devices like printers and appliances connected to the internet. The hijacked devices had been infected with malware, Dyn said, according to the report. Dyn's services are part of the infrastructure of the internet, directing users to its client websites. Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organised networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an Associated Press reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. The collective, named NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on December 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. Outages monitor downdetector.com on Saturday showed service back to normal on dozens of affected websites.

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. "The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us," said Kyle York, the company's chief strategy officer. "What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack." He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as "twitter.com." Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed," said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were "good," presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. "The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected," Dyn's York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. "It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that's over the top," York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. "Prophet" of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. "We've stopped all our attacks," he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks.

The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn't be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. VIDEOS TOP JOBS BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected "zombie" computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. "We didn't do this to attract federal agents, only test power," two collective members who identified themselves as "Prophet" and "Zain" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. "Prophet" said he is in India. "Zain" said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking "good actions." Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself "Ownz" and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, "Ownz" was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. "We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again," he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. » Next page...

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) LONDON (AP) — Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. Members of a hacker group spread across China and Russia claimed responsibility, although their assertion couldn’t be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across America and even in Europe, affecting sites such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. Broad Effects: The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as “twitter.com” into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West Coasts as well as impacting some users in Europe. “It’s been pretty busy for those guys,” Read said. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed.” Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies. “It impacted quite a few users,” he said of the morning’s attack. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available, but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems earlier Friday. Hackers Claim Responsibility: Members of a shadowy hacker collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they did not know who was behind the attacks or if they were orchestrated by a state-backed group or online activists or pranksters. They said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, @NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the @NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They said 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to be taking “good actions.” Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought through hacking only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually.. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. The Vulnerable Internet: For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7:00 a.m. local time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn’t respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said. ___ Bajak reported from Houston.

For many hours today, we were unable to post anything to pennlive.com. During the outage, stories were posted directly to PennLive's Facebook.

Manchester, N.H.-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service attacks, which work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attack had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites from across the U.S. and even in Europe. Among the sites presumably affected were Twitter, Netflix and Sony's PlayStation Network. The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn provides internet traffic management and optimization services to some of the biggest names on the web, including Twitter, Netflix and Visa. Critically, Dyn provides domain name services, which translate the human-readable addresses such as "twitter.com" into an online route for browsers and applications. Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off global positioning systems before driving to the department store. "It doesn't matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there," he said. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company early Friday tracked a half-hour-long disruption in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day caused disruption to the East and West coasts as well as affecting some users in Europe. "It's been pretty busy for those guys," Read said. "We've been monitoring Dyn for years, and this is by far the worst outage event that we've observed." Read said Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America's Fortune 500 companies. That means a lot of disruption. "It impacted quite a few users," he said of the morning's attack. A full list of affected companies wasn't immediately available. But major sites including Twitter and coder hangout Github said they briefly experienced problems. For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and now an instructor in cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. "I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is," he said. Dyn said in a series of statements that it first became aware of the attack around 7:00 a.m. eastern time and that services were restored about two hours later. A little more than two hours later, the company said it was working to mitigate another attack. A Dyn spokesman didn't respond to questions seeking further information about the online onslaught. The Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption.

Cyberattacks on the key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States on Friday, according to analysts and company officials. The White House described the disruption as malicious. (Jim Cole, The Associated Press)  Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH. In a widely shared essay titled "Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet," security specialist Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. "Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services," he said. . . . . . . .

The White House called the disruption malicious and a hacker group claimed responsibility, though its assertion couldn’t be verified. Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its data centers were hit by three waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, which overwhelm targeted machines with junk data traffic. The attacks, shifting geographically, had knock-on effects for users trying to access popular websites across the U.S. even in Europe. “The complexity of the attacks is what is making it so difficult for us,” said Kyle York, the company’s chief strategy officer. “What they are actually doing is moving around the world with each attack.” He said an East Coast data center was hit first; attacks on an offshore target followed later. The data flood came from tens of millions of different Internet-connected machines — including increasingly popular but highly insecure household devices such as web-connected cameras. It was an onslaught whose global shifts suggested a sophisticated attacker, though Dyn said it had neither suspect nor motive. BROAD EFFECTS The level of disruption was difficult to gauge, but Dyn serves some of the biggest names on the web, providing the domain name services that translate the numerical internet addresses into human-readable destinations such as “twitter.com.” Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at Intel Security, compared an outage at a domain name services company to tearing up a map or turning off GPS before driving to the department store. “It doesn’t matter that the store is fully open or operational if you have no idea how to get there,” he said in a telephone interview. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday in which roughly one in two end users would have found it impossible to access various websites from the East Coast. “We’ve been monitoring Dyn for years and this is by far the worst outage event that we’ve observed,” said Read. Dyn provides services to some 6 percent of America’s Fortune 500 companies, he said. A full list of affected companies wasn’t immediately available but Twitter, Netflix, PayPal and the coder hangout Github said they experienced problems. HACKERS CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY Members of a shadowy collective that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. They said they organized networks of connected “zombie” computers called botnets that threw a staggering 1.2 terabits per second of data at the Dyn-managed servers. “We didn’t do this to attract federal agents, only test power,” two collective members who identified themselves as “Prophet” and “Zain” told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange. They said more than 10 member participated in the attack. It was not immediately possible to verify the claim. Dyn officials said they have received no claim of responsibility, but are working with law enforcement. The collective, NewWorldHacking on Twitter, has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPN.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshaled half the computing power of Friday’s onslaught. The collective has also claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against Islamic State. The two said about 30 people have access to the NewWorkdHacking Twitter account. They claim 20 are in Russia and 10 in China. “Prophet” said he is in India. “Zain” said he is in China. The two claimed to their actions were “good,” presumably because they highlighted internet security problems. Another collective member the AP previously communicated with via direct message called himself “Ownz” and identified himself as a 19-year-old in London. He told the AP that the group — or at least he — sought only to expose security vulnerabilities. During the attack on the ESPN site, “Ownz” was asked if the collective made any demands on sites it attacked, such as demanding blackmail money. “We will make one demand actually. Secure your website and get better servers, otherwise be attacked again,” he said. THE VULNERABLE INTERNET For James Norton, the former deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security who now teaches on cybersecurity policy at Johns Hopkins University, the incident was an example of how attacks on key junctures in the network can yield massive disruption. “I think you can see how fragile the internet network actually is,” he said. Dyn officials said attacks stemmed from tens of millions of devices connected to the internet — closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders and even thermostats — that were infected with malware. “The Internet of Things sort of ran way ahead of how the Internet was architected,” Dyn’s York said on a call with reporters. He said there are between 10-15 billion such devices online. Dyn first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and problems continue. “It is a very smart attack. As we start to mitigate they react and start to throw something that’s over the top,” York said on a call with reporters. The second attack broadened its net, affecting the U.S. West Coast. “Prophet” of New World Hackers said hacktivists of the broad, more amorphous Anonymous collective piled on in the third wave on Friday afternoon. “We’ve stopped all our attacks,” he said at midafternoon. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. Security experts have recently expressed concern over increasing power of denial-of-service attacks following high-profile electronic assaults against investigative journalist Brian Krebs and French internet service provider OVH . In a widely shared essay titled “Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet,” respected security expert Bruce Schneier said last month that major internet infrastructure companies were seeing a series of worrying denial-of-service attacks. “Someone is extensively testing the core defensive capabilities of the companies that provide critical internet services,” he said.

STARTING from automobile company Ashok Leyland (they launched India’s first indigenous electric bus earlier this week) to FMCG conglomerate CavinKare, with presence in over 20 countries, Chennai-based enterprises have been making impactful forays into foreign lands for a while now. More recently, we’ve been noticing startups setting up offices abroad, picking up awards along the way (think Freshdesk). In fact, one such player, Zoho Corporation, after setting up an office in California, saw their client base increase so much that they are now investing a fortune in an upcoming data centre in the country. We speak with four entrepreneurs who are making an impact on foreign shores and inspiring others. Vijay Karunakaran Fourteen years at Intel taught Vijay Karunakaran a thing or two about man-management. This came in handy when he started InGage in 2013, developing gaming software, and augmented and virtual reality services. He now has offices in the US and Singapore, and launched his first one in Dubai two weeks ago. The laurels that came his way (his sister app development platform, Buzztm, recently featured in NASSCOM’s list of the top 12 startups this year) barely reveal the challenges that he faced when setting up shop outside the country. “Language barriers, cultural differences and long distance management are all major obstacles that crop up when you have businesses abroad,” he says. Despite that, he has managed to get 100 customers in the last two months. We are not surprised. After all, he is the man who developed Karbonn Kochadaiiyaan, the 4D augmented reality app themed on Rajnikanth. Details: myingage.com V Ramakrishnamoorthy Backed by clients like Google and Microsoft, Impiger Technologies has developed over 500 apps so far, including their latest ones for US-based restaurant chains like Applebee’s and IHOP, and Chennai-based companies like Fenner India and Rane Group. Owner V Ramakrishnamoorthy—who started overseas operations in Dallas, USA, in 2005, and has since employed over 300 people across the globe (of which 280 are in Chennai and Coimbatore)—believes that the differences between domestic and international deals lie in factors like pricing. His company currently gets 25 per cent of its revenue from Google. That said, they are going to collaborate with the Landmark Group in Dubai, along with the city’s law department (offering an automated mobile interface for lawyers to check documents on the go). Details: impigertech.com Umesh Sachdev It may have taken nine long years, but when Umesh Sachdev was selected as one among the ‘Top 10 Millennials Changing the World’ by the Time magazine this June, the world sat up and took notice. His app, Uniphore, excels in developing speech recognition software and allows users to interact with their digital devices in their native languages. Launched in 2007, it now has over 70 enterprise clients and four million users, and features in the list of companies ranked by Deloitte Technology Fast 500. With this background (plus six patents to boot), Sachdev started his international expansion in 2014. “Before heading to bigger markets like Europe and USA, we chose Philippines, Singapore and Dubai. Once we tested our potential there, we decided to tie-up with partners in the US,” he says. He believes that Chennai has a good product talent pool. “Hence we have set up our product office here and services offices in Bengaluru,” he shares,  adding that they will be focussing on the US and  Asian markets for the next two-three years. Details: uniphore.com Sid Vishwanathan Many of you may remember CardMunch, the app that created digital versions of business cards. It was acquired by LinkedIn in 2011, only to be shut down later after the social network moved on to Evernote. Its founder, Sid Vishwanathan currently owns Sweetness Technologies, an app that allows users in San Francisco to send personalised gifts to their loved ones, along with video greeting cards. Looking back, he says, “I spent almost four years at LinkedIn working on CardMunch. But as an entrepreneur, the itch to start something new never goes away and I decided to go back to the drawing board,” he shares, lamenting that talented entrepreneurs from India have a tough time setting up businesses as non-resident founders in Silicon Valley. “Over a five-year period, we processed nearly 100 million business cards, thanks to my workers, the majority of whom are from Chennai,” he adds. He advises young entrepreneurs to find solutions to domestic problems before thinking of going international.

Michael Hiltzik Columnist BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik Column Facebook won't dump billionaire Peter Thiel from its board because it cares about 'diversity' thiel Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times Libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel speaking on behalf of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in July Libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel speaking on behalf of Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention in July (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times) Michael HiltzikContact Reporter Mark Zuckerberg, the undisputed monarch of Facebook, took to his own website the other day to mount an impassioned defense of one of his handpicked board members, Peter Thiel. “We care deeply about diversity,” Zuckerberg wrote. “That’s easy to say when it means standing up for ideas you agree with. It’s a lot harder when it means standing up for the rights of people with different viewpoints to say what they care about….That’s ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.” That sounds proper superficially, as an answer to critics who argue that Thiel should be dumped from the board because of his association with Donald Trump and other reasons. Dig a little deeper, however, and it proves to be remarkably tone-deaf. So, too, does a defense of Thiel launched by executives at the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, where Thiel is a partner. The partnership’s president, Sam Altman, has tweeted that he disagrees with Thiel’s support of Trump, but “YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee ... We need to talk to each other more, not less…. Cutting off opposing viewpoints leads to extremism and will not get us the country we want." We care deeply about diversity. — Mark Zuckerberg defends keeping libertarian billionaire Peter Thiel on the Facebook board A little background about Thiel might point to why he’s not just another employee with a heterodox political viewpoint, and why his role in Facebook, especially, warrants more than Zuckerberg’s casual brushoff.  Thiel is a billionaire, thanks to his role as co-founder of PayPal. He also was an early investor in Facebook, of which he owned about 1 million shares as of March 31, according to Facebook’s most recent proxy statement.  Thiel is a supporter of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, to which he recently made a $1.25-million donation. That marks him as virtually unique in Silicon Valley; other than Thiel, not a single executive or major investor in a major high-tech company from the region appears on the list of corporate signers to an open letter supporting Trump released earlier this month. After Intel CEO Brian Krzanich abruptly canceled a fund-raiser for Trump at his home in June, the executive explained that he was not endorsing Trump (or any candidate), had intended the event to foster an “open dialogue,” and canceled it when it morphed into a fund-raiser. At Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg moves to tighten the gag on shareholders — and no one can stop him Michael Hiltzik No one would ever mistake Facebook for a shareholder-friendly company. From the moment of its initial public offering in May 2012, it's been entirely under the control of its co-founder, chairman and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Thanks to a two-class stock structure in which Zuckerberg held impregnable... No one would ever mistake Facebook for a shareholder-friendly company. From the moment of its initial public offering in May 2012, it's been entirely under the control of its co-founder, chairman and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Thanks to a two-class stock structure in which Zuckerberg held impregnable... (Michael Hiltzik) Outside the political realm, Thiel gained renown this year by secretly funding Hulk Hogan’s legal campaign against the celebrity website Gawker, which effectively led to Gawker’s demise. Thiel had a personal beef with Gawker, which he thought had disclosed his homosexuality prematurely, and seems to have used Hogan’s lawsuit to settle scores by proxy. An avowed libertarian, he lamented in a piece for the libertarian Cato Institute the “vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the [voting] franchise to women.” Calling them “two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians,” he wrote that the twin phenomena “have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron.” By almost any measure, then, Thiel is an outlier in Silicon Valley. "Peter Thiel is a contrarian," Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said in a recent interview, adding, "You have to remember that contrarians are usually wrong." That in itself doesn’t justify tossing Thiel from the Facebook board. Yet it’s proper to think harder about what a corporate board is expected to do. To begin with, Zuckerberg’s bow to the principle of “diversity” at his company is a joke. There’s no real diversity in Facebook’s management; its shareholding are under the unassailable control of Mark Zuckerberg, who owns less than 15% of all company shares but 76.4% of its class B shares, which carry 10 votes per share. That gives him 53.8% of total shareholder votes, according to the most recent proxy. At the company’s annual meeting in June, shareholders agreed to create a third class of stock, which will allow Zuckerberg to donate much of his shareholding to charity without ceding voting control. The Facebook directors, then, really serve as nothing but office decor at Facebook headquarters. Zuckerberg can talk all he likes about how the individual board members, who include venture investor Marc Andreessen, the banker and political figure Erskine Bowles and Facebook’s highly regarded chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, are there to contribute their vast experience in their fields to his decision-making. But none of them owns voting power of even 1%, or any genuine authority. If Zuckerberg wanted their advice, he could ask them  and wouldn’t need to pay them the more than $350,000 they each receive in cash and stock for serving. They’re on the board to project a certain image for Facebook—technically savvy, public-spirited and yes, diverse. What image, then, does Peter Thiel project for the company? He’s expressed publicly a distaste for social and political inclusiveness—too bad that welfare recipients and women must have a voice in governance. He’s taken a hostile stance against the free expression of ideas, by hounding into near-extinction a new organization whose actions, which were legal, he didn’t like.  Then there’s his association with Trump. Zuckerberg asserts that “there are many reasons a person might support Trump that do not involve racism, sexism, xenophobia, or accepting sexual assault.” That’s true, but it doesn’t obscure the fact that the person Thiel is supporting is a retailer of racism, sexism, xenophobia, and brags about sexual assault. Regardless of whether Thiel likes Trump because of his claims to support “smaller government” and “a different tax policy,” those other elements are inextricable parts of Trump’s character. Trump’s temperament and policies, which include violent hostility to a free press, are inimical to the role Facebook wishes to play as a social medium and information service. By defending Thiel’s relationship with Trump as merely an affiliation with a political viewpoint, Zuckerberg is associating his company with the most noxious and extreme features of national politics. The same goes for Y Combinator. Not even every Republican has stood up for Trump (and more would probably speak out against him if they weren’t making a political calculation of their own). How can these companies decide that this is just politics? It may be that Zuckerberg genuinely feels that Thiel brings something to the boardroom that’s of real value to Facebook. He shouldn’t be forced to dump Thiel from his board (not that he could be). But he needs to give the matter more thought, and make a more compelling argument. To say that a billionaire has a right to serve Facebook in the name of “diversity,” or that keeping Thiel around somehow empowers the rest of us to “share our experiences” and “understand each other” and “connect...a little closer together” is too asinine for words.

Finally. We've been waiting for this MacBook Pro overhaul for years. The event will be taking place at 1pm ET and we'll be covering it as it happens. As always, Apple will be livestreaming the presentation on its website. You can watch with Safari for macOS, Safari on iOS, the Apple TV, or Microsoft Edge on Windows 10. As always, a lot of what we're expecting to see has been leaked out. Here's what to expect. A totally redesigned MacBook Pro Image: Martin Hajek - This is a design concept of what Apple's new MacBook Pro with OLED touchscreen could look like. This is the big one. Apple is expected totally overhaul its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro notebooks. This is a big deal because the actual MacBook Pro design hasn't been changed since 2012, when Apple rolled models with Retina displays. Since then, we've begged and pleaded with Apple to release something worthy of replacing the 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display. Back in May, analyst Ming Chi-Kuo from KGI Securities reported that Apple was going to overhaul the MacBook Pro, making it thinner and offering an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard. The touchscreen will sit where your function keys sit on the MacBook Pro now, and will dynamically change, based on what apps you're using and what is on your screen. Cult of Mac later obtained "spy photos" of the chassis, showing off where the OLED touchscreen will sit. Image: Cult of Mac The MacBook Pro is also expected to add USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 ports for faster connectivity. In fact, a recent Macotakara report suggests Apple will only have USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro. Apple could even get rid of MagSafe, its long-patented (and very useful) power adaptor, and use just USB-C. When it comes to internals, Bloomberg reported back in August that the new MacBook Pro would use AMD graphics. As for processors, Apple could go with Intel's sixth-generation Core Skylake chipset or it could update to the new Kaby Lake processors. We'd love to see Kaby Lake MacBook Pros, especially after waiting this long, but it might come down to yields. Updated MacBook Air Image: Apple Although the MacBook Pro is expected to be the big star of the event, Apple is also expected to update the MacBook Air. Though it might have lost its thin and light crown to the MacBook, it's still Apple's best-selling notebook. It's also Apple's most affordable. Both Bloomberg and Macotakara report that the MacBook Air will be updated with USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. The actual hardware design, which Apple has used since 2010, is expected to be the same. The screen is not expected to get an upgrade, so if you want Retina, you need to pony up for a MacBook or MacBook Pro. Macotakara also reports that Apple will be getting rid of the 11-inch MacBook Air, leaving only the 13-inch model in the lineup. Updated iMac Bloomberg reports that Apple will update its 4K and 5K iMacs with faster processors. This makes sense, since Apple did the same thing last year. It's possible the iMac could also get USB-C ports, though we are really hoping to see some Thunderbolt 3 love. Graphics on the iMac are also expected to get a boost, thanks to newer chips from AMD. 5K External Display Back in June, Apple discontinued its beautiful Thunderbolt Display. The discontinuation was notable because there wasn't another product in Apple's lineup to replace it. For years, professional users who use 4K displays have asked where Apple's first-party solution might is. The problem is that in order to successfully drive a 5K display, you need powerful graphics, something a lot of MacBooks just don't have. Back in June, 9to5Mac reported on rumors that Apple was working on a 5K display with an external GPU, in order to drive that needed performance. We just might see it this week. If Apple does roll-out Thunderbolt 3 across its laptop line, that could pave the way for a 5K display with built-in GPU. No Mac mini and Mac Pro updates Image: Apple Apple hasn't updated the Mac Pro since its release three years ago. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Pro machine will get an update, even thought the addition of USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 would be very welcome to pro users. Similarly, the Mac mini hasn't had an update since October 2014. The Mac mini is a low-volume seller, but plenty of users rely on it for an inexpensive Mac; it's also often used as a server. Sadly, the Mac mini isn't expected to get an update this time.

The DDoS attack targeted New Hampshire-based company Dyn and its managed DNS infrastructure, and began early Friday morning. The company originally said that it restored operations around 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, but a second attack followed that knocked Twitter and others offline again for some users, especially those on the East Coast of the US. The attack is ongoing and is causing outages and slowness for many of Dyn’s customers. The White House press secretary said that the US Department of Homeland Security is investigating, but so far no one knows who might be behind the attacks. “This is a reminder of how effective an attack on one can be an effective attack on many,” Intel Security CTO Steve Grobman said via email. “DNS is one of those internet infrastructure capabilities upon which we all rely. An attacker seeking to disrupt services to multiple websites, may be successful simply by hitting one service provider such as this, a DNS provider, or providers of multiple other Internet infrastructure mechanisms.” DNS service translates website names into IP addresses. Delegating such service capabilities to such multi-tenant service providers has tremendous benefits over traditional architectures where companies are responsible for running their own capabilities. But it also means that if those services are targeted with attacks of significant scale, all tenant services relying on a provider could be impacted. “Given how much of our connected world must increasingly rely upon such cloud service providers, we should expect more such disruptions,” Grobman said. “We must place a premium of service providers that can present backup, failover and enhance security capabilities, allowing them to sustain and deflect such attacks.” Mark Chaplain, VP EMEA for Ixia, told us that botnets are likely behind the offensive. “The availability of ‘DDoS as a service’ and large-scale botnets for hire makes it relatively easy to launch large-scale attacks that can even disrupt the operations of these internet services companies, which have infrastructures designed to handle high traffic volumes,” he said. “Organizations can mitigate the impact of these attacks by reducing their attack surface—blocking web traffic from the large numbers of IP addresses globally that are known to be bot-infected, are known sources of malware and DoS attacks.” Higher-volume attacks have become more frequent.  "With the sheer volume of traffic that the modern DDoS attacks can create (see the recent Brian Krebs DDoS attack as one good example), even the best defenses can be strained to protect against these monstrous attacks, which requires constant improvements to infrastructure and the methods in which these organizations defend themselves from DDoS and other cyberattacks," said Nathan Wenzler, principal security architect at AsTech Consulting, via email.

Not signed up? Create an Account Ken Moore, left, the Democratic nominee, and Ron Noble, right, the Republican nominee, both hope to be the new representative for House District 24. By Nicole Montesano • Staff Writer • October 21, 2016 Tweet Moore, Noble vie for House District 24 seat   [Scroll down to read "Noble tries hand at politics."] Moore makes second run Local handyman and volunteer Ken Moore, a Democrat, is making a second attempt at securing the seat of Republican Jim Weidner in Yamhill County’s House District 24. He ran against Weidner, now retired, two years ago. This time he is vying with former McMinnville Police Chief Ron Noble. Moore said he wants to address transportation, education and affordable housing, as those are the issues voters tell him they are most concerned about. He believes these are areas where he believes he can make a difference. Moore said in education, he wants to make “targeted investments” in two specific areas ,career and technical education and early childhood education. He said he “knocked on 6,000 doors” in the district during this campaign cycle, and added, “You won’t find anyone who doesn’t want more career and technical education.” Schools have cut what used to be called vocational education, Moore said, “because schools are not graded on it,” and the emphasis on test scores eliminated classes in which scores are not tracked. Furthermore, Moore said, “We thought we weren’t going to need manufacturing jobs for a while,” as the state focused more on technology, “so the emphasis went away.” Returning those classes, he said, would greatly increase high school graduation rates. He said test scores and graduation rates also would increase if the state invested more to ensure children come to school ready to learn. Moore, whose résumé lists work as an electrical engineer for both Intel and Hewlett-Packard, currently works as a handyman. He said he has also farmed and volunteered in numerous venues, listing service as a planning commissioner in Yamhill, local Scoutmaster, Gallery Theater president, Sunday school teacher, ASPIRE counselor and host of the local public access television show, “Local Matters.” He said he is the ideal person to represent the district, because he is a “rural Democrat.” “I own guns and I’m concerned about agriculture,” he said. “I’ve farmed. I’ve been out in the field at 2 a.m. when the hay wagon is broken down and the bales are falling down and there’s no one else around.” Moore said he understands and struggles with the division between the interests of land use watchdog group 1,000 Friends of Oregon and farmers and loggers. He said the latter may agree with restrictions on urban sprawl, but may not on stream buffers and pesticide restrictions. “I would be looking at what is the interest here in this district,” he said. Moore has pledged to work hard to secure funding for completing the Newberg-Dundee bypass. “Funding for the bypass is a top priority,” he said. “The Band-Aid at both ends is going to fail.” He argues, “It’s imperative to pass a robust transportation bill this session,” an area where he believes he can make a difference. On the contentious issue of immigration, he said, “If they’re in this state supporting themselves, they’re probably paying taxes. If we exported all our illegals ... we’d be in big trouble.” Moore said he hears constantly from people that affordable housing is a top priority for them. He said he believes the answer is to provide incentives for builders to construct more affordable housing. That would also help to address problems such as homelessness, he said. Moore said he supports the current land use laws, believing they are working as intended — to protect farmland. He said cities in the county have sufficient residential land, particularly if they focus on in-fill. However, he said, a new law that provides some protection against issues that have lead to lengthy fights before the state Land Use Board of Appeals in the past should make it easier for cities to expand their urban growth boundaries. Moore made it clear he dislikes being asked about contentious Measure 97, which would tax the gross sales of large corporations, whether they turn a large profit, small profit or no profit at all. He said, “It’s not my job to defend it.” In an editorial board interview with the News-Register, he did proceed to defend it. He expressed support for the measure, projected to funnel another $3 billion a year into state funds, by saying the state desperately needs more income to address problems such as large classroom sizes, rising college tuition and failing roads and bridges. In a Thursday candidate forum hosted by the McMinnville Kiwanis Club, he said it wasn’t up to him; it was up to voters. His opponent has made an issue out of seeking out and eliminating government waste. Moore said there is merit in that, but it’s not the whole answer. “Audits are a good thing,” he said. But he said, “I don’t think you’re going to audit your way out of a $1.3 billion shortfall.” If elected, Moore said he doesn’t plan to throw his weight around. He said he would be guided by more senior members of the party. “There’s no will to go in and say, ‘Hey guys, Ken’s here. There’s a new rep in town.’”   Noble tries hand at politics Republican Ron Noble is a career police officer who headed the McMinnville Police Department from 2006 to 2014, and now directs campus public safety at Linfield College. But he said he’s “always been interested in politics.” And that interest was sharpened, he said, during the time he spent as head of the Association Chiefs of Police, working with state legislators on various proposed bills. “I got a real taste for how divided and partisan” the Legislature can be, he said. So when State Rep. Jim Weidner said he was thinking of retiring, Noble jumped at the chance to get in. He said he wants to return bipartisan cooperation to the Legislature. And he believes his years of heading the police department will provide good experience for the job. “I’m tired of the extreme party politics,” Noble said. “I don’t believe anybody is extreme right or extreme left. I believe people have a range of beliefs, depending on the issue. Some are extreme right, some are in the middle, and maybe sometimes they’re on the left.” He said he believes 2011 and 2012, when the state House was evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, proved “some of the most productive legislative years,” because opposing lawmakers “actually had to talk” to pass legislation. Noble said he also has a solid understanding of social and health care issues, through his wife’s work in the health care field, which helped shape his views on social issues. He called contentious Measure 97 “the worst idea I’ve ever heard,” saying affected businesses would pass on as many of the costs as possible to consumers, who can ill afford more expenses. He said people with comfortable incomes can absorb some additional costs, but many other members of the community can’t. “I think it’s going to hurt people with middle and lower incomes,” he said. On the current hot-button issue of immigration, Noble takes a measured view. Citizenship is, and should be, a basic requirement for voting, he said. As for illegally entering the country, “I was a cop,” Noble said. “Let’s follow the law.” But he also added, “The law has to be capable of being followed.” He cited the case of an acquaintance and the acquaintance’s wife, who both moved to the U.S. as children. The husband’s parents took the trouble to naturalize him, but the wife’s did not, and that has caused her great hardship. At this point, he said, “They have $15,000 to $18,000 invested. She was told she has to go to Mexico to apply, and they’ve been there since January.” They are at risk of being kidnapped by drug cartels, so they have to keep moving from town to town, as they try to work their way through the process. “They’re both college graduates, productive residents, and they want to do the right thing,” Noble said. “But $15,000? “The system is broken. You have to provide a way to follow the law.” As a state legislator, however, Noble said his focus will be on state issues. “Government is responsible for infrastructure — education funding, transportation, public safety, health care,” he said. He said he wants to stabilize funding for education, address the cost of college tuition and reduce wasteful government spending. “There’s a lot of money we just throw away,” he said. “I’ve yet to find a government where you couldn’t do better.” Departments in McMinnville don’t overspend wastefully because the city does not penalize them for not using up their entire budgets by year’s end. Following that example at the state level, he said, could help reduce waste. Another goal is to “loosen the dictates on small businesses, look at long-term impacts and unintended consequences.” As an example, he mentioned the recent increase in minimum wage. “I’m all for people making more money, but I’m concerned that we just promised what the minimum wage is going to look like six years from now,” he said. On the issue of health care, he said, “The state’s role is to make sure Medicare is expanded and funded adequately,” something he said can be improved. “More people have access now,” he said, “and that’s a great thing. I wouldn’t say it’s more affordable yet, though. It’s still in transition.” There are also problems with needing funding for care not currently covered, he said, and loosening some restrictions on medical care would be beneficial. Noble said Oregon “should get government out of the retirement business,” by leaving retirement provisions “up to individual agencies.” He urged, “Cut off the gravy train with new employees and then figure out how to keep our commitments.” Noble acknowledged he himself is a recipient of the state Public Employees’ Retirement System, saying he retired at 60 percent of his working salary.

According to the new law, German Intelligence is supposed to be under a greater control but at the same time receive more powers that might enable it to spy on European governments and NGOs. While the majority of German MPs voted in favor of the reform, some critics from the Left party and the Green party claim that the new legislation has simply legalized spying on the population. "Unfortunately, the chance to adopt a reasonable law that would put the Federal Intelligence Service under parliamentary control has been missed," member of the Green party and member of the parliamentary committee for the control of intelligence services, Hans-Christian Ströbele, said in an interview with Sputnik. © Flickr/ Philippe Put German Parliament Passes Law Limiting Intel Agency's Spy Powers"The law provides for the creation of a supposedly independent monitoring body whose members will be appointed by the Federal Government. This means that the federal government controls itself. But let me remind you that in certain cases — when the legislation was violated — the Federal Government worked together with intelligence," he added. Last April, an espionage scandal gripped Germany as local media uncovered that the BND had provided technical assistance to the US National Security Agency (NSA) in spying on European targets, including top political figures and corporations. The BND is believed to have spied on some 800,000 IP addresses, phone numbers and email addresses at the request of US intelligence. Under the new system, the BND will still be allowed to work with the NSA, but only under certain strict conditions: fighting terrorism or to protect Germany's national security. At the same time, the powers of the intelligence body are supposed to be enhanced, thus giving it an opportunity to tap European governments and non-governmental organizations again, Ströbele claimed. "This happened before and is happening now. Only now, these actions will be backed by the law," the politician stated. Ströbele also stated that his party will file a lawsuit to the Constitutional Court, claiming that the new surveillance practice is contrary to the German constitution. "I am convinced that the Constitutional Court will take into account our arguments. The problem, however, is that the decision of the Constitutional Court may take years, while the law will be in force all the time," he concluded. ...

High-End Windows 10 Laptops Prepared by Huawei for Early 2017 GO Second-generation MateBook already in the works Oct 21, 2016 08:57 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  The Windows 10 device ecosystem is growing with more high-end devices, and now Huawei is the company that’s looking to benefit from the increasing demand for such models. The company is believed to be so pleased with the success of the first-generation MateBook 2-in-1 device that it’s already preparing the unveiling of the second model, and according to a report from DigiTimes, this could take place in the first quarter of 2017. The new MateBook models will come in two different configurations, with 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch displays, and will be powered by Intel Core i-series processors, the source says. Coincidentally or not, Microsoft is also planning to take the wraps off the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 update in the first months of 2017, so Huawei might be trying to align the release of the new models with the debut of the Windows 10 update. This means that the new MateBooks could come with Redstone 2 pre-installed, but even if they don’t, the update will still be available anyway. Huawei could become a direct Microsoft Surface rival Furthermore, Microsoft is also planning its own share of hardware launches in the first months of 2017, and it’s believed that the Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Book 2 are likely to be included in this device update cycle. The first-generation Huawei MateBook was indeed a pretty compelling product and came with Intel m3 and m5 processors, up to 8 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD storage. The first model featured a 12-inch full HD IPS screen with a resolution of 2160x1440 pixels and touch support and was running Windows 10. Without a doubt, the second generation will feature powerful hardware too, and given the fact that Huawei is already planning the switch to i processors, they might become direct competitors to Surface Pro models. Huawei is already offering good value for the money, so the new models will certainly be worth a look at. #Huawei#Surface#MateBook#Windows 10#Windows 10 laptop subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Expects Windows Phone to Continue Its Collapse in the Short Term Microsoft Pulls Skype for Windows Phone Microsoft Revenue Is Increasing but Not Thanks to Windows Microsoft Reveals Another Major Drop for Windows Phone Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    The first-generation Huawei MateBook New Apps GdPicture.NET Document Imaging SDK: Full-Featured and Royalty Free Document Imaging toolkit for .NET allows you to implement viewing, processing, printing or scanning files SmartFTP FTP Library: Integrate FTP and SFTP file transfer capabilities into your software with the help of this advanced FTP library ActiveX component (COM) Norton AntiVirus Virus Definitions: Signature packanges containing the latest free virus databases for various Symantec antivirus software for both home and business use Curse: Connect, chat, share files and send messages to friends from the games you are playing fast and easy with this intuitive application Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool: Detects viruses and other infections that may have reached one's computer with the aid of different scan modes provided by Kaspersky MediaGet: Search and download torrents from the Internet, being able to use the integrated media player to watch movies without even saving them to your PC first App Builder: Visually design HTML5 apps in a variety of sizes, without prior knowledge of programming techniques, thanks to this straightforward tool Reader comments Load old comments   The New Microsoft Is Playing Dirty like the Old Microsoft, Says Salesforce CEO more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Tesla’s self-driving system will rely on cameras and radar sensors — but not lidar, the laser imaging technology most other companies pursuing self-driving cars are using to generate precise pictures of the environment around their vehicles. Tesla also is not using technology from Mobileye, the Israeli-based supplier of computer vision chips and software that provided components for earlier Tesla models equipped with Autopilot, a semi-automated system designed to assist with driving but not replace the driver. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Mobileye this summer engaged in a public dispute over the safety of Autopilot following a fatal crash in May in which the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed after hitting a truck while driving on Autopilot. “Selling a vehicle with the latest and greatest hardware, but an unproven self-driving software package is a risky strategy,” said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. On Thursday, investors appeared to be betting on Mobileye. Shares of the company rose 2.6 percent to $38.27, while Tesla shares fell 2.2 percent to $199.10. Mobileye supplies two dozen other automakers and suppliers, and has formed alliances to pursue self-driving vehicle systems with German automaker BMW AG, U.S. supplier Delphi and chip maker Intel. “As we move to a higher level of autonomy in vehicles, you’re going to want to have more redundancy,” which radar and lidar can provide, Dan Galves, senior vice president at vision safety system maker Mobileye, said in an interview. “The more sensors, the better.” A winner in the fallout from the Tesla-Mobileye dispute is Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chipmaker that will provide processors for the new Tesla system. Nvidia shares have more than doubled in the past year, and rose another 1.9 percent on Thursday to close at $67.73. No automaker, including Tesla, currently offers a fully self-driving car, although most major manufacturers and suppliers are working furiously on different technology suites — including cameras, radar and lidar — to enable vehicles to drive themselves. Google’s self-driving cars use a combination of lidar, radar and cameras. The company has said the multi-sensor approach compensates for the limitations of each type of sensor. Cameras do not perform well in the dark or in bright light. Ice and snow can block a camera’s view. Lidar can create a 360 degree view of the car’s surroundings, although it is less effective in fog, rain and snow. The high cost of lidar, currently about $8,000, is just one of the obstacles to putting self-driving cars in consumers’ hands. But the cost is rapidly declining and is expected to fall to $25-$100 in the coming years. Ford Motor Co, an investor in lidar manufacturer Velodyne, said it does not plan to put a fully self-driving vehicle into production for ride-sharing fleets until 2021 and for individual consumers until 2025 or later. Toyota Motor Corp has said it does not expect to see Level 5 vehicles — those capable of fully automated operation without humans in all situations — in widespread use for another 10-15 years. Major automotive technology suppliers, including Delphi Automotive PLC, Robert Bosch GmbH, Continental AG and Valeo SA, are all developing self-driving technology and systems that incorporate lidar. Without lidar, Tesla “will not be able to handle all situations with this array of sensors,” said Marta Hall, head of California-based Velodyne, one of the largest suppliers of automotive lidar. UBS analyst Colin Langan raised a concern that while excluding lidar could lower the overall cost of a self-driving system — now pegged by Tesla at $8,000 without lidar — “it would increase negative scrutiny” if it is proven that a lidar sensor could have prevented a fatal accident. Regulators have signaled they intend to keep tighter reins on automakers and other companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google self-driving car project and Uber Technologies, as they roll out self-driving vehicles on public roads. Summarizing the concerns of other automakers and suppliers involved in developing self-driving systems, Langan said Tesla’s early deployment of full automation “without enough testing could have negative long-term consequences” for widespread adoption of self-driving technology. “Lidars are becoming very inexpensive, and they will always add an additional safety layer. So in these early days of self-driving, I wonder why anyone wouldn’t want to use lidars for added safety,” said Sebastian Thrun, former head of Google’s self-driving car project.

Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA Supported by About this content Dan Matthews @dan_matthews Friday 21 October 2016 02.35 EDT Last modified on Friday 21 October 2016 02.37 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger London remains king of the startups, but new travel data suggests towns around England are growing in entrepreneurial muscle. Figures from booking service Trainline for Business show a steep rise in trips for presentations, supplier meetings and sales pitches on rail routes outside the capital. The figures, which cover the period March 2012 to June 2016 and strip out the effect of the growth in popularity of online booking, show the travel trends of nearly 500,000 business trippers from small- and medium-sized enterprises. The number of rail journeys from London to Brighton rocketed 230% over the period despite widely-reported disruption and delays on the Southern network. Swindon enjoyed a 183% bump, Peterborough 166% and Northampton 130%. It’s a huge set of increases in such a short space of time. The stats hint at a major demographic shift; perhaps one in which businesses are opting to locate in smaller metropolitan areas at the expense of major cities. If true, they could prophesise changes to the way people live and work in future. How little Leamington became a global player in gaming Read more Alasdair Rae, a senior lecturer in urban studies and planning at the University of Sheffield who analysed the data, said it was evidence of an emerging crop of entrepreneurial centres that are attracting startups and small businesses. “It’s clear something is happening,” he said, pointing to cheaper rents, lower house prices, skilled local labour markets and convenient access to the capital as the main drivers of business beyond the M25. “These factors have made running a business outside of London easier. Historically, lots of towns and cities were sold on the basis that you could get to London quickly, but now the equation is partially reversed. “Many people moved to Brighton to commute. Now it’s a brilliant place to do business in its own right with its maturing technology and media clusters. There are also disproportionately large tech scenes in Cambridge and Leamington Spa.” But large businesses are fanning out too. Swindon was given a boost in 2014 with the construction of Intel’s Internet of Things innovation centre, while other major players with a presence in the city include Zurich, Nationwide and RWE npower. Oxford, where rail journeys leapt 182%, is home to the Said Entrepreneurship Centre, the Oxford Foundry entrepreneurial hub, and the Oxford Seed Fund. All this innovation convinced Goldman Sachs to set-up its “10,000 Small Businesses” programme there in 2010. Meanwhile, Peterborough’s business credentials have been enhanced by a 240-acre business park and its Eco Innovation Centre. The link between more rail journeys and entrepreneurial activity is drawn out by separate data from the Centre for Cities. It reveals that in 2014, the most recent figures available, Northampton’s startup pedigree was second only to London. Do you live in an entrepreneurial hotspot? Read more During that year the town fostered 80 new businesses per 10,000 of the local population, a staggering rate of creation that leaves more famous industrial centres in its wake, including Manchester with 54, Birmingham with 44 and Liverpool with just 43. Between 2012 and 2014, Northampton enjoyed the fastest growth in new starts with a nearly 80% increase over the period. Its overall stock of businesses went up too by 17%, much faster than any other town or city in the UK. But, according to Rae, this doesn’t spell the end for big cities: “Location is more important than ever and although technology means businesses can locate outside major cities, they still benefit from being within touching distance. “Face-to-face meetings are essential for deal-making and there seems to be a cut-off point for areas more than an hour-and-a-half away from a major conurbation. It remains vital to physically get in front of clients.” He said Silicon Valley, the enormous and world-renowned centre for tech innovation in the US nestled between San Francisco and San Jose, would not have sprung up without vibrant cities full of talent to draw from. If true, the 90-minute effect could have major ramifications for cities to the north of London when the HS2 high-speed rail link is finally completed. The project, which is beset with delays, would speed up journeys linking London to Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Nottingham. “Realistically, Birmingham is just beyond what most people would consider a commutable distance, but HS2 would bring Birmingham into London’s orbit. It will be interesting to see in which direction the skills travel,” said Rae. It also has implications for infrastructure planning: “It’s quite surprising that across the UK people are working on their smart cities programmes without thinking about their geographical position in the country and the fact they can’t change where they are,” he added. Perhaps they should look to Japan for an idea of what a hyper-connected UK might look like in future. The fastest train between Manchester and Liverpool takes 33 minutes and there’s only one an hour. The bullet train from Osaka to Kyoto – about the same distance – takes 12 minutes. A faster transport network would link the whole country; imagine what that could do for entrepreneurs everywhere.

And Microsoft thinks it has found a new way to secure VMs. Let's do Redmond first because its new “Shielded VMs” are one of the headline items in Windows Server and Hyper-V 2016. As explained to The Register by Microsoft program manager Dean Wells, Redmond reckons one of the things that holds back virtualisation is that virtual machines aren't yet as verifiably secure as their bare metal brethren. The main thing VMs are missing is something like Intel's trusted platform module (TPM), the cryptographic signing technique that binds a workloads to a known server. If you apply TPM to a server and then to an application, the workload just won't run unless it's on a server it's been told to trust. Or to put it in terms that Jurassic Park's Dennis Nedry would understand: without the magic word, you'll be locked out. Wells feels the lack of TPM for virtual machines means some organisations keep sensitive workloads on bare metal because they fear rogue admins can take a VM and run it elsewhere. That fear is fair enough because with a .VHD or .VHDX file, or their equivalents for non-Microsoft hypervisors, it's trivial to run a virtual machine. Wells told The Register that Microsoft clients are worried by this, because storage admins, network admins, vanilla sysadmins and other Dennis Nedry types can access the resources on which virtual machines reside. Shielded VMs aim to prevent VM exfiltration by providing a virtual equivalent to TPM, so that VMs just won't run unless they know the host is allowed to run them. Shielded VMs are also shorn of tools like VM console connection, PowerShell Direct and other things that let an admin reach out and touch them, reducing their attack surface along the way. Shielded VMs' disks are also encrypted (at rest and in motion) turning VMs from a portable package that can be plugged into a hypervisor and turning them into black boxes. Hyper-V itself must undergo a rigorous health attestation process before being allowed to run shielded VMs and Microsoft proposes that the provisioning of new shielded VMs must also conform to a known & trustworthy baseline configuration or provisioning will be aborted. Shielded VMs also boot from a virtual Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), so that the state of the host and the VM can be verified as the VM fires up only releasing the encryption key if it’s still healthy. Windows Server 2016's new Host Guardian Service (HGS) gets the job of verifying whether hosts are allowed to run a Shielded VM and/or are in a fit condition to run it. With trusted hosts, only whitelisted VMs in operation (and then only after accounting for themselves as they boot), Microsoft feels you'll be able to embrace hybrid cloud with confidence, in a “trusted fabric” of infrastructure that could span multiple private and/or public data centres. For those yet to adopt TPM V2-enabled servers, there's also an option to use only Active Directory groups to verify VMs' Hyper-V host’s fitness for executing on shielded VMs. Microsoft proudly told world+dog it was way out in front of the VM security race with Shielded VMs, which launched a couple of weeks back at Ignite. That lead was whittled away after a week as VMware launched vSphere 6.5 with UEFI-secured boot for hosts and guests, plus encryption for VMs in motion. For now VSphere itself can use TPM, but Virtzilla's guests can't do virtual TPM. So Microsoft's got a little lead here for now. The Register understands that VMware's Project Goldilocks security product may not be far from its formal debut, so perhaps Virtzilla's security story is about to gain a new chapter. For what it's worth, it looks like Xen has had virtual TPM since version 4.3 and that contributions from the NSA helped make it a reality. Which means Shielded VMs are NSA-grade security.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 October 2016 | MYT 9:17 AM Tesla, rivals joust over how to put self-driving cars on the road No lidar: Tesla's self-driving system will rely on cameras and radar sensors. — Reuters Tesla Motors Inc's decision to equip all of its vehicles with self-driving hardware has intensified competition among rival camps of technology and auto companies over what equipment will be on board cars of the future. Tesla's self-driving system will rely on cameras and radar sensors – but not lidar, the laser imaging technology most other companies pursuing self-driving cars are using to generate precise pictures of the environment around their vehicles. Tesla also is not using technology from Mobileye , the Israeli-based supplier of computer vision chips and software that provided components for earlier Tesla models equipped with Autopilot, a semi-automated system designed to assist with driving but not replace the driver. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk and Mobileye this summer engaged in a public dispute over the safety of Autopilot following a fatal crash in May in which the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed after hitting a truck while driving on Autopilot. "Selling a vehicle with the latest and greatest hardware, but an unproven self-driving software package is a risky strategy," said Barclays analyst Brian Johnson. Mobileye supplies two dozen other automakers and suppliers, and has formed alliances to pursue self-driving vehicle systems with German automaker BMW AG, US supplier Delphi and chip maker Intel. "As we move to a higher level of autonomy in vehicles, you're going to want to have more redundancy," which radar and lidar can provide, Dan Galves, senior vice president at vision safety system maker Mobileye, said in an interview. "The more sensors, the better." A winner in the fallout from the Tesla-Mobileye dispute is Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chipmaker that will provide processors for the new Tesla system. No automaker, including Tesla, currently offers a fully self-driving car, although most major manufacturers and suppliers are working furiously on different technology suites – including cameras, radar and lidar – to enable vehicles to drive themselves. Google's self-driving cars use a combination of lidar, radar and cameras. The company has said the multi-sensor approach compensates for the limitations of each type of sensor. Cameras do not perform well in the dark or in bright light. Ice and snow can block a camera's view. Lidar can create a 360 degree view of the car's surroundings, although it is less effective in fog, rain and snow. The high cost of lidar, currently about US$8,000 (RM33,470) , is just one of the obstacles to putting self-driving cars in consumers' hands. But the cost is rapidly declining and is expected to fall to US$25 (RM105) -US$100 (RM420) in the coming years. Ford Motor Co, an investor in lidar manufacturer Velodyne, said it does not plan to put a fully self-driving vehicle into production for ride-sharing fleets until 2021 and for individual consumers until 2025 or later. Toyota Motor Corp has said it does not expect to see Level 5 vehicles – those capable of fully automated operation without humans in all situations – in widespread use for another 10-15 years. Major automotive technology suppliers, including Delphi Automotive PLC, Robert Bosch GmbH, Continental AG and Valeo SA, are all developing self-driving technology and systems that incorporate lidar. Without lidar, Tesla "will not be able to handle all situations with this array of sensors," said Marta Hall, head of California-based Velodyne, one of the largest suppliers of automotive lidar. UBS analyst Colin Langan raised a concern that while excluding lidar could lower the overall cost of a self-driving system – now pegged by Tesla at $8,000 without lidar – "it would increase negative scrutiny" if it is proven that a lidar sensor could have prevented a fatal accident. Regulators have signaled they intend to keep tighter reins on automakers and other companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google self-driving car project and Uber Technologies, as they roll out self-driving vehicles on public roads. Summarising the concerns of other automakers and suppliers involved in developing self-driving systems, Langan said Tesla's early deployment of full automation "without enough testing could have negative long-term consequences" for widespread adoption of self-driving technology. "Lidars are becoming very inexpensive, and they will always add an additional safety layer. So in these early days of self-driving, I wonder why anyone wouldn't want to use lidars for added safety," said Sebastian Thrun, former head of Google's self-driving car project. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Hunting big game at sea Pampered Canadian pigs feed Japan's hunger for pricey pork MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Warning!

Home Industry Companies Indiamart reports Rs 40-crore loss in FY16 Indiamart reports Rs 40-crore loss in FY16 B2B marketplace Indiamart reported a loss of R40 crore in the year to March 2016 on revenues of R300 crore, Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of Indiamart told FE. By: Hita Gupta | New Delhi | Updated: October 21, 2016 7:13 AM B2B marketplace Indiamart reported a loss of R40 crore in the year to March 2016 on revenues of R300 crore, Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of Indiamart told FE. Revenues rose a smart 40% over FY15 and the company is targetting another 40% jump in FY17. Agarwal added the losses would come down in FY17. The Noida-based company is a B2B marketplace for small, medium and large-sized enterprises that connects buyers to suppliers based on the requirements. The company has raised funds across three rounds from Brand Capital, Intel Capital, Amadeus Capital Partners, Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund and WestBridge Capital. The customer acquisition cost for Indiamart is R15,000, which is a one-time fee. the marketplace is adding 20,000 paying suppliers and 100,000 free suppliers every month. Indiamart’s revenue model works on lead generation and it earns no commission on conversion. Irrespective of the conversion that takes place on the platform, Indiamart charges a subscription or a pre-paid fee to the supplier for every lead. In the pre-paid model, the supplier can be listed on the platform for free but he will have to purchase the lead from Indiamart. “A lead cost typically R449 but through this package the supplier can buy a lead for as low as R200,” Sumit Bedi, vice president – marketing, Indiamart explained. Under the subscription package, Indiamart will charge a subscription fee and give the supplier listing on the site, cataloging services and better lead and content management.The subscription starts from R2,500 and goes to R2.5 lakh, per month, according to Agarwal. Indiamart has 110,000 paid suppliers on the platform. About 25,000 of them have 3-year or multi-year subscription; 30,000 have an annual subscription and 55,000 have a monthly subscription. In 2014, Indiamart launched its subsidiary Tolexo, an online marketplace for industrial goods. According to Agarwal, the company clocks gross merchandise value of $1 billion every month and earns a commission in the range of 12-18%. In FY15, Indiamart had invested $10 million in Tolexo and committed another $15 million each for FY16 and FY17. Collectively, Agarwal is targetting R2,000 crore in revenue by 2020 from three businesses – Indiamart, Tolexo and ProcMart Please Wait while comments are loading...
