Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 11, 2016 at 12:43PM Image source: Micron.  No company, not even one that is incredibly well managed and participates in secular growth trends, is immune to risks. Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the world's largest semiconductor company by revenue, is no exception. In this column, I'd like to highlight three potential risks that investors in this chip giant should be aware of. 1. Intel's fortunes remain tied to the personal computer market Although Intel has done a good job of trying to find growth beyond the personal computer market -- a market that's proven challenging over the years -- the fact of the matter is that this segment still represents a substantial portion of the company's revenue, operating profit, and manufacturing scale. Indeed, last year Intel took in $55.35 billion in revenue. Of that hefty sum, $32.219 billion came from the company's client computing group, which primarily sells components that go into personal computers. This segment also contributed $8.165 billion in operating profit, making it the largest profit machine among the company's business units. If the personal computer market manages to decline slightly, stay flat, or even grow, then Intel's other businesses -- if they grow as expected -- should be more than enough to pick up the slack and help the company achieve some level of revenue growth. However, if the personal computer market drops significantly in a given year, then not only do the prospects of revenue growth dim, but it could have a significant impact on overall profitability. 2. Intel's data center group is about to face significant competition Intel's data center group has benefited from both secular growth trends as well as the fact that it has dominant share of the market for server processors. To be clear, Intel's market share hasn't come by accident -- the company has invested significantly over many years to build best-in-class chips and other technologies in order to grow that share. However, since Intel now overwhelmingly dominates the server processor market, the opportunity to grow its share is limited (though there are non-server opportunities in the data center that Intel is gaining share in). And, naturally, there are many companies vying for a piece of Intel's very lucrative server processor pie. If Intel can maintain significant competitive advantages over its competition, then it should be able to continue to grow with the server market (since Intel's share is high enough that it is virtually the server chip market). However, if Intel loses market share, then that could have a negative impact on its growth rate here. This is something that Intel investors should keep a close eye on. 3. Intel's bet on memory may not pay off Last year, Intel announced that it would be significantly growing its bet on non-volatile memory technologies such as 3D NAND and a new technology that it developed in conjunction with memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU) known as 3DXPoint that's supposed to be much faster than typical NAND flash memory and can be used as both storage and main memory. In particular, Intel said that it plans to spend $1.5 billion this year on capital equipment to refit its chip manufacturing plant in Dalian, China, to manufacture both 3D NAND and 3DXPoint. It's also likely that will continue to invest in both capital equipment as well as research and development in support of 3D NAND and 3DXPoint in the future. If Intel can build competitive products at a leadership cost structure, then it should be able to successfully play in this market. However, if the company's technology winds up falling behind and it is placed at a major cost structure disadvantage, then it might continue to incur significant losses. Right now, the business is losing money but Intel is banking on turning it profitable down the line.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The post, first spotted by Ashraf Eassa from fool.com, said the products in question would arrive in the “2020 and beyond” timeframe. Eassa recently noticed, however, that Intel has published a revised version of the job listing that suggests Intel may be looking to milk its upcoming 10nm process longer than most initially expected. In the updated listing, Intel says it is looking for someone to spearhead the research and advanced development of microprocessor cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs, the company says, will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade. On the surface, it indeed sounds like Intel may be pushing its 7nm chips out by a couple of years, from 2020 to 2022. As Eassa notes, it’s possible that Intel could instead be talking about 5nm technology in the new listing versus the 7nm it explicitly referenced in the original posting. If that were the case, it seems unlikely that Intel would use the phrase “sub-10nm technology nodes” rather than something more fitting like “sub-7nm technology nodes.” Related Reads Intel tells John McAfee he can't use his own name Early Intel Core M benchmarks look very impressive Intel Z170 vs. Z97 chipset: What is the difference? 9 comments 160 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… China still has the two fastest supercomputers in the world The indefatigable PC IBM says Macs save as much as $543 per user versus a PC Popular 33 comments Make Chrome great again: Performance and memory tweaks Samsung SSD 960 Evo 500GB Review: The king of the TLC hill Load Comments 9 ...

No single company is perfect, but together they show what the corporate ideal could look like. The platonic ideal “We are at our best when we draw on the talents of all parts of our society, and our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges.” —Barack Obama in 2011 The practice Genevieve Bell, who’s been at Intel since 1998, was running late for her call, so she quickly ducked into the gender-neutral bathroom at the company’s Santa Clara, California, headquarters before plopping herself down on the floor to dial in. “Intel today feels like a profoundly different company than I was at even five years ago,” says Bell, a cultural anthropologist, senior fellow, and vice president at Intel.  “I had at least one boss who told me my career would be much better if I stopped talking about diversity. I survived, and he didn’t.”  These days, it seems almost every major tech company in Silicon Valley has publicly committed to building a more diverse workforce. But it’s a topic Bell, a self-described radical feminist, has been thinking about since she first arrived at the company 18 years ago. “I had at least one boss who told me my career would be much better if I stopped talking about diversity,” says Bell. She was one of the first social scientists hired by Intel to conduct field work to understand what women and people in the “rest of world” (a term she hates) want from technology. “I survived, and he didn’t.” Like its peers, Intel is overwhelmingly male, white, and Asian, and the diversity problem is a particularly tough one to tackle because 85% of its 100,000 or so employees are in technical roles, which is where the industry’s efforts to improve diversity have largely stalled. “They really have to make a dent on the technical side,” says Elizabeth Ames, a senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, which advocates on behalf of women in technology. “I think it’s really impressive that Intel is not only making this dent, but they are continuing to sustain it.” Since 2000, long before companies like Google and Facebook began releasing their diversity stats, Intel made its EEO-1 reports, which are filed with the US government and break down staff race and gender across all ranks, publicly available. Transparency was a good first step, and key to holding the company accountable, but it alone wasn’t enough. To show it was really committed to the cause, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich went on stage at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), arguably the biggest tech convention of the year, to proclaim the company would reach full representation—meaning the makeup of its staff would mirror market availability across different types of roles—by 2020. This aspiration might seem basic, but it’s rare for a tech company to set specific, measurable goals. While full representation is also a realistic goal, it’s proved largely out of reach for the tech industry. According to Intel’s market availability data, women make up 22.7% of available talent for technical roles while Hispanics and African Americans comprise 8.4% and 4.5%, respectively. At Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, for example, Hispanics and blacks make up 3% and 1%, respectively, of technical roles. Women comprise 17% of tech staff at Facebook and 19% at Alphabet. “It’s time to step up and do more,” Krzanich declared in his keynote address. “It’s not good enough to say we value diversity.” He said Intel would commit $300 million to invest in startups created by women and underrepresented minorities, help define computer science curriculum at high schools, offer internships to diverse students, and send Intel employees to schools to mentor minority students.  “It’s time to step up and do more.”  This was in addition to Intel’s other initiatives to recruit, retain, and promote diverse employees. This year the company started requiring managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for open roles, and for a diverse group of employees to interview job candidates. The company doesn’t mandate specific quotas, but continues to emphasize diversity with hiring managers and will enlist the help of recruiters to fill these slates too. Intel also runs a “pay it forward” program that identifies and connects promising employees with mentors within the company who help groom them into leaders. “I’m a product of the sponsorship protege program,” says Sandra Lopez, vice president of Intel’s new devices group and member of Intel’s Hispanic Leadership Council. “I had a sponsor, and she helped me understand what I needed to do to be a leader and grow and develop. As a result, I became a VP.” It’s a common refrain for tech companies to attribute their lack of diversity to the “pipeline problem,” the notion that there aren’t enough qualified women and minorities to recruit from. Intel, however, believes it can approach the diversity problem from a variety of angles, including keeping its existing employees. “I always say if you just focus on hiring and everyone’s [headed] toward the door, it’s a zero-sum game,” remarks Danielle Brown, Intel’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. To retain its employees, Intel has worked to build a welcoming work environment, one where employees feel there are opportunities to grow their careers. One attempt to do so is a program called Rapid Orientation for Accelerated Results (ROAR), which brings new hires to headquarters for a week to meet with company leaders and attend workshops on career development. Intel believes there’s a ripple effect in promoting diverse employees to managerial roles, who are likely to attract, hire, and mentor other women and underrepresented minorities. A company blog post on Intel’s internal blog. (Intel) “I think we’re all impatient for change to happen quickly.”  When the company first started the program in 2015, it was available only to women. But this year, Intel opened ROAR to diverse hires, which Brown says is key to achieving Intel’s diversity goals. “If we made the choice to be exclusive instead of inclusive, it wouldn’t be received very well,” she adds. “We truly believe for this to work you have to take the inclusive approach.” This same approach has been taken with other initiatives as well, tested first with a smaller group, such as new hires within the last year, before opening it up to more employees. The takeaways While progress is slow, according to Intel’s most recent diversity report released Aug. 10, women now make up 25% of the company’s US employees and 21% of technical staff in the US. In addition, underrepresented minorities comprise 12% of its US employees and technical employees. In the first half of 2016, however, Intel saw a slight decline in the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in their early careers. The company explains this is a result of a shift in focus from PCs to the cloud and connected devices, which led to fluctuations in its hiring numbers and increases in people leaving the company. But the company insists it’s still committed to its goal of full representation by 2020. In Silicon Valley, where cars drive themselves and marijuana shows up an hour after it’s ordered, diversity has proven to be a problem with no easy solution. Intel knows there’s more than just the pipeline problem, which it’s committed to fixing. To grow and maintain diversity, it’s also working to keep existing staff happy and getting all employees—not just the underrepresented—on board with the company’s goals. “This is big, big culture change,” says Brown. “It’s really changing the way a company practices hiring, how they think about internal movement and development, how they think about retention. Those changes take time, and I think we’re all impatient for change to happen quickly.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Feature Intel’s Modems Creating New Versions For Device By Ramish Zafar Posted 2 months ago 16Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launched this year came with their fair share of controversy. Apple tried its best to make us forget that it hasn’t changed the design on its flagships for three years. While the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did feature build upgrades, they devices maintained the spaceship form of their predecessors. The only new feature which Apple introduced was the dual camera for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The removal of the 3.5mm earphone jack didn’t win Apple any new fans either. Almost all of these features had also surfaced on the rumor mill months before the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Another rumor also claimed that Intel’s modems would be making it on the devices this year. Intel’s Modems On The iPhone 7 And iPhone 7 Plus Restrict Compatibility Of Some Models To T-Mobile And AT&T Supplier issues are a problem that Apple’s faced on the iPhone for quite a while. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus suffered from GT Technologies’ bankruptcy. This forced Apple to stick with Corning’s Gorilla Glass on the devices. The inability of Apple to upgrade the iPhone’s display from IPS LCD to OLED or Micro-OLED is partly due to supplier problems as well. While we’ve started to see the collaboration between Foxconn and SHARP solidify, there’s still time until it bears actual fruit. To that end, the news that Apple would use Intel’s modems in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus wasn’t that much of a surprise either. For starters, the news had been surfacing for quite a while and secondly, Apple loves to diversify its supplier base without affecting performance whenever possible. To that end, we’re now starting to hear that Intel’s modems have made it on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus after all. What’s more, they’ve limited the pair’s carrier connectivity as well. Advertisement The decision to use Intel’s modems on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has restricted their carrier connectivity. Santa Clara’s modems don’t support the old CDMA Standard which is employed by Sprint and Verizon. Therefore, if you’ve ordered an iPhone from either of the carriers, it’ll feature Qualcomm’s modems. If you’ve ordered one from T-Mobile or AT&T, then you’ll get a device with Intel’s modem. Of course, Apple hasn’t fully diversified yet. T-Mobile and AT&T iPhones feature Qualcomm’s modems as well. With these restrictions, users might find themselves bound to one carrier over the life of their device. This will create problems for a lot of folks out there, even though carrier switches aren’t that common in the US. Nevertheless, if you haven’t pre-ordered an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus for yourself, do consider today’s information before making your decision and carrier choice. If you’ve ordered one, then we hope we were of help in making things clear for you. Thoughts? Let us now what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned for the latest.

Both chipmakers posted disappointing gains compared to their industry peers, but could one bounce back before the other? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Sep 10, 2016 at 2:38PM Many chipmakers have rallied over the past year, thanks to improving sales of chips for mobile devices, Internet of Things devices, connected cars, and other gadgets. That optimism boosted the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by 20% since the beginning of 2016, which easily outperformed the Nasdaq's 6% gain. However, two major chipmakers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), underperformed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by a wide margin. Intel shares rose just 6% during that period, while NXP gained a mere 3%. Image source: Getty Images. Did those two stocks underperform the sector for valid reasons, or are they poised to catch up? Let's compare the two chipmakers' core businesses, growth, and valuations to decide. What do Intel and NXP sell? Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers. Its core client computing business, which includes its PC chips, generated 54% of its revenue last quarter. The data center group accounted for 30% of its revenue. The remaining 16% of Intel's revenue came from its programmable solutions group (programmable chips acquired from Altera), non-volatile memory solutions group, Internet of Things group, and Intel security group (formerly known as McAfee). Intel recently agreed to sell a majority stake in Intel security to private equity firm TPG. NXP sells a wide variety of chips for connected cars, security devices, and mobile chips. Through its acquisition of Freescale last year, NXP became the world's largest manufacturer of automotive chips. It also supplies the NFC (near-field communication) chips used for "tap and pay" payments and file transfers used by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other mobile device makers.

Last quarter, 36% of NXP's sales came from automotive chips, 22% came from SCD (secure connected devices) chips, 19% came from its SI&I (secure interface and infrastructure) business, and 8% came from SIS (secure identification solutions) chips. These chips are all classified under its HPMS (high-performance mixed signal) division. Thirteen percent of NXP's revenue came from its standard products division, which sells discrete, logic, and PowerMOS chips to a wide variety of industries. NXP is currently divesting this slower-growth unit to Chinese investment firm Jianguang and private equity firm Wise Road Capital for about $2.75 billion. How fast are Intel and NXP growing? Intel's revenue rose just 3% annually last quarter, with a 3% year-over-year decline in client computing revenue and 5% growth in data center revenue. Its client computing sales fell due to the ongoing slowdown in PC sales and Intel's failure to gain a foothold in the mobile market dominated by ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH)-based chips. Its data center growth was also disappointing, because the chipmaker previously claimed that the segment could achieve 15% annual sales growth between 2015 and 2019. Looking ahead, analysts expect Intel's revenue to rise 4% this year. NXP's revenue rose 57% annually last quarter, but that figure was greatly inflated by the Freescale acquisition, which closed last December. On a combined and adjusted basis, which normalizes those figures, NXP's sales actually fell 8%. Automotive revenues rose 5%, but that growth couldn't offset double-digit declines across all three of its secure solutions businesses. A large part of that decline was caused by lower orders of NFC chips for mobile devices, which are included in its SCD segment. Analysts expect NXP's revenue to rise 55% this year, due to the purchase of Freescale, but only grow 5% next year. NXP also faces significant Brexit-related eurozone headwinds, since the chipmaker is based in the Netherlands. The aforementioned divestment of its standard products unit could also weigh down year-over-year comparisons. Profitability and valuations Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% annually to $1.3 billion, but that still gave it a decent net profit margin of 9.6%. On the same basis, NXP reported a net loss of $13 million last quarter, compared to a profit of $300 million a year earlier. That's because Intel's operating margins have been consistently higher than NXP's. Data source: YCharts. Analysts expect Intel to post 7% non-GAAP earnings growth this year and an average of 10% earnings growth over the next five years. This gives it a five-year PEG ratio of 1.5, which is higher than the "undervalued" threshold of 1. NXP's non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise just 3% this year but improve 34% annually over the next five years as the market for connected cars grows. This gives NXP an "undervalued" five-year PEG ratio of 0.5. The verdict: NXP has more room to grow Intel is still a solid "mature tech" play with a decent forward dividend yield of 2.8%, but its upside potential is limited by the sluggish PC market, its low exposure to mobile devices, and its questionable ability to challenge ARM-based chipmakers in new markets like IoT. NXP doesn't pay a dividend, but it arguably has more room to grow in connected cars and NFC chips, and its lower PEG ratio also makes it a better long-term growth play. Therefore, I believe that NXP is clearly a better buy than Intel at current prices. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Both chipmakers posted disappointing gains compared to their industry peers, but could one bounce back before the other? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Sep 10, 2016 at 2:38PM Many chipmakers have rallied over the past year, thanks to improving sales of chips for mobile devices, Internet of Things devices, connected cars, and other gadgets. That optimism boosted the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by 20% since the beginning of 2016, which easily outperformed the Nasdaq's 6% gain. However, two major chipmakers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), underperformed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by a wide margin. Intel shares rose just 6% during that period, while NXP gained a mere 3%. Image source: Getty Images. Did those two stocks underperform the sector for valid reasons, or are they poised to catch up? Let's compare the two chipmakers' core businesses, growth, and valuations to decide. What do Intel and NXP sell? Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers. Its core client computing business, which includes its PC chips, generated 54% of its revenue last quarter. The data center group accounted for 30% of its revenue. The remaining 16% of Intel's revenue came from its programmable solutions group (programmable chips acquired from Altera), non-volatile memory solutions group, Internet of Things group, and Intel security group (formerly known as McAfee). Intel recently agreed to sell a majority stake in Intel security to private equity firm TPG. NXP sells a wide variety of chips for connected cars, security devices, and mobile chips.

News & Analysis IBM Bests Intel's HPCs Cheaper and faster IBM claims R. Colin Johnson 9/8/2016 00:01 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAKE WALES, Fla. — For decades IBM supercomputers were faster, but significantly more expensive that similarly performing Intel-based supercomputers. As a result of its collaborative with Nvidia, however, IBM now claims to have supercomputers-in-a-slot that are faster and cheaper than equivalent performing Intel-based supercomputers. "Designed from ground up for the cognitive era and datacenter Big Data, our on-chip V-Link to Nvidia Tesla P100 Pascal GPUs delivers 5X faster interconnect data transfer than PCIe — a bi-direction 160 Gbytes per second from CPU to GPU compared to 32 Gbytes for PCIe," Dylan Boday, senior offering manager of Linux infrastructures told EE Times. IBM's supercomputer-in-a-slot claims to have finally bested Intel in price as well as in performance. (Source: IBM) The high-end of its new supercomputer-in-a-slot line is the IBM Power S822LC for higher-performance computing (HPC) applications requiring up to a terabyte of instant-access memory. Plus its POWERaccel Coherent Acceleration Processor Interface (CAPI) enables high-speed interconnects with FPGA accelerators by members of the OpenPower community (nixing another advantage Intel used to have when it purchased Altera). "We have opened up the POWER architecture to all, with an expanding ecosystem surrounding our new servers for faster time-to-market and industry-first innovations available only on POWER," Boday told EE Times. "Our NVLink is embedded at the silicon level and incorporated into the overall system design. This tight coupling of IBM and NVIDIA technology enables data to flow 5X faster than on an x86-based system." IBM is offering three initial models of its supercomputer-in-a-slot with pricing starting as low as $6000. (Source: IBM) Besides the S822LV, IBM is offering two other versions of the new servers: the Power S821LC (a single-slot version of the 822 at a 30 percent lower cost); and the Power S822LC (at 33 percent lower cost than an Intel-based Hewlett-Packard DL380 for an 80 percent better price/performance ratio for Big Data application loads). All three new servers leverage GPU acceleration which can be expanded using Nvidia Telsa K80 GPU accelerators on PCIe cards. "Overall IBM now offers 2.5X better performance than any Hewlett Packard x86 systems, plus we offer a water cooled option for improved efficiency and the ability to run indefinitely at peak turbo-boost speeds," Boday said. "We can also accommodate 42 percent more virtual machines (VMs) per server than Hewlett Packard's x86 systems or can accommodate the same number of users while reducing the number of required servers by two-thirds." All comparisons were made to Intel E5v4 based Hewlett Packard servers, and when asked IBM had no comparison data available for Intel Xeon Phi based supercomputers. However, the U.S. Department of Energys (DoEs) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and several large corporations have already signed on for initial installations in 2017. Pricing starts at $6000. For all the details on IBM's price/performance comparisons see IBM Power Systems — R.

Integrate Intel Corporation's Modem Tech in Future A-Series Processor? Not anytime soon, if ever. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 7:05PM A wafer of Intel chips. Image source: Intel.  After Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent iPhone launch event, it became clear that the iDevice maker had opted to use cellular modem chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for a solid portion of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Interestingly, in the wake of the launch event, analyst Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company speculated (via Barron's) that, at some point in the future, Apple and Intel could deepen their collaboration. In particular, the analyst thinks Intel could license its modem technology to Apple for integration into a future A-series processor. That integrated processor, then, would be manufactured by Intel. Is such a scenario likely any time soon? I would actually argue, "No." Here's why. The amount of risk Apple would take in this scenario would be much greater The risk that Apple took on by using an Intel modem for the iPhone 7 is fairly minimal. Had Intel failed to deliver with the modem, Apple had a perfectly acceptable backup solution: simply launch the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)-powered iPhone 7 into all regions. The modems in this case are discrete components and Apple has multiple potential sources, so the risk of a show-stopping issue related to Intel (a new entrant into the iPhone supply chain) was pretty much nil. However, if Apple and Intel were to collaborate in the fashion that Arcuri suggests, the amount of risk the iDevice maker takes on becomes substantially greater. First of all, in such a scenario, Apple wouldn't have two modem suppliers, it would have one. To be blunt, Intel's track record with respect to modems is getting better, but Qualcomm is still the "proven" supplier. This means that if Intel hit a roadblock with its modem technology, it would derail Apple's launch schedule. Additionally, even if Intel executes as needed on the modem side of things, there would still be the risk associated with integrating that modem technology onto the same piece of silicon as Apple's A-series processor. If something went wrong with that integration process it would, once again, force a delay in Apple's product launch schedule. The risk doesn't end here, either. Apple has been using proven contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture its chips. Intel is a world-class manufacturer of chips, but to date it has only manufactured chips designed by Intel's in-house teams (and Intel still relies on third party contract chip manufacturers for some product lines, including the very modems that it's currently selling to Apple). It has not proven itself as a capable and reliable contract chip manufacturer. So in this case, Apple moves away from a proven partner that has been able to ramp new technologies on schedule to a completely unproven contract chip manufacturer. This sounds risky to me. This may be possible at some point far in the future, but not anytime soon What Arcuri suggests might be possible at some point in the distant future. Once Intel has built a long and successful track record of delivering world class modems on schedule, and once Intel has proven itself as a contract chip manufacturer, then maybe such an arrangement would be possible. However, such a deal -- were it ever to happen -- would very likely be many years away. Given the fast paced nature of technology, predictions going that far out aren't particularly useful.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Some iPhone 7 Models Are Apparently Packing Intel’s Modems By Tyler Lee on 09/09/2016 18:48 PST For the longest time ever, Apple has relied on Qualcomm for its LTE modems. However rumors from earlier this year suggested that both Intel and Qualcomm could be supplying the modems, which shouldn’t really be surprising as Apple has typically favored diversifying their suppliers so as not to have too much reliance on one of them. However are the rumors true? According to a report from Recode, it looks as though rumors of some iPhone 7 models packing Intel’s modems could be true after all. How did they arrive at this conclusion? Apparently in the fine print of the iPhone 7, it notes that customers who purchase the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus for AT&T and/or T-Mobile will be getting a phone that won’t fully work with Verizon or Sprint. AT&T and T-Mobile are GSM-based carriers, while Verizon and Sprint rely on CDMA technology. Intel’s latest modems, as it stands, does not support the old CDMA standard that Sprint and Verizon are still using, hence the fine print. Unsurprisingly neither Apple nor Intel have offered to comment on it, meaning that we’ll most likely have to wait for a teardown of the iPhone 7 in order to see for ourselves. While diversification is good, Apple did find themselves in a spot of controversy last year when it was discovered that the iPhone 6s/6s Plus had chipsets made by either TSMC or Samsung, with TSMC’s version apparently offering better battery life (at least on paper). Hopefully Apple will be able to avoid this with the iPhone 7/7 Plus. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Intel, iPhone, iphone 7 and Qualcomm.

It seems likely, but Intel will need to close the technological gap with Qualcomm longer term to continue to be inside of Apple's iPhone. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 9:05PM Image source: Apple.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has finally made it into the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. The chipmaker is supplying a portion of the modems inside of the iDevice maker's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones. This isn't the sort of win that's going to move the financial needle for the chipmaker, but it does serve as a very real validation of the chipmaker's efforts to build capable cellular modems. With Intel in the mix this year, one has to wonder whether Intel will be able to continue to win future iPhone designs. In this column, I try to answer that question. Beyond XMM 7360 The Intel modem that Apple is likely using inside of the iPhone 7 is the XMM 7360. The modem supports up to 450 megabits-per-second download speeds and 100 megabits-per-second upload speeds. Intel's next modem, a device known as the XMM 7480, still tops out at 450 megabits-per-second download speeds, but it sees an upgrade on the uplink to handle up to 150 megabits-per-second upload speeds. If Apple chooses to keep Intel as a modem supplier for the next-generation iPhone, it would almost certainly use the XMM 7480. Why using XMM 7480 could make sense It's likely that Apple is using Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X12 modem for the non-Intel versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. That modem, interestingly enough, actually supports 600 megabits-per-second download speeds and 150 megabits-per-second upload speeds. However, Apple only advertised the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as being capable of 450 megabits per second download speeds. I suspect that Apple is sandbagging the capabilities of the Qualcomm modems in the versions of the iPhone that have Qualcomm modems in order to support its dual-sourcing strategy. What I expect, then, is for Apple to continue using the Snapdragon X12 modem inside of the non-Intel versions of its post-iPhone 7 smartphones, but this time, enable them to reach their full upload-speed potential, because the XMM 7480 will finally be able to match it. Intel has a foothold, but it needs to improve its products Frankly, it's quite interesting that Apple was willing to sacrifice the peak download speeds that it was able to advertise for the sake of bringing Intel on as a modem supplier. In the near term, I would expect it to be a mild inconvenience for Apple, as competing smartphone vendors will be able to advertise faster download and upload speeds relative to the new iPhones. Longer term, it looks to me that Apple is making a long-term bet on Intel in a bid to diversify its modem suppliers. By making the required sacrifices to bring Intel onboard for the iPhone 7, Apple makes it worth Intel's while to continue to invest aggressively in future modem technology. With that in mind, Intel is going to need to step it up in terms of features and performance. I don't think Apple will want to artificially restrict the cellular capabilities of its phones in order to accommodate Intel in perpetuity. If Intel doesn't achieve feature/technology parity with Qualcomm over the next, say, three to four product generations, it wouldn't be farfetched to think that Intel would no longer be inside of the iPhone.

But what's missing grabbed most of the attention: the headphone jack. On The Late Show, host Stephen Colbert delivered a parody of Wednesday's release, dressed in the style of Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an untucked dark-blue shirt. He took away not just the headphone jack but also the home button, the glass front -- and the back. "We thought, if less is more how much more could we less?" he said. Apple's all-too-serious move to remove the connection to its iconic white earbuds and urge people to use cordless AirPods -- sold separately for $159 -- points to the company's vision of a "wireless future," which could someday extend to home appliances, cars and more. There was other news: Nintendo's Super Mario is coming to the App Store, and you can be part of the Pokémon Go scavenger hunt on a revamped Apple Watch. It was a consumer tech show for sure, with no mention of business. But CIOs should take notice. Even though its iPhone sales have flagged recently, Apple still sells big to consumers -- and those who buy also go to work. "CIOs would be best served by paying attention to what kind of technology their employees like and prefer to use," said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. "But most important, focusing on how mobile can help them, because the business impact is undeniable." Apple-to-apples comparison Irwin Lazar, an analyst at Nemertes Research, said CIOs should think about the new iPhone 7 features and other Apple announcements in digital-transformation terms: "What can we deliver to mobile devices both internally and externally?" he said. The Apple Watch, for example, which comes with a faster, dual-core processor, might be able to run business applications that couldn't be run before. And apps may require tweaking to offer what the new phone has. "If I'm delivering an application that allows people to take pictures of something," Lazar said of a CIO, he or she should "make sure that I can support the enhancement that the camera provides." Overall though, the tweaks Apple introduced were incremental, Lazar said, and won't have as big a business impact as the release of the new mobile operating system, iOS 10. The new version, which will be released Sept. 13, will work with third-party applications like corporate phone systems from Cisco or Microsoft, making it easier for workers to make business calls from their personal devices. Hefty, hefty iPhone 7 But some of the tweaks Apple was proudest of, like the iPhone 7's new "ruggedized" exterior, could prove beneficial in a number of contexts, Voce said, including retail and air travel -- and it will compete well with efforts rivals like Samsung have been doing to make their devices tougher and more resilient to drops and bad weather. "There are scenarios where organizations might use devices in less-than-ideal conditions," he said. "You get on a flight nowadays -- every flight attendant is going to have a mobile device, and it usually has been ruggedized to a certain extent." Apple also debuted real-time collaboration capabilities in its iWork productivity suite -- which includes word processing, presentation and spreadsheet applications. The new feature will allow people working on the same project to contribute images, text or graphics. That may seem like Apple wants a piece of the market segment dominated now by Microsoft, with its Office suite, and to a lesser extent Google, with its cloud-based Apps for Work. But its impact will be primarily in education, not business, Voce said. Making inroads in business would be "extraordinarily difficult." Lazar's forecast: "Most people won't be using iWork in a business context." 'Increased competition' The Apple rollouts may have another, less-direct effect on business, Voce said: It may very likely trigger industry-wide change. The company has "spurred an intensity" in the tech market, Voce said, pushing Microsoft to make its Surface tablet offering easier to use, for example, and Dell to improve its XPS computer line. "What you've seen is that kind of focus on experience has driven the whole industry to raise their game," Voce said. "And as consumers and employees, we benefit. Apple led that charge and the benefit is increased competition." CIO news roundup for week of Sept. 5 The iPhone 7 and other Apple upgrades prevailed in the news this week. Here's what else made headlines: HPE is slimming down. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will spin off and merge its non-core software assets with UK-based technology firm Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion, HPE said Wednesday. "With today's announcement, we are taking another important step in achieving the vision of creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company well-positioned for our customers and for the future," Meg Whitman, president and CEO, said in a press release. HPE's non-core software assets -- Application Delivery Management, Big Data, Enterprise Security, Information Management & Governance and IT Operations Management -- will combine with Micro Focus' portfolio to help drive software innovation and create a "pure-play" software company, according to the release. HPE shareholders will have a 50.1% ownership of the merged company, and Micro Focus will pay $2.5 billion in cash to HPE. This follows the announcement in May that HPE would merge its IT services business with Computer Sciences Corp. Google plans to acquire Apigee. The search giant said it is set to acquire San Jose, Calif., API management provider Apigee for $625 million. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are used by developers to interface and integrate with outside applications and services, and "the addition of Apigee's API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers' move to supporting their businesses with high-quality digital interactions," said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google Cloud services, in a blog post. The deal is expected to close by end of this year. Apigee was founded in 2004 as Sonoa Systems, and the company went public in 2015. Its customers include Walgreens, AT&T, Burberry and Live Nation. In other Google news, the company announced its partnership with Box on Wednesday. Intel boosts computer vision strategy. In an effort to bolster its RealSense platform, chip maker Intel is acquiring computer vision startup Movidius, Intel announced Monday. Movidius designs system-on-a-chip (SoC) products, and its low-power and high-performance SoC platforms will help accelerate Intel's computer vision applications, said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager at Intel's New Technology Group, in a blog post. "This acquisition brings algorithms tuned for deep learning, depth processing, navigation and mapping, and natural interactions ... and machine intelligence," Walden wrote. Intel will deploy Movidius' vision chip technology in devices like drones and robots, and use it to improve augmented, virtual and merged reality technologies. Mobile device infections on the rise. Smartphones accounted for 78% of infections detected in mobile networks during the first half of 2016, according to a new report by the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia. The report's data was aggregated across the networks where the Nokia NetGuard Endpoint Security solution is deployed. The report found that the smartphone infection rate rose 96% between January and July this year when compared with the second half of 2015. The mobile infections hit an all-time high in April, with malware affecting one out of every 120 smartphones, the report states. Android devices where the most targeted, accounting for 74% of all mobile malware infections. The Nokia Threat Intelligence Report - H1 2016 identified Uapush.A, Kasandra.B and SMSTracker as the top three mobile malware threats, accounting for 47% of all infections.

Add My Comment Cancel   [-] abuell - 10 Sep 2016 7:06 PM I found it interesting that there's some controversy around Apple removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Accusing them of benefiting through the move which could spur more sales of Beats. If you don't like it, there's a easy solution to that: don't spend $650+ on an iPhone. That's just foolishness.  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] ncberns - 12 Sep 2016 8:18 AM News of the non-jack has been unavoidable. Of course if buyers are willing to drop almost a $1000 for a new phone they really don't need, an extra $150 for a new headset (they also don't need) won't mean much. What say we all stand by while Apple dukes it out with all the pro-jack folks until there's a clear winner of this tempest in a teapot "advance".  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] AlbertGareev - 12 Sep 2016 4:40 PM I actually find the news in the absence of truly innovative advances from Apple - for quite a while. Another disappointment is due to a gradual degradation of iOS based software quality. Crashing apps slowly become a norm.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive A $130 billion Wall Street investor is trying to muscle in on Silicon Valley Sunday Sep 11, 2016 at 12:03 PM Rachel Butt Nigel Treblin/Reuters KKR, the private equity dealmaker that inspired Barbarians at the Gate, has a new love. The company's executives are wooing early stage startups in the US, Europe and Israel, targeting those in the corporate enterprise, fintech and artificial intelligence industries. "We're trying to invest in situations where the companies have an established product, market and technology," Philipp Freise, head of technology, media and telecoms in Europe at KKR, told Business Insider. "They have revenue and a clear path to scalability, but still are at the stage where valuations are reasonable." KKR, with buyout roots dating back to 1976, has evolved into a $131 billion firm that has a hedge fund unit, invests in infrastructure projects, and lends to distressed companies. It is now raising a "growth equity" fund dedicated to private tech investments. Private equity's infatuation with tech has spurred a flurry of deals this year. Apollo Global, for example, recently agreed a deal to take cloud computing firm Rackspace private in a $4.3 billion deal. Thomas Bravo said it will buy data analytics firm Qlik Technologies for $3 billion. And private-equity company TPG and Intel are jointly spinning out Intel Security in a deal that values the business at $4.2 billion. "It's really an indication of the maturing tech PE ecosystem," Todson Page, PwC’s US technology deals leader, told Business Insider. "These funds are getting more comfortable with what the risks are, have a better appreciation of industry trends, and get a better sense of where the disruptions are as they have companies in their portfolios." 'More than capital' Before forming the fund, KKR invested in tech deals from its balance sheet, Scott Nuttall, global head of capital and asset management at KKR, said on the company's first quarter earnings call. "Several warehoused balance sheet investments will be transferred into the fund, again illustrating the power of our balance sheet to accelerate fundraising," Nuttall said.  Over the past year, the firm has invested in everything ranging from train tickets platform Trainline to cyber security firm Darktrace. A spokeswoman at KKR has declined to comment on the fundraising progress. With more than 100 portfolio companies that have over $5 billion in annual IT spending, KKR can effectively be a matchmaker, introducing companies that have a need with other portfolio companies that can meet it. For example, Frankfurt-based firm Arago, which developed an algorithm that aims to free up time for engineers, gained early traction in Europe. It broke into the US market after KKR introduced it to portfolio company First Data. When other portfolio companies were struggling with security issues, KKR introduced them to identity management provider Ping Identity. KKR invested in Ping in 2014, with the firm's annual recurring revenue growing sharply thereafter. Vista Equity Partners acquired Ping earlier this year.  In short, KKR can offer more than capital, according to Freise, who cited the company's global network of offices, portfolio companies, and hands-on support to help scale the startups. Moonshot...or not KKR's growth equity team keeps a close eye on startups and on the venture capital scene.  "We can do anything under $100 million, but $40 million to $60 million per investment is the sweet spot," Freise said. "We don't take risk for the product– it has to demonstrate it can be scaled and bring revenue." Aside from working directly with enterpreneurs, KKR also partners with venture capital firms like Highland Capital Partners. Often times, these VCs need good follow-on investors to take the startup to the next level, Friese added. When asked whether KKR is making a good move, Chris Kotowski, managing director and banks analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said the jury is out.  "In VCs, you tend to have much smaller equity checks, and the thing is in PE, you're not looking for the 10 to 1 shot. You hope to get twice your money in 5 years for most of your investments, and you can't afford a lot of complete failures," Kotowski said. "It's probably a fairly small business [for KKR], but it's kind of a natural extension. We'll see what good will come out of it."

Samsung Electronics saw its share in the global SSD market reach 37.3 percent in the first quarter of the year, compared with 32.8 percent from the same period last year, according to the data compiled by industry tracker IHS. Samsung Electronics is trailed by Intel Corp. with 12.2 percent and SanDisk Corp. with 11 percent. U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology came in a distant fourth with 3.9 percent, and Japan's Toshiba Corp. has a 3.8 percent share in the global SSD market. An SSD is a data storage device made with a NAND flash memory chip that saves data without requiring power, and is more durable and faster than a hard disk drive (HDD). Global market research firm TrendForce said that the ratio of SSDs installed in laptop computers could exceed 50 percent in 2018, compared with more than 30 percent this year. SSD prices have fallen gradually while hard drive prices remain at relatively high levels. The market price of 128GB SSDs will soon be cheaper than 500GB HDDs, and the price between 256GB SSDs and 1TB HDDs is less than US$5. entropy@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. Advertisement It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-hailing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. Mayor Bill Peduto has worked with Uber to allow access to test its vehicles on Pittsburgh streets. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” he said. Advertisement The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Advertisement Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and that the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal. “There is no technology that is fail-proof, and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” he said. When Uber wanted to expand its research on autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. In Pittsburgh, Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. “Travis’ vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Barack Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Peduto urged Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Kalanick. Uber’s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city’s first driverless-car passenger. After the 2-mile ride home, Peduto posted on Twitter that he ended that day as the world’s first mayor chauffeured by an autonomous Uber car. “I feel fortunate that I have the ear of a CEO of one of the biggest privately held companies,” he said.

Here are three familiar American names that fit the bill. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:25PM SUVs are booming in China, and the Baojun 560 is a hot seller. Its secret: It benefits from General Motors' deep SUV expertise, because Baojun is a GM brand. Image source: General Motors. Many American investors are intrigued by the investment possibilities offered by China's ongoing economic rise. But they're also daunted: There is a bewildering array of up-and-coming Chinese companies to consider, and getting news on many of them (or at least, news in English) can be a big challenge.  But you don't have to go to China to find companies that are thriving in the booming Chinese market. We asked our Fool contributors to identify three U.S. companies that each have a big presence in China and that are well-positioned to bring home big profits as the Chinese market grows. Here's what they came up with.  Sprinting for growth in the Middle Kingdom Steve Symington: It's hard to find any company with a more attractive runway to bolster its presence in China than Under Armour (NYSE:UA). Last quarter alone, Under Armour's international revenue grew 68% year over year, to just over $150 million. But international sales still represented only around 15% of Under Armour's total. And during Under Armour's subsequent conference call, company founder and CEO Kevin Plank specifically singled out the greater China geography as crucial to implementing Under Armour's global growth strategy, especially amid what he described as "increasing support for sport by the government." Plank also called this quarter an "inflection point for the brand in China" as it begins to ramp its expansion plans in earnest. So far this year, e-commerce revenue from China has already climbed 157%. And when all is said and done in 2016, Under Armour will have opened more than 150 international partner stores this year, with the majority located in China. "We're not as famous as we will be [in China]," Plank stated, "but we're definitely proud, I think, of the inroads that we've made, and the big opportunity in putting stores behind it, putting distribution." But arguably most important to Under Armour's success in China is the fact that its consumers largely view UA as a superior performance footwear brand, with many even regularly referring to it as "the professional brand," according to Plank. To be sure, Under Armour's men's and women's running businesses have each more than doubled from last year. And with the help of two-time NBA MVP (and loyal Under Armour-sponsored athlete) Stephen Curry, the high-end Curry 2 Under Armour basketball shoe has proven the top-selling item in China year to date in 2016. It should come as no surprise, then, that just last week Under Armour took Curry on his second tour of Asia to promote the brand over five days in Shenyang, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taipei.  So with international revenue still representing such a small slice of Under Armour's total, and with the Middle Kingdom playing a central role in its overseas growth initiatives, I think Under Armour is a perfect stock to profit from the rise of China. No stranger to China Tim Green: International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has been operating in China for decades, with the first IBM machines installed in the country way back in 1934. IBM China was established in 1936, headquartered in Shanghai, and by 1939 the company counted as customers the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and various other major organizations. The revolution of 1949 complicated matters, but by 1979 the first IBM computer system was installed in the country. As China's economy continues to grow rapidly, IBM is positioned to benefit. One area in particular where IBM could expand its business in China is the market for server CPUs. In an effort to effectively compete against Intel, IBM launched the OpenPOWER foundation in 2013 along with companies like Alphabet's Google and NVIDIA. The goal was to create an ecosystem around IBM's Power processors, creating a viable alternative to Intel in the data center. Part of IBM's plan is to allow third-party companies to build and sell Power servers, as well as custom Power chips. Allowing Chinese companies to design and build custom Power chips could help IBM make inroads into the Chinese server market, given China's push to build up its homegrown tech industry. Advanced Micro Devices is following a similar strategy with its recently announced joint venture in the country. China is a tough market for American technology companies, but IBM's long history and realistic strategy should help the company profit from the country's continued rise. This Rust Belt icon is thriving in China John Rosevear: I think a lot of U.S. investors are dimly aware that Buick is a popular brand in China. But I think a lot of folks miss just how big General Motors' (NYSE:GM) presence in China has become, how well it's positioned to ride the country's growth over the long term -- and why, here in 2016, GM is looking like a very good investment.  China has a slew of domestic automakers, and most of the global giants have a presence there. But GM sells more cars and trucks in China than any manufacturer other than Volkswagen -- and in some years, GM sells more than VW. Both GM and VW have dominant positions in China. But GM is the better bet for investors for a bunch of reasons.  The Buick Excelle GT is one of China's best-selling cars. It's a close cousin of the U.S.-market Buick Verano. But GM's presence in China goes far beyond Buick. Image source: General Motors.  China has become a huge part of GM's global business: Last year, GM and its Chinese joint ventures sold 3.6 million vehicles in China, more than the 3.1 million GM sold here in the U.S. It's on track to sell even more in 2016: Through August, GM's sales in China are up 8% versus the same period last year. That growth isn't likely to stall. GM has the production capacity, the dealer network, the product mix, the local partners, and the on-the-ground expertise to continue to be a leader in the Chinese auto market well into the future.  China doesn't yet contribute as much to GM's bottom line as its wildly profitable North America operation. That's mostly due to product mix: The Chinese still buy more small cars and fewer loaded big SUVs than Americans, though they're buying more SUVs every year. And GM's upscale (and highly profitable) Cadillac brand is growing quickly in the Middle Kingdom. But China already contributes a lot: GM raked in $2.1 billion in equity income from its Chinese joint ventures last year, more than a fifth of its $9.8 billion in net income for 2015. That proportion will rise as Chinese buyers continue to move upscale.  There are a lot of good reasons aside from China to take a closer look at GM shares right now. Even with all of the radical technological changes expected to come to the auto industry over the next few years, GM's low valuation (just over four times trailing-12-month earnings) and fat dividend yield (4.7%) make it a very intriguing stock -- in part because GM is better-positioned to thrive in that technological upheaval than many realize.  Long story short: China is a major part of GM's compelling growth story, and it will be for years to come.

Beauty with a Purpose By William Watterson '15    Tag it: “None of my teachers believed I could get into college,” says Shruti Nagarajan ’14. “My friends laughed. I don’t want anyone to feel that way. I hope that I can be that one person that can tell a young person that they can do it.” Credit Nagarajan, who is originally from the U.S. territory of Guam, won the Miss Rhode Island contest in May with a platform of “Upward Mobility: College Access for Low-Income and Minority Students” and a talent for Bollywood fusion dance. She believes she is the first woman from Guam to participate in the Miss America Pageant.  Nagarajan’s road from Guam to Miss Rhode Island started with a mango tree, ran through Brown, and, she hopes, will lead to a Miss America crown. When Nagarajan was a high school freshman, her mango tree died. “I was very young and very upset that my tree had died. Guam problems.” She laughs. Nagarajan cut the tree open and found that it was hollow. The problem was a borer insect infestation. She devised a novel pest management system that would control the borer population. Her system not only worked but was a finalist at the Intel International Science Fair in 2007. For her college essay, Nagarajan wrote about her mango tree. Brown was one among many colleges she applied to. “From Guam, all U.S. schools sound the same,” says Nagarajan, “and I couldn’t afford to visit.” The Brown admission officers were so taken by her ingenuity in fixing her tree that they wrote her a personalized acceptance letter. This impressed Nagarajan, and in 2010 she arrived on College Hill. Yet it had been only by chance that she’d written about the mango tree. She had no college adviser and neither did her peers, most of whom would never leave Guam, much less attend an American university. When Nagarajan started at Brown she was shocked by how far behind she was. She studied public policy and education because she “wanted to know why [she] was different” and why geography and socioeconomic status affect access to college. After graduation Nagarajan took a job with the investment advising firm Cambridge Associates. She loves it, but started to feel it was taking over her life. Unhappy with herself, having gained weight and lost her self-confidence, Nagarajan decided she needed another positive outlet. She ended up jumping into pageantry after discovering that two Brown women—master's student Alexandra Curtis and Ivy DePew  ’14 MPA—had won the past two Miss Rhode Island pageants. With zero pageant experience, Nagarajan took the leap. Nagarajan wants to use her platform as Miss Rhode Island to boost college acceptance of low-income students. She plans to work with College Visions, a Rhode Island–based nonprofit founded by Simon Moore ’00, which provides advice and resources to low-income and first-generation college-bound students to help them enroll, persist, and graduate. By both publicizing the program and working directly with students as a mentor, Nagarajan aims to make a real difference. Comments (1) 09/23/16   I'm disappointed to see Deborah Saint-Vil '10, who was Miss Rhode Island 2010, not mentioned alongside the other previous winners in this article. Brown women have been killing it for years at Miss RI.   This email address is being protected from spam bots, you need Javascript enabled to view it Name and Class Year: Email: Comment: Code:*   The Brown Alumni Magazine is published bimonthly, in print since 1900. ©1995-2016 Brown Alumni Magazine.

Restaurants Home Nation / World How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2784900 false Jeff Swensen / The New York Times An Uber car drives through Pittsburgh last week to map out the roads and topography before the introduction of the company’s driverless vehicles. Click here to enlarge image Cutting edge How Pittsburgh became Uber’s testing ground By Cecilia Kang / New York Times News Service Published Sep 11, 2016 at 12:02AM PITTSBURGH — Any day now, Uber will introduce a fleet of self-driving cars in Pittsburgh, making this former steel town the world’s first city to let passengers hail autonomous vehicles. So with the world watching, what has the city of 306,000 done to prepare for Uber’s unprecedented test? The answer is not much. There have been no public service announcements or demonstrations of the technology. Except for the mayor and one police official, no other top city leader has seen a self-driving Uber vehicle operate up close. Fire and emergency services don’t know where the Uber cars will travel. It is precisely this hands-off approach that has made Pittsburgh ideal grounds for one of Silicon Valley’s boldest experiments — and it has ignited criticism that the city is giving away its keys to Uber, which is testing a nascent technology and has a reputation for running roughshod over regulators and municipalities. “It’s not our role to throw up regulations or limit companies like Uber,” said Bill Peduto, Pittsburgh’s mayor, who said that Uber planned to use about 100 modified Volvo sport utility vehicles for the passenger trials. The vehicles will also have a human monitor behind the wheel. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet. If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” The mayor’s mantra highlights what it takes these days as cities seek to shed their Rust Belt pasts and transform themselves into technology hubs — essentially, give the tech companies lots of free rein. The approach, described as greenlight governing, is one that Pittsburgh and the state of Pennsylvania have nurtured over the last few years. When Uber wanted to expand its research around autonomous vehicles, Pittsburgh helped the company lease a large plot near the city’s riverfront for a testing track. When state regulators tried to ban ride-hailing services in 2014, Pittsburgh’s mayor and the state’s governor helped bat those hurdles down. Otherwise, Pittsburgh’s politicians stay out of the way. The approach has many benefits, allowing Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to position themselves at the forefront of a driverless-vehicle movement that has swept up tech companies including automakers, Google and Baidu of China. It has brought tech entrepreneurs to Pittsburgh and attracted hundreds of scientists and engineers to new research centers opened in the city in the last decade by Apple, Google, Intel and Uber. But it also has invited criticism from those who say Pittsburgh is giving too much power to tech companies, all for a sheen of innovation. Some residents are on edge about Uber’s self-driving vehicles and complain that they have been thrust into an experiment with potential safety risks. “I feel like we were pushed into being part of this by the city,” said Montana Michniak, a recent college graduate who works at a cafe in the city’s South Side neighborhood. How Pittsburgh handles the unveiling of Uber’s self-driving fleet is being closely watched by other tech and auto companies that are doing their own driverless experiments in places like California and Michigan (although Apple is said to have laid off dozens of employees in its self-driving car project and to be rethinking its strategy). Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and that the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal. “There is no technology that is fail-proof, and there is no tech that can guarantee there won’t be accidents, but right now there are 3,287 people who die in automobile-related accidents around the world each day, and there has to be a better way,” he said. In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. In Pittsburgh, Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. “Travis’ vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Barack Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Peduto urged Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schuster, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. 15014590 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

With the potential for interest rate increases, a sure to be intense final 60 days to the presidential election, and typical seasonal volatility, caution may be the best avenue for now. For growth investors with a longer term time horizon, one well to go to is large cap technology, especially the companies that also pay solid dividends. We screened the research universe at Merrill Lynch looking for large cap technology leaders that pay dividends. We found four rated Buy that make good sense now. HP This is the printer and personal computer businesses of the old Hewlett-Packard. HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) provides products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as to the government, health and education sectors worldwide. The company’s Personal Systems segment offers commercial personal computers (PCs), consumer PCs, workstations, thin client PCs, tablets, retail point-of-sale systems, calculators and other related accessories, software, support and services for the commercial and consumer markets. The Printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, media, scanning device and software and services, as well as LaserJet and enterprise, inkjet and printing, graphics, and software and web services. HP investors receive a 3.4% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $15, and the Wall Street consensus estimate is $15.54. The shares closed Tuesday at $14.63. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. But a new partnership with Microsoft for a virtual reality, as well as a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.85% dividend. The $42 Merrill Lynch price target compares with the consensus target of $37.58. The shares closed Tuesday at $36.57.

Depressed cities around the nation are watching to see if the Pittsburgh story can be a blueprint for their own transitions into tech hubs. “This is the first mayor in Pittsburgh to really get it, and that’s a big reason why the city has become the best case of Rust Belt revival,” said Richard Florida, a professor of urban studies at the University of Toronto, who previously taught at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said he was “frankly surprised at how long a leash” Uber got. Mr. Peduto said Uber did not have too much power in Pittsburgh and said the city would be safe because there would be a human monitor in the Uber test cars. The mayor also has his eye on a bigger safety goal.

Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times In a statement, Uber said of Pittsburgh, “Our work would not be possible without the support we’ve received from city leaders.” Uber came to Pittsburgh in early 2015, drawn by the engineering talent at Carnegie Mellon. The university started a robotics department 30 years ago, when driverless cars seemed like a fantasy, but robotics has since proved crucial for the systems that let vehicles navigate streets on their own. By this decade, the university’s expertise in computer science had attracted not only Uber but also General Motors, Google and Intel, some of which embedded at Carnegie Mellon. Google and Uber later opened research centers, hiring dozens of Carnegie Mellon professors and graduate students. Today, Uber has 500 employees at a center in Pittsburgh’s industrial Strip District working on autonomous vehicles, according to Mr. Peduto. Uber will have 1,000 employees at the site, known as the Advanced Technology Center, within a few years and plans to increase investments to $1 billion from hundreds of millions of dollars in a decade, he said. For driverless car tests, Pennsylvania also held a legal advantage. Specifically, the state’s transportation rules did not explicitly ban driverless cars, as long as someone was behind the wheel to take over if needed. Officials from Pennsylvania’s transportation agency said they interpreted that silence on driverless technology as a green light. Some state officials said they also believed that driverless cars could be safer than those steered by drivers, helping avoid driver-related deaths. “We’d be committing governmental malpractice if we didn’t pursue this technology,” said Roger Cohen, the policy director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times In Pittsburgh, Mr. Peduto fostered a close relationship with Uber. In Mr. Peduto’s first meeting in early 2015 with Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, Mr. Kalanick said he had noticed efforts by Mr. Peduto and other officials to fight the state public utilities commission’s proposed ban on ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft in 2014. Mr. Kalanick also laid out a plan for Uber’s driverless cars. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “Travis’s vision was to build out the autonomous vehicles industry in 10 years,” Mr. Peduto said. “We shared a vision to do it in a way that would be a benefit for society.” Weeks later, in a meeting with President Obama at a conference for the National League of Cities, Mr. Peduto urged Mr. Obama to support autonomous vehicles and declared Pittsburgh’s intention to be a testing ground. Since then, Pittsburgh has showed its friendliness to Uber’s efforts. Last year, it also worked with the city’s police department on plans to install a ride-hailing kiosk in the lively South Side district, for the use of people who had been drinking and would prefer not to drive home. Pittsburgh International Airport last year also designated waiting areas for Uber and Lyft passengers. Yet Uber has mostly gone ahead with its self-driving-car plans in Pittsburgh alone. Driverless cars with Uber’s logo have cruised around town for months, in part to get the public used to seeing them. With cameras and GPS units mounted on the roofs, the vehicles collect mapping data on plants and trees, the conditions of sidewalks, and traffic markings for nearly every street. “There’s really not been a whole lot of collaboration on the actual testing,” said Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh’s assistant chief of police, who rode in one of the Uber vehicles last June and signed a nondisclosure agreement to do so. Last month, Uber officially announced that the self-driving fleet would go into action in Pittsburgh. Mr. Peduto, who had been informed a few days earlier by Uber, sent a congratulatory text message to Mr. Kalanick. Uber’s chief was in Pittsburgh at the time and invited the mayor to be the city’s first driverless-car passenger. After the two-mile ride home, Mr. Peduto posted on Twitter that he ended that day as the world’s first mayor chauffeured by an autonomous Uber car. “I feel fortunate that I have the ear of a C.E.O. of one of the biggest privately held companies,” he said. Correction: September 14, 2016 An article on Sunday about Uber’s introduction of self-driving cars to Pittsburgh misstated the surname of the city’s assistant chief of police. He is Scott Schubert, not Schuster. Kitty Bennett contributed research. A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2016, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: No Driver? Bring It On. How Pittsburgh Became Uber’s Test City.

Technology 1 0 0 September 10, 2016 MacBook Pro Update: Has Apple’s High-End Notebook Been Delayed Until 2017? Daryl Deino People have been patiently awaiting a major upgrade for the MacBook Pro since 2013. Now, there are some people who are fearing that Apple’s latest notebook may not arrive until 2017. This is because it is rumored that Apple wants to use the latest Intel Kaby Lake processors, which won’t be widely available until the very end of 2016. However, Macworld UK, a site that originally thought the new MacBook Pro would be announced in September, says that the MacBook Pro could be announced in October. Is Apple’s new MacBook Pro really coming out in 2016? [Image via Daryl Deino] “Instead, we’re expecting the MacBook Pro to be announced in October, alongside an upcoming iPad. We had originally thought that the theory was backed up by the lack of a MacOS Sierra release date, but following the event we discovered that Apple has quietly announced that the new operating system is coming this month.” Bloomberg was the first site to announce the new MacBook Pro last month. “Apple Inc. is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales.” The article added that the updated notebooks would be thinner, include a touchscreen strip, and contain more powerful and efficient graphics processors. At the time, Bloomberg claimed the new notebooks had been in advanced testing since early this year and were expected to be released during the fourth quarter. An article from iTech Post asks if the new MacBook Pro really is coming out this year. “Apple made no announcement about the highly rumored MacBook Pro 2016 at the September 7 event and while this might be disappointing for some, it could actually be good news for others,” says columnist Victor Thompson, who adds that the delayed announcement could mean Apple is waiting to build their new top-line notebooks with Kaby Lake processors. There is a lot of excitement for the new MacBook Pro on Twitter. I'm normally excited for #AppleEvent and new iPhones but 7 does nothing for me. Would like to see a new MacBook Pro soon ! — Jordan McGurk (@jordan210) September 7, 2016 The only features I want to see are those of a 2016 Macbook Pro. #AppleEvent — ~twino~ (@TwinoEmma) September 7, 2016 The new MacBook Pro couldn’t come at a more important time for Apple, which has been seeing a sales decline of all its products. As the Telegraph recently pointed out, Apple’s profits have fallen for the second consecutive quarter. Many people believe that Tim Cook lacks the creative vision that Steve Jobs had. [Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] “On Tuesday night, the company reported a 27 percent decline in quarterly profits and a slide in revenue, as it struggled to boost sales of the iPhone almost 10 years after it was released,” the article claimed. The Telegraph piece added that Apple also predicts sales would fall in the next quarter and that this has presented the biggest challenge to CEO Tim Cook since Steve Jobs died five years ago. An opinion piece at Tech Times recently indicated that Tim Cook really “needs to go.” “As soon as he assumed his position at the helm of the company, Cook was met with skepticism. He had huge shoes to fill, as late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs was viewed as an iconic figure, a visionary and a true leader.” The article reminded readers that when Cook took over, most industry experts and analysts questioned whether he’d be up for the part and it ends up that he wasn’t. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus announcement this week has led to more people thinking that Cook really isn’t innovative. However, Apple doesn’t have the same problems Samsung is having — devices that are actually blowing up on people. It would be unwise to ever count Apple out, especially since the Cupertino company has made so many comebacks before.

Thanks to their tech-y designs, however, they don't generally come dressed properly for your chic arm party. Stylish options are becoming more available: Tory Burch's collaboration with Fitbit, for example, and the fashion-fave (and pricey) smart bangle MICA, made by Opening Ceremony and Intel. You can also now buy all kinds of charms and covers on Etsy to dress them up. Still, the most affordable, creative way to go is to make over your wearable on your own, since you'll be able to customize the design to reflect your unique personal style. Check out these five DIY blogger examples with easy-to-follow tutorials, below, for instant inspiration.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Sep 11, 2016 - Page 15　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Vietnam’s ‘Silicon Valley’ spurs start-up boom By Herve Asquin and Jenny Vaughan  /  AFP, HO CHI MINH CITY and HANOI French, left, and Vietnamese employees work in the office of French information technology company Linkbynet in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on Monday. Photo: AFP Recent Vietnamese graduate looking for an English language teacher? There is an app for that. Or hunting the best bowl of pho in your Hanoi neighbourhood? There is now an app for that, too. A decade ago such technology would likely have been developed in California’s Silicon Valley, but today those apps are being churned out by Vietnam’s start-up sector — an industry driven by local techies trained overseas, but returning home to prowl for opportunities. The sector’s growth in a young tech-hungry nation has caught the eye of foreign firms — French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday led a group of businesspeople to meet tech investors in Ho Chi Minh City, the communist country’s start-up hub. Much of the technology, which also includes popular mobile games and e-commerce software, is being produced for local consumers in Vietnam, where the median age is 30 and Internet connectivity is rapidly expanding. “The local market is large, young, fast growing, and not fully tapped,” said Eddie Thai of 500 Startups, a venture with a US$10 million pot — mostly of foreign cash — to splurge on tech enterprises for Vietnamese users or made by local developers. US-born Thai, 31, whose parents fled during the Vietnam War, belongs to a vanguard of entrepreneurs who have arrived to offer expertise in the country, where Intel and Samsung already have a foothold in the hardware industry. “I kept getting tugged by Vietnam. I saw that the opportunity to make an impact and make money doing it were bigger the sooner I came back,” he said. For Thai, the mathematics made the move a no-brainer: 90 million people, 45 million Internet users, 30 million smartphone users and Internet usage 10 times what it was a decade ago. He arrived in 2012 to work for a corporate firm, and eventually joined 500 Startups, which has funded ventures, including the language-learning app Elsa and online ticketing platform Ticketbox. Other apps developed in Vietnam include Lozi for food lovers and mobile bespoke tailor UKYS. However, much of the talent is also homegrown: Vietnamese teens rank ahead of peers in the US, Britain and Sweden in mathematics and science, according to the latest survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2012. That educated labor force, which comes cheap compared with China or Singapore, is helping to pique interest from tech heavyweights like Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, who took time away from his holiday in December to speak to tech entrepreneurs in Hanoi. Comprehensive official figures are not available. However, state media reported that turnover in the software and information-technology (IT) services industry was US$3 billion last year, up from US$2 billion in 2010, citing the Vietnam software and IT services association. The government has also outlined its own strategy for the sector and founded Vietnam Silicon Valley in 2013 to create an “ecosystem of innovations and technology commercialization.” However, some observers say investors should be wary of the hype, warning of red tape and murky local laws. “Vietnam has hidden tech potential, but it could take another five years maybe really to create these huge massive companies that have global influence,” said Anh-Minh Do of Singapore-based Vertex Venture Holdings. “The law needs to be better, the government needs to be more supportive, there needs to be more interaction from Vietnamese-Americans, specifically Vietnamese-Californians because of the ‘Valley’ connection.” 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2200 times.

You get the choice of the dual-core M3, M5, or M7. It breaks down like this - the Core M3 is a 1.1GHz chip that Turbo Boosts to 2.7GHz. The M5 is 1.2GHz with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz. Finally, the Core M7, which is a built to order option, is 1.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz. Each model rocks the Intel HD Graphics 515 chipset, which is 25% faster than last years graphics chip. What’s interesting is that these models seem to be in Turbo Boost mode at almost all times. In fact, the M7 model is just about 4% slower than the previous-generation MacBook Pro in terms of processor speed, and that’s quite the surprise. FASTER FLASH STORAGE, RAM, AND GRAPHICS The second big change to the 2016 lineup is the inclusion of faster flash storage. This is the chips used to store your data on the MacBook. The new chips can do sequential reads of up to 1 GBps, which is 20% faster than the previous model. While a 20% read speed gain in great, even more impressive is that write speeds are 90% faster on the 2016 MacBook when compared to its predecessor. That’s a big deal, and means that when you are using the MacBook to get things done, you won’t feel the squeeze. The 2016 MacBook is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. The faster flash storage is paired with faster RAM as well - you get 8GB or 1867MHz DDR3 RAM, which is an increase from last years 1600MHz RAM. On top of that, there’s also the new Intel HD Graphics 515 chip, which Apple says increases graphics performance by 25%/ My main complaint with the 2015 MacBook is that it always felt like it was one step behind me, always trying to catch up to what I was doing, whether it was launching apps, or even the simple act of typing. With the new model, that issue has all but disappeared. ROSE GOLD Apple introduced the Rose Gold hue on the Apple Watch Edition - that was real Rose Gold. Then it brought Rose Gold colored aluminum to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus smartphone line. Shortly after, it brought Rose Gold to the Apple Watch Sport. A couple of weeks ago, the 9.7-inch iPad brought Rose Gold to Apple’s tablet line, and now with the 2016 MacBook, Apple brings the hue to its computers. From the outside, the 2016 MacBook looks exactly the same as the 2015 version, with the Rose Gold color being the only external choice that sets it apart visually. In some light the color looks more pink, in others it looks damn near close to the standard gold. It can even take on a copper color. Of course, if Rose Gold isn’t your thing, you can also pick up the MacBook in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray as well. CONCLUSION So, should you buy it? Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook feels like a much more capable computer than its predecessor. There’s always the waiting game you can play, which in this case would be waiting to see what Apple has up its sleeve for WWDC before pulling the trigger, just in case there’s a thinner, more powerful MacBook Pro around the corner. However, with the faster internal specs, the MacBook is capable of accomplishing those everyday tasks that you’ll want to throw at it, and this year it does it without complaining back at you by way of a multi-colored beachball.

Other than the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 2, and a Super Mario game, there was nothing about the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro or the rumored iPad Pro 10.5-inch or the wireless charging special feature from the Cupertino-based tech giant. Latest reports now have it that the non-appearance of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro on September 7 only proves that Apple will be having another launching event next month to finally unveil the latest device in its laptop line and also the next iteration of its iPad Pro, reports the MacWorld of UK. However, these remain as speculations pending the confirmation from Apple, which seems unlikely to do it anytime soon. It would be the third time that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro did not show up in an Apple event this year starting in March during the company’s “Let Us Loop You In” event, and then again in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2016. The reports are also saying that the launch of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro in October shall either be a single event or even a quiet update, the same way that the company did with the latest MacBook in April this year. Rumors gaining steam Rumors are now gaining steam that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall come with a Retina Display and shall be running on Intel processors that are two or three years out of date, notes C/Net. The speculations are also rife in saying that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall have identical prices as its current models. But the rumors are also fairly consistent in saying that the excellent features of the latest laptop from Apple are the OLED touch bar, the Touch ID, and the Apple Pencil Trackpad. Accordingly, the 2016 MacBook Pro shall have a massive redesign from its previous model because it will be lighter and thinner than its predecessors. However, the laptop’s best feature would be its touch-ready secondary OLED display that shall be replacing the entire function key row atop the keyboard. Easier to interact with device’s features The secondary OLED display of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall offer contextual shortcuts to the user, making it even easier to interact with frequently used features that are going to be just one touch away. The OLED bar should offer system-wide shortcuts, but also app-specific shortcuts, on the assumption that developers shall extend support to the feature. Apple has yet to officially name the OLED display on the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro but insiders say that the company refers to it internally as the ‘Dynamic Function Row.’ The best feature of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro seemed to have been confirmed no less by reputable Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo of KGI Securities as early as May this year. What is also exciting users about the upcoming Apple laptop is its reported new features including a fingerprint scanner, a near-field communication (NFC) chip, and a wireless charging capability. These major features are already common in some of Apple’s devices including iPhones and iPads, but they have yet to touch base on its laptop lines. In fact, because of these reported features of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro when it officially comes out in the next few months that it is projected by analysts that laptop and notebook shipments are set to rebound beginning in the third quarter of this year. Of the three rumored major features of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro, the wireless charging capability seems to be the one that shall be a bit of a challenge because Apple has yet to launch an iPhone that has a wireless charging IC.

After 18 years living in San Jose, she moved to Folsom so she and her husband could buy a house. She knows of at least five other friends who've been "priced out" in the San Francisco Bay Area in just the last year and a half. (Photo: Courtesy of Erica Atreya) By Rachael Myrow September 9, 2016 Share Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Erica Atreya never fell out of love with San Jose. The Silicon Valley capital just became too damn expensive. Her husband, Krishna, really wanted to buy. But even with his engineer’s salary, the couple could only afford to rent a one bedroom town home. The Atreyas soon realized that if left the San Francisco Bay Area, they could actually buy a piece of the proverbial American dream. So they started house-hunting farther and farther afield, in places like Pleasanton, Dublin and Livermore. But their goal of homeownership continued to remain elusive. “We kept getting bought out by people who were offering cash,” Atreya says. Finally, the Atreyas found their way to Folsom, east of Sacramento. Erika Atreya loves the small city’s easy-going vibe and its proximity to nature. But she misses San Jose. A year and a half out, she continues to struggle with the emotional fallout of the change. “There was more than an adjustment,” says the self-taught visual artist, who lived in San Jose for 18 years before she and her husband decamped for Folsom. “There was depression, and loneliness.” For one thing, San Jose’s demographic mix makes for a richer, multi-cultural feel, which Atreya loves. For another, the art gallery scene in Folsom doesn’t really compare to her old home base. “Back home, I had so many people to reach out to in my art community,” Atreya says. Room to paint in Folsom That said, the Atreyas’ new three-bedroom house gives the couple space to breathe and grow. Now, instead of ever so carefully spreading out on the couch with her materials, as she used to in San Jose, Atreya has her own studio in the garage. She also has enough wall space in the house to accommodate 40 works of art, many by friends she had to leave behind. Atreya is constantly adding to the collection with new works, like this one: “Eve,” by Folsom artist Erica Atreya, was produced for a show with a collective called reCREATE, that upcycles items like this body form of a female torso. (Photo: Courtesy of Anthony Barbaria) “I did lot of detail and texturization with puff paint,” Atreya says of one of the pieces on display in her home, titled Eve. “So you can actually touch the piece.” Not Johnny Cash’s Folsom The Folsom the Atreyas moved to is not the one that comes to mind from the 1968 Johnny Cash song “Folsom Prison Blues.” These days, the city is like a comfortable, middle class Sacramento suburb. Intel is the biggest employer. Half the population hails from the San Francisco Bay Area or Southern California. The Atreyas moved numerous times within San Jose before they left. “We kept moving further away from the main tech companies, because it would get cheaper the further we moved,” but those rents rose, too. (Photo: Courtesy of Erica Atreya) “It’s cyclical,” explains Mary Ann McAlea, senior vice president of the Greater Folsom Partnership, a consortium of organizations that oversee tourism, trade and economic development in the region. McAlea says Folsom’s population expands every time real estate booms to the west. “It’s tied to the real estate values on the coast.” McAlea says Folsom has witnessed a spike in in-migration over the last five years, especially young families looking for more square footage in an area where they can also find well-paying jobs. Dramatic losses for San Jose In recent years, rising real estate prices have pressured – or forced – artists to leave San Francisco and Oakland for cheaper places elsewhere. The same thing is happening in Silicon Valley. The average rent for a San Jose apartment these days is $2,600 according to the real estate brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap. That’s not as bad as San Francisco, but San Jose rents are still steep, and nearly 50 percent higher than they were five years ago. Even for those who can afford to pay the rent, the pull to leave for cheaper living is hard to resist — especially if you’re an artist whose partner makes the bulk of the household income. These days, Erica Atreya still drives three hours from Folsom to San Jose every month to participate in Arte nella Piazza, an art bazaar in San Jose’s Little Italy. (Photo: Rachael Myrow/KQED) In the time since she left for Folsom, Atreya says she knows of five other artists who left their hearts in San Jose. This number includes a musician who like her also moved to Sacramento County, a painter who moved in El Dorado County, and three people who left for Oregon. “We know the market has changed drastically,” acknowledges Kerry Adams-Hapner, San Jose’s director of cultural affairs. Adams-Hapner says the city of San Jose is surveying its artists for the second time in eight years to get a current handle on their housing and work space issues. Real estate costs are dramatically higher now. But even five years ago, 47 percent of the 700 artists canvassed in the survey found San Jose area housing unaffordable; two-thirds reported spending more than 30 percent of their income on mortgage or rent. “People need a space to live, fundamentally,” Adams Hapner says. “Also, people need a space to present their work. They need a space to rehearse. And they need spaces also to connect with each other and network.” Many Silicon Valley artists, including Steve Borelli of Campbell, don’t even begin to pay the rent with their art. But that’s not a reason to give up the practice, or the community. (Photo: Rachael Myrow/KQED) In Folsom, Atreya is gradually building a new network of friends and professional contacts. But she still feels an emotional pull towards her old home. “All my art family’s there, mostly,” Atreya says. “So, my heart’s still here in San Jose.” Atreya still regularly drives three hours southwest to reconnect with her friends in San Jose. She’s still a member of the San Jose Art Salon, a group of creatives who meet regularly for collective inspiration. And every month, she returns to Arte nella Piazza, an art bazaar in San Jose’s Little Italy neighborhood. Those that stayed behind This exodus of artists is depressing for those left behind in the South Bay, too – even if they’re not about to get priced out. At the art fair, Steve Borelli has his own table set up near Atreya’s with his abstract drawings available for sale. “Every passing day, I feel I’m luckier,” Borelli says. Borelli bought a house years ago in Campbell, near San Jose. Borelli pays the mortgage with his salary as a graphic designer. But his true love is drawing – and his connection to the local artists’ community. “I fear for the future,” Borelli says. “You know, if it keeps going the way that it is, eventually you’re going to see a mass migration out, and I just hope it never comes to that.” Mia the cat gets interviewed at Erica Atreya’s Folsom home. (Photo: Courtesy of Erica Atreya) The exodus is a function of the economy, says Matthew Mahood, president and CEO of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce. The loss of school teachers and firefighters might seem to be a more pressing concern for San Jose than the flight of artists. But Mahood says quality of life is equally essential for the region to thrive going forward.  “In order to attract and keep a quality workforce, you have to have arts and entertainment,” Mahood says. “Those things where people want to call this home.”   Explore: Arts, News, Visual Arts, audio, feature Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Show Comments (1) Hide Comments Mary949 Newsflash, Erica.

Slow Growth in Productivity: What Do We Know About "Why?" and "What Is To Be Done?"—Long J. Bradford DeLong :: U.C. Berkeley, NBER, and WCEG :: 2016-09-09 :: http://tinyurl.com/dl20160909b | https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-productivity-puzzle-how-can-we-speed-up-the-growth-of-the-economy/ The productivity puzzle: How can we speed up the growth of the economy? What Are We Talking About Here? Perceived poor performance of the American economy. Measurement issues are fascinating and important, but largely orthogonal to perceived poor performance. Slow growth in overall productivity only one and not the most important aspect of perceived poor performance: Inequality. Declining mobility. Millennials. And they have, of course, been offset by the enormous decline in what can only be called caste privilege. Eight Things Are Going On Always: the problems of measuring economic growth in productivity levels and living standards Since the 1920s: the problems of the shift to information goods—non-excludable and personalized And four more things: The post-1973 productivity slowdown The post-1995 productivity speedup The post-2004 second slowdown The post-2008 catastrophe of what we will soon be calling “the Longer Depression” Plus: reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible, and may not be the best policy even if it is possible Plus: what is it reasonable that we should expect out of the growth process? Problem: Simply Assessing Economic Growth Are we, notionally: Measuring growth by taking today's median income, and setting it equal to that multiple of median income in the past that would provide equivalent value? Measuring growth by taking that fraction of today's median income that is equal to median income in the past, in the sense of providing equivalent value? Year-to-year changes simply do not sum or multiply Additional inescapable questions of moral philosophy to which “shut up and calculate!” is not a proper answer Narrow utilitarianism questions: Productivity and opportunity—I’ve never been a believer in any sort of sharp distinction between “wealth” as some form of “positive liberty” and “freedom” as some form of “negative liberty”. If you’re in a locked cage and lack the money to buy a key, your freedom to buy a key is illusory Productivity and distribution: Are we average people (believers in Negishi prices: that your proper weight in the social welfare function is your lifetime wealth, or perhaps your lifetime wealth squared) Are we median people Or do we aspire to be among the Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas? Broader political economy and moral philosophy questions: Productivity and society—how much growth is needed and how much churn can be tolerated in order to avoid the disappointment of those reasonable expectations that keeps the altruistic-punishment mechanisms that maintain our sociability from going haywire? Productivity and humanity—what is the proper telos of the Sociable Language- and Tool-Using East African Plains Ape? Problem: Valuing Information Commodities When you sell a rival, excludable commodity, there is producer revenue and consumer surplus: The first—producer revenue—is what is counted in GDP The second—consumer surplus—is not counted in GDP. When you provide a non-excludable information commodity produced with enormous amounts of non-rivalry: You give away the commodity Thus all of the final value is consumer surplus: none is producer revenue. You then sell, as an ancillary service, the eyeballs and eardrums of users to advertisers: This a much smaller money flow, a much smaller share of consumer value then producer revenue is in the case of a Smithian commodity Moreover, advertising expenditures are not captured anywhere in real GDP They are an intermediate service, not a final good. How large is this? Well, how much of their recreational time are people spending engaged with such information age commodities? How much of the utility they accrue during that time is due to that engagement? There is also the "personalization" part of the information economy: getting you the information you need to purchase exactly that monopolistically competitive variant of the commodity that pleases you the most Problem: Valuing Information-Driven Personalization Henry Ford thought people got value—utility—from basic transportation: “Any color you want, as long as it is black…” Alfred P. Sloan disagreed GM and Chevy drank Ford’s milkshake Is there real value from getting people the exact monopoly-competitive variant they want? Or is it just a grift—selling people Chevy parts at 100% markup because they are under a Cadillac shell? I favor “grift”: I am more than half on Team Let’s-All-Dress-in-Identical-Blue-Overalls Myself But I do have three-touch smartphone advance ordering at the nearest Starbucks of a whole-milk triple-shot short latte with two pumps of sugarfree hazelnut syrup and extra cinnamon… The Four Trend Breaks: Magnitudes A U.S. population come 2025 of 350M… Before 1973: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $44T @2009 prices: $125K per capita Before 1995: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $28T: $80K per capita Before 2004: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $32T: $91K per capita Before 2008: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $26T: $75K per capita Now: expect real GDP come 2025 of $22T: $63K per capita Four Productivity Trend Breaks since 1973 Have Halved the Expected 2025 Productivity of the USA From $44T @2009 prices—$125K per capita—to $22T: $63K per capita That as, as Joe Biden would say, a BFD How are we to understand these four breaks in the trend of productivity growth we have seen since 1973? The First: The Drop Post-1973 The first of these trend breaks comes around 1973 It is the drop from $125K to $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices With Martin Neil Baily in the room, whatever summary I attempt to provide will be rightfully dismissed as cocksure and inadequate. So * I will just say: it’s complicated… The Second: The Jump Post-1995 * The second of these trend breaks comes in 1995 * It is the jump from $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices * Oliner and Sichel (and Fernald) and company have, I think, nailed this one to the floor… * A Fed committed to keeping deficit reduction from inducing a recession * 4% of GDP of financial flows diverted from buying government debt looking for a home * It finds a home in Silicon Valley * Just as infotech reaches a critical mass * And Intel ramps up its development pace The Third: The Drop Post-2004 The third of these trend breaks comes in 2004 It is the drop from $91K to $75K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices John Fernald and company have been working full time on trying to understand it… I would be rash and foolish to try to challenge John Fernald and company… But it’s a very big shift to happen in a very short time with no obvious system-wide shock… The Fourth: The Drop Post-2008 The fourth of these trend breaks comes in 2008 It is the drop from $75K to $63K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices It is a consequence of the Longer Depression Labor force attachment Worker skills Investment Experimentation with business models The Last of These Is Robert Barro’s “Non-Covery” We should have had substantial bounce-back to trend after September 2009. We didn’t. It’s not because the economy is incapable of reallocating resources. It reallocated resources fine away from housing and into exports and investment over 2004-2008 See? Over 2006-2008 We Reallocated Resources Out of Housing on a Huge Scale As financial markets changed their minds about risk and return in housing… We moved huge amounts of resources out of the housing-construction sector… And, smoothly, into business investment and exports. The Diagnoses of the Problem We Heard Here Yesterday… Seemed to me to focus around problems of “reallocation” and “dynamism”… Flawed in a relative neglect of the difference between a high-pressure and a low-pressure economic environment… Whether “Reallocation” Is into Unemployment or a Booming Sector Is Really Important Keynes (1936): “I defend [my policies] … as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.... If effective demand is deficient... the individual enterpriser who seeks to bring... resources into action is operating with the odds loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros.... The increment of the world’s wealth… [reduced] by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough…" Davis and von Wächter (2011): U-3<6%, mass-layoff workers lose 1.5 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings. U-3>8%, mass-layoff workers lose 3 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings Chodorow-Reich and Wieland (2016): An area with reallocation +1SD -> employment 2% lower at the end of a national recession-recovery cycle. Reallocation has no effect if it occurs during an expansion. The Problem Comes After 2008 The financial-crisis freeze-up of the economy… As housing, exports, investment collapse… And the Recovery Act is undersized by, arithmetically, a factor of 6 And Then We Hit the Economy on the Head with the Austerity Brick, Over and Over Again We also fail to restructure housing finance to encourage construction to help all those people move out of their sisters’ basements. And, with interest rates at zero, the Fed finds no way to signal exports and business investment to take up even more of the slack than they do. Can We Still Recover from the Post-2008 Disaster? We now need to start calling it: “The Longer Depression”… Back in 2009 I said that we obviously will recover, easily. Back in 2012 I said that we could recover—DeLong and Summers—straightforwardly. Now? Gerry Friedman still thinks we could do so. I’m more pessimistic: but I’m not going to argue anything with Gerry until November 15 Nevertheless: worth trying. We should, right now, be desperately trying to generate a higher-pressure economy if only just to see how much low-hanging fruit can be picked via easy aggregate demand-boosting measures Greenspan did it in 1995, and we all were very pleased that he did so. Other Policies? Reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible Reversing the causes is unlikely to be the best policy, even if it is possible However, Low-hanging fruit: Generate a high pressure economy. It might work. And it will do good anyway What else? Aside from Strive for a High-Pressure Economy and Hope, What Can We Do? Where is there low-hanging fruit? What are our value-subtracting industries? Finance (we pay 8% of GDP for net services that used to cost 3%) Health care administration (we pay 5% of GDP for services other countries pay 1% for) Mass incarceration (another 2% other countries do not pay) NIMBYism Residential (but how mportant is it outside of SF, BOS, DC?) Occupational (perhaps? More Low-Hanging Fruit Truman started the process of turning the federal government into an entity with a permanently very large military (for good and sufficient reasons, but still). Johnson set in stone the process of turning the federal government into an insurance company too. “An insurance company with a military”—that’s where we are. Is that where we should be? All Growth Comes from “Investment” of Some Kind All growth comes from somewhere: it doesn’t just precipitate out of the air. Net private investment roughly 7% of net domestic product. Other net investment-like activities of equal magnitude—figure 15% of net product devoted to growth, 10% to per capita growth The average net rate of return on those expenditures is 20%/year. There are some investment and investment-like expenditures that offer very high returns indeed. The U.S. Government Could Do Much More In a world that is increasingly non-Smithian, confining government to military, insurance, property rights, and contract enforcement is just silly—even adding in standard infrastructure. Incentivize the private creation of public and information goods: Why is the government so good at committing itself to pay money in the event of failure—loan guarantees—but not success? Prizes—cf., Michael Kremer. Platforms: Why is it Google doing Google Books? Platforms: Isn’t relying on advertising to fund write-once run-everywhere value-in-scale profoundly silly? Let’s Take the Longest Possible View… Pre-1800 (upper left point is 1800-50) “data” Periods from 1000 years down to 50 Impressive, no? This is essentially Michael Kremer’s pre-job market paper from back when Almost all growth is useful ideas Useful ideas are non-excludable Thus two heads are better than one This is not economics: this is numerology… But the basic Michael Kremer two-heads-are-better-than-one model from 1992: Estimated over the pre-1800 period Admittedly with GDP rather than population on the left-hand side Fits our current 2000-2050 forecast Moreover: this is consistent with Gordon’s view that the Second Industrial Revolution was a really big deal 1.25%/year x 100 years of extra growth Exp(1.25) = 3.5 And now that extra 3.5-fold multiplication of global GDP is over But, still, going forward, after the exhaustion of the Second Industrial Revolution. It still looks as though two heads are better than one If world population tops out and stabilizes at 9B in 2050 Then will world real GDP growth stabilize at 6%/year? Thus we have powerful reasons to believe that economic growth is not over—that human brains will continue to be a very valuable idea-generating resource. Provided, of course, we do not blow up the planet. Or cook it. J.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:41PM Image source: Getty Images. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality. To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business. Revenue has fallen fast, but it's improving Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high. Data by YCharts. The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously. Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects. AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable.  This is changing AMD's focus  A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets.  The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments.  AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying: At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card. The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020. Image source: Digi-Capital. AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story. This stock is on the move  It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.   Data by YCharts. Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017. The bottom line AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors). But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

While some Linux distributions are suitable for older or slower hardware, others are famous for being heavily customizable. If we discuss the ones that are most elegant, elementary OS proves to be the best option. Often called ‘poor man’s Apple’, elementary OS looks and feels like OS X. After spending more than a year in development, the elementary OS team has released elementary OS 0.4 Loki. This release follows Freya, which was released in April of 2015. For this release, Loki development team closed about 1,000 issue reports and acted on more than 20 blueprints. Overall, these changes bring stability and security improvements to the operating system. This Ubuntu-based distribution is based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Linux kernel 4.4. It brings improved hardware support, including 6th-gen Intel Skylake CPUs and graphics. More changes come in the form of support for ambient light sensors.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Be Quiet! announces Pure Rock Slim cooler Published on 7th September 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 0 Comments News Be Quiet!'s new Pure Rock Slim boasts an asymmetric layout to its fin stack to aid clearance on cramped mini-ITX motherboards. Be Quiet! has announced a new tower cooler, the Pure Rock Slim, with an asymmetric design it claims will help it squeeze onto cramped mini-ITX motherboards. The Be Quiet! Pure Rock Slim, the company claims, has been designed for smaller builds which nevertheless boast enough clearance for its upright 92mm seven-blade 'SilentWings' fan and 124.8mm height. Where such tower-style coolers are compatible, the company says that the asymmetric layout of the fin stacks - which sees the rear stack being significantly higher than the front stack - will aid with clearance of RAM modules and other components that can otherwise foul larger heatsinks. Featuring three 6mm outside-diameter heat pipes running through a copper base to the twin aluminium fin stacks, Be Quiet! claims the Pure Rock Slim is capable of cooling any current Intel or AMD processor with up to a 120W thermal design profile (TDP). The overall size of the cooler comes in at 81.8mm by 97mm, plus the aforementioned 128.8mm height, including the bundled fan but excluding the size of the mounting brackets used. More information about the Pure Rock Slim can be found on Be Quiet!'s official product page. UK availability and pricing have yet to be confirmed.

Apple's latest iPhones: USB-C ya later, for now 0 Share: Phones by Dong Ngo September 11, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @riceandstirfry Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy USB-C and Thunderbolt 3: One port to rule them all CNET editor Dong Ngo explains the joy of connecting devices together using the latest USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 standard. by Dong Ngo 2:58 Close Drag A few hours before the Apple event, I made a bet with a coworker: I think this new iPhone is going to have USB-C instead of Lightning. Well, you know how that turned out. And I get it. There are plenty of reasons why Apple is sticking with its proprietary connector. It allows the company to have more control over its devices and make more money via licensing. (Apple makes money for each third-party MFi-certified -- "made for iDevice" -- cable and accessory is sold.) USB-C compatibility issues also have been plaguing the mobile industry for the past many months. And Apple already caused a wave of outrage as it transitioned from the old iPod-era 30-pin connector to the Lightning standard when the iPhone 5 debuted back in 2012. So, OK, a USB-C iPhone will probably never happen. But here's why I think Apple should move to USB-C, anyway. 38 Best iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cases USB-C is a big step forward from Micro-USB. When Apple first debuted the Lightning connector 4 years ago I didn't mind it much, though I wished Apple had opted for the then popular Micro-USB instead. After all, Lightning then used the same USB 2.0 standard and shared the same speed. But at least the Lightning connector was much easier to use. Compared to that now ancient-looking 30-pin connector, Lightning was far smaller. And the unlike Micro-USB, it was reversible -- you could plug it into the phone upside down. Later on, when USB 3.0 became more popular, the Micro-USB 3.0 connector was introduced. While it was backwards compatible with narrower Micro-USB connectors, the 3.0 version was just way so big, ugly and inconvenient to plug in that very few smartphones adopted it. (By the way, you can read more about USB connectors here.) The Galaxy Note 3 was about the only known handset that did. And so, I was fine with Lightning all the way to the iPhone 6S. But now, we have USB-C, an unified connector type that has the same physical size as Lighting, its cable can be plugged in however way you want, can do everything a Lightning connector does and more, and has been adopted by most, if not all, other vendors. It only makes sense that Apple should use it for its latest phones. Apple already uses USB-C on its MacBook. Enlarge Image This Apple Macbook has a USB-C port, so why not the iPhone?Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET That's right, Apple is the one of the first companies that brought USB-C to laptops and it did so in an extreme manner: the 12-inch Macbook which first debuted in 2015 has no other connector than that single USB-C port used for both charging as well as connecting devices to the computer. (OK, not totally true: the other port on that MacBook is, ironically, a 3.5mm headphone jack -- now gone from the new iPhones.) While some grumbled about the single port (a breakout dongle adds other legacy jacks and the ability to charge while using other peripherals), the MacBook's USB-C port was a forward-looking feature that even allows for bidirectional power. That means you can also charge the Macbook from a connected USB-C device (in addition to, say, providing power to a phone or other peripheral). It's also rumored that new Mac models expected later this year will be getting USB-C. And that means for now, and near future, you will need an adapter to connect your new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus to some of the Macs. Isn't that ironic? Better for users Whenever I pack for a trip, I need to carry at least three type of cables. Lightning cables to charge my iPhone and my iPad, USB-C cables to use with my external hard drive, and Thunderbolt cables so that I can connect a display to my Macbook Pro. Yet more often than not, I still find myself short on cables. I was ecstatic to learn that starting with Thunderbolt 3, Intel has opted for USB-C connector, allowing all Thunderbolt 3 port to work as a USB-C port and all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 cables to work interchangeably. Now if the new iPhones also used USB-C connector, I'd just need to carry a few USB-C cables and I'm game. Most importantly, ain't you tired of adapters, already! Those extra little easy-to-lose, always-misplaced things that you need to carry along or clutter your desk with. Going USB-C is the only way to get rid of them once and for all. The idea of one port to rule them all is also great in case of emergency. You won't need to fumble with the cables before you can charge your device. You may not even need to bum a cable from a friend and when you do, they'd definitely have the one you need, because they'd all be the same.. So if the new iPhones had USB-C, cable anxiety would soon be no more. Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Better for environment Let's face it. The new iPhones will almost certainly sell in the tens of millions, headphone jack blowback or not. And that means millions and millions of Lightning cables, Lightning-to-audio adapters, Lightning headphones and third-party accessories. Eventually, all of them will become e-waste, filling up our landfills. You can argue that if the new phones supported USB-C, we'd still need the cables and adapters (USB-C-to-audio) anyway. That's true. But in this case, the cables and adapters can be used interchangeably with other USB-C devices. You wouldn't need two sets of cables and accessories, one for Apple devices and another for non-Apple devices. And you can keep the cables (and accessories) longer because you can always make use of them with future USB-C devices, which are only going to multiply in 2017 and beyond. Apple has been big on claiming itself an environmentally conscientious company. Then why doesn't it use the universal connector standard that helps cut down waste and the use of natural recourses? The USB-C dream When announcing the iPhone 7, Apple's Phil Schiller said that it takes "courage" to remove the headphone jack. Don't fool yourself! Removing the jack, but keeping the Lightning connection, revealed Apple's intention to go completely proprietary, to have more control, and ultimately to make more money. Remember that MFi certification mentioned earlier? Apple gets a cut of literally anything you plug into the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (so long as it's a legit accessory). Sounds less like courage to me, and more like greed. But going proprietary can also lead to the downfall of a company. This is partly why Sony -- once the biggest name in electronics -- is much less relevant than it was a decade or two ago. You remember: when it would keep trying to convince you that you needed to re-buy that same movie or song on a MiniDisc and a UMD (and maybe a memory stick), after you already had it on a CD or DVD. I could be wrong, though. Maybe Tim Cook has decided to save USB-C for the 2017 iPhone. But next time, I won't bet on it.

(Far r.): Hackathons have become popular events at California’s Santa Clara County Library District in Silicon Valley Last summer, Bloomberg BusinessWeek devoted an entire issue to “What Is Code?” a single article by Brooklyn-based writer and programmer Paul Ford. It quickly generated more traffic on the business magazine’s website than any other article since the site’s launch in 2010, editors told the Huffington Post a few weeks after the story’s publication. The detailed-but-­accessible essay discusses key concepts in computer programming, programming languages, and the software development process at businesses. Yet perhaps one theme that grabbed readers from the business community and kept them engaged throughout the 38,000-word piece was the idea that “you,” a successful VP at a large company, are working with “The Man in the Taupe Blazer,” a project leader who has been hired for a major overhaul of your company’s website. And during your initial meeting, “you” can barely understand what he’s talking about. “For your entire working memory, some Internet thing has come along every two years and suddenly hundreds of thousands of dollars (inevitably millions) must be poured into amorphous projects with variable deadlines,” Ford writes in the intro. “Content management projects, customer relationship management integration projects, mobile apps, paperless office things, global enterprise resource planning initiatives—no matter how tightly you clutch the purse strings, software finds a way to pry open your fingers.” The article doesn’t argue that business executives could solve this problem by dropping everything and learning C. There is a reason that they hire experts for their multimillion-dollar projects. Instead, Ford’s breakdown of key concepts pulls back the curtain on the fundamentals of computer programming and makes a compelling argument that any smart person can learn the basics—and that the basics are worth learning even for those who aren’t planning to become professional coders. It is, in part, a case for coding as a new frontier in digital literacy. As technology becomes an ever more ubiquitous facet of modern work and entertainment, speaking a bit of the language is one of the best ways to facilitate communication with those experts. “Once you understand the basics of coding—or anything, really—as you get older, you can see where it goes,” says Alex Giannini, manager of digital experience for the Westport Public Library, CT. “Kids today are growing up with an iPad in their hands. They don’t have to learn the digital language; they’re born with it. The more that we can integrate even basic coding younger and younger, it just makes it easier to grasp the true concepts as they get older.” There’s a growing interest in this type of education among kids, teens, businesspeople, career changers, and the generally curious. And a growing number of public libraries are already responding to this need within their communities. Here’s a look at ways in which a few libraries have made their programs a success. (For more on the library’s role in teaching coding for kids both in a school and public library setting, see Coding Skills Empower Us All, and look for more in SLJ 4/16.) Constant communication Florida’s Orange County Library System (OCLS), Orlando, offers an example of how a technology curriculum can grow when a library system responds to local demand and seeks regular feedback regarding its community’s needs. Fourteen years ago, like most libraries, OCLS offered classes on computer basics. Patrons began requesting computer classes taught in Spanish and Haitian Creole, so the library set up high-demand classes in those languages. Multipart courses on software such as Excel and Photoshop were added owing to demand. Surveys revealed that there were many patrons who were interested in the classes but couldn’t fit travel to the library into their schedule, so a series of live, online web courses was launched eight years ago, notes ­Ormilla Vengersammy, Melrose Center manager and Technology and Education Department head for OCLS. Due in part to the growth of Orlando’s technology sector, demand has been increasing for courses in topics from HTML 5 and mobile app development to networking concepts and electronics prototyping. With its current slate of about 250 in-person and online tech courses, OCLS has one of the most comprehensive computer course selections in the library field. “We do a lot of analysis prior to developing a course,” explains Vanya Walker, instructional technology specialist for OCLS. “We look at trends to determine the needs of our audience. We also ask our patrons, in regular surveys, ‘What do you need?’ ” Once demand is determined, Walker says that OCLS then examines the topic to decide whether that need should be addressed with an individual class or a multipart course. “We look at the scope of the class, and what we want to cover, and then we find natural breaks,” she says. For example, with the library’s HTML 5 class, which consists of four 90-minute sessions, “we know we want to cover the basics of HTML and the basics of web design. We know that [we must] cover CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, because that’s an integral part of HTML 5. And we’re also going to include JavaScript…. It takes you through the complete, basic process of designing a website from scratch.” The library also supplements its classes with an institutional subscription to Lynda.com, but Vengersammy notes that OCLS still considers in-person instruction to be a priority, enabling attendees to ask a teacher questions in real time and work with other patrons. Learn as you go The Denver Public Library (DPL) has followed a similar trajectory at its Community Technology Center, which began as a traditional computer lab offering one-on-one assistance and classes in computer basics and has expanded in recent years as patrons began requesting more advanced instruction. Program coordinator Nate Stone organized staff-taught classes on the open source content management system WordPress and subsequently four-part courses on HTML and CSS. Later, a separate four-part course on JavaScript provided patrons with a comprehensive web development track. Then, people started asking about the programming language Python. “None of us on the staff here felt like we had the skills set to teach that as a structured class,” says Cody Yantis, librarian at DPL’s Community Technology Center and ideaLAB. So, Yantis simply dove into the programming language alongside interested students. “We ended up doing an eight-week [course in which] we met once a week and worked through an online resource together. So I learned as well. I would just work ahead and come up with some exercises, but then we would also just tackle stuff together. And it worked out really well.” DPL is planning to offer a similar Python course this spring. It’s a great example of how a library might use online resources such as Codecademy, Code.org, Lynda.com, Treehouse, or a curated selection of free web resources to develop courses on advanced topics in-house even without a preexisting expert on staff. Denver’s tech sector is on the rise, and locals have the option of enrolling in for-profit coding “boot camps” for advanced instruction and job training. But as Yantis notes, those types of courses are generally an expensive investment, often costing individuals $10,000 or more. “For the Community Technology Center, we see our place as kind of a bridge,” he says. “We’re never going to offer a high enough level of [instruction] to get someone a professional programmer job as soon as they finish. But it may get them into a program that will lead to that…. This allows people to try it out, see if it speaks to them, without any kind of financial obligation.” Make friends As programs grow, however, opportunities to provide more advanced instruction can grow as well. DPL’s Community Technology Center and ideaLAB Maker space has begun attracting attention from local tech companies, some of which have expressed interest in teaching classes or offering mentorship. The Melrose Center at OCLS has become a regular meet-up spot for IndieNomicon, a local group of game developers and entrepreneurs. Last summer, Intel hosted a six-week “Innovator Lab” to help programmers work with the company’s RealSense 3-D camera and gesture-based human-computer interaction technology. Afterward, it donated equipment to OCLS. A proactive search for instructors can also produce help from quarters that many libraries might not expect. At California’s Santa Clara County Library District (SCCL), in the heart of Silicon Valley, teen services librarian Matt Lorenzo developed coding courses with help from members of academic clubs at local high schools. Advanced teens now teach coding courses for middle school students at the library. “I wasn’t really sure how much attendance we would have, but, right off the bat, a class filled up,” Lorenzo says. Whether it’s a teen instructor or a guest speaker from a local tech company, Lorenzo says that part of the challenge is helping these instructors explain complex concepts in ways that their audience can easily grasp. “They have to have sound knowledge, and they have to be able to express that to other learners in a way that can be retained by students,” he says. “I spend a good amount of time working with presenters to make sure that everything is lined up in an easily understandable, flowing manner…. With the older kids able to help the younger ones…it takes that classroom feel where ‘you need to know this or you’re going to get a bad grade’ off the table. It relieves a lot of pressure for younger learners when they’re being taught by their peers.” With young people accustomed to teaching one another and working with mentors from the local tech industry, the library’s Cupertino branch has become a great spot for hackathon events. Last summer, more than 100 local teens participated in a 12-hour, all-night event where they worked in groups to create apps and games, then presented their creations to a panel of judges. Get them hooked Thanks to a generous private donation, Westport PL was able to take its coding curriculum to the next level in 2014, acquiring two small humanoid NAO Evolution robots by Paris-based Aldebaran Robotics. At about $8,000 each, these walking, talking, dancing robots are currently priced out of reach for many library systems, but the program engagement that Westport managed to generate during the past two years could indicate that inexpensive programmable robots, such as Sphero or Ollie, could be a good way to capture attention, introduce basic concepts, and then take a deeper dive for patrons who become interested in more advanced coding. The robots, named Vincent and Nancy, instantly captured the community’s imagination. Giannini says that shortly after acquiring the robots, Westport announced a series of classes on its website, six days per week with a demonstration on Sundays, with the classes capped at ten attendees each. “It was a Friday afternoon,” he says. “By Sunday morning, two months’ worth of classes were full.” The robots can be programmed by novices using proprietary software called Choreograph, which Giannini describes as similar to Scratch, a visual programming language for kids developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Offering introductory classes in which everyone could use ­Choreograph and see instant results from their work kept ­attendees engrossed, while identifying patrons who might be curious to learn more. “You can take a class with us, and by the end of the class you can have the robot wave and say something, and there’s instant gratification,” Giannini says. “Once you go deeper into that software, Python is underneath. By the end of the year, we trained over 2,000 patrons on [Choreograph]. I’d say 90 percent were happy taking the [basic] courses we provided, creating a 30- to 60-second program on the robot, using existing movements…. But there was that ten percent who wanted to go deeper. And for them, we did an Hour of Code [course], and we taught Python.” Want to learn more? Come to “Code Your Library” April 20–May 11, 2016 Learn how to create meaningful tech programming for your library in this four-week online event and workshop. Speakers include Mitchel Resnick and Natalie Rusk from MIT’s Scratch Program, Kim Wilkens of Tech Girls, Alberto Tornes of All Star Code, Chad Sansing from the Mozilla Foundation, and more. Registration is $250; SIGN UP NOW Progress report Vengersammy and Walker agree that breaking a course down into manageable segments and demonstrating visible results help to keep learners involved. “One key to capturing an audience’s attention is to show them the end product first,” Vengersammy says. “This is what you’re going to create.” In the OCLS two-part Arduino course, one of the very first things attendees do is set up the device and issue a command to make an LED light blink. “You have to tell it where the power is coming from, what ports you are using, how fast the light should blink. And people see it right away, and they’re so excited,” Walker says. “Then you can challenge them—make it blink faster, make it blink slower…. People think ‘code’ and ‘programming’ and ‘microcontrollers’ and they think ‘that’s going to be too much for me.’ When you pre­sent it the way that we do, which is fun and easy and exciting, people build their skills without even realizing it.” Once the library helps patrons get past any initial trepidation and instills the confidence that they, too, can learn to code, it may just be the spark they need to seek out more knowledge or start their own projects. At Westport, Giannini says that he has reached a bit of a saturation point with large public demos of the robots, but that’s not a bad thing. Going forward, Vincent and Nancy will continue to be in demand for advanced students, including a programming group from a local community college that recently booked a weekly ­session. “It’s one thing to give people the tool and show them the tool, but once they see the tool and understand [it], they want to take it and use it for their own purposes,” Giannini explains. “That’s the goal of any of the stuff that we teach. Actually, that’s why we teach.” This article was published in Library Journal. Subscribe today and save up to 35% off the regular subscription rate.

The event took place for the first time this Sunday at Impact Hub Bamako, which is the local ambassador for Seedstars World and co-organized the event. The 8 selected startups were invited to present their ideas in front of the local jury panel. “It was an amazing experience to have Seedstars World organize the event in Bamako. I saw a group of amazingly enthusiastic entrepreneurs who will show the world that we have amazing talent in the country.” says Mohamed Keita, CEO and Founder of Impact Hub Bamako. The local winner, Aikio Corp, a platform for medical laboratories to transmit medical test results to patients safely and confidentially online and by sms, was selected the best startup in Mali. “I’m on a mission to improve healthcare in Africa and I believe that my solution is one that is relevant for many and can literally save lives.” explains Boubacar Keita, founder and CEO of Aikio Corp. As a part of the prize, Aikio Corp will be participating at Seedstars Summit, taking place in Switzerland in April 2017, a weeklong training program with the opportunity to meet the other 60 winners, as well as investors and mentors from around the world. Traditionally, the final day of the Summit will be dedicated to pitching in front of audience of 1000 attendees, with the possibility of winning up to the USD 1 million equity investment. 1st runner up is Transup, a technology that allows anyone to transfer phone credit between different operators. Feuze, an electronic device that allows for registration, insurance and geolocation of motorbikes, grabbed the last spot in the top 3. The other startups invited to pitch were Pharmoso, E-Keneya, AllianceJ, Orientkey, HVM. The 10 startups pitched in front of a prestigious jury, including Claudia Makadristo, Associate for Africa at Seedstars World, Soline Miniere, Senior Investment Associate at Crossboundary, Fayelle Ouane Co-founder Impact Hub, Issa Toure, Head of Finance at CRS and Sidi Yattara, Consular Officer at Global Affairs Canada. “We were very impressed by the talent that was showcased during the SSW Bamako event. Mali is yet again an example that proves that it is not about where you are from, but what you do. We are very excited to bring Aikio Corp to our global summit and hope that this event will inspire young talented people in the country to start their own businesses.” says Claudia Makadristo, Associate for Seedstars World Africa. Seedstars Bamako also featured speaker mr.

Gameranx NEWS FEATURES PLATFORMS PC PlayStation 4 Xbox One VIDEOS UPCOMING GAMES GUIDES September 9, 2016 BioShock: The Collection PC Requirements Revealed The Steam version of the collection will go live on September 15th. Kris Kittie / Updates / 2K Games, Bioshock The Collection, PC, Steam / 2k has revealed the PC system requirements for Bioshock: The Collection on Steam today. They will be listed in full at the bottom of the article. In addition, the publisher has detailed upgrade instructions for players who have purchased the Games for Windows Live versions of the first two games. If you own Bioshock and/or Bioshock 2 on Steam, then you will receive the remastered versions upon their release. However, things are a bit more complicated for those with Games for Windows Live copies. For the original Bioshock you will need to submit a ticket to 2k Support with a scan of the original receipt, a confirmation email or some other way to prove your purchase is valid. Getting the remastered version of Bioshock 2 is not quite that complicated. Simply enter your Games for Windows Live key into Steam, and the game will be added to your library. If you want to play the original version of their game, both the remastered and original will be in your library. The single Steam listing for each game also includes both versions. Bioshock Infinite is not included in the remasters on PC “because it already meets current-gen console standards and runs smoothly on high visual settings.” Bioshock: The Collection releases for PS4 and Xbox One on September 13th, while the Steam versions will go live on September 15th at 3 PM PT. Total Storage Space: BioShock: 25 GB BioShock 2: 25 GB BioShock Infinite: 20 GB Total for all three games: 70 GB Minimum System Specs: OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit Processor: Intel E6750 Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz / AMD Athlon X2 2.7 GHZ Memory: 4 GB GPU: DirectX11 Compatible, AMD Radeon HD 7770 / Nvidia GeForce GTX 560 Recommended System Specs: OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit Processor: 3 GHz Quad-Core Memory: 8 GB Video Card: 2 GB ATI Radeon HD 7970, 2GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 770 or better   3127240-3109607-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_lighthouse 3127240-3109607-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_lighthouse 3127244-3109611-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_welcome-to-rapture 3127244-3109611-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_welcome-to-rapture 3127247-3109614-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_bs-fight 3127247-3109614-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_bs-fight 3127246-3109613-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_adonis-luxury-resort 3127246-3109613-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio2_adonis-luxury-resort 3127243-3109610-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_shock-water 3127243-3109610-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_shock-water 3127242-3109609-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_mr-bubbles 3127242-3109609-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_mr-bubbles 3127241-3109608-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_ls-harvest 3127241-3109608-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_ls-harvest 3127239-3109606-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eves-garden 3127239-3109606-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eves-garden 3127238-3109605-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eve-injection 3127238-3109605-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_eve-injection 3127237-3109604-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bees 3127237-3109604-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bees 3127236-3109603-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight-2 3127236-3109603-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight-2 3127235-3109602-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight 3127235-3109602-2k_bioshock-the-collection_bio1_bd-fight Related Recent Posts Pokemon Sun & Moon: Unlock Entries & Locations With 454 QR Codes Before You Buy – Dishonored 2 Dishonored 2 to Get New Game Plus and Custom Difficulty Pokemon Sun & Moon: Z-Crystal Locations | Z-Moves Unlock Guide Watch Dogs 2 – Before You Buy ↑ ABOUT Copyright 2010-2016 Gameranx.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Fujitsu has a winner on its hands, with the S936 offering excellent performance along with some stunning expansion capabilities and shockingly good battery life, all of which makes it a great candidate for demanding businesses. For Lengthy battery life Impressive performer Exceptional expansion capabilities Portability Against No need for a battery cover A bit pricey Launched at the beginning of 2016, the Lifebook S936 sits, together with the U904, in a category that Fujitsu describes as notebooks with "ultimate features and stylish design", destined for professionals on the move looking for products that combine looks with substance. Prosaically though, it's essentially a more refined version of the Lifebook E736 that we reviewed not so long ago. As expected from a laptop for which the cheapest version will set you back about £1,000 (around $1,340, AU$1,740), this is a model that looks and feels premium. Its main rivals include the ThinkPad T460s series, the Dell Latitude E7440 and the HP Elitebook 1040 G3. The S936 uses the same magnesium/aluminium combination for its chassis but manages to keep the weight down to only 1.19kg (our model weighed in at 1.42kg thanks to an optical drive and the touch display). What came as a surprise though was how chunky it is – at its thickest, this notebook is a whopping 26mm thick, which pushes it outside the minimum requirements to be called an Ultrabook. At last, a vendor that doesn't compromise! Another area where Fujitsu has trumped the competition is connectivity and expansion capabilities. Unlike many of its competitors and despite its weight, Fujitsu managed to include a free memory slot that allows the owner to upgrade the memory to 20GB of DDR4 RAM (4GB of memory is soldered on the motherboard) simply by removing one screw and one flap. This is still a far cry from the 32GB that the E736 could take thanks to two free slots, but it is the only major step down with this model. We're puzzled by the fact that engineers have managed to cram in a modular bay that allows you to shove in a secondary battery, a hard drive or an optical drive; an example of where modularity works in an enterprise setup. When it comes to ports, there's a GbE port, a legacy VGA one, and HDMI port, three USB 3.0, an audio connector and a card reader. It's a shame about the lack of a DisplayPort though which would have made this machine 4K friendly. Servicing the laptop is a fairly mundane operation. There are a dozen screws that need to be removed – some of which are well hidden – and all the important components are well in sight. Because Fujitsu placed manageability ahead of integration, servicing teams will be able to replace almost all components in the S936 far faster, in case of hardware issues, reducing downtime considerably. However, we did hit a snag when trying to take out the battery. For some reason, the S936 includes a snap-on cover, an odd option. When we tried to put the battery back, it just wouldn't fit in properly and got jammed. This meant that we couldn't put the cover back on. Speaking of the battery, the smaller one offered has a 51Whr capacity with a beefier 6-cell model boasting 77Whr and up to 15 hours of longevity. Slot in an optional secondary 28Whr battery and that adds another six hours to an already impressive battery life. The battery life tests were carried out by Fujitsu using the BAPco MobileMark 2014 office productivity test. A major reason why the S936 excels in mobility is because it uses a screen technology that draws less power. Our model came with a palm vein sensor, a Fujitsu exclusive and one that doesn't require you to touch the sensor in order to unlock your device. A more traditional fingerprint sensor is also available as an option. Other security features on the S936 include a smart card reader, encrypted disk and a TPM 2.0 module, all of which are staple offerings on high-end enterprise laptops. The relatively small footprint of the machine means that a 13.3-inch display was the only logical choice with a full HD model or a WQHD one, with touch and anti-glare offered as options. Our model came with an Intel Core i7-6600U CPU (2.6GHz, two cores, 4MB cache), 8GB of RAM, a 128GB M2 SSD, a 4G LTE modem, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC, Windows 10 Pro and a list price of £1,200 (around $1,600, AU$2,090) excluding VAT. As with other Fujitsu laptops, this one comes with a two-year warranty. There are also two front-facing speakers and a webcam. We tested the Fujitsu Lifebook S936 using Cinebench R15, CPU-Z and GeekBench 4. On the first benchmark, it reached 43.9 fps for the OpenGL test and 322 points for the CPU benchmark. CPU-Z yielded scores of 1,597 and 3,597 (Single and Multi-thread respectively) while on the newly introduced GeekBench 4, the notebook achieved 17,749 on its compute benchmark and 3,871/7,560 points on its single/multi-core test. All these numbers are on par with what one would expect from a Skylake-based Core i7 processor from Intel. The display, which uses Sharp's acclaimed IGZO technology, was exquisite, on par with the rest of the competition. It boasts great viewing angles, reasonably thin bezels and well balanced colours. The keyboard and the touchpad were equally good – the former offers a reasonable spring and feedback, with massive Enter, Shift and Backspace keys, and great travel. The touchpad has two physical mouse buttons and while it's not the biggest we've seen on a 13.3-inch laptop, it is accurate and responsive, although we have some reservations regarding its slightly high level of friction. An optional port replicator/docking station, costing £99, is also available and adds an extra USB 3.0 port, DVI and DisplayPort connectors. Early verdict The Lifebook S936 is one of the best designed laptops we've seen in recent years. Okay, so it's not perfect and is a tad thicker than we'd expect, but removing the artificial limit on thickness gave more leeway to engineers and frankly, the additional 10mm thickness meant more space to fiddle around and a level of expansion capabilities that we've never seen on any laptop of this weight. Perhaps the only reservation we have is about the battery and its cover; a minor point but one that caused us some problems.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Editorial: Microsoft should be putting Windows 10 on phones 3 by Greg Jordan  @solo_g06 Sep 10, 2016 at 20:59 GMT2 months ago While the title of this article may be misleading, as Microsoft already has a version of Windows 10 available for mobile devices in the form of Windows 10 mobile, we know that the future of that platform in itself is hazy; as market share has been on a rapid decline, the official Microsoft website has delisted the Lumia brand, and now reports are coming in from readers all over the country that Microsoft stores have removed all phones that were on display. Even the legendary “Surface Phone”, which has been rumored since last year, is now rumored to be hitting the market in the latter half of 2017, if the phone even comes to fruition at all. No, this article isn’t about any of that (except for the last one, but we’ll get to that later). Microsoft clearly has no strategy for performing in the mobile market; Project Astoria was canned, the Windows Insider program, though seemingly helpful, is limited upon official release (less than half of the Windows 8.1 phones received the official W10M update despite being able to run the technical preview version), and Microsoft seems content with getting to Windows 10 mobile whenever they feel ready, despite what the actual market says. Android and iOS are growing by leaps and bounds (well at least one of the two), and have set schedules, whether it be for new devices or new software. People know what they’re getting when they jump on the Google and Apple train, but no matter how often Microsoft tries to rebrand themselves, their actions speak completely different than their words. Windows 10 on phones As I stated earlier, Microsoft seems to have no other strategy for Windows 10 mobile other than the Windows Insider program. Since July 29 2015, Microsoft has rode behind Windows 10 like no other product in its history, but that’s Windows 10 for PCs/laptops. From the free upgrade offer, to the on time release of the Anniversary update, to the unwanted forced installation of Windows 10 on consumer devices, Microsoft has made sure to get its new baby into consumers hand. They even offered an incentive to come into the store to get the upgrade for free, giving a free laptop to those with capable devices that weren’t able to be upgraded. But where’s the incentive to get W10m devices into its consumers hands? Other than committed Windows fans, most phone users don’t even know that there’s a version of Windows 10 for phones. And when they find out that there is, they assume its the same edition that’s running on their computer at work. Well why not give them what they want? Why not put Windows 10 Home edition on mobile hardware? Microsoft has already lost the war for mobile marketshare, but holds steadfast to the lead in the PC division. This is what Microsoft needs to use to its advantage. Merging the Windows Store was the beginning. If market share was the problem, we should start seeing more UWP apps hit the Windows Store. By eliminating Windows 10 mobile and focusing on explicitly focusing on Windows 10 for PCs/laptops/phones, you shake the negative connotation that W10m has garnered over the past few years. UWP apps already run on all platforms, and features like continuum would really be useful, allowing you to dock your mobile device to any external screen, using Windows 10 on a larger screen, while having use of ALL of your apps and information. A landscape start screen would actually be an implemented feature instead of a suggestion on Windows Feedback. Windows as a platform would experience an increase in market share. And no matter what Microsoft wants to believe, mobile computing is the future, and Redmond needs to take advantage of its leading position while it still has one to claim. The mysterious Surface Phone And here’s where the Surface Phone comes into play. Microsoft needs a device to showcase Windows 10 on mobile devices, and what better than a device with a brand name that’s synonymous with style, functionality, and quality. More than that, the Surface should be everything that Lumia isn’t. If Lumia was supposed to be the flagship Windows 10 mobile device, the Surface Phone needs to be the best mobile device running Windows 10. This is where all of that Microsoft rebranding comes into play, its time for the software giant to reinvent the mobile market. After having a hold on the mobile market in the early part of the millennium ( along with Blackberry and Palm, neither of which had the money that Microsoft does to keep playing), Microsoft failed to innovate, which Apple did with the first iPhone. Apple made an all touchscreen device with no stylus, pinch to zoom functionality, and a dedicated app store. The phone was widely accepted, and as we know is one of the best selling phones in history. Google followed suit with Android a year later, with the same open functionality that Windows Mobile had when it was a major player. Windows Phone 7 series was way too little, and way too late, only becoming a viable option with Windows Phone 8.1 in 2014. But much like the wearable Microsoft Band, Microsoft shouldn’t be afraid to make a niche mobile product. Imagine a Surface Phone with a 6.0-6.5 inch display, 4GB of RAM, 128-256GB ROM, Intel processor, stylus, an optical trackpad akin to the Samsung Omnia, a full size ISB 3.0 port ( or maybe just USB OTG), and full blown Windows 10. None of these specifications are farfetched, as modern day flagships already have similar specs. But the niche feature for the Surface Phone would be the ability to run x86 programs, with the stylus and trackpad for assistance. And even a typecover like case could be implemented. Now before you get to complaining about x86 programs running on a 6.0 or 6.5 inch mobile device, remember that there are 7.0 inch tablets that run the full version of Windows 10. I’ve used these devices, and x86 program run and work just fine on touch, a stylus or trackpad would only make it more efficient if anything. There are already mobile devices that are attempting to do exactly what I’ve described above, but none have reached the market as far as I know (the device pictured at the beginning of the article is Gole 1, a mini PC, not a phone). However if you check on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, you’ll find multiple devices attempting to bring Windows 10 to mobile devices, they just lack one thing; the backing that a company like Microsoft has. So what say you readers? Do you think that Microsoft should do away with Windows 10 mobile for smartphones running Windows 10, or is the idea too farfetched?

The upcoming device may launch in fall 2017.  ( David Ramos | Getty Images ) Advertisement Rumors of Microsoft's Surface Phone have been circling the tech space not for months but for years now. But it seems that smartphone enthusiasts have to wait another year for the company to launch the Surface Phone. Given that Microsoft already has laptops and tablets under the Surface brand, it makes sense for the company to extend the brand name to mobile phones as well. Previous rumors have pointed that Microsoft is working on three Surface Phones, which will have different prices and specs to cater to all market segments. Speculations are rife that the company will hold an event sometime in October where it will showcase a number of products, such as the Surface all-in-one device. However, the Surface Phone is not likely to be launched at the event. A ZDNet report cites sources familiar with the matter and suggests that if the Surface Phone materializes, then customers should expect the handset to arrive "considerably later." Although the report does not state how long customers will have to wait for the Surface Phone, rumors suggest that Microsoft may launch its smartphone line in fall 2017. Microsoft planned to launch a Surface Phone in 2014 but due to component issues the company scrapped the plan. Microsoft is also said to have planned to launch the Surface Phone in fall 2016, but Intel shut down all its mobile developments, which is believed to have delayed the Surface Phone to 2017. The mobile OS market is dominated by bigwigs such as Android and iOS. According to an International Data Corporation (IDC) report, in 2016, the combined market share of iOS and Android was more than 99 percent. Windows Phone had a market share of 0.5 percent. IDC also predicts that the Windows Phone market share will decline further in the near term. "IDC anticipates further decline in Windows Phone's market share throughout the forecast. Although the platform recently saw a new device launch from one of the largest PC vendors, the device (like the OS) remains highly focused on the commercial market. Future device launches, whether from Microsoft or its partners, are expected to have a similar target market," says IDC. The disappointing market share of devices running on Windows Phone could be a reason that has made Microsoft shift its focus from the Surface Phone. The company has not confirmed any detail about the Surface Phone and customers will have to wait before it reveals more information on its smartphones. Till then, rumors regarding the Surface Phone should be treated with a pinch of salt. Photo: Mike Mozart | Flickr TAG Microsoft, Surface Phone, Windows Phone © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

A portfolio manager for the Voya Large Cap Growth Fund talks about investing strategies. Share story By SARAH SKIDMORE SELL The Associated Press The stock market is at record highs, and that is making it tougher for investors to find big gains. Voya Large Cap Growth Fund focuses on big companies. Its top 10 holdings are all household names like Apple, Home Depot, Facebook and Costco. The fund says it aims to find that “sweet spot where business momentum, valuation and market recognition intersect.” Michael Pytosh, head of equities at Voya Investment Management and one of the fund’s portfolio managers, spoke with The Associated Press about investing strategies for growth in a low-growth world. Answers have been edited for length and clarity. Q. Given the slow growth in both markets and the global economy right now, what do you see as the primary appeal of large cap funds?

A. Growth is harder to come by today than in many times in my career, and I’ve been doing this for 30 years. But there’s still good growth out there. There’s always changes in regulation, changes in market share and innovation. This environment is a little different than normal because, in part, investors are looking for yield. There’s a lot of room between the high growth and the yielding parts of the universe. For moderate-growth companies, they are trading at reasonable levels and there are opportunities there. It’s all relative gain at the end of the day. Q. Is growth overvalued right now? There seems to be a lot of demand chasing very little supply. A. In short, yes. Particularly at the very high end of the growth spectrum. There is a scarcity. And this is the slowest growth period I’ve lived through. There is a lot of money searching for growth, so when it happens, people pay for it. But growth is finite. There is the rare company that grows for 10 or 20 years. Most growth companies only have a growth period of three to five years. You have to be careful, you have to be nimble. The biggest problem you have as a growth investor is when you stay too long in a stock that grew fast and isn’t growing as fast. You can’t have a portfolio full of stocks that drop like that. There’s no way to counteract it. Q. A lot of growth has traditionally been in technology, and those companies are highly reliant on markets outside the U.S. What are you keeping your eye on globally? A. Technology is pretty representative of global markets. More than half of those sales come from outside the U.S. for the big companies. So we are always aware of the economic developments in Europe and China. But more important than that, for each individual company — if it’s Apple or Google or Facebook or Intel — it’s really what innovations do they have in the pipeline, what’s the available market. The tech market isn’t as vibrant as it was in the ’90s, when you were putting PCs on every desk or the 2000s, when cellphones were everywhere. But there are still opportunities with product cycle and innovation. Q. There are a lot of tech companies creating a lot of stuff out there. It seems tough to stay on top of what is going to be the next big thing. Is it? A. It’s challenging. You have to have analysts who are very experienced in understanding the evolution of technology and what are the available markets. There’s a lot of innovation out there, but about 98 percent of it is not material. It’s great innovation, but it’s not going to move the needle. We spend a lot of time dissecting that to see what is going to move the needle. SARAH SKIDMORE SELL Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

It was nuts and last June it was a relief to report that Apple finally set the story straight because the rumors were getting completely out of control about the vans being associated with an autonomous vehicle. In August of last year we posted two reports on the matter. The first was titled "Are the New Round of Car Rumors Believable?" and the second titled "Proof is Mounting that Apple's Project Titan is about the Development of an Advanced Driver Assistance System." There's no denying that Apple's engineers had been working on underlying technology related to future vehicles for years because they're on record with a series of patents that were presented in our noted report above.    Shortly thereafter the rumor mill went into high gear and all out for Project Titan being about an autonomous vehicle. We followed a few of the rumors that were from the top news sites like the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Reuters. Stories about Apple giving the green light to triple Project Titan's staff, that Apple ended talks with BWM and Daimler over new vehicle cooperation and that Apple had a secret Titan team in Germany.   Then in early 2016 the surprising news came to light that Steve Zadesky, head of Project Titan was leaving and speculation began that the project was in trouble. In July Apple appointed no-nonsense Bob Mansfield to head Project Titan who was reportedly taking the project in a new direction by prioritizing the development of an autonomous driving system, exactly what we reported on back in August 2015 as noted earlier. Of course the door was still open a crack for a future car, but Mansfield wanted the Project Titan team to first focus on the heart of the project which was towards an advanced driver assistance system.   Late yesterday the New York Times reported that three sources close to the matter confirmed to them that Apple was indeed rethinking Project Titan. "Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.   Apple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a 'reboot' of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.   Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.   The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.   Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company's plans. Like other companies in the space, that technology is likely a number of years away from seeing mainstream consumer use, they added." For more on this, see the full New York Times report here.   An interesting and random point in the NYTimes report was that "Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use."   In July we posted a report titled "BMW, Intel, Mobileye Announcements Live," wherein we presented the live event about the 'iNext Car' and still have the video covering it. I also noted in that report that the Tesla tragedy was the elephant in the room that was a drag on the event because the Tesla incident happened the day before the big live event. One of the companies behind the Tesla system was also behind the new BMW autonomous vehicle initiative being announced. Tesla later ended the partnership with Mobileye over the deadly crash caused by a flaw in the autonomous system.   The Tesla tragedy really put a big question mark into the whole autonomous driving craze. I have to admit, the autonomous driving experience was never one that interested me in the least. It's a feature I'd only use lightly like I use cruise control. But any driver knows that at high highway speeds it only takes a second for something to go wrong and depending on any machine to make the right decision at the right time is something I'll never trust in my lifetime. Inner-city cab rides sounds like a real market but trusting a car to make lane changes and avoid accidents at high speed is, for many, not something of great interest.   With that said, Apple's big billion dollar investment in Didi Chuxing made sense for opening the door to Apple Pay because the service delivered 11 million rides a day – Ka-Ching! But it was also an open door to a mass market to test out various vehicle technologies. The President of Didi Chuxing stated on a conference call at the time that the deal would benefit each other "on product, technology, marketing, and many other levels."   This is one of the key markets where Apple's focus with Project Titan could still pay off. Taxi cabs, unlike consumer vehicles, have a high turnover. There's no doubt that Didi and Uber are thinking about moving into autonomous cabs as Uber's first self-driving fleet arrived in Pittsburgh in August.   For now, Apple's Project Titan is shifting gears away from making a vehicle to refocusing their energies on such things as an advanced driver assistance system and beyond. While the dream of the iCar was popcorn for our minds, perhaps reality is now setting in and refocusing on the possible is at hand.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

BioShock: The Collection - Upgrade-Infos, Systemanforderungen & Startzeit Nächste Woche kommt die BioShock: The Collection auch für PC. 2K Games hat jetzt die Hardware-Anforderungen und weitere Details zum kostenlosen Upgrade-Prozess veröffentlicht. Von Christian Fritz Schneider | Datum: 10.09.2016 ; 12:45 Uhr Kommentare (38) BioShock: The Collection - 14 Minuten Gameplay aus Bioshock 1 HD Zum Thema BioShock: The Collection für 44,99 € bei GamesPlanet.com Am 15. September 2016 wird BioShock: The Collection für PC, PS4 und Xbox One veröffentlicht. Bei uns in Deutschland wird es allerdings schon Punkt 0 Uhr am 16.9. sein, wenn sich die PC-Version auf Steam aktiviert. Die neuen Versionen von Bioshock und Bioshock 2 werden als neue Spiele in der Steam-Bibliothek auftauchen. Wer die beiden Spiele und den Story-DLC Minerva's Den bereits auf Steam hat, bekommt die grafisch verbesserten und um freischaltbare Audiokommentare verbesserten Versionen gratis. Dabei gilt: Man bekommt nur für die PC-Inhalte kostenlose Upgrades, die man besitzt. Wer den DLC also beispielsweise nicht hat, bekommt auch nicht die neue Version aus der Collection. Bioshock Infinite wird am PC übrigens nicht überarbeitet, da die neue Version für PS4 und Xbox One eigentlich nur ein Port der ursprünglichen PC-Fassung ist. Wer BioShock: The Collection kauft, bekommt aber alle Spiele inklusive aller Story-DLCs. Ansonsten kann man auch weiterhin alle Titel über Steam einzeln kaufen und bekommt dann beide Fassungen - soweit vorhanden. Upgrade für Boxed-Version und Games for Windows Während die Upgrades für Steam-Spieler automatisch laufen, ist die Sache bei Kunden von Retail-Versionen oder Bioshock 2 für Games for Windows schon etwas schwerer. 2K Games hat einen Blogeintrag veröffentlicht, der erklärt, das sich Käufer von Bioshock 1 mit einer Original-Rechnung und den Details zu ihrem Steam-Account bitte an das Support-Team wenden sollen. Wer seine Games-for-Windows-Version von Bioshock 2 auf Steam übertragen will, findet beim 2K-Support ebenfalls Unterstützung. Systemanforderungen für Bioshock: The Collection Minimale Hardware: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit. Platform Update for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Processor: Intel E6750 Core 2 Duo 2.66 GHz / AMD Athlon X2 2.7 GHZ Memory: 4 GB Hard Drive: BioShock 25GB; BioShock 2 25GB; BioShock Infinite 20GB; Total for all three games 70GB Video Card: DirectX11 Compatible, AMD Radeon HD 7770 / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Sound Card: DirectX Compatible Sound Device Other Requirements: Software installations required including DirectX and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 & 2012 Redistributable Package.

So wie ich das verstanden habe, wohl nicht - man muss es zum Release der Remastered Edition bereits in seiner Bibliothek haben, dann erhält man den DLC auch für das HD Bioshock2. Kauft man es danach, erhält man den DLC nur für das normale BioShock2 und müsste ihn für HDBS2 erneut kaufen. Ich bin mal lieber auf Nummer Sicher gegangen und hab den DLC noch schnell nachgekauft ;)  (1)  |   (1) Kaimanic #9 | 10.

How to prevent .NET Garbage collections with the TryStartNoGCRegion API Pauses are a known problem in runtimes that have a Garbage Collector (GC), such as Java or .NET. GC Pauses can last several milliseconds, during which your application is blocked or suspended. One way you can alleviate the pauses is to modify your code so that it doesn’t allocate, i.e., so the GC has nothing to do. But this can require lots of work and you really have to understand the runtime as many allocations are hidden. Another technique is to temporarily suspend the GC, during a critical region of your code where you don’t want any pauses and then start it up again afterwards. This is exactly what the TryStartNoGCRegion API (added in .NET 4.6) allows you to do. From the MSDN docs: Attempts to disallow garbage collection during the execution of a critical path if a specified amount of memory is available. TryStartNoGCRegion in Action To see how the API works, I ran some simple tests using the .NET GC Workstation mode, on a 32-bit CPU. The tests simply call TryStartNoGCRegion and then verify how much memory can be allocated before a Collection happens. The code is available if you want to try it out for yourself. Test 1: Regular Allocation, TryStartNoGCRegion Not Called You can see that a garbage collection happens after the 2nd allocation (indicated by “**”): Prevent GC: False, Over Allocate: False
Allocated:   3.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   6.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1, **
Allocated:   9.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1,
Allocated:  12.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1,
Allocated:  15.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1, Test 2: TryStartNoGCRegion(..) with Size Set to 15MB Here, we see that despite allocating the same amount as in the first test, no garbage collections are triggered during the run. Prevent GC: True, Over Allocate: False
TryStartNoGCRegion: Size=15 MB (15,360 K or 15,728,640 bytes) SUCCEEDED
Allocated:   3.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   6.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   9.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  12.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  15.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0, Test 3: TryStartNoGCRegion(..) Size of 15MB, But Allocating More Than 15MB Finally, we see that once we’ve allocated more than the size we asked for, the mode switches from NoGCRegion to Interactive and garbage collections can now happen. Prevent GC: True, Over Allocate: True
TryStartNoGCRegion: Size=15 MB (15,360 K or 15,728,640 bytes) SUCCEEDED
Allocated:   3.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   6.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   9.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  12.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  15.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  18.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  21.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1, **
Allocated:  24.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1,
Allocated:  27.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 2, Gen1: 2, Gen2: 2, **
Allocated:  30.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 2, Gen1: 2, Gen2: 2, So this shows that at least in the simple test we’ve done, the API works as advertised. As long as you don’t subsequently allocate more memory than you asked for, no Garbage Collections will take place. Object Size However, there are a few caveats when using TryStartNoGCRegion, the first of which is that you are required to know up-front, the total size in bytes of the objects you will be allocating. As we’ve seen previously, if you allocate more than totalSize bytes, the No GC Region will no longer be active and it will then be possible for garbage collections to happen. It’s not straight forward to get the size of an object in .NET, it’s a managed-runtime and it tries its best to hide that sort of detail from you. To further complicate matters, it varies depending on the CPU architecture and even the version of the runtime. But you do have a few options: Guess?! Search on Stack Overflow Start-up WinDbg and use the !objsize command on a memory dump of your process Get a estimate using the technique that Jon Skeet proposes Use DotNetEx, which relies on inspecting the internal fields of the CLR object Personally, I would go with a variation of 3), use WinDbg, but automate it using the excellent CLRMD C# library. Segment Size Update: It turns out that I completely missed the section on segment sizes on the MSDN page, thanks to Maoni for pointing this out to me. In the section on “Generations”, there is the following chart (which fortunately correlates with my findings below): However even when you know how many bytes will be allocated within the No GC Region, you still need to ensure that it’s less that the maximum amount allowed, because if you specify a value too large an ArgumentOutOfRangeException exception is thrown. From the MSDN docs (emphasis mine): The amount of memory in bytes to allocate without triggering a garbage collection. It must be less than or equal to the size of an ephemeral segment. For information on the size of an ephemeral segment, see the “Ephemeral generations and segments” section in the Fundamentals of Garbage Collection article. However if you visit the linked article on GC Fundamentals, it has no exact figure for the size of an ephemeral segment, it does however have this stark warning: Important The size of segments allocated by the garbage collector is implementation-specific and is subject to change at any time, including in periodic updates. Your app should never make assumptions about or depend on a particular segment size, nor should it attempt to configure the amount of memory available for segment allocations. Excellent, that’s very helpful!? So let me get this straight, to prevent TryStartNoGCRegion from throwing an exception, we have to pass in a totalSize value that isn’t larger than the size of an ephemeral segment, but we’re not allowed to know the actual value of an ephemeral segment, in-case we assume too much!! So where does that leave us? Well fortunately, it’s possible to figure out the size of an ephemeral or Small Object Heap (SOH) segment using either VMMap, or the previously mentioned CLRMD library (code sample available). Here are the results I got with the .NET Framework 4.6.1, running on a 4 Core (HT) - Intel® Core™ i7-4800MQ, i.e., Environment.ProcessorCount = 8. If you click on the links for each row heading, you can see the full breakdown as reported by VMMap. GC Mode CPU Arch SOH Segment LOH Segment Initial GC Size Largest No GC Region totalSize value Workstation 32-bit 16 MB 16 MB 32 MB 16 MB Workstation 64-bit 256 MB 128 MB 384 MB 244 MB Server 32-bit 32 MB 16 MB 384 MB 256 MB Server 64-bit 2,048 MB 256 MB 18,423 MB 16,384 MB The final column is the largest totalSize value that can be passed into TryStartNoGCRegion(long totalSize), this was found by experimentation/trial-and-error. Note: The main difference between Server and Workstation is that in Workstation mode, there is only one heap, whereas in Server mode, there is one heap per logical CPU. TryStartNoGCRegion Under-the-hood What’s nice is that the entire feature is in a single Github commit, so it’s easy to see what code changes were made: Around half of the files modified (listed below) are the changes needed to set-up the plumbing and error handling involved in adding a API to the System.GC class, they also give an interesting overview of what’s involved in having the external C# code talk to the internal C++ code in the CLR (click on a link to go directly to the diff): src/mscorlib/src/System/GC.cs src/mscorlib/src/System/Runtime/GcSettings.cs src/vm/comutilnative.cpp src/vm/comutilnative.h src/vm/ecalllist.h The rest of the changes are where the actual work takes place, with all the significant heavy-lifting happening in gc.cpp: src/gc/gc.cpp src/gc/gc.h src/gc/gcimpl.h src/gc/gcpriv.h TryStartNoGCRegion Implementation When you call TryStartNoGCRegion, the following things happen: The maximum required heap sizes are calculated based on the totalSize parameter passed in. These calculations take place in gc_heap::prepare_for_no_gc_region If the current heaps aren’t large enough to accommodate the new value, they are re-sized. To achieve this, a full collection is triggered (see GCHeap::StartNoGCRegion) Note: Due to the way the GC uses segments, it won’t always allocate memory. It will however ensure that it reserves the maximum amount of memory required, so that it can be committed when actually needed. Then next time the GC wants to perform a collection, it checks: Is the current mode set to No GC Region By checking gc_heap::settings.pause_mode == pause_no_gc, relevant code here Can we stay in the No GC Region mode This is done by calling gc_heap::should_proceed_for_no_gc(), which performs a sanity-check to ensure that we haven’t allocated more than the # of bytes we asked for when TryStartNoGCRegion was set-up If 1) and 2) are both true, then a collection does not take place because the GC knows that it has already reserved enough memory to fulfil future allocations, so it doesn’t need to clean-up any existing garbage to make space. Further Reading You can now tell the .NET GC to stop collecting during critical code paths Prevent GC Collections In Certain Spots To Improve Performance So, what’s new in the CLR 2.0 GC? How does the GC work and what are the sizes of the different generations? .NET Memory usage – A restaurant analogy The post Preventing .NET Garbage Collections with the TryStartNoGCRegion API appeared first on my blog Performance is a Feature!

Berkeley, NBER, and WCEG :: 2016-09-09 :: http://tinyurl.com/dl20160909b | https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-productivity-puzzle-how-can-we-speed-up-the-growth-of-the-economy/ The productivity puzzle: How can we speed up the growth of the economy? What Are We Talking About Here? Perceived poor performance of the American economy. Measurement issues are fascinating and important, but largely orthogonal to perceived poor performance. Slow growth in overall productivity only one and not the most important aspect of perceived poor performance: Inequality. Declining mobility. Millennials. And they have, of course, been offset by the enormous decline in what can only be called caste privilege. Eight Things Are Going On Always: the problems of measuring economic growth in productivity levels and living standards Since the 1920s: the problems of the shift to information goods—non-excludable and personalized And four more things: The post-1973 productivity slowdown The post-1995 productivity speedup The post-2004 second slowdown The post-2008 catastrophe of what we will soon be calling “the Longer Depression” Plus: reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible, and may not be the best policy even if it is possible Plus: what is it reasonable that we should expect out of the growth process? Problem: Simply Assessing Economic Growth Are we, notionally: Measuring growth by taking today's median income, and setting it equal to that multiple of median income in the past that would provide equivalent value? Measuring growth by taking that fraction of today's median income that is equal to median income in the past, in the sense of providing equivalent value? Year-to-year changes simply do not sum or multiply Additional inescapable questions of moral philosophy to which “shut up and calculate!” is not a proper answer Narrow utilitarianism questions: Productivity and opportunity—I’ve never been a believer in any sort of sharp distinction between “wealth” as some form of “positive liberty” and “freedom” as some form of “negative liberty”. If you’re in a locked cage and lack the money to buy a key, your freedom to buy a key is illusory Productivity and distribution: Are we average people (believers in Negishi prices: that your proper weight in the social welfare function is your lifetime wealth, or perhaps your lifetime wealth squared) Are we median people Or do we aspire to be among the Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas? Broader political economy and moral philosophy questions: Productivity and society—how much growth is needed and how much churn can be tolerated in order to avoid the disappointment of those reasonable expectations that keeps the altruistic-punishment mechanisms that maintain our sociability from going haywire? Productivity and humanity—what is the proper telos of the Sociable Language- and Tool-Using East African Plains Ape? Problem: Valuing Information Commodities When you sell a rival, excludable commodity, there is producer revenue and consumer surplus: The first—producer revenue—is what is counted in GDP The second—consumer surplus—is not counted in GDP. When you provide a non-excludable information commodity produced with enormous amounts of non-rivalry: You give away the commodity Thus all of the final value is consumer surplus: none is producer revenue. You then sell, as an ancillary service, the eyeballs and eardrums of users to advertisers: This a much smaller money flow, a much smaller share of consumer value then producer revenue is in the case of a Smithian commodity Moreover, advertising expenditures are not captured anywhere in real GDP They are an intermediate service, not a final good. How large is this? Well, how much of their recreational time are people spending engaged with such information age commodities? How much of the utility they accrue during that time is due to that engagement? There is also the "personalization" part of the information economy: getting you the information you need to purchase exactly that monopolistically competitive variant of the commodity that pleases you the most Problem: Valuing Information-Driven Personalization Henry Ford thought people got value—utility—from basic transportation: “Any color you want, as long as it is black…” Alfred P. Sloan disagreed GM and Chevy drank Ford’s milkshake Is there real value from getting people the exact monopoly-competitive variant they want? Or is it just a grift—selling people Chevy parts at 100% markup because they are under a Cadillac shell? I favor “grift”: I am more than half on Team Let’s-All-Dress-in-Identical-Blue-Overalls Myself But I do have three-touch smartphone advance ordering at the nearest Starbucks of a whole-milk triple-shot short latte with two pumps of sugarfree hazelnut syrup and extra cinnamon… The Four Trend Breaks: Magnitudes A U.S. population come 2025 of 350M… Before 1973: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $44T @2009 prices: $125K per capita Before 1995: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $28T: $80K per capita Before 2004: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $32T: $91K per capita Before 2008: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $26T: $75K per capita Now: expect real GDP come 2025 of $22T: $63K per capita Four Productivity Trend Breaks since 1973 Have Halved the Expected 2025 Productivity of the USA From $44T @2009 prices—$125K per capita—to $22T: $63K per capita That as, as Joe Biden would say, a BFD How are we to understand these four breaks in the trend of productivity growth we have seen since 1973? The First: The Drop Post-1973 The first of these trend breaks comes around 1973 It is the drop from $125K to $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices With Martin Neil Baily in the room, whatever summary I attempt to provide will be rightfully dismissed as cocksure and inadequate. So * I will just say: it’s complicated… The Second: The Jump Post-1995 * The second of these trend breaks comes in 1995 * It is the jump from $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices * Oliner and Sichel (and Fernald) and company have, I think, nailed this one to the floor… * A Fed committed to keeping deficit reduction from inducing a recession * 4% of GDP of financial flows diverted from buying government debt looking for a home * It finds a home in Silicon Valley * Just as infotech reaches a critical mass * And Intel ramps up its development pace The Third: The Drop Post-2004 The third of these trend breaks comes in 2004 It is the drop from $91K to $75K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices John Fernald and company have been working full time on trying to understand it… I would be rash and foolish to try to challenge John Fernald and company… But it’s a very big shift to happen in a very short time with no obvious system-wide shock… The Fourth: The Drop Post-2008 The fourth of these trend breaks comes in 2008 It is the drop from $75K to $63K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices It is a consequence of the Longer Depression Labor force attachment Worker skills Investment Experimentation with business models The Last of These Is Robert Barro’s “Non-Covery” We should have had substantial bounce-back to trend after September 2009. We didn’t. It’s not because the economy is incapable of reallocating resources. It reallocated resources fine away from housing and into exports and investment over 2004-2008 See? Over 2006-2008 We Reallocated Resources Out of Housing on a Huge Scale As financial markets changed their minds about risk and return in housing… We moved huge amounts of resources out of the housing-construction sector… And, smoothly, into business investment and exports. The Diagnoses of the Problem We Heard Here Yesterday… Seemed to me to focus around problems of “reallocation” and “dynamism”… Flawed in a relative neglect of the difference between a high-pressure and a low-pressure economic environment… Whether “Reallocation” Is into Unemployment or a Booming Sector Is Really Important Keynes (1936): “I defend [my policies] … as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.... If effective demand is deficient... the individual enterpriser who seeks to bring... resources into action is operating with the odds loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros.... The increment of the world’s wealth… [reduced] by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough…" Davis and von Wächter (2011): U-3<6%, mass-layoff workers lose 1.5 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings. U-3>8%, mass-layoff workers lose 3 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings Chodorow-Reich and Wieland (2016): An area with reallocation +1SD -> employment 2% lower at the end of a national recession-recovery cycle. Reallocation has no effect if it occurs during an expansion. The Problem Comes After 2008 The financial-crisis freeze-up of the economy… As housing, exports, investment collapse… And the Recovery Act is undersized by, arithmetically, a factor of 6 And Then We Hit the Economy on the Head with the Austerity Brick, Over and Over Again We also fail to restructure housing finance to encourage construction to help all those people move out of their sisters’ basements. And, with interest rates at zero, the Fed finds no way to signal exports and business investment to take up even more of the slack than they do. Can We Still Recover from the Post-2008 Disaster? We now need to start calling it: “The Longer Depression”… Back in 2009 I said that we obviously will recover, easily. Back in 2012 I said that we could recover—DeLong and Summers—straightforwardly. Now? Gerry Friedman still thinks we could do so. I’m more pessimistic: but I’m not going to argue anything with Gerry until November 15 Nevertheless: worth trying. We should, right now, be desperately trying to generate a higher-pressure economy if only just to see how much low-hanging fruit can be picked via easy aggregate demand-boosting measures Greenspan did it in 1995, and we all were very pleased that he did so. Other Policies? Reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible Reversing the causes is unlikely to be the best policy, even if it is possible However, Low-hanging fruit: Generate a high pressure economy. It might work. And it will do good anyway What else? Aside from Strive for a High-Pressure Economy and Hope, What Can We Do? Where is there low-hanging fruit? What are our value-subtracting industries? Finance (we pay 8% of GDP for net services that used to cost 3%) Health care administration (we pay 5% of GDP for services other countries pay 1% for) Mass incarceration (another 2% other countries do not pay) NIMBYism Residential (but how mportant is it outside of SF, BOS, DC?) Occupational (perhaps? More Low-Hanging Fruit Truman started the process of turning the federal government into an entity with a permanently very large military (for good and sufficient reasons, but still). Johnson set in stone the process of turning the federal government into an insurance company too. “An insurance company with a military”—that’s where we are. Is that where we should be? All Growth Comes from “Investment” of Some Kind All growth comes from somewhere: it doesn’t just precipitate out of the air. Net private investment roughly 7% of net domestic product. Other net investment-like activities of equal magnitude—figure 15% of net product devoted to growth, 10% to per capita growth The average net rate of return on those expenditures is 20%/year. There are some investment and investment-like expenditures that offer very high returns indeed. The U.S. Government Could Do Much More In a world that is increasingly non-Smithian, confining government to military, insurance, property rights, and contract enforcement is just silly—even adding in standard infrastructure. Incentivize the private creation of public and information goods: Why is the government so good at committing itself to pay money in the event of failure—loan guarantees—but not success? Prizes—cf., Michael Kremer. Platforms: Why is it Google doing Google Books? Platforms: Isn’t relying on advertising to fund write-once run-everywhere value-in-scale profoundly silly? Let’s Take the Longest Possible View… Pre-1800 (upper left point is 1800-50) “data” Periods from 1000 years down to 50 Impressive, no? This is essentially Michael Kremer’s pre-job market paper from back when Almost all growth is useful ideas Useful ideas are non-excludable Thus two heads are better than one This is not economics: this is numerology… But the basic Michael Kremer two-heads-are-better-than-one model from 1992: Estimated over the pre-1800 period Admittedly with GDP rather than population on the left-hand side Fits our current 2000-2050 forecast Moreover: this is consistent with Gordon’s view that the Second Industrial Revolution was a really big deal 1.25%/year x 100 years of extra growth Exp(1.25) = 3.5 And now that extra 3.5-fold multiplication of global GDP is over But, still, going forward, after the exhaustion of the Second Industrial Revolution. It still looks as though two heads are better than one If world population tops out and stabilizes at 9B in 2050 Then will world real GDP growth stabilize at 6%/year? Thus we have powerful reasons to believe that economic growth is not over—that human brains will continue to be a very valuable idea-generating resource. Provided, of course, we do not blow up the planet. Or cook it. J.

In the latest and most concrete example of the tech industry elite's distaste for Donald Trump, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz has pledged $20 million to help Hillary Clinton win the presidency and defeat the Republican presidential nominee. In a Medium post late Thursday, Moskovitz wrote that he and his wife, Cari Tuna, have never given to a presidential candidate before but felt "compelled to act" given the stakes in November's election. "We cannot ignore the remarkable alignment between these two visions for society and the choices in this year's election," he wrote. "The Republican Party, and Donald Trump in particular, is running on a zero-sum vision, stressing a false contest between their constituency and the rest of the world." Moskovitz, who was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard, has a net worth of $10.5 billion, according to Forbes. In 2008, he left Facebook to co-found Asana, a San Francisco-based maker of work-collaboration software, and is its chief executive. READ MORE: * Hillary Clinton's campaign stands aside * Donald Trump alludes to shooting Hillary Clinton * Yes, Donald Trump has small hands REUTERS Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton calls her Republican rival Donald Trump unpatriotic for "trash talking" U.S. generals and called his candidacy a threat to the United States.   In July, Moskovitz was one of about 150 tech CEOs, investors, academics and others who signed an open letter calling Trump "a disaster for innovation." The tech industry has for the most part been no friend to Trump, speaking out loudly against the candidate's immigration policies and more. While tech executives such as Apple CEO Tim Cook have held fundraisers for Clinton, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich canceled a planned fundraiser for Trump in June. And Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman, a Republican, has also started stumping for Clinton. One of Trump's only high-profile supporters from the tech industry is billionaire entrepreneur, investor and longtime libertarian Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies. Thiel, who was an early investor in Facebook and sits on its board, was a California delegate for Trump at the Republican National Convention. He gave a prime-time speech at the RNC in July in which he said he agreed with Trump that "it's time to end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country." In addition, Thiel wrote in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this week that "Trump's heretical denial of Republican dogma about government incapacity is exactly what we need to move the party - and the country - in a new direction." CARLO ALLEGRI/REUTERS Is Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump a danger to the IT industry? With their donation, Moskovitz and Tuna - a former reporter who now heads Good Ventures, the couple's philanthropic foundation - become the second-largest contributors to the Democrats in this election after hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, according to The Associated Press. OpenSecrets.org, the Center for Responsive Politics website that tracks contributions, shows that Steyer has given nearly $40 million to Democrats and liberals in this election cycle. Thiel has given $2 million to Republicans, the site shows. Moskovitz said the money will go to the Clinton campaign, other Democratic Party committees, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Victory Fund, MoveOn.org, Color of Change and others. "We hope these efforts make it a little more likely that Secretary Clinton is able to pursue the agenda she's outlined, and serve as a signal to the Republican Party that by running this kind of campaign - one built on fear and hostility - and supporting this kind of candidate, they compel people to act in response," he wrote.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Sep 11, 2016 at 1:41PM Image source: Getty Images. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is certainly an alluring company right now. Its shares have gained more than 100% year-to-date, with much of the bullish sentiment riding on the growing popularity and opportunity behind virtual reality. To help put the recent stock run in perspective -- and to point out some potential pitfalls at the company -- let's take a look at three charts that paint a fuller picture of AMD and the state of its business. Revenue has fallen fast, but it's improving Longtime AMD shareholders will know that the company's revenue has been anything but encouraging over the past few years. Since 2014, the top line has declined by about 39% from its high. Data by YCharts. The main reason for the decline came from slowing sales of AMD's PC processors, particularly in notebooks. PC chips are among the company's biggest revenue drivers, and a slowdown in the PC market over the past few years has hurt AMD tremendously. Despite the bad times, the company is starting to see revenue growth return, thanks to increased demand for chips and a new licensing deal with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology. The latter adds about $52 million to AMD's revenue this year, while the former should help the company's long-term prospects. AMD certainly isn't out of the woods yet, and investors will need to see the company deliver on promising new chips (like its upcoming Zen processor for servers) and new GPUs to see if the recent rebound is sustainable.  This is changing AMD's focus  A couple of years ago, the company highlighted a few key areas that it would pursue in order to turn around its business. One of those areas of focus is what the company calls immersive platforms, which include PC components and the growing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) markets.  The total addressable market for immersive platforms is $20 billion, according to the company, and much of that will come from the AR and VR segments.  AMD CTO Mark Papermaster highlighted the company's focus on boosting VR adoption rates in a recent interview with TechRadar, saying: At AMD, we frankly aim to directly impact that adoption rate. That's why, for instance, we brought that $200 price point for the RX 480. That broke the paradigm -- that is a VR-ready graphics card. You can have a wonderful VR experience, 90 frames per second, very low latency with that graphics card. The graph below shows exactly why AMD is pinning some of its future revenue prospects on the AR and VR markets -- because they'll be worth potentially $150 billion by 2020. Image source: Digi-Capital. AR and VR certainly aren't the only markets that AMD is focusing on, of course, but with immersive platforms marked as one of the top three focuses for the company over the next few years, it's clear the company is expecting its GPUs to be a major part of its growth story. This stock is on the move  It's hard to write an article showing some of the most important AMD charts without including the company's massive bull run this year. The stock has already more than doubled in 2016, with a nearly 220% gain over the past 12 months.   Data by YCharts. Management and shareholders hope that the upcoming Zen release could steal some of the $18 billion server market away from rival Intel. The company says it has already secured several design wins with original equipment manufacturers and that it will officially launch the chip in the first half of 2017. The bottom line AMD certainly has a lot going for it in the GPU, VR, and PC markets -- management is wisely pursuing new areas of growth and re-entering markets where they believe the company can succeed (like server processors). But without stable revenue, the incredible share price gains would make me hesitant to invest in the company right now. It definitely appears that there are brighter days ahead for the company, but investors should be careful not to overestimate the success AMD will enjoy based on such early efforts with little to show for them.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.
