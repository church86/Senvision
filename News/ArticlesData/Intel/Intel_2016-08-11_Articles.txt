News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Re-examining the unusual frame time results in our Radeon RX 470 review by Jeff Kampman  1:33 PM on August 12, 2016 It's never fun to admit a mistake, but we made a big one while writing our recent Radeon RX 470 review. That piece was our first time out on a new test rig that included an Intel Core i7-6700K CPU and an ASRock Z170 Extreme7+ motherboard. Once we got that system up and running, it delivered some weird-looking frame time numbers with some games. For example, the spikiness of the frame-time plot below didn't match any test data we had ever gathered before for Grand Theft Auto V, and we puzzled over those strange results for some time. We decided to go ahead and publish them anyway after doing some extended troubleshooting without seeing any improvement. Compare that to a more typical GTA V result from our Radeon RX 480 review, as demonstrated by three GeForce cards running on an X99 testbed: The spikiness caused by what turned out to be high deferred procedure call (or DPC) latency didn't seem to affect average framerates much (save one major exception), but it did worsen our 99th-percentile frame time numbers considerably. Given how much we use those 99th-percentile numbers in formulating other parts of our conclusions, especially value plots, the error introduced this way had considerable negative effects on the accuracy of several key parts of our review. The net effect of this error led us to wrongly conclude that the Radeon RX 480 8GB and the Radeon RX 470 were closely matched in performance, when in fact they're quite different. Upon reflection, we should have stopped the RX 470 review at that point to try and figure out exactly what was going on, but the pressure of deadlines got the better of us. When these weird frame-time plots appeared once more in the preliminary testing work for our review of the Radeon RX 460, however, we had to acknowlege that something unusual was going on. Of course, that also meant that our published RX 470 review had problems that we had to deal with. We believe that in the interest of full transparency, it's important to explain exactly what happened, be clear about how we messed up, and resolve not to make the same mistakes in the future. The issue While I was testing the Radeon RX 460 and tearing my hair out over the wild frame time plots our cards were generating, TR code wizard Bruno "morphine" Ferreira brought the possibility of high DPC latency to my attention. DPC latency is usually of interest to musicians running digital audio workstations, where consistently minimal input lag is critical. Bruno pointed me to the LatencyMon app, which keeps an eye on DPC performance and warns of any issues, as a way of figuring out whether DPC latency was the root cause of this problem. LatencyMon thinks something is up with my main desktop. I'll have to look into it soon. I didn't capture any screenshots during my frenzied troubleshooting, but LatencyMon did show that our test rig wasn't servicing DPC requests promptly. Wireless networking drivers are generally considered the first place to look when troubleshooting DPC issues, and I use an Intel Wireless-N 6205 card in our test system. Oops. Even after disabling that wireless card, however, the issue persisted. After killing every potential bit of software that might have been causing the problem without getting any improvements, I took Bruno's suggestion of updating our motherboard's firmware. "The BIOS can't possibly be the cause!" I thought to myself smugly. Pride goeth before a fall, of course, and the DPC latency issue vanished with the new ASRock firmware installed. The frame-time plots for GTA V began to resemble the flat, tight lines we've come to expect with modern hardware. I had to quash the urge to drive over the motherboard a few times and burn the remains before coming to grips with the fact that I would have to throw out large amounts of testing data. So what happened? You see, ASRock sent us its Z170 Extreme7+ board during a brief period in which the company was promoting its ability to overclock locked Intel CPUs with a beta BIOS. I had hoped to explore that possibility with some ASRock motherboards and cheap CPUs, but Intel swiftly put the kibosh on the concept. We got busy with other work, and the beta firmware remained on the motherboard through our first attempts to test graphics cards with it. I don't know precisely what was wrong with this beta firmware that was causing it to wreak havoc on DPC latency, but updating the firmware did fix it, so Occam's razor suggests something weird was going on. The fallout Having solved the underlying problem, I now had to contend with the fact that I had published a very public and widely-read review that contained what seemed like reams of contaminated data. To see just how wrong I had been in my conclusions, I retested every title we had slated for our RX 470 and RX 460 reviews on our ASRock test rig, using the same settings we had initially chosen for our reviews. As it turns out, high DPC latency doesn't affect every game equally, or at least not in a way that shows up in our frame-time numbers. While GTA V, Hitman, and Rise of the Tomb Raider all showed significant changes in average FPS and 99th-percentile frame times after a retest on the updated hardware,  Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 did not. That second trio of games certainly felt more responsive to input after the critical firmware update, but the data they generated wasn't meaningfully different. We're talking fractions of milliseconds of difference in before-and-after testing, and those deltas are almost certainly imperceptible in real-life gaming. Given that behavior, we're confident that the numbers we generated for Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 are representative of the performance of the Radeon RX 460, the Radeon RX 470, and the other cards we tested in those reviews.  The resolution Given the large differences in performance we saw with GTA V, Hitman, and RoTR, the only acceptable way to fix our mistake was to retest all of the cards in our Radeon RX 470 review from the ground up with those games. We've done that now, and as a bonus, we did that retesting with the same data-collection methods we just premiered in our RX 460 review. As a result, we now have Doom Vulkan and OpenGL numbers for the RX 470 and RX 480, plus DirectX 12 numbers for Rise of the Tomb Raider and Hitman. We've also extensively re-written the conclusion of our Radeon RX 470 review to account for this new data, much in the same way that we crunched our results for the Radeon RX 460 and friends. We've accounted for the differences in our results there, so I'd encourage you to go read up on what changed. If you read our original Radeon RX 470 review, we're deeply sorry to have misinformed you. We also extend our sincerest apologies to everybody at AMD and Nvidia for presenting incorrect information and misguided conclusions about their products. In the future, we'll strive to be both correct and swift with our reviews, but we also won't hesitate to delay a piece when clear warning flags are evident. We hope this clarification reinforces your trust in The Tech Report's reporting. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a comment below or email me directly.

The reason is simple: NVIDIA’s technology is being used in far more game-changing devices, which puts it at the forefront of technological innovation for the next several years. From CNBC: Nvidia’s semiconductors are powering innovation in some of the world’s fastest growing industries. Its core graphics processing units (GPUs) enable popular video games like “Battlefield 4” and “Call of Duty: Black Ops III.” And as computing rapidly evolves in the cloud and Internet of Things, Nvidia’s technology is being adopted by companies focused on big data, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Brian Alger, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, has been bullish on the stock for a while. “They’re in several massive growth markets where they have differentiated solutions, very few competitors and are executing extremely well,” Alger said. Massive growth markets and very few competitors? That’s how people were talking about Intel in the late 90s, when the company went from an unknown to one of the faces of the technological revolution. When it comes to what remains of its competition, well, NVIDIA investors shouldn’t be worried. AMD no longer poses much of a threat. That company has lost money each of the past four years and, when it comes to Nvidia’s newer businesses, there aren’t many rivals. Again, this sounds exactly like Intel when it first began taking off. Back then, a company called Cyrix was making processors too. But they fizzled and went out of business entirely, leaving Intel as the only game in town. When it comes to artificial intelligence, NVIDIA isn’t just the clear leader. They’re the only name anyone of consequence in the space even thinks about. Nvidia is selling its technology into data centers, which are rapidly moving towards machine learning and artificial intelligence. Within data centers, Nvidia has gained traction in recent years helping businesses process mounds of data coming from all the devices connected to the Internet. The next step is training those machines through algorithms to learn like humans. … Nvidia “anticipated the emergence of these applications and invested in these applications and helped develop them, whereas their main competitor AMD was more constrained and resource challenged,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners. He has a buy rating on the stock and a $64 price target. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said in a podcast last month that Nvidia has “seemingly overnight” become the market leader in chips used for artificial intelligence. “Every sharp AI software entrepreneur that comes in here is now building on top of Nvidia’s chips,” Andreessen said. Automakers, too, are using NVIDIA’s technology in their audio/video systems. And NVIDIA leads the way in autonomous driving chips as well. That’s a niche market now, but will explode tenfold in the coming years, say analysts. Once upon a time, the only people who’d heard of NVIDIA were PC gamers looking to max out the high-resolution graphics performance of their gaming rigs. Now, the company has made it to the big time, and seems to have a date with destiny: a seat at the table next to Intel as microchip royalty. NVIDIA shares rose $2.54 (+4.25%) to $62.24 in Friday afternoon trading. NVDA has gained 89% year-to-date, making it the second best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016.

Updated August 12, 2016 10:42AM SHARE ALSO SEE Microsoft Windows 10 Windows 7 Windows 8.1 Intel Skylake Kaby Lake AMD Operating System Upgrade Enterprise IT Top Tech News Perhaps bowing to popular demand, Microsoft this week backed off a previous announcement that it would end support for some machines running its Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems next year. On its blog, Microsoft said it will patch those two operating systems on PCs that run Intel’s Skylake chip until 2020 in the case of Windows 7 and 2023 in the case of Windows 8.1. However, in January, Microsoft said it would end most support on the two operating systems next July if they were running on machines equipped with Intel's Skylake line of processors. "We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates," wrote Shad Larsen, a director of Windows business planning, on a Microsoft blog. "We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes [to Windows 10]." Exempt List Microsoft referred to the deadline extension as a clarification of its previous announcement. Microsoft initially attributed the decision to end support to Windows 7 because of its age and the headaches that that Microsoft and original equipment manufacturers would face ensuring that Windows 7, which debuted in 2009, was running on Intel's latest architecture. The company backed off that announcement in March, saying that it was extending the support exit date by a year, to July 18, 2018. After that date, the company and its computer-making partners would not guarantee that they would revise device drivers to support Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer hardware. The end-of-support dates are now January 14, 2020 for Windows 7 and January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1. After the new deadlines, Skylake-powered PCs on a list of exempt devices compiled by Microsoft will only get patches for the most serious flaws. Skylake devices not on that exempt list won’t receive those patches. The initial end-of-support dates were decried by many computer users who felt Microsoft was using them to force customers into moving to the Windows 10 operating system. Managing Migration The curtailing of support hasn't been popular with computer makers, either. Earlier this year, Lenovo suggested that it didn’t agree with the deadline, possibly sensing that customers would hesitate to buy new computers knowing that they would have to migrate to Windows 10 by mid-2017. Microsoft still plans to support only Windows 10 on Intel's Skylake successor, an architecture called Kaby Lake, and on AMD's next-generation Bristol Ridge chip. Additionally, Microsoft said that it’s working with Intel to better optimize Windows 10 for the latest processors. That appears to mean that improving the hardware for older operating systems will eventually make less sense. "This change is designed to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10," according to Larsen. "We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software."

Spend it on essential IP Seagate Nytro M.2 card 12 Aug 2016 at 16:02, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp, Dell Recent Articles Intel punches out data centre flash cardlet NYSE halts trading in Violin Memory shares Datto launches backup and disaster recovery technology to combat ransomware Analysis As well as launching several new flash products, Seagate revealed the four pillars of its flash product strategy at the August 9-11 Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara. These were: Foundry independence Essential IP for system-wide use of flash Portfolio expansion Top-level cloud supplier Let's have a waltz around the Seagate flash dance floor to explore these four areas. The foundry independence point confirms that Seagate has no interest in integrating a foundry-level, NAND chip-making business into its existing operation. As has been pointed out many times before, this vertically integrated disk drive manufacturer sees no benefit to it of becoming a vertically integrated flash drive supplier. Its number-crunchers must have pushed numbers through their spreadsheets to explore the financial implications and, we presume, concluded that Seagate can make more money by deploying its capital and credit resources in building disk drives rather than by siphoning some off into setting up a vertically integrated NAND business by, for example, buying SK- Hynix, or partnering Intel/Micron or Samsung. It will buy NAND chips on the open market or via supply deals with flash fabbers such as Micron, with whom it has a relationship. A partnership with Toshiba is ruled out because WD got there first by buying Toshiba’s foundry partner, SanDisk. We assume here that Seagate’s flash strategy is actually its general non-volatile memory strategy and includes post-flash technologies such as XPoint in its scope. System-wide flash IP Pillar two is gaining essential IP for the system-wide use of flash. This is interesting. Let’s see what it might mean. Flash can be deployed in servers in: NVDIMM format, PCIe card format, Standard 2.5-inch or, 3.5-inch disk bay format with SATA, SAS or NVMe connectivity, Disk drive caching use, In storage arrays in a proprietary card format as used by DSSD, Pure Storage’s FlashBlade or Violin Memory. Flash use in storage array controllers is pretty much the same as its use in servers, so we’ll ignore that. Providing proprietary memory card designs to individual OEMs doesn’t seem like a viable business for Seagate so we’ll forget that, which leaves us with five areas of system-wide use. NVDIMM It does not produce NVDIMM-F flash, and that might be an area where it could provide expertise, if it has something both Netlist and Diablo don't have. But Micron might prefer to go straight to QuantX (XPoint) NVDIMM-F products from its existing battery-backed NVDIMM-N products rather than devise its version of Diablo/Netlist NVDIMM-F technology. 2.5-inch disk bays This is a hotly contested area, the sweet spot of the SSD industry, with mature products using SATA, SAS and NVMe interfaces and getting regularly refreshed as as planar NAND shrinks and 3D NAND adds layers. There's little change of Seagate getting a significant edge here, unless perhaps it builds XPoint SSDs using Micron QuantX technology. This seems a pretty safe bet. 3.5-inch disk bays The general use of flash in disk bay slots as pseudo-disk using SATA, SAS or NVMe is standard stuff but Seagate has its ClusterStor and DotHill storage array business and has just demonstrated 60TB SSDs in the 3.5-inch disk bay format. It could sell 60TB SSDs to cloud storage providers and hyper-scalers who want faster-than-disk access to large amounts of data and build systems from the component level upwards. It could also sell drive arrays populated with 60TB SSDs to managed service providers and not so big hyper-scalers. The management of such arrays to minimise wear and provide consistent QoS could provide an IP opportunity to Seagate. SSD controller provision is another matter. Seagate has disk drive controller IP, some of whose aspects it might be able to re-use with NAND. The ClusterStor and DotHill arrays might get NVMe over fabrics-class interconnects added to them to radically lower network access latency, particularly any forthcoming flash versions of those arrays. The operation of Lustre software on all-flash arrays is another area where someone could add IP value, although that is an open source area. The wild card here us Seagate's Kinetic disk business, the development of direct, Ethernet-accessed drives implementing an object storage scheme. Could a Kinetic SSD concept make sense? (That would get rid of object storage's reputation for slow speed.) Disk drive caching Seagate has been the main proponent of using flash as a disk drive cache and so speeding access. This can be expected to continue. Portfolio expansion Before and over the course of the Flash Memory Summit Seagate announced; 60TB 3.5-inch SSD Nytro NVMe drive Nytro SATA SSD 2TB M.2 format drive It already had SAS SSDs and Flash Accelerator cards. Conceivably it's missing NVDIMM format drives and should, we expect, get access to Micron QuantX chips and start developing XPoint-based drives as go-faster follow-ons to SATA, SAS, and NVMe SSDs in their varying formats, where it makes sense. This is something WD doesn't have, SanDisk's ReRAM technology not being ready to productise yet. We don't see Seagate adding storage-class memory system software IP, it not having any expertise in that area. This is deep OS internals work. Top-level cloud supplier Seagate markets its wares to private, hybrid and public cloud service providers. We can surely expect it to use its existing programs to pump flash products to its existing cloud storage customers and new ones. That's fine and dandy, but doesn't seem to have scope for anything that significant in itself.

That scored 7/10, and was praised for its smooth, flexible hinge, the slick Chrome OS, and while it's not without its issues, we deemed it stonkingly good value for money. Read our full Lenovo N20 review here What you said: The Lenovo N22 holds an impressive 4.6/5 score on Amazon, based on 68 user reviews.

We had this model's little sibling in for review and we really liked it. We particularly liked the fact that at 14-inches it was thin and portable but didn't sacrifice a good screen for the cause. The model we had to test kept up with our needs despite the smaller Intel Core i3 processor. It's even better then, that the Ideapad on offer here has a larger Intel Core i5 processor. Add on the already equipped SSD and this is a seriously speedy machine. Buy now: Lenovo Ideapad 510s for £529 from Very - saving £70 How good a deal is this? The Lenovo Ideapad 510s has a heap of great features including an Intel Core i5 processor, an SSD and a full HD anti glare screen.

This came as a surprise to many users and businesses, as Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported by the company. In fact, Windows 8.1 is still on its general support schedule while Windows 7 is on extended support already. Many users saw this as another attempt by Microsoft to get customers to upgrade to Windows 10 or buy devices that ship with Windows 10 installed as the operating system. Back then, Microsoft wanted to support Intel Skylake processors only on a selection of business devices, and only until mid-2017. Microsoft to support Skylake on Windows 7 and 8.1 after all Microsoft published an update to its "silicon support policy" for Windows yesterday on the official Windows blog. The main change is that Microsoft, listening to feedback and all, decided to extend the support policy for 6th generation Intel Core (Skylake) processors to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This means that Skylake processors are supported on Windows 7 until January 14, 2020, and on Windows 8.1 until January 10, 2023. According to Microsoft, the change was made possible by Intel and OEM partners who "will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1". What this does not mean however is that future platforms, Intel's upcoming 7th generation Kaby Lake and AMD's 7th generation processors like Bristol Ridge will also be supported on previous versions of Windows. Microsoft states that these 7th generation processor families will only be supported on Windows 10, and that all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10. It is still unclear what "not supported" means practically. Does it mean that Windows 7 or 8.1 operating systems cannot be installed on devices running 7th generation processors? Or is support merely a factor in the business world, with Microsoft not support systems running these processors? If it is the former, it would mean that Microsoft would block customers from installing a previous version of Windows on devices running these processors. Customers affected by this would have two options: install Windows 10, or switch to another operating system supporting these processors (which most likely means a Linux variant).   Summary Article Name Microsoft to support Skylake on Windows 7 and 8.1 after all Description Microsoft reversed the decision to support Intel Skylake processors only on devices running Windows 10 after July 17, 2018.

Seams I am actually seeing it in action. I just posted this on MDL forum, with almost no good replies: "Hi Folks, I have Windows 10 on my main NVMe SSD, but I also have a working SATA SSD which I want to install Windows 7 on it and sometime use as a secondary OS. I applied a fully updated Windows 7 install.wim to a primary partition on the SATA SSD and also added the boot files: dism /apply-image /imagefile:X:\install.wim /index:1 /Applydir:I:\ bcdboot.exe" I:\Windows /s I: /f BIOS Now the problem. When I boot to the SATA SSD for the first time, it sticks on 69% when recognising my devices. I even disconnected any external devices, graphics card, wireless adapter, etc. Nothing helped. I want Windows 7! Using an ASUS Z170-PRO motherboard with the latest BIOS, Intel Core i7-6700K CPU, 16 GB Kingston HyperX Savage 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 2400 C9 memory, and an EVGA GeForce GTX 970 FTW GAMING ACX 2.0 graphics card. The NVMe is a Samsung 512GB 950 Pro M.2 NVMe Internal SSD. (Windows 10). I am also using an OCZ Vertex 3 120GB SATA III SSD for my Windows 7 installation. I can install Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 on the SATA SSD and boot to it, with all my devices connected without any issue. So any idea about why Windows 7 setup cannot continue after applying install.wim and rebooting? I did install Windows 7 in the same way on lots of other computers without any problem. Thanks so much for any possible help." So... Maybe M$ do not want us to install Windows 7 on Skylake systems after all... Reply Arthur August 15, 2016 at 7:28 am # > Maybe MS do not want us to install Windows 7 on Skylake systems after all... Or could it be because Windows 7 is an ancient operating system and doesn't include NVMe SSD support out-of-the-box? Have you integrated the KB2990941 hotfix into your install.wim? Maybe it's just me, but if you want to use the latest hardware it makes sense to use the latest OS. Reply joncr August 12, 2016 at 2:35 pm # No USB 3 drivers in Win7/Win7SP1, so it's still awkward to install on USB3-only devices with no CD/DVD drives, such as newish Skylake hardware. Reply Daniel August 13, 2016 at 2:54 am # You can integrate USB 3 drivers into an ISO of windows 7. I used MSMG ToolKit to do this, made an ISO of that and then used Rufus to put it on a USB stick. Reply Dave August 12, 2016 at 2:50 pm # Someone on here once said Skylake has some kind of badness built-in, that you wouldn't really want given the choice. Anyone know the tinfoil disadvantages of Skylake? Reply The Flash August 17, 2016 at 1:24 pm # Yeah, Intel CPUs in general have all sorts of things snuck in them, but I don't what what bad thing was introduced in Skylake though. That's why I just stick with AMD. Reply Guest703 August 12, 2016 at 4:02 pm # What about 8.0? I don't want the spyware that the 8.1 patch introduces, and 7.x is crap compared with Windows 8. Reply Liv August 12, 2016 at 4:24 pm # Windows 8.0 is officially unsupported by Microsoft and to me Windows 7 is way better than Windows 8/8.1 ever drempt of being. Reply T J August 12, 2016 at 5:04 pm # @ Liv "Windows 7 is way better than Windows 8/8.1 ever dreamt of being" Agreed with 5 up votes for you :-) George August 12, 2016 at 6:55 pm # I don't think 8.0 is unsupported, it shares the same "end of support" dates as 8.1. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet Liv August 12, 2016 at 9:50 pm # @ George No Windows 8.0 was officially dropped from support earlier this year. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/default.aspx?alpha=windows%208 "Customers have 24 months to move to Windows 8.1 after General Availability in order to remain supported." Gary D August 12, 2016 at 5:02 pm # @ Guest703 Win 7 = crap. Pardon ! Perhaps it is because you can not leave sticky finger marks on the screen as you can with a Win 8 touch screen. Reference Win 8.1 spying; did you not read ANY of the articles on Ghacks about blocking telemetry / spyware which Martin has blogged for the last year or so ? ! Reply Decent60 August 13, 2016 at 3:12 am # @Gary D Windows 7 supports touch screen. My mate had an AIO with touch screen so....that's a bad reason to say it's better. But over-all performance and bugs, Windows 7 has had better compared to Windows 8/8.1 MrHandsome August 12, 2016 at 6:58 pm # Its the other way around, 8.x is crap compared to 7.... unless you have a phablet. Reply 420 August 12, 2016 at 4:40 pm # M$ sure does want people to start useing linux or osx which is just as terrible if not worse with the shenanigans. Sounds to me like the only reason this was reversed is because Intel and hardware manufacturers said wtf and decided to flip the bill so M$ really could not argue at that point. Never seen a company with such a huge market share doing everything possible to put its self out of business. Reply A different Martin August 13, 2016 at 10:49 am # My guess is that it's because lots of businesses have no interest in "upgrading" to Windows 10 in the near future, and OEMs realize that they are going to lose a lot of sales of new hardware if Windows 7, and maybe Windows 8.1, are not supported on Skylake through end of life. (I was told straight out by computer support staff at a large medical research facility that a lot of the software the institution uses simply doesn't work past Windows 7 and that they're nowhere close to being ready to "upgrade" their users.) You know that big dip in traditional desktop and laptop computer sales everyone's been talking about for a while? And how Intel has slowed down its development schedule? I have a hunch it's not just because "everyone is using tablets and smartphones instead." I suspect it also correlates pretty closely with the introduction of Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10. As for me personally as a Windows 7 user, I'm still recovering from GWX PTSD -- "Get Windows 10" Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder -- and am gradually lowering my personal alert level from hyper-vigilant to merely vigilant. I'm still vetting every single update Microsoft proposes, but the night sweats have stopped. ;-) I'm fine sticking with Windows 7 for now, but if a bad Windows update slips past me and my awesome clone/backup strategy and borks my system or the hardware simply craps out and I need to get a new machine, that strikes me as a good time to move to Linux. Reply xpclient August 12, 2016 at 5:13 pm # Windows 8.1 is currently the best version IMHO. I will try to be objective. Here's why I think it's the best: Windows 8.1 has the following benefits for me over Windows 7: - USB 3.0 support. Even though Windows 7 PCs do have USB 3.0 drivers, Windows 8.1 supports USB Attached SCSI protocol which makes UASP flash drives much faster than USB 3.0 on Windows 7. UASP with USB 3.0 is a significant speed boost over USB 2.0. - USB Type C connector with KB3103696 - Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)/Bluetooth SMART support means I can use devices like Bluetooth wireless mouse which supports the Bluetooth 4.0 LE standard or LE headsets. The batteries in these devices last for a long time. - 802.11ac. With a fast 802.11ac router, 2 PCs with PCIe/NVM Express SSDs, you get amazing WiFi speeds. (OK, after doing some testing on Windows 7, it turns out, as long as you have the right drivers installed under Windows 7 and an 802.11ac router, you will get the same faster than N speeds as Windows 8 on 7 as well. It's only that Windows 7 continues to report your radio as 802.11n.) - Offloaded Data Transfers for file copying (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/ifs/offloaded-data-transfers) - More WMI classes and PowerShell cmdlets - Miracast wireless streaming to a display which 8.1 supports (although you could also use Windows 7 with Intel WiDi or buy a Chromecast dongle). But Miracast in 8.1 lets you not only mirror your display wirelessly to the second display but also extend your desktop to it. Like a wireless multiple monitors solution. - Windows 8.1 supports external manifests for application executables ("PreferExternalManifest"=dword:00000001) without any side effects of Windows 7 like the Network icon breaking. This is important if you are using a High resolution/High DPI display because Microsoft f***ed up DPI scaling with Windows 7. Windows 7 DPI scaling is broken, Windows 8.1 actually works. You can modify any app's manifest to scale it properly. - The DPI scaling engine in Windows 8.1 loads much earlier than Windows 7 so apps which load at startup are scaled properly - Windows 8.1 has better WinSxS cleanup using Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase - Chkdsk Spotfix ability, Hyper-V. Those who miss Virtual PC can get VirtualBox - Most issues on the software side were resolved for me by using third party apps - Classic Shell, 7+ Taskbar Tweaker, Classic Task Manager, Equalizer APO, Google Chrome, Everything Search, PerigeeCopy, OldNewExplorer, FileSearchEX, VistaSwitcher, Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, and reinstating Sidebar Gadgets, Classic Games, classic MSConfig, various tray applet fixes, ERUNT, AutoHotkey, EasyBCD, UxStyle plus this theme (http://winaero.com/blog/make-active-window-more-visible-on-windows-8-1-taskbar-with-pressed-button-look/), WindowsFirewallControl etc - All the Metro crap uninstalled, default programs set to Win32 apps, Group Policies to disable crap like OneDrive, Bing Search and Customer Experience Improvement Program, it is OK. - DOZENS of Registry fixes to make it work like the way I want - more like Windows XP Professional and Windows 7 so Windows 8.1 is now a pleasant and stable experience!! - Media Center is missing but Kodi is better. Between Kodi and its addons you can do everything. - Aero Glass project is there if you miss Aero. Personally I don't miss Aero's transparencies any more. I prefer the theme above that I linked to. From a usability perspective, I find the Windows 8 theme is uglier compared to Windows 7 but the visual cues that help usability are better. For example, it is easier to tell the active window due to the use of solid colors in the title bar compared to transparencies. The baby blue selection color in context menus is also more visible in the Windows 8 theme vs Windows 7. - Vastly superior virtual machine performance as a guest OS. I would like to stress this especially. Windows 7 and Windows 10 perform abysmally on my host running VirtualBox, Windows 8.1 performs extremely well. So in general, I prefer Windows 8.1 over 7 because of better DPI scaling, better support of newer hardware technologies like Bluetooth low energy, NVM Express SSD TRIM, USB 3.0, Miracast, performance improvements to I/O. Windows 7 is still excellent but on a high res display, the DPI scaling isn't up to it, USB and SSD I/O performance is worse, latest Bluetooth peripherals and wireless displays don't work. Windows 10, I am finding is just fluff and gimmickry and lots of annoyances which are hard to disable or impossible. It has some core/under the hood improvements but 8.1 has most of them too minus the silly and getting-in-the-way stuff which is essential for a serious workstation class OS. I don't find the silly stuff like Cortana and all the dumbed down Metro UI forced on me useful at all. Reply Yuliya August 12, 2016 at 8:07 pm # 1. Network File System (Enterprise-only) and Win Media Centre (Pro-only) So you can't have them both at the same time on W8. W7Ultimate wins because it has both. 2. Start menu I have over hundreds of things (programs/games) installed. Digging for them is not the solution. Nor having another background process for a third party Start button which also have the "most used" list broken. 3. Disabling desktop composition (Aero) without breaking the Windows On W7 I can simply apply W7Classic or Basic and I'm done. DWM.exe renders useless and I can close it. Things are different on 8. Why I need that? Welp I get more precision on my mouse when I need it (in Photoshop, for instance). 4. Shadow Copy (Last version..) tab is gone is W8. Very useful when editing a document and saving it every 5 minutes. It's back in W10 though. 5. Broken ClearType. Try it on 7 vs 8/10, you'll see the difference. 6. Broken intrnal clock on 8. Probably they fixed that by now, probably. (look on YouTube, there's a video about it). 7. 125 Hz polling rate limitation. Some people reported it as fixed, some don't. 8. Looks ugly. Yeah, I prefer glass over flat nonsense. 9. Useless BSoD. At least on 7 I get to recognise the file of the driver which game me the error. If it's "nv..." then it's the graphics one, etc.. 10. 7 is the last non "connected" version of Windows. The "cloud" word gives no results to any search. 11 [extra] It just works. Why do I need third party programs to fix broken things when I can have the real deal, perfectly working? o.O Seems like doing a lot of work for nothing in return. Your first three issues are basically just drivers which should be available from manufacturer's device. Allways use them, even if Windows has some that are compatible anyway. I don't know about VM's. 7 has Hyper-V as well though. I personally use VMWare and on my PC with a 3770k and 32GB or RAM I can easily host two OS'es (8.1 and 10) with zero performance hit in my daily tasks (given that you disable update checking and other maintainance tasks on those VM's) In terms of benchmarking (I did that too, with STALKER Call Of Pripyat, METRO 2033 / Last Light and Tomb Raider 2013. 7 won in all of them, a small win, they were close enough, but still always won. Reply xpclient August 12, 2016 at 10:42 pm # 1. NFS Server - true but a better third party solution must exist? Unix subsystem and NFS vanished from 8.1, only there in 8 Enterprise. You can run Kodi on Enterprise. :) 2. "Most used" list broken in which Start menu? If you're referring to Classic Shell, its developer is very responsive to feedback and immediately implements any fixes or changes if it's broken. But the most used list data is based on Windows UserAssist algorithm which changed in Windows 8 vs 7. Might be "broken" because of that, in that case the Start Menu can't do anything. Also, what's the big deal with running an extra process for a Start menu? Not everyone uses IE, Explorer or Windows Media Player right? They use alternate browsers, file managers and media players which use more resources? It's the same for the Start menu. :) 4. Shadow Copy is not back in Windows 10. MS deceived everyone by putting back a Previous Versions tab but it is now based on File History, not Shadow Copy. File History does not use Shadow Copies. :( 5. Broken ClearType where? In the main Windows UI? In Explorer? In web browsers? 7. Is this the PS/2 mouse polling rate you are referring to? 9. BSoD can be reverted to the useful one using a Registry tweak :) 10. Cloud shit can be disabled using Group Policy in 8.1 and stays disabled, but not 10. I can't stand it either :) There are no drivers for Bluetooth LE or UASP for Windows 7 except for very limited hardware. There is much more robust support for these technologies in Windows 8.1. Yuliya August 13, 2016 at 12:05 am # xpclient, Well we clearly have different ideas on the OS aspect :) I like a small ffotprint, my Win7 boots with 30-something processes only. I don't like patching thing , I'd have to do it for Explorer, Task manager (always replaced with Process Explorer), Msconfig (how do I disable a process from booting up once I replace W8 task manager?), you name it. Too much, too complex, and sooner or later something will break. Even now I still have to restart Explorer like once a day due to a bug which, I assume the current microsoft developers are not capable of fixing it, because it's still present in 10 as well. StartIsBack and ClassicShell, both have this broken "recently used programs" issue. In the same manner. Sometimes the list is updates on spot, some other times it's delayed, with like a minute or so, and most of the times not updated at all. As for AIMP, VLC, Firefox, etc, well I'm trading the internal process for a new one. I'm not stacking them ;) With the start menu replacement it's a new one. Clear type mostly throughout Windows UI, not browser's canvas, thankfully. You can even easier spot this by comparing any of the Office 2010 program to its counterpart from Word 2013 or 2016. There's many complaints about this, even on their forums. I'll again blame the incompetence of their developers for breaking something that worked and not being able to fix it back. Normal mice, USB. I rember I noticed this myself while moving a window on the screen, it feels way less smooth than on 7. A quick search for "bluetooth le windows 7" shows many people asking how to get it working and also many ohers which have managed to do so. It's a driver thing. Native or not - well you're not using the native graphics driver, do you? You always get the one from Nvidia/AMD/Intel ;) Same for audio and so on.. And still the main issue is present. No possibility to disable desktop composition, which makes the mouse signifficantly less responsive. And these are my issues. I could go on with the UAC related ones - once completely disabled (via registry) the "modern apps" stop working. Now the fun part begins when you try to create a new windows profile. Instead of CPanel, the Settings modern will pop up, but with a message telling you that it can not work while UAC is off. xpclient August 12, 2016 at 5:15 pm # Windows 8.1 is currently the best version IMHO. I will try to be objective. Here's why I think it's the best: Windows 8.1 has the following benefits for me over Windows 7: - USB 3.0 support. Even though Windows 7 PCs do have USB 3.0 drivers, Windows 8.1 supports USB Attached SCSI protocol which makes UASP flash drives much faster than USB 3.0 on Windows 7. UASP with USB 3.0 is a significant speed boost over USB 2.0. - USB Type C connector with KB3103696 - Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)/Bluetooth SMART support means I can use devices like Bluetooth wireless mouse which supports the Bluetooth 4.0 LE standard or LE headsets. The batteries in these devices last for a long time. - 802.11ac. With a fast 802.11ac router, 2 PCs with PCIe/NVM Express SSDs, you get amazing WiFi speeds. (OK, after doing some testing on Windows 7, it turns out, as long as you have the right drivers installed under Windows 7 and an 802.11ac router, you will get the same faster than N speeds as Windows 8 on 7 as well. It's only that Windows 7 continues to report your radio as 802.11n.) - Offloaded Data Transfers for file copying - More WMI classes and PowerShell cmdlets - Miracast wireless streaming to a display which 8.1 supports (although you could also use Windows 7 with Intel WiDi or buy a Chromecast dongle). But Miracast in 8.1 lets you not only mirror your display wirelessly to the second display but also extend your desktop to it. Like a wireless multiple monitors solution. - Windows 8.1 supports external manifests for application executables ("PreferExternalManifest"=dword:00000001) without any side effects of Windows 7 like the Network icon breaking. This is important if you are using a High resolution/High DPI display because Microsoft f***ed up DPI scaling with Windows 7. Windows 7 DPI scaling is broken, Windows 8.1 actually works. You can modify any app's manifest to scale it properly. - The DPI scaling engine in Windows 8.1 loads much earlier than Windows 7 so apps which load at startup are scaled properly - Windows 8.1 has better WinSxS cleanup using Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase - Chkdsk Spotfix ability, Hyper-V. Those who miss Virtual PC can get VirtualBox - Most issues on the software side were resolved for me by using third party apps - Classic Shell, 7+ Taskbar Tweaker, Classic Task Manager, Equalizer APO, Google Chrome, Everything Search, PerigeeCopy, OldNewExplorer, FileSearchEX, VistaSwitcher, Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, and reinstating Sidebar Gadgets, Classic Games, classic MSConfig, various tray applet fixes, ERUNT, AutoHotkey, EasyBCD, UxStyle plus a custom theme, WindowsFirewallControl etc - All the Metro crap uninstalled, default programs set to Win32 apps, Group Policies to disable crap like OneDrive, Bing Search and Customer Experience Improvement Program, it is OK. - DOZENS of Registry fixes to make it work like the way I want - more like Windows XP Professional and Windows 7 so Windows 8.1 is now a pleasant and stable experience!! - Media Center is missing but Kodi is better. Between Kodi and its addons you can do everything. - Aero Glass project is there if you miss Aero. Personally I don't miss Aero's transparencies any more. I prefer a custom theme. From a usability perspective, I find the Windows 8 theme is uglier compared to Windows 7 but the visual cues that help usability are better. For example, it is easier to tell the active window due to the use of solid colors in the title bar compared to transparencies. The baby blue selection color in context menus is also more visible in the Windows 8 theme vs Windows 7. - Vastly superior virtual machine performance as a guest OS. I would like to stress this especially. Windows 7 and Windows 10 perform abysmally on my host running VirtualBox, Windows 8.1 performs extremely well. So in general, I prefer Windows 8.1 over 7 because of better DPI scaling, better support of newer hardware technologies like Bluetooth low energy, NVM Express SSD TRIM, USB 3.0, Miracast, performance improvements to I/O. Windows 7 is still excellent but on a high res display, the DPI scaling isn't up to it, USB and SSD I/O performance is worse, latest Bluetooth peripherals and wireless displays don't work. Windows 10, I am finding is just fluff and gimmickry and lots of annoyances which are hard to disable or impossible. It has some core/under the hood improvements but 8.1 has most of them too minus the silly and getting-in-the-way stuff which is essential for a serious workstation class OS. I don't find the silly stuff like Cortana and all the dumbed down Metro UI forced on me useful at all. That said, I would like to hear others' point of view too on this. Do they have objective reasons on why they prefer Windows 10 over 7 or 8 or why they prefer Windows 7 over 10? Reply Yuliya August 12, 2016 at 8:10 pm # Ofcourse it was just micro$oft's fud. When did Windows needed drivers to run on a CPU? My 3770k released in 2012 runs perfectly with 7 7600, which was released in 2009. There is no way it has any Ivy Bridge "Official Support [TM] [c] [R]" in it because of this timeframe. Reply xpclient August 12, 2016 at 9:47 pm # Martin, please delete the duplicate comment and this comment. I only want one comment of mine.

At 75 MPH An attendee awaits a session at this year's Black Hat, where good-guy hackers dealt with dark subjects, such as the rise of ransomware. CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA ALLISON GATLIN 8/13/2016 Reprints LAS VEGAS -- If the giant robot at the Malwarebytes booth and arcade game at WatchGuard weren't sufficient clues, maybe a Cylance speaker using Morpheus, from "The Matrix," as a prop was: Black Hat USA 2016 in Las Vegas was the ultimate hacker-nerd mecca -- but with a serious focus of dealing with topics such as cyberwarfare, ransomware and IoT security. Black Hat's most recent iteration this month drew more than 15,000 cybersecurity-minded professionals to Las Vegas, topping last year's event by at least 4,000. Neon was seemingly the color du jour, in theme with the Strip's bright lights. The future of cybersecurity, experts say, is just as resplendent. Hackers are leveraging the Internet of Things to push new ransomware attacks. The Ukraine-Russia conflict is setting the model for modern cyberwarfare. Apple (AAPL) and Android are engaged in a donnybrook for mobile security dominance. All that along with the Terminators -- a nickname for drones capable of hacking and surveying industrial infrastructure complexes used by speaker Jeff Melrose, principal technologist for industrial automation company Yokogawa US. Intel Security CTO Steve Grobman demonstrates how ransomware can hijack your home network. (Allison Gatlin) To keep pace, the cybersecurity industry can't fall back on old tricks, says Intel (INTC) Security CTO Steve Grobman. There's no "silver bullet" technology, and threat intelligence is faulty by design. It's all about innovation -- just ask the men who hacked a 2014 Jeep Cherokee ... again. "Nothing is perfect," Grobman told IBD. "Attackers in the wild are using new methods, new techniques. And because of that, there's an inherent lag in addressing them (threats). Recognizing that cycle is important." Benefiting from it is an absolute certainty. How Important Are Your Brakes? Your vehicle's infotainment center lights up with a message as you barrel down the freeway at 75 mph. "Going somewhere? Too bad, we've blocked your system and brakes," the message taunts. "To continue your journey and decrypt the system, give us a call." Ransomware, malicious software designed to hold data hostage until a sum of money is paid, can be deadly. In February, hackers paralyzed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles with a $3.6 million Bitcoin ransom on the facility's servers. Officials ultimately paid the equivalent of $17,000 in Bitcoin. Ransomware has yet to roil the consumer world, but some billions of Internet of Things devices slated to come online by 2020 offer a drool-worthy opening, Intel's Grobman says. "What if you couldn't drive your car for two months until you could get an appointment at the dealer, or pay $200 in ransomware?" he posited. "There's not yet ransomware on vehicles, but Intel Security's Advanced Threat Research team is trying to figure out the next generation of attacks." TripWire researcher Craig Young breaks financially-motivated malware into three segments: ransomware, blackmail and extortion. Blackmailers will threaten to unveil some nebulous crime unless a victim pays up, extortioners prey on businesses with threats of crashing their operations unless a ransom is paid. Whatever the flavor, hackers are relying on statistics, says Nathan Shuchami, head of threat prevention for Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP). If only 10% of ransomware attacks reap financial rewards, that's a big success, he told IBD. "Most visible attacks are by cybercriminals using ransomware," he said. "Attempts to hack banks and retailers represent the majority of these threats. ... These guys are interested in the easiest way to be successful. "They're generating billions in ransom. It's a simple effect because it's not targeted." Cyberterrorists are just as likely to attack the IoT infrastructure as banks and retailers, he says. Flicking on and off the connected lights in a home might not spur much terror, but felling the entire Internet-linked vehicular world? That would be catastrophic. Uber Advanced Technologies Center researchers Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller proved in 2015, in a Black Hat presentation, that attacks on vehicles are viable. This year, they upped the ante from "parlor tricks" to cutting power steering, locking the parking brake and pulling the steering wheel of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee into a right-hand skid. Each of those attacks relied on a plugged-in USB device and, unlike their 2015 antics, were performed at speeds greater than 5 mph. But, Miller told the 2016 Black Hat audience, those vulnerabilities could have easily been exploited remotely. "The Jeep vulnerability was discovered by ethical researchers," Grobman said. "But imagine if that exploit was done by a cybercriminal where all those Jeeps were impacted with ransomware. ... What happens as the same criminal business model starts moving into the consumer end?" Ukrainian Conflict Turns Digital Everyday citizens are already under attack in Ukraine, where Russian forces have occupied portions of the country since 2014, says Kenneth Geers, a senior research scientist for security firm Comodo. Geers is based in Ukraine and lives blocks from where Belarusian journalist Pavel Sheremet was killed in a car bombing. The death toll in Ukraine has rocketed into the thousands amid a conflict pitting pro-Westerners interested in deepening ties with the European Union and pro-separatists in the east aligned with Russia. The conflict is the bloodiest Europe has seen in decades. It's also quickly becoming an archetype for modern cyberwarfare, Geers told a Black Hat audience. The North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) last month officially recognized cyberspace as a military domain. So, even though Ukraine isn't a NATO member, it's already setting the stage for cyberwarfare in the 21st century. Geers says both sides are armed with "weapons on mass disruption." That seemed the case in 2014, when a virus crippled Ukraine's Central Election Commission ahead of the presidential election. Last December, hackers attacked a Ukrainian power plant, plunging 230,000 into darkness amid the harsh winter. The attack was a simple and highly effective spear-phishing venture that let hackers gain deeper access. Both countries also have hacked smart billboards with their own propaganda. But attribution is tricky, Geers said. Using a country's specific cyberattack M.O. -- technology, language and political motivations -- it's fairly simply to mimic an attacker, Intel's Grobman said. Retribution against an innocent, falsely accused third-party country could be ruinous. "It's difficult in cyberspace because everything is so evasive," Geers said. "Can you get solid attribution? Can you get to the person at the keyboard? Absolutely. But you might need law enforcement and Russia is now finding out you can crowdsource an attack." There ought to be limits to government power in cyberspace, Geers argues. "There are plenty of governments that would take advantage of it in a heartbeat," he said. For that reason, the U.S. and its allies need to outline peacetime cyberinitiatives, he says. Does that include peacetime hacking? After all, cyberwarfare is reality, and the invisible battleground has real implications in the physical one that could mean the difference between a felled and an optional weapon, Geers says. Hackers, he says, also could "turn out the lights" to confuse leaders, or exploit holes in critical applications. "Then," he said, "it might be a very long day on the battlefield."

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 08.12.16. 08.12.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Intel Reinvents Itself to Stay King in a Changing World Tyrone Siu/REUTERS Intel is bigger than all but 50 other U.S. companies, and that’s because of something called the CPU. If you were around in the ’90s or the early aughts, you saw the TV ads. Intel Inside. For decades, Intel has supplied a majority of the chips that sit at the heart of our personal computers, including desktops as well as laptops. These chips are called central processing units, CPUs for short. They handle most all of the digital calculations that drive our PCs. They also handle most of the calculations inside the millions upon millions of computer servers that run Internet services like Google Search, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter. And Intel came to dominate this market too. It now builds 99 percent of all CPUs that wind up in a computer server, according to research firm IDC. When you use the Internet, you use Intel. But the chip market is now shifting in new directions. And as it shifts, Intel is remaking itself in an effort to stay on top of the heap. The world’s largest chip maker somehow missed the shift away from the PC and toward the smartphone. Other chip makers supply most of the silicon at the heart of our phones. But Intel now sees that the game is changing on the Internet as well. To run their myriad online services—operations of unprecedented size and complexity—Internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft need more than just CPUs inside their millions of servers. They’re using all sorts of alternative chips to accelerate particular technologies, most notably the new breed of artificial intelligence. So, Intel is remaking itself as a company that can build these chips too. Last summer, Intel paid $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, a company whose programmable chips, known as FPGAs, help choose search results inside Bing, the Microsoft search engine. This was the largest acquisition in the history of Intel. And then, earlier this week, the company agreed to acquire Nervana, a startup building chips just for deep neural networks, AI services that can learn tasks by analyzing enormous amounts of data. At Google, Facebook, and so many others, deep neural nets are now recognizing photos, identifying spoken words, and translating from one language to another—among other tasks—and that’s why Intel paid an apparent $408 million for Nervana. “We’re now at the precipice of the next big wave of growth,” says Intel vice president Jason Waxman, “and that’s going to be driven by artificial intelligence.” These hefty buys show just how rapidly the global chip game is changing. As Microsoft explores FPGAs as a way of accelerating search, it’s training deep neural networks with massive farms of GPUs, chips originally built for rendering images for games and other highly graphical software. So many other Internet companies are doing the same. And at Google, engineers have gone so far as to build their own alternative chip, dubbed the TPU. After GPUs help train a neural network to, say, recognize faces in photos, Google’s TPUs help execute this neural network, putting it to use in the real world. It’s an attack of the geek acronyms. FPGAs. GPUs. TPUs. And certainly, keeping it all straight is far from easy. But the trend isn’t hard to see. The world is moving onto Internet services, and these Internet services now require many chips beyond the classic CPU. As Microsoft vice president Peter Lee explains it, our Internet services are evolving more quickly than our CPUs. CPUs continue to mature according to Moore’s Law, getting faster every two years or so, but that’s not enough to accommodate the rise of deep learning. Nor can it handle the tremendous growth of our online services. So, we need chips that can handle “post-CPU workloads,” in the words of Lee, who oversees a new Microsoft Research operation called NExT. “Increasingly, we’re looking at more specialized hardware,” he says. It’s significant that so many acronyms are in the mix. We’re at the beginning of this movement, with Internet companies exploring so many possibilities, and it’s unclear how things will eventually pan out. Will the market settle on one or two chips? Or it will it be more? And what will those be? It’s telling that Intel has acquired not just Altera, but Nervana too. Wherever the market goes, it wants to be there. Go Back to Top.

Wired Staff Gear Date of Publication: 08.12.16. 08.12.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am These Are the Best Laptops for Under $200 Dell Great news! If you only have $200 to spend on a laptop, your options are far better than they used to be. While these machines aren’t built for hardcore gaming or video editing, they’re more than enough for web browsing and writing papers. These days, sub-$200 laptops commonly ship with HD displays, full Windows 10 (rather than something more limited, like Google’s Chrome OS), and a decent chunk of internal storage. Many also come with a free year of Microsoft Office 365—perfect for the students they’re targeting. To find the best of this affordable bunch, we put the most popular models through a series of performance and display tests in our state-of-the-art labs. Then we put them to the test at our desks, to get a feel for real-world factors like keyboard feel, trackpad responsiveness, and build quality. The result? We can tell you with authority that if you want the best affordable laptops available today, these are the ones to buy. This article was originally published on Reviewed.com. See more at Reviewed.com’s best laptops for every kind of student. Also see their recommendations for the best laptops. Best Overall: Asus E402SA Asus The Asus E402SA (also known as the EeeBook E402SA) won us over right away. While it’s not much faster than its competition, its 14-inch screen is bigger than most. The display is a mere 1366 x 768 pixels, but it’s glossy, looks great, and isn’t a major drain on the battery. Its $249 MSRP is a little above our target price, but we’ve seen it on sale as low as $179. Under the hood, the E402SA has the same Intel Celeron N3050 processor as most of the best sub-$200 laptops, but it’s one of the few to offer both VGA and ethernet jacks. It also includes a full-sized SD memory card slot and two USB ports (one is even USB 3.0). Its trackpad is mediocre, but the full-sized keyboard is very comfortable to type on. Our favorite feature is the E402SA’s expandability; turn one screw to remove the bottom panel and you can upgrade your storage with any 2.5-inch laptop hard drive or SSD. Dell Inspiron 11 3000 (2016) Who says a cheap laptop can’t be pretty? This Dell offers up an attractive design, solid build quality, and the port selection we expect from a new laptop these days (USB 3.0, HDMI, and a microSD slot). Based around Intel’s ubiquitous Celeron N3050 dual-core processor, it performs pretty much like any other laptop in its class. It also sports a decent trackpad, but its keyboard feels a bit cramped. The Inspiron 11 3000’s ($180) biggest flaw is the included McAfee install, which can be a real hog on system resources and annoys with frequent popups. But all things considered, Dell offers up a package that’s colorful, modern, and just fast enough for schoolwork or surfing the web. It may not be inspiring, but this Inspiron is worth its asking price. Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 11 This Acer isn’t a looker, but it’s got what it takes on the inside. Its cramped keyboard has a weird layout, but on the positive side, the Aspire One Cloudbook 11 ($180) has a very responsive trackpad that works well with gestures. Sporting an Intel Celeron N3050 dual-core chip, this small laptop fits the bill if you have limited needs. It might keep you waiting from time to time, but it’s got just enough oomph for Word, Excel, a few Chrome tabs, or older games. While you can find a 16GB version, you should avoid that one at all costs; our test model had 32GB of storage and even that filled up right away. You can add more memory with an SD card, but since it’s not microSD, it’ll stick out the side of the machine. In our opinion, your best bet for inconspicuous extra storage on the Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 11 is probably a low profile USB drive. Lenovo Ideapad 100s (Windows) Lenovo’s Ideapad 100s ($200) impressed us as a Chromebook, but the Windows 10 version falls short of expectations. Its mediocre keyboard, basic trackpad (don’t expect scrolling or zooming gestures), and plasticky feel don’t do it any favors. It’s available in a bunch of different colors, but that does little to distract from its underwhelming performance. Inside, it has an older Intel Atom Z3735F chip. It may be quad core, but it’s still slower than the Celeron N3050 dual-core processor found in rival machines. The 100s is also stuck with USB 2.0 ports, which can’t keep up with the 3.0 ports on better machines. It’s not all bad though. You can add storage through the compact microSD slot, the hinge rotates a full 180 degrees, and it had the best battery life of any of the sub-$200 models we tested. HP Stream 11 (2016) HP We liked the HP Stream last year, and are happy to see the line continue with this year’s updated model ($200). Revamped from the ground-up, the playful Stream 11 is a little bigger than its 11-inch competition, but that makes for a keyboard that’s much more pleasant to use. Its keys are almost full-sized, and the typing feel is pretty good for this part of the market. With Intel’s Celeron N3050 inside, the Stream isn’t great at multitasking, but can tackle lighter work without breaking a sweat. The worst part of using the Stream 11 is its iffy trackpad, which isn’t nearly as responsive as we’d like. The screen also seemed a little duller than the rest of our test group. Unfortunately, HP also bundles McAfee with this computer; it’s a pain, but you can uninstall it to speed things up. Lenovo IdeaPad 100s (Chromebook) If you’re shopping for a Chromebook, we thought that the affordably-priced Lenovo IdeaPad 100s ($180) was pretty solid. Even though you won’t be able to run Android apps, for only around $175, we can’t get too upset. It’s a lot like the Windows-based IdeaPad 100s we tested for this article, but it has a slightly better trackpad and, of course, runs Google’s ChromeOS. It’s competitively spec’d thanks to an Intel N2840 processor, 2 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of storage. It’s the right price for a simple Chromebook, without spending more than $200. Go Back to Top.

Long live Atom for IoT, cars! JC Torres - Aug 12, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Rumors of Intel Atom’s death have been greatly exaggerated. And Intel has only itself to blame for that. Now it seems that the company is clarifying, or further muddling, its plans for its low-power processor line. Intel is, indeed, axing the Atom but that is true only as far as mobile devices, laptops, and even wearables go. It still has Atoms planned, newer ones based on its Apollo Lake architecture. Those, however, will be heading towards smart cars and smart appliances as Intel tries to make a grab for the IoT market instead. Intel has had a rather tough time with the mobile market. Due to circumstances and poor business decisions, it allowed Qualcomm, a leader in the competing ARM computing architecture, to take a foothold in smartphones and tablets. By the time it did make a concerted effort to gain a presence in that industry, it was far too little, far too late to make a difference. The most recent casualty of that failed business was the Atom line of processors, initially intended for the low-power, low-spec, and now extinct netbook product line. But while Intel is practically backing out of the smartphone and tablet race, that doesn’t mean there is no room for a power-efficient chip on the x86 architecture. And it seems that Intel has found the exact niche for it. Come August 17th at the Intel Developer Forum, the company is expected to unveil a new generation of Atom processors. Those, however, are earmarked for the IoT industry. But that’s not the only market either. Intel has long had its eyes, no pun intended, on imaging technologies, particularly in virtual and augmented reality. It is also expected that Intel will make a grab for that market, introducing its own Remote EyeSight take on the Microsoft HoloLens. Curiously, Intel’s Atom was last seen powering Microsoft’s very own AR headset. Of course, just because Intel wants to doesn’t mean it will be able to. While relatively more power efficient than its bigger siblings, Atom chips have been traditionally still seen as giants compared to equivalent Atom processors. And that might be a bigger problem in smaller spaces like appliances and headsets.

Microsoft retreats, will extend Skylake PC support to normal support lifetimes Customers cried foul, and Microsoft changed its mind. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 12 August, 2016 05:11 0 - - - - print email On Thursday Microsoft completed its retreat from its controversial policy regarding support for Intel’s “Skylake” processors on its older Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems. Now Skylake PCs running those OSes will receive the standard length of support. In a controversial move, Microsoft had previously said this past January that it would only support Skylake PCs running its older operating systems for about 18 months. (Generally, mainstream support is five years and extended support is 10 years.) Support for Skylake would have run out in July 2017, far earlier than for older systems powered by Intel’s “Broadwell” processors. Now, the support lifetimes for “Broadwell” and “Skylake” PCs are the same: Windows 7 support will expire on January 14, 2020, and support for Windows 8.1 will end January 10, 2023. Microsoft noted the changes in a blog post it published Thursday. Why this matters: Microsoft originally pitched the changes to its support lifecycle as a positive: The older OSes were designed with older CPUs in mind. Thus Intel's Skylake was not only not optimized for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, but it also required special tweaks to ensure those OSes remain compatible. But customers latched on to the fact that Microsoft was ending support years early for Skylake PCs, and Microsoft has steadily backtracked since then. The dam started crumbling a month later, for example, when the Windows Server team publicly stated that it would not be enforcing Microsoft’s policy and it would support Skylake-based servers through the original support dates. Still pushing Windows 10 Microsoft had originally set the early expiration dates for Skylake PCs to encourage users to move to Windows 10, a more modern OS with more advanced protections against malware and other threats. That’s still Microsoft’s stance. “We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software,” Microsoft wrote. Microsoft claimed that the changes would primarily affect commercial customers, though the list of affected PCs includes gaming systems from Dell’s Alienware subsidiary as well as other consumer notebooks. According to Microsoft, the change has been made possible by the PC OEMs and by Intel, which will themselves be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing through the end of the support dates.

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Microsoft backs down, extends Skylake PC support By Juha Saarinen on Aug 12, 2016 2:22PM Updated policy driven by enterprise customer needs. Microsoft has backed down over its decision to shorten support for Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processor technology following enterprise customer outcry. The company originally said it would support downgrades from Windows 10 to Windows 7 until January 2020, and Windows 8.1 until January 2023, but this past January decided it would "embrace silicon innovation" and cut short that promise to 2017. Now, however, Microsoft's director of Windows business planning Shad Larsen said the company had changed its mind again as a result of protests by enterprise customers. Larsen said Microsoft now understood that enterprise users may still need to go slow in rolling out Windows 10. "At the same time we recognise that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th-gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy," Larsen said. The policy change means Intel Skylake PCs will once again join other Windows 7 and 8.1 devices to be supported until January 2020 and January 2023 respectively. The updated support policy applies to Microsoft commercial customers who currently manage Windows 7 and Windows 8 deployments, Larsen said. It doesn't apply to users currently running Windows 10. Larsen made it clear that Intel's upcoming seventh-generation "Kaby Lake" and AMD's new "Bristol Ridge" and other hardware would only be supported on Windows 10. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

While it’s not expected to match the power of Intel’s latest Core family, most believe it’ll be a much better showing compared to the company’s recent efforts. To that end, WCCFTech has come across what it claims are the first verified benchmarks of the Zen platform courtesy of the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark database. It is worth noting, however, that these results are from an engineering sample of the chip and may not accurately represent the performance of the final product brought to market. The tests, which were conducted on August 6 and August 9 (two versions were tested, it seems), were run in conjunction with a Radeon RX 480. Using comparable hardware runs from the database, the publication found the Zen ES sample to be 38 percent faster than the AMD FX-8350, about 10 percent faster than Intel’s Core i5-4670K and around 11 percent slower than a Core i7-4790. So, what’s the verdict? It’s hard to say for sure. Keep in mind that the Zen ES samples tested had a low base clock of 2.8GHz (boost to 3.2GHz). If the retail product is pushing speeds closer to 4GHz, performance will no doubt improve significantly. It’s also worth pointing out that the Zen ES is being compared to Intel’s three-year-old Haswell processors. The Core i5-4670K has just four cores and four threads while the Core i7-4790 features four cores and eight threads and both are built on a 22nm process. The Zen ES reports eight cores, 16 threads and is a 14nm part yet it can’t keep pace with Intel’s old chips? Making matters even worse for AMD is the fact that Intel is planning to release Cannonlake, its 10nm die shrink of Kaby Lake, next year. AMD has said it doesn’t expect to ship Zen with full market availability until sometime in 2017. Nothing is official at this hour but if the benchmarks are indeed legitimate, it's not a great start for Zen. Then again, it's just a single set of benchmarks we have so even if they are legit, it's tough to draw full conclusions based on them alone.

Shocked, we're totally shocked Storage tech's real performance figures fail to match marketing claims Is the XPoint dish over-egged? 12 Aug 2016 at 01:54, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Ibm, Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp Recent Articles Micron scrambling up wall of revenues pit Zeta Systems: NVMe over Fabrics speed is real... and here's why Scale scales: HCI maverick heads upstack with apps +Comment XPoint will substantially undershoot the 1,000-times-faster and 1,000-times-longer-lived-than-flash claims made by Intel when it was first announced – with just a 10-times speed boost and 2.5-times longer endurance in reality. This became clear when Micron presented details of its QuantX-branded XPoint memory technology at the Santa Clara Flash Memory Summit this week. Summit attendees could see a 128GB prototype QuantX system with four XPoint, seemingly, dual-chip packages on it; meaning two 16GB die per package. In contrast to the wildly optimistic Intel "1,000 times faster than NAND" claims when XPoint was launched, the Micron pitch presented a 10-times improvement over NAND in terms of IOPS and latency, and four times more memory footprint than DRAM per CPU. Now that does seem more realistic. A Micron blog states: It delivers mesmerizing PCIe SSD performance – measuring typical read latencies at less than 10µs and a five 9 QoS at less than 25µs. That's over 10X better than the best NAND flash-based SSDs! El Reg doesn't think a 10-times improvement over NAND is worth an exclamation point, or classing it as "mesmerizing" – not when a 1,000-times improvement has been alleged before. We understand Micron is arguing that raw XPoint cell performance is 1,000 times faster than NAND raw cell performance, but, when you add in everything else in an SSD, such as the controller, its firmware and the interface, the speed drops. What did Micron tell the audience about QuantX latency? Write latency is <20μs (An NVMe SSD has <200μs). Read latency is <10μs (An NVMe SSD has <100μs). A U.2 200GB to 1.6TB XPoint SSD achieves 900,000 IOPS vs a 1.6TB NVMe SSD's 200,000 IOPS. A 900GB to 1.6TB XPoint SSD in a half height, half length PCIe 3.0 x8 card achieves 1.8 million IOPS vs a 1.6TB NVMe SSD's 200,000 IOPS. The IOPS testing used 4KB blocks with random 70 per cent read and 30 per cent write operations. With the U.2 QuantX NVME SSDs, queue depths of four to six saturated a PCIe x4 link, which the NAND NVMe SSD couldn't do. On a PCIe card, the queue depth reached 8 to 12, varying with QuantX SSD capacity, before the link was saturated. A 200GB QuantX SSD saturated the link at a queue depth of 16. Micron also provided an endurance number: QuantX SSDs will support 25 drive writes per day (DWPD) over five years. What do NAND SSDs provide? Samsung SM1715: 10 DWPD for five years Toshiba PX04P: 10 DWPD for five years Intel DC P3700: 17 DWPD for five years It looks as if QuantX XPoint has 2.5 times more endurance than ordinary NAND SSDs, and not the 1,000 times (which would mean 10,000 DWPD for five years) that the Intel marketing department keeps banging on about. We understand data stored in QuantX DIMMs will be encrypted. Operating system and application code changes will be needed to get the full benefit of XPoint as system memory, as opposed to storage. The NVDIMM-P products from Netlist will, presumably, help here, alerting potential XPoint memory ecosystem partners to the need for change. Price QuantX products will cost four to five times more than equivalent flash capacity and about half the cost of DRAM. We could see XPoint being used to bulk out DRAM as storage-class memory, and so enable larger working sets to be held in memory, leading to faster application run times. Products with capacities from 200GB to 1.6TB are expected and these will be for data centers and enterprises. We can expect Micron to be trying to sign up server and storage system vendors as OEMs, with array vendors needing an NVMe-over-fabrics link to server hosts to make XPoint SSD use worthwhile. Expect the first QuantX products in the second 2017 quarter. We would expect all the server vendors: Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HDS, HPE, Huawei, Inspur, Supermicro, etc to look at qualifying them. We would also expect all the NVMe over Fabrics-class array vendors: Apeiron, Dell/EMC DSSD, E8, Excelero, Mangstor and Pavilion Data Systems, to check them out as well. Reg comment The big question is: does XPoint deliver enough of a performance boost over NAND to justify a four to five-times price premium? There are other technologies available to fill the price-performance gap between DRAM and NAND. Flash DIMMs in NVDIMM-P guise for one. Everspin MRAM DIMMs for another. And then there's Samsung's mystery Z-SSD. XPoint competition is mounting up and it has a relatively trivial endurance advantage over flash, and a less-than-expected performance advantage. It is remotely possible that Intel and Micron have over-egged their XPoint pudding and it could fall flat. ® PS: QuantX is supposed to signify quantum leap, by the way.

Chief executive Brian Krzanich announced last year that Intel would spend $300 million to achieve “full representation (of women and minorities) at all levels in our company workforce by 2020.” It’s a lofty goal, and one Intel and other tech companies have struggled to achieve — effectively shutting large segments of the population out from some of the most lucrative careers. But Intel has won plaudits from civil rights activists for setting a goal publicly and providing regular updates on its progress. Before Intel launched its initiative, more than three-quarters of its workers were men and just 8 percent were African-American, Hispanic or Native American. Women now constitute 25.4 percent of Intel’s workforce, up nearly 2 percentage points since December 2014. The total share of underrepresented minorities has increased three-tenths of a percent. Intel indicated the broad restructuring it began last spring — laying off 12,000 workers — has disrupted its diversification effort. And Krzanich said last spring that some of his white, male employees feel “under siege” amid the cutbacks and diversity initiative.

Will this struggling chipmaker break out or spin out over the next 12 months? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 11, 2016 at 2:30PM Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has bounced between $28 and $35 this year, but its current price represents nearly flat growth from the beginning of the year. That range-bound trading can likely be attributed to the sluggish PC market, weak demand for its data center chips, and its humbling retreat from the mobile market. Image source: Intel. But if we look a year down the road, will these headwinds strengthen or dissipate? Let's discuss analysts' growth forecasts and see where Intel stock might end up in a year. Growth forecasts and price targets Investors should take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt, but it's easy to figure out how these targets are calculated with basic math. Analysts, on average, believe that Intel's earnings per share will rise 7% to $2.50 per share for fiscal 2016. They have an average price target of $37.61 on the stock, which would represent a 9% gain from its price at the time of this writing. If we divide Intel's target price by its estimated EPS, we get an implied P/E ratio of 15. That's lower than Intel's current P/E of 17 and the average P/E of 22 for the broader semiconductor industry. But it's also reasonable to assume that Intel's P/E should pull back, since it's currently at its highest levels of the year. Source: YCharts Therefore, it's safe to assume that Intel stock probably won't post big double-digit gains within the next year. However, we should also examine the key challenges that the company will likely face. Understanding the main challenges Intel could post stronger growth if PC sales start rising again. Unfortunately, IDC expects worldwide PC shipments to fall 7.3% in 2016 and 1.6% in 2017, due to longer-lasting devices, PC owners refusing to upgrade, and the rising use of the smartphone as a main computing device. Microsoft's decision to end free Windows 10 upgrades might persuade some consumers to buy new PCs, but that's a long shot since they weren't willing to install a free OS over the past year. Demand for Intel's data center chips might accelerate and hit the 15% annual sales growth target it set last November. But that growth relies heavily on the Chinese market, where demand is sluggish and cheaper ARM-based servers are gaining more attention. Nvidia and IBM have also been gaining ground in data centers by pairing Nvidia's GPUs with IBM's Power CPUs for machine learning purposes. Due to those challenges, revenue at Intel's Client Computing and Data Center groups, which account for over 80% of its top line, respectively fell 3% and rose just 5% annually last quarter. Intel's discontinuation of mobile chips, which were sold through its Client Computing business, is also a double-edged sword -- it can save billions of dollars by eliminating "contra revenue" subsidies, but it also leaves Intel without a meaningful presence (besides modems) in smartphones. Potential catalysts remain weak Intel constantly highlights new Internet of Things (IoT) markets like drones, wearables, and connected cars as ways to diversify away from PCs and data centers. Unfortunately, Intel's IoT business generated just 4% of its sales and 7% of its operating income last quarter. The unit's revenue rose just 2% annually last quarter, indicating that it won't offset its weak PC and data center growth anytime soon. Other potential areas of growth are programmable chips (acquired from Altera) and non-volatile memory. However, those two businesses generated just 7% of Intel's revenue last quarter, and both units suffered operating losses due to the ongoing decline in flash memory prices. Where will Intel be in a year? Intel's PC and data center businesses will likely keep posting soft numbers over the following year, and its newer businesses will probably struggle to gain momentum. With those challenges in mind, the consensus forecast for 7% earnings growth with a 12-month price target of $38 sounds fairly reasonable. That target isn't impressive, but Intel's valuations are still fairly low, and it pays a solid dividend yield of 3% -- making it a good defensive income play for choppy markets.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's tablet adventure looking like its netbook disaster Intel's new Atom chips bring 4K video to VR headsets, robots At IDF, Intel is leaving PCs behind to highlight VR and IoT Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel's Atom chips are on their way out of mobile devices, and the next generation of the chip line will instead be targeted toward drones, self-driving cars, and IoT devices. The new Atom chips will retain the line's focus on low power consumption, with an emphasis on graphics and visual computing. The chip line, to be announced next week at Intel Developer Forum, will be used to maneuver cars, drones, and robots and to also help them recognize objects. Many Atom mobile and server chips have been on Intel's chopping block. The troubled chip's future now is in the growing markets of IoT and virtual reality.  The chips will integrate into devices with the company's 3D RealSense cameras, according to a technical session description at IDF. That points to the chips also being used in low-power virtual reality headsets. Intel will lay out its VR and augmented reality strategy at the developer show, and RealSense is expected to be at the center of many announcements. Intel will show off its own version of Microsoft's HoloLens called Remote EyeSight, a set of head-worn AR smart glasses for remote collaboration. Expect the bread-and-butter products for the new Atom chips to be smart home and industrial IoT devices. The chips, according to the technical session page, will also work in devices with "advanced displays," which could refer to information kiosks or digital advertising displays. Intel declined to comment on the next-generation Atom chips, the details, or the underlying architecture. The chips could be based on the Broxton architecture, conceived by Intel originally as a way to quickly design and release new Atom chips to catch up with market leader ARM in smartphones and tablets. The new chips ensure the survival of the Atom product line, which had an uncertain future. Atom chips for mobile devices were the first on the chopping block after Intel announced plans earlier this year to lay off 12,000 employees and restructure operations to focus on servers, connectivity, IoT, and other areas.  However, Intel is still using Atom chips like Sofia -- which it was supposed to cut -- for point-of-sale systems and industrial IoT devices. The Atom architecture called Goldmont will be used in upcoming Celeron and Pentium PC chips code-named Apollo Lake. Those chips were originally based on the same architecture used in high-end Core PC processors. The new Atom chips could go into AC power-connected devices for digital signs, cash registers, and casino gaming machines, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research.  "It won't be for small, battery devices," McGregor said. Intel's done a good job of scaling down the size and power consumption for x86 architecture with Atom, but the chip isn't as power efficient as ARM or MIPS for low-power devices, McGregor said. Atom, in a way, is coming back to embedded devices -- which it was originally designed for -- but an ill-advised mobile route has given the chip a bad name, McGregor said. "They have to rebrand it. There's so much failure around it," McGregor said. The Atom chips were at the forefront of the netbook explosion from 2007 to 2010, then were tweaked for tablets and smartphones. Atom smartphones never really took off, and in a desperate move, Intel in 2014 said it would ship 40 million tablet chips, then hit 46 million chips. But by the time Intel found its groove in tablets, that market started declining.

Die Einträge bestätigen das Format sowie die Anbindung über PCIe 3.0 x4 und NVMe. Jetzt ist auch die Modellpalette bekannt, die von 128 GByte bis 1 TByte reicht. Im ComputerBase-Preisvergleich wird die Intel SSD Pro 6000p in vier Varianten mit 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB oder 1 TB aufgeführt. Detaillierte Spezifikationen fehlen noch, doch deutet sich bereits das Preisniveau an. Im europäischen Ausland werden folgende Preise genannt: Modell Preis* Intel SSD Pro 6000p 128GB, M.2 (SSDPEKKF128G7X1) ab 102,00 € Intel SSD Pro 6000p 256GB, M.2 (SSDPEKKF256G7X1) ab 138,60 € Intel SSD Pro 6000p 512GB, M.2 (SSDPEKKF512G7X1) ab 236,70 € Intel SSD Pro 6000p 1TB, M.2 (SSDPEKKF010T7X1) ab 418,78 € *EU-Übersicht im Preisvergleich, Stand 11.08.2016 Händler präzisieren den Formfaktor auf M.2 2280, die Module sind entsprechend 80 mm lang. Wie schon die besagte Roadmap verriet, kommt der gemeinsam mit Micron entwickelte 3D-TLC-NAND zum Einsatz. Leistungsdaten liegen zur Stunde nicht vor, doch verrät die gewählte Schnittstelle, dass Intel zumindest beim Lesen höhere Transferraten anpeilt. 600p günstiger als Pro 6000p Zur 600p-Serie mit den gleichen Basisspezifikationen liegen auch bereits Preise aus dem deutschen Online-Handel vor, die aber weitgehend den EU-Preisen entsprechen. Dabei zeichnet sich ein niedrigeres Preisniveau als bei den Pro 6000p ab. Worin sich beide Serien im Detail unterscheiden, bleibt zunächst unklar. Modell Preis* Intel SSD 600p 128GB, M.2 (SSDPEKKW128G7X1) ab 81,46 € Intel SSD 600p 256GB, M.2 (SSDPEKKW256G7X1) ab 128,03 € Intel SSD 600p 512GB, M.2 (SSDPEKKW512G7X1) ab 209,90 € Intel SSD 600p 1TB, M.2 (SSDPEKKW010T7X1) ab 373,93 € *DE-Übersicht im Preisvergleich, Stand 11.08.2016 Anzeige Intels Roadmap besagt, dass beide Serien für den Client-Bereich irgendwo zwischen dem bisherigen Mainstream-Angebot und den Workstation-SSDs bestimmt sind. Die M.2-NVMe-SSDs betreten ein von anderen Herstellern längst bedientes Terrain, auf dem sich unter anderem auch Samsungs neue PM961 oder Microns 2100 tummeln werden. Die PM961 taucht ebenfalls bereits im Preisvergleich auf, obgleich die Preisangaben teils fehlerhaft erscheinen.

Intel has a leaky bucket Posted Aug 11, 2016 by Megan Rose Dickey (@meganrosedickey) 0 SHARES Next Story AWS launches Kinesis Analytics for analyzing real-time streaming data This apparently bears repeating: putting resources toward attracting and hiring diverse candidates is useless if you can’t retain them. I’m looking at you, Intel. Intel, which last year made a $300 million commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace, released its mid-year diversity report yesterday, and the results are nothing to be proud about. Intel has until 2020 to hit its goal of employing a workforce that is representative of the talent available. But Intel, like most tech companies, is still predominantly white (53%) and male (~75%). Intel’s hiring of underrepresented minorities went up from 11.8% in 2015 to 13.1%, but the caveat is overall URM representation went down from 12.4% to 12.3%. It’s problematic that while the company has increased the rate of hiring underrepresented minorities (people of color), overall representation of POC has gone down at the company. intel diversity mid 2016 Screen Shot 2016-08-11 at 8.27.01 AM  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit This begs the question of why Intel is losing people of color. Intel says it’s related to the workforce restructuring that resulted in layoffs, but my theory is that it has something to do with the fact that not everyone at Intel is on board the diversity and inclusion train. Considering that employees have threatened Intel’s leadership team for its stance on diversity and inclusion, I would imagine that those people are less than welcoming to their diverse co-workers. Related Articles The other pipeline Facebook is slightly less white, but not any darker Rev. Jesse Jackson says Apple is 'setting the pace' around diversity and inclusion “One of the biggest learnings we’ve had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place,” Intel’s leadership team wrote in the report. “Through data we’ve gathered, conversations we’ve had with employees around the world, and new initiatives we’ve launched, we know we have more work to do to make Intel a place where every employee can bring their full selves to work, and where everyone is heard, valued, and feels they belong.” On the bright side, Intel has added a second woman to its board of directors, electrical engineering professor Dr. Tsu-Jae King Liu. Intel also highlighted its analysis of pay data cross racial identities for the first time, showing a 99% pay equity for URMs. Intel says it hopes to close the pay discrepancy gap by the end of this year.

Or just Ram and Gpu? - 08-11-2016, 04:00 | posts: 264 | Location: Savannah GA Hey! I have a 2010 Intel i7-860 3.6mhz and a Intel H57 with 5 series 3400 mobo/chipset with 1333mhz 8gb ddr3 Ram, Evga GTX 960 FTW ACX 2.0, PNY 240gb SSD, WD Black Cav 1tb 7200rpm HDD, and a Thermaltake 600w Psu. Should get rid of all of it and start fresh with a Skylake setup and ddr4 or just get some faster ddr3 Ram and a MSI GTX 1060? The reason I can't decide is I use Aida 64 and when run the list of benchmarks with my old i7-860 cpu is in the top 15 in almost every single test ahead of almost every AMD cpu and almost as fast as a i7-965 extreme so it's hard to let go of the old girl since there might be 20 cpu out there faster that's it! Anyway I just realized this Ram is only running at 1066mhz not the advertised 1333mhz so it's got to go but can't decide what else except I regret getting the Evga FTW GTX960 because it's the 2gb version and I only got it cause it was a deal and didn't have to order it so it went home with me the day I bought it. It runs great super cool 70c or under and sooooo quiet with the ACX 2.0 brushless motors but vram is too low and new platforms are blowing it away at less than $300. Help me decide what to do buy a whole new system other than storage and Psu or just Ram and Gpu? OR I am up for any other advice that you pros will share! Thanks! Here is one benchmark result for my old cpu but I removed about 20 results under mine to not use so much space and I get right at 8000 in 3D Mark Fire Strike Free Also faster than 47% of the systems.

Samsung will noch 2016 vor Intel liefern und zeigte diverse Benchmarks. Basierend auf der nicht flüchtigen Speichertechnik 3D Xpoint wollen Intel und Micron SSDs als Optane- und QuantX-Produkte verkaufen. Dieser sogenannte Storage Class Memory, der einerseits die Kapazität von Storage wie HDDs und SSDs liefern und andererseits (fast) die Geschwindigkeit von Arbeitsspeicher erreichen soll, wird von der Industrie als zukunftsweisender Schritt gesehen. Klar, dass da auch Samsung dabei sein will: Die Südkoreaner haben die Z-SSD entwickelt und auf dem Flash Memory Summit vorgestellt. Anzeige Samsungs Z-SSD soll schneller sein als eine mit PRAM. (Foto: Marc Sauter/Golem.de) Die Z-SSD soll noch in diesem Jahr als 1-TByte-Version erscheinen, womit Samsung Intel in die Parade fahren würde. Für 2017 sind Modelle mit 2 und 4 TByte angesetzt. Bei allen handelt es sich um Steckkarten mit schnellem PCIe-3.0-x8-Interface. Ob das NVMe-Protokoll verwendet wird, ist nicht ganz klar, erscheint aber wahrscheinlich. Neben einem neuen Controller nutzen die SSDs sogenannten Z-NAND, der wie der V-NAND v4 aus geschichteten Zellen bestehen soll. Welche Technik Samsung verwendet, bleibt offen - dem Messegeflüster zufolge könnten die Südkoreaner auf Flash mit 1-Bit-Zellen setzen. Auch die Balken sprechen dafür: Verglichen mit der eigenen PM963, einer 2-GB/s-NAND-Flash-SSD, und einem PRAM-Drive (was für Phase Change RAM, ähnlich 3D Xpoint, steht) soll der Z-NAND flotter Daten sequenziell lesen und eine geringere Latenz aufweisen. Zur Schreibrate und Haltbarkeit von Z-NAND äußerte sich Samsung nicht, bei der Energie-Effizienz wurde nur der (schlechter abschneidende) PRAM als Vergleich angegeben. Bei den Benchmarks handelt es sich übrigens um Schätzungen basierend auf Samsungs Emulator. Western Digital wollte erst auf Crosspoint-ReRAM setzen. (Foto: Marc Sauter/Golem.de) Western Digital sagte auf dem Flash Memory Summit, frühere Versuche mit einer Crosspoint-Struktur für Resistive RAM seien wenig erfolgreich gewesen. Der eigene Storage Class Memory werde daher auf geschichteten Speicherzellen basieren, also 3D-ReRAM. Bei resistivem RAM wird eine Dielektrikum-Schicht durch Spannung dazu gebracht, ihren Widerstand zu verändern. Einen Zeitplan für 3D-ReRAM hat Western Digital bisher nicht vorgelegt. 0 3 17 0 zur Startseite Kommentarübersicht So, und jetzt liefert alle mal schön cicero 11.

On Monday, the chipmaker said it had acquired the deep learning startup, making it one of several tech firms increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. By Max Lewontin, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Showgoers visit the Intel booth on the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2013. The chipmaker said Monday it had acquired the deep learning startup Nervana, joining several other tech firms that have increased their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. Rick Wilking/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of With Intel’s acquisition of the deep learning startup Nervana Systems on Monday, the chipmaker is moving further into artificial intelligence, a field that’s become a key focus for tech companies in recent years. Intel’s purchase of the company comes in the wake of Apple’s acquisition of Seattle-based Turi Inc.  last week, while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, and Samsung have also made similar deals. Those purchases – large tech firms have bought 31 AI startups since 2011 – according to the research firm CB Insights, also underscore a shift. While AI was once thought of as a sci-fi concept, the technology behind it has come to propel a slew of innovations by hardware and software companies that both attract attention – like self-driving cars – and ones that often go unnoticed, like product recommendations on Amazon. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says “Intel’s acquisition of [Nervana] is an acknowledgment that this area of deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, is really an important part of all companies going forward," says David Schubmehl, an analyst who focuses on the field at the research firm IDC. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Intel also purchased Saffron Technologies , which aims to solve complex problems using “cognitive computing,” last fall. But, Mr. Schubmehl tells The Christian Science Monitor, “I think this [recent purchase] is noteworthy because it provides [Intel] with both software and hardware technology.” Nervana’s focus, deep learning, builds on advances in machine learning, the idea of training a computer to “think” and recognize patterns. Deep learning expands so-called neural networks, which are modeled on the human brain, to a much larger scale, allowing a computer to perform tasks such as recognizing an image of a cat without necessarily having prior knowledge of what a cat looked like.  For Intel, which has focused on cloud-based computing systems, machine learning represents a necessary step to contend with the reams of data they generate.  “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, told Recode. Working with Nervana also offers Intel an opportunity to expand machine learning capabilities in its own chips, rather than simply having software that works on top of them, Recode reports. For many users, these technologies often go unnoticed, Schubmehl notes.  “Do you really spend time thinking about when Amazon says ‘Hey, other people like this product, would you be interested in this product?’” he asks.  “That’s a product of machine learning, but you don’t think of it that way. You just look at as ‘Gee, Amazon actually knows me a little better than other people, and they’re recommending products that I’m actually interested in,’” he adds. In other cases, users have been quick to point to concerns about potential biases hidden in such algorithm-driven technologies. Last year, some complained when they noticed that the first result for a Google search for “female CEO” was a Barbie doll. In June, a video showing that a Google search for “three black teenagers” produced a series of mugshots , in sharp contrast to a search for “three white teenagers,” went viral. Civil libertarians and researchers have also expressed alarm about what happens when such technology is combined with personal data about users, as in tech firm Samsung’s acquisition of the “big data” company Joyent. “I think that a company that is involved in manufacturing devices that people hold so close to their hearts, it behooves them to tread very carefully,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Monitor in June. But at this point, many companies' focus on machine learning shows little sign of slowing down, Schubmehl says. For businesses making hardware, whether Intel, the carmaker Tesla, or the power titan GE, the technology offers the ability to integrate their products with software in a variety of ways. Self-driving buses , or robotic manufacturing equipment, he notes, are two of the results. "At some point it will change enterprise software, and technology in general, so that everything is machine learning-enabled in one fashion or another, so it will slow down at that point," he says. "But, I think for the foreseeable future, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘dumb’ software out there that has to be made smart."

Bigelow August 11th, 2016 @bvbigelow @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints On the day after Intel announced its acquisition of San Diego machine learning startup Nervana Systems, investor Steve Jurvetson told me he was feeling a sense of satisfaction about a call he made three years ago, and how it has been playing out. In a 2013 panel discussion at Silicon Valley’s Churchill Club, the DFJ partner said “machine learning” was his pick as the most important tech trend to watch for the next three to five years. “Just about anything you’ve heard [about] at Google that sounds interesting and new is based on machine learning,” Jurvetson said at the time. “Everywhere, technology is starting to percolate into an otherwise prosaic, non-tech industry—apply big data, apply machine learning—and revolutionize it.” Just over a year later, Jurvetson led the Series A round of venture funding for Nervana Systems. Now, more than two years after Nervana was founded, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has endorsed Jurvetson’s top tech trend of 2013 by acquiring Nervana in a deal reportedly valued at more than $408 million (according to Recode). “It’s not that often in a VC career you get to work with teams you’re sure will be featured in documentaries about how major industries changed,” wrote Matt Ocko of Data Collective Venture Capital, which joined DFJ in Nervana’s initial venture funding. “We can’t wait to see their next set of breakthroughs, delivered at even greater speed, with Intel behind them.” (In the 2-1/2 years since it was founded, Nervana raised roughly $25 million. In addition to DFJ and Data Collective, other investors include Playground Global, CME Ventures, Lux Capital, Allen & Co, AME Cloud Ventures, Fuel Capital, Omidyar Technology Ventures, SV Angel, and unnamed seed investors.) Nervana Systems co-founders (and Qualcomm expats) Naveen Rao, Amir Khosrowshahi, and Arjun Bansal set out to develop new artificial intelligence technology that emulates the human brain, where thousands of synapses transmit information between each neuron. The co-founders integrated their specialized expertise in neuroscience, distributed computing, and networking . As CEO Rao wrote in a blog post Monday, “Nervana started with the idea that we can engineer better solutions for computation by bringing together computer engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning.” Rao added, “With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies.” Intel’s Diane Bryant with Nervana’s co-founders Naveen Rao, Arjun Bansal, Amir Khosrowshaki and Intel vice president Jason Waxman (photo courtesy Intel). As Jurvetson drove between meetings yesterday afternoon, he said machine learning continues to be a top tech trend. In a self-described “sweeping generalization,” he declared that the new generation of iterative algorithms in computational mathematics that are being applied in machine learning, directed evolution, and generative design “is the most important advance in engineering since the scientific method.” Nervana initially developed a software-based model of its technology, based on Nvidia graphics processors. Earlier this year, Nervana began offering its AI technology in the cloud to business customers, using a software-as-a-service model. For example, Nervana’s Web-based software has been used to help Paradigm software analyze prospective oil and gas fields, identify irregular trading patterns for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and enable Blue River Technology to refine its computer vision technology for use in agriculture. At the same time, Nervana has been advancing its machine learning technology on a different front by developing a new type of semiconductor architecture based on the company’s neural-based approach to AI. A Nervana “AI semiconductor” would appear to be ideally suited for Intel, as it enables the chipmaker to integrate machine learning into the silicon of Intel’s proprietary chip design—instead of running in the software atop graphics processors made by Nvidia and other chipmakers. In a blog post that recaps the Nervana story, Jurvetson writes that one of the pre-eminent engineers hired by Nervana figured out how to rework the undocumented firmware of Nvidia’s processors to run deep learning algorithms faster than off-the-shelf GPUs “or anything else Facebook could find.” Nervana says the souped-up capabilities of its Neon software framework enable it to run 10 times faster on Nvidia processors—faster even than Nvidia’s own software framework. While speed is always important in computer processing, it becomes especially important in machine learning, which rely on iterative algorithms that allow computers to learn patterns and data without explicit programming instructions. Jurvetson writes that similar innovations in Nervana’s chip design will enable the company’s forthcoming chip to perform 55 trillion operations per second, with multiple high-speed interconnects typically seen in the networking industry making it possible to tie “a matrix of chips together into unprecedented compute fabrics.” Nervana, which now has 48 employees, plans to remain in San Diego and operate under its own brand name. Combining Nervana’s expertise in artificial intelligence with Intel’s capabilities, technology resources, and huge market reach, Rao wrote, “will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special.” Nervana Systems co-founders (from left) Arjun Bansal, Amir Khosrowshahi, and Naveen Rao.

Colin Johnson, EETimes 8/10/2016 08:47 PM EDT LAKE WALES, Fla.—Intel will announce its intention to acquire Nervana Systems at its Intel Developer Forum next week (IDF 2016, San Francisco, Calif., August 16-to-18)—a bid to obsolete the graphics processor unit (GPU) for deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Intel dominates the high-performance computing (HPC) market, but Nvidia has made significant inroads into deep learning verticals with its sophisticated GPUs. However, Nervana Systems (Palo Alto, Calif.) has already made a significant dent in Nvidia's Cuda software for its GPUs with Nervana's Neon cloud service that is Cuda-compatible. Intel, however, is acquiring Nervana for its promised deep-learning accelerator chip, which it promises by 2017. If the chip plays out as advertised, Intel will sell Deep Learning accelerator hardware boards that beat Nvidia's GPU boards, while its newly acquired Neon cloud service will outperform Nvidia's Cuda software.

On Monday, the chipmaker said it had acquired the deep learning startup, making it one of several tech firms increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. By Max Lewontin, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Showgoers visit the Intel booth on the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2013. The chipmaker said Monday it had acquired the deep learning startup Nervana, joining several other tech firms that have increased their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. Rick Wilking/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of With Intel’s acquisition of the deep learning startup Nervana Systems on Monday, the chipmaker is moving further into artificial intelligence, a field that’s become a key focus for tech companies in recent years. Intel’s purchase of the company comes in the wake of Apple’s acquisition of Seattle-based Turi Inc.  last week, while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, and Samsung have also made similar deals. Those purchases – large tech firms have bought 31 AI startups since 2011 – according to the research firm CB Insights, also underscore a shift. While AI was once thought of as a sci-fi concept, the technology behind it has come to propel a slew of innovations by hardware and software companies that both attract attention – like self-driving cars – and ones that often go unnoticed, like product recommendations on Amazon. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says “Intel’s acquisition of [Nervana] is an acknowledgment that this area of deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, is really an important part of all companies going forward," says David Schubmehl, an analyst who focuses on the field at the research firm IDC. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Intel also purchased Saffron Technologies , which aims to solve complex problems using “cognitive computing,” last fall. But, Mr. Schubmehl tells The Christian Science Monitor, “I think this [recent purchase] is noteworthy because it provides [Intel] with both software and hardware technology.” Nervana’s focus, deep learning, builds on advances in machine learning, the idea of training a computer to “think” and recognize patterns. Deep learning expands so-called neural networks, which are modeled on the human brain, to a much larger scale, allowing a computer to perform tasks such as recognizing an image of a cat without necessarily having prior knowledge of what a cat looked like.  For Intel, which has focused on cloud-based computing systems, machine learning represents a necessary step to contend with the reams of data they generate.  “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, told Recode. Working with Nervana also offers Intel an opportunity to expand machine learning capabilities in its own chips, rather than simply having software that works on top of them, Recode reports. For many users, these technologies often go unnoticed, Schubmehl notes.  “Do you really spend time thinking about when Amazon says ‘Hey, other people like this product, would you be interested in this product?’” he asks.  “That’s a product of machine learning, but you don’t think of it that way. You just look at as ‘Gee, Amazon actually knows me a little better than other people, and they’re recommending products that I’m actually interested in,’” he adds. In other cases, users have been quick to point to concerns about potential biases hidden in such algorithm-driven technologies. Last year, some complained when they noticed that the first result for a Google search for “female CEO” was a Barbie doll. In June, a video showing that a Google search for “three black teenagers” produced a series of mugshots , in sharp contrast to a search for “three white teenagers,” went viral. Civil libertarians and researchers have also expressed alarm about what happens when such technology is combined with personal data about users, as in tech firm Samsung’s acquisition of the “big data” company Joyent. “I think that a company that is involved in manufacturing devices that people hold so close to their hearts, it behooves them to tread very carefully,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Monitor in June. But at this point, many companies' focus on machine learning shows little sign of slowing down, Schubmehl says. For businesses making hardware, whether Intel, the carmaker Tesla, or the power titan GE, the technology offers the ability to integrate their products with software in a variety of ways. Self-driving buses , or robotic manufacturing equipment, he notes, are two of the results. "At some point it will change enterprise software, and technology in general, so that everything is machine learning-enabled in one fashion or another, so it will slow down at that point," he says. "But, I think for the foreseeable future, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘dumb’ software out there that has to be made smart."

Clear Linux Continues To Have Graphics Performance Advantage Over Ubuntu Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 11 August 2016. Page 1 of 3. 21 Comments Earlier this week I published some Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux OpenGL benchmarks showing how the native gaming performance is different between the competing platforms. Ubuntu Linux lost nearly all of those results with the Intel Mesa driver to Windows 10. In this article are those previous benchmarks plus now having Intel Clear Linux benchmarks added in the mix. Months ago in previous tests we've found Clear Linux to have faster Linux graphics performance than other distributions. Clear Linux 9810 was used for benchmarking and was powered by the Linux 4.7 kernel and Mesa 12.0. Ubuntu 16.04 was tested out-of-the-box with Linux 4.4 and Mesa 11.2 while also testing Ubuntu 16.04 when upgraded to Linux 4.7 and Mesa 12.1-dev Git. Windows 10 was using the latest proprietary Intel graphics driver. The same Intel Core i5 6600K system was used accross testing. If you're new here, the reason why in the system table the CPU frequency is different just comes down to the different distributions using different CPU scaling drivers reporting base vs. turbo frequency, etc. Same goes for any other hardware reported differences: the same system was used during testing. In the earlier aforelinked Windows vs. Ubuntu testing, various Steam games were also tested in addition to the various tests exposed by the Phoronix Test Suite. However, Clear Linux doesn't yet support Steam: there's a mess of 32-bit libraries not packaged by the distribution. Hopefully Valve will migrate the Steam Linux client to being pure 64-bit soon enough, but for now at least there isn't the ability to run Steam games on Clear Linux. For those new to Clear Linux, it's also worth mentioning that only Intel graphics are supported with the Nouveau and Radeon DRM drivers being deactivated. Anyhow, for those curious how Clear Linux with its latest packages are comparing to Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10, the latest numbers are on the pages ahead.

Representational image. Reuters According to a report by India Today, the BBMP has come up with a very unique method to extract the dues. It has decided to teach the employees of the IT company to love a stinky office if the IT giant fails to pay its taxes. The Intel employees were greeted by a pile of garbage when they reached their office. The BBMP officials had blocked the gates of the firm’s premises in Belandur with trucks filled with garbage, the India Today report added. The Hindu quoted sources as saying that some officials even threatened to dump the garbage inside the office if the company did not pay up property tax dues to the civic body. The standing committee on taxation and finance found that Intel had defaulted tax payment between 2007 and 2008 of around Rs 34 crore. Intel challenged this in court. However, after valid documentation, the BBMP managed to convince the court how Intel defaulted, according to reports. Intel ignored several court warnings to pay half of the due amount by 25 July. India Today quoted the Joint Commissioner of the Mahadevapura zone, BBMP, Muniveerappa as saying that the company had been calculating its taxes on the basis that it was not an air conditioned office, but the reality was that it was centrally air conditioned. He also said that after Intel authorities gave a written undertaking that they would pay half of the dues by 28 August, the garbage trucks were removed from the office gate. Apart from BBMP, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) too has come up with innovative ways to make defaulters pay their dues. According to its recent notice, the BMC will now seize movable property such as computers, furniture, sofas, televisions, refrigerators, air-conditioners and other valuables if they don’t pay up by the due date, reported The Indian Express. It also plans on sealing the lifts, building material and entrance of the building to restrict its usage to recover the property tax due on land, according to the policy.

(Photo: Remy Gabalda, AFP Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Intel has committed $300 million to ensure that by 2020 its staff mirrors what it calls the market availability of the U.S. tech workforce. But even that kind of cash doesn't buy overnight success. In the tech company's latest mid-year diversity report released Wednesday, most of Intel's key metrics remained flat or ticked up slightly despite concerted efforts in the past six months to target women and minorities in the hiring process. "One of the biggest learnings we’ve had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," read a note accompanying the report, which was signed by CEO Brian Krzanich, Diversity and Inclusion chief Aisha Evans and Human Resources leader Danielle Brown. Currently, Intel is 53% white and 32% Asian, a skew that is generally reflective of tech companies - from Google and Apple to small startups — as they continue to grapple with the challenge of creating a workforce that better reflects the U.S. population. USA TODAY EEOC to hold rare public hearing on tech diversity While tech firm leaders long resisted revealing the overwhelmingly white and male make-up of their work force, pressure from both media outlets and activist groups such as Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition have since made reporting diversity efforts almost de rigueur as prospective employees look for companies that reflect their own values. Achieving workplace diversity also goes beyond social justice or mere optics, as many researchers have noted that a diverse workforce typically correlates to increased corporate performance as employees are better able to anticipate the needs of a broad consumer base. Many companies now have diversity on their front burner, dedicating resources to in-house diversity programs and nontraditional outreach programs in efforts that often are led by senior leaders focusing solely on diversity and inclusion. But despite this new-found emphasis, progress is slow. In a report last month, Facebook revealed that its employee makeup has changed little over the past years despite the social media giant's intent on looking less homogeneous. Apple was the latest tech company to update its diversity numbers. Last week, the Cupertino, Calif.-based iPhone-maker revealed that its non-white workforce grew by a percentage point, although white employees also increased by 2% to 56%. African-American employees went from 8% to 9%, Hispanics from 11% to 12% and Asians from 18% to 19%. USA TODAY Few minorities in non-tech jobs in Silicon Valley, USA TODAY finds Among the key findings in Intel's latest report: female employees inched up to 25.4% from 24.8% in December 2015, while underrepresented minorities (URMs) decreased slightly to 12.3% from 12.4%. Among URMs, African-American staffing increased to 3.7% from 3.5%, while Hispanics dropped to 8% from 8.4%. The U.S. workforce currently consists of 58% women, 16% Hispanics and 12% African-Americans, according to the Department of Labor. On the hiring front, Intel's efforts remained flat with women and minorities accounting for 43.4% of all hires, compared to 43.1% in December. Of that 43.4%, 13.1% were URMs, a notable jump from the 9% figure logged in December 2014. The company also said it was at 99% pay equity for URMs. Gender pay equity is at 100%. USA TODAY Intel diversity stats show slow pace of progress Women in senior company positions grew to 18.2% from 16.5% six months ago, while those in leadership positions also increased slightly to 18.7% from 17.6%. URM representation in senior positions inched up to 6.4% from 5.8%, while those in leadership roles hit 6.9% from 6.3%. Intel also announced it had added a second woman to its board of directors, University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor Tsu-Jae King Liu. The company also noted a need to improve its retention efforts, as adding new women and minorities to the payroll can easily be offset by departing employees who don't find the environment welcoming. Intel also is grappling with a challenging business market, as it looks to reinvent itself from a chip-maker to a provider of cloud-based services powering Internet of Things devices. In April, Intel announced it would be laying off 12,000 employees, or about 11% of its global workforce.

The Redmond, Wash.-based company previously had said it would pull Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 support for systems using Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake processors as early as 2017. Thursday the company said it had extended that deadline. “Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows. At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment time frames. We listened to this feedback and … we have extended the support period,” said Shad Larsen, director of Windows Business Planning, in a blog post. [Related: As Windows 10 Free Upgrade Expires, Anniversary Update Is Set To Launch] Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, said in a January blog post that after July 17, 2017, only the “most critical” security fixes would be released for systems with a Skylake processor running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 -- and Windows 10 would be the only supported Windows platform for Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processors, expected to hit the market later this year. Now, Windows 7 and 8.1 will be supported with all security updates on Skylake processors until their end of life. The compatibility and security fixes will be published until Jan. 14, 2020, for Windows 7, and Jan. 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1, according to Microsoft. Joe Balsarotti, president of Software To Go, a St. Peters, Mo.-based Microsoft partner, said the extension is “great news.” “The initial announcement didn't seem to make sense to me as it gave AMD an obvious invitation to take market share for anyone with 'real-world' refresh cycles,” he said. David Felton, founder of Microsoft partner Canaan Technology, Norwalk, Conn., said many of his company's customers would be upset if their Windows 7 support on new, Skylake-powered devices ended in a year. “Most of our clients are on a three- to five-year refresh cycle, and … bought new hardware with Windows 7,” he said. “So many clients are completing their second year of the upgrade cycle, and would be upset to find out their Windows 7 support would end in a year.” Since the operating system’s release last July, Microsoft has been pushing customers to upgrade to Windows 10 by using techniques that some see as aggressive. For instance, if customers who had not yet upgraded clicked on a Red X at the bottom of the Windows 10 updates box, the computer would automatically begin upgrading as opposed to clicking out of the window. Following widespread criticism, Microsoft in June said it would make the upgrade process easier and more clear.

By Nick Heath | August 12, 2016, 6:06 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus The Windows 7 desktop. Image: TechRepublic Microsoft has gone back on an earlier decision to prematurely end support for Windows 7 and 8.1, in the firm's latest concession to businesses in no rush to upgrade to Windows 10. The tech giant yesterday announced it will support Windows 7 and 8.1 on PCs running on Intel Skylake processors until the official end of support for these operatings systems — January 2020 for Windows 7 and January 2023 for Windows 8.1. It marks a reversal of Microsoft's decision in January this year to phase out support for Windows 7 and 8.1 on PCs running on Intel Skylake processors ahead of the official date for the end of support. At the time, Microsoft said that support would end for Windows 7 and 8.1 systems running on Skylake processors in July 2017. It later pushed that date back to July 2018.

Microsoft's u-turn means that Windows 7 and 8.1 systems running on Skylake will now get all security updates until support officially ends, as opposed to only receiving 'critical' updates. The company's change of heart was prompted by the need to give businesses more times to upgrade from Windows 7 and 8.1, said Shad Larsen, director of Windows Business Planning at Microsoft. "We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes," he said. Microsoft's decision is the latest in a series of measures designed to appeal to businesses that want to continue running Windows 7. Earlier in the year, Microsoft announced the release of the Windows 7 SP1 convenience rollup, a collection of security and other updates for the seven-year-old operating system. By most estimates, Windows 7 is by far the most popular Windows operating system and still used by most businesses today. Microsoft's Shad was also keen to stress that the decision to improve support for Windows 7 had not been prompted by lacklustre demand for Windows 10 among businesses. "Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows," he said. Analysts predict that from 2017 onwards businesses will begin moving to Windows 10 in earnest. "2017 will be a big year for enterprise upgrades. Many organizations are already piloting Windows 10 devices, but in 2017 they will be driven by security concerns," Forrester principal analyst JP Gownder told TechRepublic earlier this year, citing the OS' support for security features such as application containerization, faster updates and anti-malware instructions built into Skylake processors. Skylake processors were first released at the end of last year. There are still some restrictions when it comes to support for Windows 7 and 8.1 machines running on Skylake processors. To be eligible to continue receiving updates until the end of support, the Skylake PC will need to be one of the models on Microsoft's list of approved machines. Machines that use even newer processors will not receive updates for Windows 7 and 8.1, however, and will need to running Windows 10 to ensure continued support. These include processors in Intel's Kabylake family, due before the end of 2016, AMD's Bristol Ridge, due this year, and Qualcomm's 8996/Snapdragon 820 architecture.

The decision essentially delays the retirement of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 for a good few years, and comes as Microsoft insists that businesses are adopting Windows 10 at a faster rate than previous versions of the operating system. Support Extension That said, Microsoft admitted in a blog post that some commercial customers have systems that require longer deployment timeframes. “We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates,” it said. This policy change primarily applies to Redmond’s commercial customers. So what are the new deadlines. Well support for Windows 7 has been extended to 14 January 2020, whereas support for Windows 8.1 will end 10 January 2023. And Microsoft said that customers using six generation Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until those dates. “This change is designed to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10,” wrote Microsoft. It said there are now over 350 million devices on Windows 10 and more than 135 billion hours of use since the launch. But there are concerns that despite the offer of a free upgrade, and some questionable tactics, Windows 10 might miss its target of one billion installations by 2018. That said, by most metrics Windows 10 has been a success for the company. “We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software,” Microsoft said. Earlier this month Microsoft released its Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which is said to be more secure, faster and boasts another improvements as well. Mobile Confusion Confusion meanwhile still surrounds Microsoft’s intention in the mobile space. Windows Phone is being quietly retired and the company has effectively withdrawn from the consumer mobile space after the sale of its feature phone business, and the brutal gutting of its phone workforce. However Microsoft continues to insist that it is still committed to running Windows 10 on mobiles, is reportedly working on new smartphones, but these seem to be aimed at the business and not the consumer segment.

Argggh, my back! A bigger splash: The mathematics of spilling beer Some clever folks have started an experiment that will hunt for signs of alien civilisations using the Murchison Widefield Array – a low frequency radio telescope in western Australia. Eggheads at Curtin University, Down Under, and the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy, have published a paper outlining the experiment today in the Astrophysical Journal. In order to understand the nature of life in the universe, you have to look for it. Researchers at the SETI institute in California have a long history of using high-frequency radio waves to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Interestingly, though, this experiment by the Aussies and Italians uses low frequency radio waves in the range of 103 to 133MHz. Past experiments were conducted at 1.4 to 1.7GHz range, also known as the “water hole” as it was where the radio spectral lines produced by neutral hydrogen and hydroxyl (OH) could be found. The presence of water is often associated with the possibility of life as it is considered a crucial component of life. “That radio band is the cornerstone for of communications technologies on Earth, and it could be reasonably assumed that a similar path has been taken by extraterrestrial civilisations,” the paper said. The pilot study will be performed using the Murchison Widefield Array, chosen for its high sensitivity, prime radio range, large field of view and is a located in an extremely radio quiet area over 200km inland from the western Australian coast. The telescope will cover 400 square degrees field of view, where 45 exoplanets in 38 planetary systems known. Radio spectra from those systems will be analysed to find the limits on the presence of narrow line emission - which could signify the presence of chemicals suitable for life. The researchers hope to carry further experiments into using low frequency waves using the Square Kilometre Array, a large multi-telescope project to be built in two sites: one in South Africa and the other close to Murchfield's silent perch in Australia. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 39 Comments More from The Register Spoiler alert: We'll bet boffins still haven't spotted aliens Spectral modulation looks like 233 coincidences too many 54 Comments Russian billionaire: GET me the ALIENS ON THE PHONE.

Does Windows 10 Need Brand-Specific Hardware? Q. Does Windows 10 Need Brand-Specific Hardware? Aug 11, 2016 Fred Langa EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement Q. According to an Italian PC magazine, due to a special partnership between Intel and Microsoft, Windows 10 performs at its best only on a PC/tablet whose hardware is specifically designed for this purpose. Therefore no machine born to work with Windows 7 or 8 is really suitable. Is all this true? A. No. Win10’s hardware requirements are actually rather modest, as the Windows 10 Specifications page states. I’m running Win10 on some PCs from the XP and Vista eras, and they’re working fine. In fact, in some cases, those older PCs actually run a skosh faster under Win10 than they did with their original operating systems. I don't have a copy of the article you read. Perhaps it may have been referring to some special-purpose Windows 10 features such as “Windows Hello,” which has features like facial recognition, iris (eye) recognition, or fingerprint scanning -- all of which needs specialized hardware. Facial recognition, for example, requires an illuminated infrared camera; fingerprint scanning requires an appropriate optical- or capacitance-based device; and so on. Other nonessential features also require specialized hardware. See the full list on the Windows 10 specifications page. But these optional technologies have nothing to do with Win10’s basic functionality. Again, Windows 10 runs just fine on most older hardware. * Editor's note: We feature an abridged Q&A from Fred Langa's LANGALIST, a column available exclusively to paid subscribers of the Windows Secrets newsletter,.

Aug 12 2016 at 10:00 AM Updated Aug 12 2016 at 10:07 AM Save article Print Diversity is hard to achieve even with ambitious goals and a generous budget Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Despite an ambitious goal and a generous budget, Intel is making slow progress on transforming its workforce. Getty Images by Marco della Cava Technology company Intel has committed $US300 million ($389 million) to ensure that by 2020 its staff mirrors what it calls the market availability of the US tech workforce. But even that kind of cash doesn't buy overnight success. In the company's latest mid-year diversity report released on Wednesday, most of Intel's key metrics remained flat or ticked up slightly despite concerted efforts in the past six months to target women and minorities in the hiring process. "One of the biggest learnings we've had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," read a note accompanying the report, which was signed by CEO Brian Krzanich, diversity and inclusion chief Aisha Evans and human resources leader Danielle Brown. Currently, Intel is 53 per cent white and 32 per cent Asian, a skew that is generally reflective of tech companies – from Google and Apple to small start-ups – as they continue to grapple with the challenge of creating a workforce that better reflects the US population.

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Beyond social justice While tech firm leaders long resisted revealing the overwhelmingly white and male composition of their work force, pressure from media outlets and activist groups such as Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition have since made reporting diversity efforts almost de rigueur as prospective employees look for companies that reflect their own values. Achieving workplace diversity also goes beyond social justice or mere optics, as many researchers have noted that a diverse workforce typically correlates to increased corporate performance as employees are better able to anticipate the needs of a broad consumer base. Many companies now have diversity on their front burner, dedicating resources to in-house diversity programs and non-traditional outreach programs in efforts that often are led by senior leaders focusing solely on diversity and inclusion. But despite this new-found emphasis, progress is slow. In a report last month, Facebook revealed that its employee make up has changed little over the past years despite the social media giant's intent on looking less homogeneous. Underrepresented minorities Apple was the latest tech company to update its diversity numbers. Last week, the iPhone-maker revealed that its non-white workforce grew by a percentage point, although white employees also increased by 2 per cent to 56 per cent. African-American employees went from 8 per cent to 9 per cent, Hispanics from 11 per cent to 12 per cent and Asians from 18 per cent to 19 per cent. Among the key findings in Intel's latest report: female employees inched up to 25.4 per cent from 24.8 per cent in December 2015, while underrepresented minorities (URMs) decreased slightly to 12.3 per cent from 12.4 per cent. Among URMs, African-American staffing increased to 3.7 per cent from 3.5 per cent, while Hispanics dropped to 8 per cent from 8.4 per cent. The US workforce currently consists of 47 per cent women, 16 per cent Hispanics and 12 per cent African-Americans, according to the Department of Labor. On the hiring front, Intel's efforts remained flat with women and minorities accounting for 43.4 per cent of all hires, compared to 43.1 per cent in December. Of that 43.4 per cent, 13.1 per cent were URMs, a notable jump from the 9 per cent figure logged in December 2014. The company also said it was at 99 per cent pay equity for URMs. Gender pay equity is at 100 per cent. Need to improve retention Women in senior company positions grew to 18.2 per cent from 16.5 per cent six months ago, while those in leadership positions also increased slightly to 18.7 per cent from 17.6 per cent. URM representation in senior positions inched up to 6.4 per cent from 5.8 per cent, while those in leadership roles hit 6.9 per cent from 6.3 per cent. Intel also announced it had added a second woman to its board of directors, University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor Tsu-Jae King Liu. The company also noted a need to improve its retention efforts, as adding new women and minorities to the payroll can easily be offset by departing employees who don't find the environment welcoming. Intel also is grappling with a challenging business market, as it looks to reinvent itself from a chip-maker to a provider of cloud-based services powering Internet of Things devices. In April, Intel announced it would be laying off 12,000 employees, or about 11 per cent of its global workforce.

This was ostensibly a move to force more users to upgrade to Windows 10, or else face the possibility of losing access to security updates. The folks in Redmond, Washington justified the move at the time, citing the “advanced” age of the operating systems. Microsoft did, however, give some of its top OEM partners a reprieve, exempting select machines from its banhammer. Needless to say, reaction from enthusiasts came swiftly and viciously. Microsoft backpedaled a bit two months later, extending the cutoff date for full support to July 17th, 2018. Microsoft also at the time announced that Skylake users would receive critical updates through the end of the extended support period for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, which ends on January 14th, 2020 and January 10th, 2023 respectively. Microsoft is now cutting through the confusion surrounding Skylake support, and is declaring that ALL Skylake machines running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be FULLY supported until the extended support period ends for each operating system. Shad Larsen, Microsoft Director of Windows Business Planning, writes: We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy. We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates. So not only will Skylake machines running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 receive critical updates, but they will receive ALL applicable security updates going forward. According to Microsoft, this change was made possible due to “the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing.” However, Microsoft customers will need to be aware that newer Intel and AMD processors (i.e. Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10. Microsoft goes on to state that “all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.” Tags:  Intel, Microsoft, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Skylake, (nasdaq:msft) Via:  Microsoft Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Ubuntu Based Zorin OS 12 Linux Could Be...32 Netflix 4K Streaming Comes To PC, But...11 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Mocks Apple...9 Apple Reportedly Throttling iPhone 7...8 NVIDIA Offers Free Gears Of War 4...5 Microsoft Rumored To Include x86 on...4 Stanford Study Shows That Students Are...4 FEATURED Hot Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Tablets,...

Shortly after CES wrapped up in January Terry Myerson revealed this new plan on the official Windows blog. At that time their policy towards the Skylake chipset was to provide driver and system support to a very specific set of Skylake based devices for Windows 7 and 8.1 users. The other aspect of this new plan was to only support Windows 7 and 8.1 on those devices until 17 July 2017 which at that time was just 18 months down the road. Of course, Windows 10 was built for that type of new chipset and beyond so support for it was not considered an issue. As you might imagine, the reaction was swift and loud to the idea that Windows 7 and 8.1 would only be supported on newer devices running Skylake for just 18 months. Then just two months later in March Microsoft announced their plans to modify this support policy and adjust the end of support for Windows 7 and 8.1 running on Skylake to expire on 17 July 2018 and give organizations an extra year to make their migration over to Windows 10. They also revealed that security related fixes for Windows 7 and 8.1, which were originally due to expire at the end of this new support policy, would be made available for those systems on Skylake until the operating system end of support dates of 14 January 2020 and 10 January 2023 respectively. This was considered a pretty significant backtrack on their original announcement in January. However, the changes to this policy were not done as we learned today from Microsoft. In a new blog post on the official Windows blog site, Shad Larsen the Director of Windows Business Planning, what is hopefully the final change to this silicon support policy. He details the following key items in that article: Today Windows 7 is in extended support and support will end for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, and support for Windows 8.1 will end January 10, 2023. 6th Gen Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. As previously communicated earlier this year, future silicon platforms including Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (e.g. Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10. Despite extending support on these chipsets until the OS's themselves are no longer actively supported Microsoft does not want customers waiting around to migrate to Windows 10: "We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software. Our commitment to all of our customers remains strong and we’re grateful for your ongoing support."

Roston - Aug 11, 2016 6 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Want the style and durability of a ThinkPad with the budget-friendliness and speed of a Chromebook? Enter Lenovo’s ThinkPad 13 Chromebook, a version of its ThinkPad 13 laptop that runs Google’s Chrome OS. High-end Chromebooks have become more common over the past couple years; we’ve seen such offerings from Dell, for example, and now the latest is the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook. Particularly notable with the model is the inclusion of UBS-C ports, but that’s just a small sliver of what the laptop has to offer. Is Lenovo’s Thinkpad 13 Chromebook the Chrome OS business laptop you’ve been waiting for? Read our full review to find out! Hardware The Lenovo Thinkpad 13 Chromebook looks like the expansive array of other Thinkpad laptops available, with one notable exception: the small Chrome emblem on the lid that any Chromebook user will be familiar with. That aside, you’re getting a Thinkpad is every regard when it comes to design, and that includes durability. According to Lenovo, the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook is tested to military specifications across a dozen different durability tests. The laptop is, overall, thin and light, measuring 19.8mm thin and 3.2lbs/1.4kg in weight. This is a USB-C laptop, and like many others cropping up on the market, includes two USB-C ports instead of one. Displays are often one source of complaints when it comes to Chromebooks, which is perhaps why Lenovo is offering an optional Full HD 1080p IPS display with the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook. The model I reviewed features this panel, and it is very nice to behold with crisp colors and sharp lines. This particular screen option also boasts a 180-degree viewing angle. In the future (Lenovo describes it as “soon”), you’ll also have the option of getting a touch panel. Among the laptop’s more welcoming features is the inclusion of dual noise-cancelling microphones, an arguably necessary feature for a business laptop (as impromptu Skype sessions may happen when your headset isn’t available). The Thinkpad 13 Chromebook also features a 720p high-definition webcam with face tracking and wide viewing angles. The webcam appears atypically sensitive in low-light conditions; video quality in an averagely lit office is very nice. The display, as shown in the image above, can be laid completely flat. Typing, meanwhile, is aided by two large rubber feet on the rear of the laptop, elevating it slightly to put the keyboard at a more comfortable angle. The keyboard itself is distinctly that of a Thinkpad, very comfortable to type on with a nice level of resistance and relatively silent operation. One of the nicer aspects of the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook is its level of available customization options. As you can see in the specs below, you have three different processors to choose from, a trio of display options, and more. TECH SPECS Processor: — Intel® Core™ i5-6300U Processor — Intel® Core™ i3-6100U Processor — Intel® Celeron® 3855U Processor Operating System: Chrome OS Graphics: Intel® Integrated Graphics Webcam: 720p Camera Memory: Up to 8 GB LPDDR3, 1600 MHz Storage: 16GB / 32GB EMMC Audio: 3.5 mm Combo Audio Battery: Up to 10 Hours (42 WHr) Display: — 13.3″ HD (1366 x 768) TN, 200 nits — 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, 220 nits — 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS, Touch (coming soon) Dimensions (W x D x H): — (inches) : 12.68″ x 8.78″ x 0.78″ — (mm) : 322 x 223 x 19.8 Weight: Starting at 3.2 lbs (1.4 kg) Keyboard: Standard Keyboard MIL-SPEC: Yes – 12 Methods I/O (Input/Output) Ports: — 2 x USB 3.0 — 2 x USB Type-C — 3.5 mm Headphone / Microphone WiFi: Intel Stone Peak 7265 AC/B/G/N Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.0 Software & Performance Because this Thinkpad is a Chromebook, our regular Geekbench benchmarks don’t apply, and most usage scenarios for the laptop aren’t going to be very demanding at all — a Chromebook is something you use to watch video, put together presentations, edit photos, check and send emails, perform general word processing activities, and maybe play a game or two during your downtime. Most people with these modest needs get a Chromebook for two reasons: they’re a low-cost way to do these simple tasks, they’re fast, and they have a long battery life. After using the Thinkpad 13 Chromebook for all of the above tasks (except putting together a presentation, alas), I can say it hits both of those goals. The battery life does indeed fall around the 10-hour figure Lenovo specifies for it, depending, of course, on how you’re using the laptop. Even running YouTube videos doesn’t drain the battery noticeably faster than just browsing the web, though, so in terms of on-the-go usage, the Thinkpad 13 is great. And, as we’d expect from a Chromebook, the Thinkpad 13 fires up quickly and is very snappy during general usage. The speeds you experience will be affected by which hardware configuration you end up siding with, of course — the model I reviewed has the i5 processor option and 8GB of RAM. Conclusion A Chromebook is a Chromebook, I’ve heard some say. They’re so simple that it all boils down to Chrome OS, and that is the same no matter which model you pick up. After using many different types of Chromebooks over the years, I can say that’s not really true. Yes, Chrome OS is Chrome OS. The Chromebook itself, though, is obviously the sum total of all of its parts, and there truly are crappy models out there. Lenovo’s Thinkpad 13 Chromebook isn’t one of them. The overall construction and display quality, speed, and durability make for a Chromebook that is notable among many others, one that you won’t be embarrassed to pull out at the office and that won’t let you down when you need it the most.

The obligations are scheduled for a negotiated sale the week of August 22nd. Proceeds will be used to refund outstanding debt for savings. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the following ratings at 'AAA': -- Issuer Default Rating (IDR); --$309.5 million general obligation bonds; --$201.3 million ETROs. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY ETROs are payable from a first lien on the city's excise tax revenues. The GO bonds are payable from an unlimited ad valorem tax levied against all taxable property in the city. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAA' IDR and general obligation (GO) ratings are based on Chandler's exceptionally strong financial flexibility, enabled by solid expenditure flexibility and strong budget management practices supplemented by reserves, as well as its low long-term liability burden. The 'AAA' ETRO rating reflects an ample coverage cushion, strong additional bonds test of 3.0x and expectations for solid growth in the pledged revenue stream. Economic Resource Base Chandler encompasses 70 square miles in southeastern Maricopa County, with a 2015 population of approximately 260,000. Anchored by Intel Corporation, top employers represent technology, manufacturing, local government, education, financial, healthcare, and telecommunication interests. Revenue Framework: 'aaa' factor assessment Strong revenue trends and ongoing population growth and economic development support the expectation for solid revenue growth. Chandler's independent legal ability to raise operating revenues is considered high based on its capacity to raise the local sales tax rate without external approvals. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment Chandler's natural pace of spending is in line with revenue growth. The city benefits from a voluntary 'meet and confer' process with its employee groups, contributing to expenditure flexibility. Fitch expects the city's carrying costs to remain moderate based on rapid principal amortization and limited debt plans which offset planned increases in pension contributions to facilitate prepayment of a portion of its pension liability. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa' factor assessment Long-term liabilities are a low 5.8% of personal income. Fitch expects the long-term liability burden to remain low based on regional growth to support new issuances, and the city's plans to accelerate pay-off of one of its pension liabilities. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment The city has taken advantage of nonrecurring revenues and the economic upturn to build a strong financial cushion. Fitch expects Chandler to demonstrate strong financial resilience through a moderate economic downturn based on its current high reserve level, revenue-raising capacity and solid expenditure flexibility. RATING SENSITIVITIES Financial Flexibility: The 'AAA' rating is sensitive to shifts in fundamental credit characteristics, most notably the city's ongoing strong financial flexibility and solid economic growth. CREDIT PROFILE Strong employment growth trends reflect Chandler's participation in the broad-based Phoenix area economy. Intel Corporation employs approximately 11,000 (about 8% of Chandler's employment base). However, the city's success in attracting and retaining top technology, manufacturing, advanced business and health services continues to widen and diversify the employment base. The city's low unemployment rate continues to trend below regional and U.S. averages. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to the city's low unemployment and attractive growth prospects; income and wealth trends are well above average. Chandler's local economy continues to expand as evidenced by the 15% compound annual growth of its ad valorem tax base since fiscal 2013 due to new industrial, commercial, and residential development, as well as property appreciation. Revenue Framework The city's local sales tax or transaction privilege tax (TPT) collections contributed 52% of fiscal 2015 general fund revenues, followed by state shared revenues (28%). Ad valorem property tax revenues contributed only 3% to revenues. Chandler's general fund revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 10 years of 2.6% exceeds inflation, but falls short of U.S. GDP, reflecting significant exposure to economically sensitive revenues during the Great Recession. Subsequent to the recession (fiscal 2011 through 2015), Chandler realized a healthy general fund revenue CAGR of 4.1%. Fitch's expectation for solid growth considers the city's current expansion as well as its exposure to economically sensitive revenues. By virtue of its status as a TPT non-program city, Chandler retains the independent legal capacity to change its own TPT rate, currently at 1.5%, without limit. The city's sales tax rate is competitive and its long-range plan does not include a TPT rate increase based on the expectation of moderate ongoing growth in the sales tax base, consistent with current trends. Expenditure Framework Public safety represents Chandler's largest governmental cost of service, accounting for just over 50% of operating costs. The city's natural pace of spending is expected to track closely with revenue growth. Chandler achieves expenditure flexibility through discretion over headcount, salaries and work rules within the framework of meet and confer agreements the city has in place with its employee groups. The city tapped this flexibility during the last recession by initiating a hiring freeze, voluntary separation and retirement incentives and vacant position eliminations. Additional flexibility is maintained through the city's moderate carrying costs, 16.9% of fiscal 2015 spending. Fitch expects the city's carrying costs to remain moderate based on a rapid 10-year 85% amortization rate and limited debt plans which offset a planned uptick in pension contributions for the scheduled paydown of the city's Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS) net pension liabilities (NPLs). Long-Term Liability Burden Chandler's long-term liability burden of $448 million (including overall debt and direct pension liabilities) is low at 5.8% of personal income and is expected to remain low based on moderate area debt needs, an expanding economic base and the city's management of its unfunded pension liabilities. Chandler's fiscal 2017 budget includes $592 million in projected capital spending over the next five years, $313 million for municipal utilities, $164 million for transportation, and $115 million for general government, parks & recreation, and public safety. Funding sources include impact fees, current revenues, grants, tax-supported debt and enterprise user fee-supported debt. The city routinely conducts bi-annual GO and excise tax revenue debt sales. Under GASB 67 and 68, the city reports a fiscal 2015 Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) NPL of $105.7 million, with fiduciary assets covering 69.5% of total pension liabilities at the plan's 8% investment return assumption (approximately 63% based on a lower 7% investment rate assumption). The NPL for the city's PSPRS police and fire plans are $73 million and $36 million, respectively, with fiduciary assets covering a low 58.7% of total police plan and 66% of fire plan pension liabilities at the plan's 7.85% investment return assumption (approximately 53.7% and 60.3% based on a lower 7% investment rate assumption). Notably, the city's fiscal 2015 budget included annual contributions in excess of the actuarially determined contribution to achieve pay-off of the unfunded liabilities within the 10-year planning horizon. Additionally, proposed legislation provides modest PSPRS reforms applicable to new hires and eliminates the automatic cost of living adjustments currently in place which Fitch anticipates could, if implemented, improve long-term plan sustainability. Operating Performance Fitch expects Chandler to maintain its exceptionally strong financial resilience during a moderate economic downturn, benefiting from its very high current level of reserves, strong independent legal ability to raise revenues without external approval, and solid expenditure flexibility. Chandler estimates completing fiscal 2016 with a strong financial cushion approximating that of fiscal 2015. The city's five-year budget incorporates reserve applications for capital projects and accelerated paydown of its PSPRS unfunded pension liability, but maintains reserves in excess of its four-month of revenue target, commensurate with a 'aaa' operating performance assessment. Chandler typically outperforms its conservative budget and replenishes reserves during times of economic expansion and with nonrecurring revenues to apply to capital and strategic applications. Excise Tax Revenue Bonds Excise tax revenues include local sales tax or transaction privilege tax (TPT), state shared revenues (reflecting a two-year lag in distributions), franchise fees, licenses and permits, and fines and forfeitures. ETROs fund the city's water and waste water system improvements and these system revenues support ETRO debt service. Excise tax revenue collections reflect strong 3.8% CAGR from 2004-2014 and growth prospects remain strong. Legal provisions provide solid bondholder protections. These include an additional bonds test (ABT) of 3.0x maximum annual debt service (MADs) using an historical test for bonds outstanding plus bonds to be issued. To evaluate the sensitivity of the dedicated revenue stream to cyclical decline, Fitch considers both revenue sensitivity results (using a 1% decline in national GDP scenario) and the largest decline in revenues over the period covered by the revenue sensitivity analysis. Based on the city's 15-year pledged revenue history, Fitch's analytical sensitivity tool (FAST) generates a 2.6% scenario decline in pledged revenues. The largest actual cumulative decline in historical revenues is a 16.5% decline from fiscal 2009-2011, reflecting sensitivity of sales and state shared revenues to the economic downturn. Assuming issuance up to the 3.0x ABT, well below actual current coverage, debt service would be covered with more than a 60% drop in revenues, 25x the scenario results and 4.0x the largest actual revenue decline in the review period. This level of resilience is consistent with a 'AAA' rating (noting additionally that the fiscal 2009-2011 performance reflected a housing bust that disproportionately affected the Arizona economy to an extent that Fitch believes is less likely to be repeated in the future). Fiscal 2015 pledged revenues of $170 million are up for the fourth consecutive year and cover MADS (2029) a high 8.65x. Projections which include the addition of a $100 million ETRO issuance in fiscal 2017 indicate that ETRO MADs coverage from pledged excise tax revenues will continue to provide a financial cushion commensurate with the current rating. Issuing Entity Exposure The special tax bond rating is limited by the city of Chandler's IDR ('AAA') as Fitch does not believe that the security insulates the bonds from the general credit of the issuer. Fitch does not view the pledged excise tax revenues as special revenues under section 902(2) (B) of the bankruptcy code, which defines 'special excise taxes imposed on particular activities or transactions' as special revenues.

GIGABYTE launched two new high-end motherboards at Computex, the Z170X-Ultra Gaming, and the Z170X-Designare. Both motherboards are targeted towards the two largest subsets of Z170 buyers; gamers and power users. The Z170X-Ultra Gaming differs from most of GIGABYTE's previous Z170 gaming products. It has a neutral color look, it has metal shielding instead of plastic, it features U.2, and it carries some of GIGABYTE's newer features such as 100W USB Type-C support.     The Z170X-Ultra Gaming is basically a refreshed Z170 motherboard with the latest features. Its color theme is worth noting because many users had asked for more color-neutral motherboards. If users decide to disable the red LEDs, then the motherboard will be all black with some hints of silver. If they decide to leave the LEDs on, then a very red color theme with diffused LEDs will appear, and it doesn't look half bad.   Let's take a closer look at the Z170X-Ultra Gaming.     Specifications     The GIGABYTE Z170X-Ultra Gaming has a lot of high-end features, including Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, U.2, M.2 (32Gb/s), USB 3.0, and SATA 6Gb/s.     Pricing   The Z170X-Ultra Gaming is available from many large retailers for roughly $170.

Kyle Raines told Sputnik on Thursday. © AP Photo/ Susan Walsh CENTCOM Ties With Intel Chief Could Result in Obama Receiving Distorted DataWASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The report made public on Thursday revealed that CENTCOM manipulated intelligence reports and public statements on the fight against Daesh terrorist group to portray events on the ground as being more positive than they were. “US Central Command has seen the Congressional Joint Task Force initial report and we appreciate the independent oversight provided,” Raines said. “We are reviewing the findings of the initial report; since the Joint Task Force investigation is ongoing, as is the DOD IG's [Department of Defense Inspector General] investigation, we will refrain from further comment at this time.” House of Representatives committees convened the task force after a whistleblower claimed in May 2015 that CENTCOM leaders were engineering intelligence products to present an unjustly positive outlook on US efforts to train Iraqi Security Forces and fight Daesh. Additionally, CENTCOM press releases, statements and testimony in front of the US Congress were significantly more positive than the events on the ground, the Joint Task Force explained. Despite the whistleblower complaint, neither CENTCOM nor the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence took steps to improve the analytic problems, the report pointed out. The Joint Task Force along with the US Department of Defense is continuing to investigate the whistleblower allegations, and the findings are only preliminary, the report stated. ...

This is the newest release in NoviFlow’s industry leading high-performance OpenFlow 1.3/1.4/1.5 switching software for use in switches, WAN IP/MPLS routers, network appliances and other high-performance forwarding planes. The software is deployed around the world in NoviFlow’s NoviSwitch products and is also offered via software license to OEM and ODM switching platform suppliers. NoviWare 400 consists of all the software necessary for a pure-play OpenFlow switch, and currently supports Mellanox NP-4 and NP-5 network processors and Intel or PowerPC host CPUs. According to Dominique Jodoin, president and CEO of NoviFlow: “Whether deployed in NoviFlow’s NoviSwitch products, or integrated as part of our OEM customers’ own offering, NoviWare is providing a real high-performance software solution for OpenFlow enabled switches, routers and other network appliances. We are pleased that our network processor-based switches and software are becoming key elements in the deployment of scalable, robust, and high-demand SDN, cloud, and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) solutions.” NoviWare 400 provides the industry’s broadest support of the OpenFlow 1.3 and 1.4 specifications, including all actions, instructions and match fields. It has also been extended to support key OpenFlow 1.5 features such as the highly anticipated Copy-Fields action, as well as other new features that significantly boost the performance of OpenFlow based applications, such as a hashing function on user-defined ordered lists, MPLS payload matching and broader encapsulation/decapsulation support for layer 2 tunneling protocols. In order to offer the Copy-Fields action to existing customers who do not have the option of using OpenFlow 1.5, NoviFlow has implemented the Copy-Field action on as an OpenFlow Experimenter action to offer SDN applications this functionality with OpenFlow 1.3, 1.4 AND 1.5 controllers. Key features of NoviWare 400 include: Implements all required and optional OpenFlow 1.3/1.4 match fields (41 of 41) and instructions (6 of 6) as well as 59 out of 60 actions and basic support of OF 1.5 (Copy-Fields action) Linux-based NoviWare host CPU software for PowerPC or Intel i7 Multiple OpenFlow Controllers and Controller role-changes Support for OpenFlow pipeline processing with up to 120 flow tables, with up to 1 million wildcard match flow table entries in TCAM and up to 15 million exact match flow entries in DRAM OpenFlow queues and meters for implementation of QoS mechanisms Extensive O&M features optimized for large scale deployment of OpenFlow switches in carrier, cloud and enterprise networks OpenFlow Experimenter-based extensions: - L2-L7 matching, packet processing and flow management - Experimenter action for Hash on user-defined ordered list of OpenFlow fields. Can be used to load balance in Select Group (all products) and in LAG (2000 Series only) or in the copy-field action - Copy-Field action based on OF1.5 also supported on OF1.3 to 1.5 through OpenFlow Experimenter action - Experimenter MPLS payload matching - L2 GRE/GTP/VxLAN/MPLS tunneling protocol encapsulation/decapsulation - BFD Link Monitoring Says Jodoin: “NoviWare 400 provides a smooth path to using OpenFlow 1.5 capabilities without requiring that existing solutions be upgraded to OpenFlow 1.5 Controllers. It continues NoviFlow’s proven track record of delivering the most advanced OpenFlow capabilities available in the market while protecting existing OpenFlow investments, and is being deployed with confidence in commercial networks around the world.” NoviWare 400 is shipping now. NoviFlow will demonstrate its advanced OpenFlow solutions at its booth at the SDN World Congress in the Hague, Netherlands, October 10 [th] to 14 [th] , 2016.

Now Google DeepMind, Blizzard train AIs with StarCraft battles AI boffins turn to StarCraft to train future neural networks Accessories to crime: Facial recog defeated by wacky paper glasses Intel’s latest Diversity and Inclusion mid-year report shows that numbers of African American and Hispanic people have hardly changed, despite the company’s $300m pledge to achieve full representation by 2020. Although the number of female workers have slowly been rising – especially for those in more senior roles – the same cannot be said for a group Intel calls "under-represented minorities". The percentage of African American workers went up from December 2015 to June 2016 only 0.2 per cent, from 3.5 to 3.7 per cent. For Native Americans - the most under-represented minority - the figure was bumped up a mere 0.1 per cent, from 0.5 to 0.6 per cent. But for Hispanics, the percentage dropped 0.4 per cent. In December 2014, the figure started at 8.3 per cent and rose a year later by 0.1 per cent, but in June it fell to 8 per cent. Broken down by career levels, the number of under-represented minorities in senior roles has grown. The biggest jump seen from December 2014 to June 2016 was for leadership roles, which rose from 4.8 to 6.9 per cent. During the same period, however, the overall percentage of under-represented minorities (12.3 per cent), remained unchanged. Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, announced the company’s Diversity in Technology Initiative in 2015. It made Chipzilla the first major technology company to aim for full representation of women and under-represented minorities by 2020 by investing $300m to hire and retain more employees. “We’re calling on our industry to again make the seemingly impossible possible by making a commitment to real change and clarity in our goals,” said Krzanich. “Without a workforce that more closely mirrors the population, we are missing opportunities, including not understanding and designing for our own customers.” But Intel’s latest figures show the company is far from its goals. According to CIA Fact Book, the American population is 12.85 per cent black, 4.43 per cent Asian, and Amerindian and Alaska native 0.97 per cent, and native Hawaiian and other Pacific islander 0.18 per cent. The lack of diversity is an issue recognised by many major tech companies. In June, 30 companies, including Intel, GitHub and VMWare signed a Tech Inclusion Pledge, a commitment to the White House to publish diversity figures and implement goals to increase representation in their companies. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Google gently leads Intel into its cloud: This is for your own good All is well, rejoice, rejoice, let's get into the white 'n' fluffy Intel mulls sale of Intel Security – reports Opinion The game done changed 6 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

Taking a page from Intel and Micron's strategy book, they also announced a new memory type and corresponding SSD product while saying essentially nothing about what the new memory actually is. Gallery: Samsung 4th Generation V-NAND The fourth generation 3D NAND bumps the layer count up to 64, compared to the 48-layer design used by the third generation V-NAND that was announced last fall and has been slowly rolling out to their SSD products over the course of this year. So far Samsung has talked about a 512Gb TLC part, and at least initially the MLC parts will probably be made from the same die and thus have two thirds the capacity. (Samsung's second generation 3D NAND was initially available as 128Gb TLC or 86Gb MLC, with 128Gb MLC parts introduced later.) The new NAND also supports an increased interface speed of 800Mbps, which is key to reducing the performance penalty that comes from consolidating more flash onto fewer independent chips. With a per-die capacity of 512Gb (64GB), Samsung can now put 1TB of TLC flash in a single package. This means most product lines will be seeing an increase in capacity at the high end of the range. Their BGA SSD products will be offering 1TB capacity even in the 11.5mm by 13mm form factor. The 16TB PM1633a SAS SSD will be eclipsed by the new 32TB PM1643. Likely to be further out, the PM1725 PCIe add-in card SSD will be succeeded by the PM1735 with a PCIe 4 x8 host interface. Complementing the NAND update will be a new non-standard oversized M.2 form factor 32mm wide and 114mm long, compared to the typical enterprise M.2 size of 22mm by 110mm. A little extra room can go a long way, and Samsung will be using it to produce 8TB drives. These will be enterprise SSDs and Samsung showed a diagram of these enabling 256TB of flash in a 1U server. Samsung will also be producing 4TB drives in standard M.2 sizing. Gallery: Samsung Z-NAND and Z-SSD In what is likely a bid to steal some thunder from 3D XPoint memory before it can ship, Samsung announced Z-NAND memory technology and a Z-SSD product based around Z-NAND and a new SSD controller. They said nothing about the operating principles of Z-NAND, but they did talk about their plans for the Z-SSD products. Samsung Z-SSD is being marketed as addressing the performance gap between DRAM and SSDs. Samsung's slides during their keynote showed some performance comparisons against the PM963 NVMe TLC SSD and against an unnamed "PRAM based" solution. The logical point of comparison would be against 3D XPoint NVMe drives, but Samsung can't have real performance and power numbers on those when they're still under development by Intel and Micron. Thus the PRAM based solution Samsung refers to is probably one of their own earlier R&D efforts that didn't make it to market. The Z-SSD ties or comes out ahead on every benchmark Samsung showed, but NVMe NAND flash SSDs were missing from the power consumption comparison. The slides stated that there will be a 1TB Z-SSD this year and 2TB and 4TB Z-SSDs next year, while the press release issued later states that more generally that the Z-SSD is expected to be released next year. The press release also states that Z-NAND "shares the fundamental structure of V-NAND and has a unique circuit design and controller that can maximize performance". Given that, the launch timeframe and capacities that are only a little lower than NAND flash SSDs, it seems that Z-NAND isn't drastically different from existing memory technologies and it may even be little more than SLC flash in disguise, trying for a comeback.

On the consumer end, that is. Reply ImSpartacus - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link Yeah, I don't see much changing there except a steady march to the bottom. All these are pro/high end products. Reply name99 - Friday, August 12, 2016 - link Consumer is a big space. Are Apple products consumer? Because they're a possible target for this sort of thing. (Depending on how Intel prices XPoint, however, THAT may be enterprise only for two or three years.) Reply plopke - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link The more I see from Optane , QuantX , Z-SSD,... the more I wonder what the benefit is for mainstream consumer products , to expensive, coming as a cache system for consumer enthusiastic people which can buy 16/32GB DDR4 quiet cheap + very quick SSDs instead of spending money on this. But on enterprise level will be fun to watch how this all evolves. Reply lefty2 - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link I don't think anyone ever said that they have benefit for mainstream consumer products. It's mainly for enterprise and enthusiast markets. Also, Samsung only talks about performance. 3D X-point is 1000 times more longativity than normal NAND and that factor is just as important as the performance. So, what's the longativity of Z-Nand? Reply plopke - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link You are right , guess Intel is the only one who might pitch this to consumers atm. Reply ddriver - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link Well, if it is indeed SLC, then it could handle 100k+ p/e cycles. That's a LOT more than MLC flash. SLC's problem was low capacity, which samsung can solve by stacking dies into a single package. I am surprised they took so long, but then again, it is not as cost effective as MLC and TLC stacking, so it makes sense they didn't do it for consumer drives, but now that the enterprise market is gearing for a transition to flash and with xpoint on the horizon, the fat profit margins of the enterprise market have made stacking SLC very viable. Reply bcronce - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link 3D VAND TLC has between 10k and 70k p/e cycles, depending on if they optimize the firmware for speed or durability. I haven't heard how many cycles SLC 3D VNAND has, I assume more. The main point is modern MLC can have about the same amount of cycles as last gen SLC. Reply ats - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link This is completely false on so many levels. Modern NAND and 3D NAND has significantly LESS real endurance than NAND from 5-10 years ago. What you are actually seeing are advances in redundancy and error correction codes. Those old numbers for say 50/40nm flash were RAW P/E cycles. You could hook the flash up to any interface and it would give at least those numbers of P/E cycles. What is being quoted for modern flash is not RAW P/E values but calculated P/E values assuming a certain redundancy and a certain level of error correction (generally quite complex taking microseconds to compute). Reply frenchy_2001 - Thursday, August 11, 2016 - link Nope. What has happened is that 3D NAND took multiple steps back in XY lithography and then went 3D (up) and stacked layers. So, recent 3D NAND are back on the 40nm process (instead of 16nm process for planar NAND). This gives them *MUCH* bigger cells, thicker walls and as such, better endurance. Process improvements helped too. Basically, 3D NAND is back to RAW p/e cycles superior to what we had in the past, just due to cell size. On top of that, they now have better error correction and better wear leveling and controllers. This is why even TLC in 3D NAND has decent endurance.

We have worked to get Sandia National Laboratories to help get small businesses started with the labs’ technologies. We hoped Intel would be the basis of a cluster of local semiconductor companies. We watch the University of New Mexico license its technologies to local entrepreneurs, then hope those entrepreneurs will build a locally controlled company of some meaningful scale. We’ve done this for many reasons: We want an economy where our kids can find good jobs; tech companies pay better; tech companies are usually less polluting than traditional manufacturers; tech companies grow faster and employ more people over time; tech companies tend to spawn more tech companies. A new study from the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution says Albuquerque has a long way to go to create that new economy. In fact, the study shows we’re losing ground. Advertisement Continue reading Brookings identified 50 industries in manufacturing, energy and services that spend at least $450 per worker per year on research and development and employ at least 20 percent of their workforces in STEM-intensive occupations (STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Then for the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Brookings calculated how many workers are employed in those industries, how much they earn and how important those industries are to the local economy. Brookings found that employment in what it calls advanced industries in Albuquerque declined 1.4 percent from 2010 to 2013 and grew not at all from 2013 through 2015. The output of those industries declined 0.6 percent from 2010 to 2013 and declined 2.3 percent from 2013 to 2015. Nationally, output grew 2.7 percent from 2013 through 2015, and employment grew 2.46 percent. Albuquerque ranked 99th among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas in the growth of its advanced industries’ output and 85th in employment growth. The industries employ 38,400 people in the Albuquerque area and generated $6.2 billion worth of output in 2015. They pay an average annual salary of $76,889, compared with an average of $45,221 for all industries in the Albuquerque area. Mark Muro, who directs Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program, really can’t explain it. “Albuquerque remains a puzzling case, in some ways, and sure has been having a difficult time across multiple measures of post-crisis recovery,” Muro said in a email exchange with the Journal. “It does seem to lack dynamism.” Albuquerque has experienced some growth in computer systems design, web search services and data processing. Precision instruments, miscellaneous manufacturing, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals are “growing a bit or gaining momentum,” Muro said. But these industries don’t employ that many people. Looking at larger employers, “the region is getting less engineering growth than most places, and semiconductors had a rough two years. Meanwhile, your largest industry – R&D services – added employment but not at a rapid pace. Perhaps this is reflective of slow federal budget increases, since the state is heavily tied to federal funding flows.” Advertisement Continue reading Another Brookings study, published two years ago, says there are several impediments to our long-held hope that the national laboratories in New Mexico would help our advanced industries grow. Brookings found that “despite their undeniable potential, most national labs appear to contribute only marginally to the build-out and dynamism of their regions’ local innovation clusters.” Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories are primarily weapons labs that “remain at present too mission-focused and too little incentivized to plunge deeply into their respective regional economies.” The labs have “a heritage of defense activity” that has “created a culture within the labs that is occasionally still resistant to collaboration” with local business, according to Brookings. The labs’ bureaucracy and time-consuming contracting processes are difficult for small businesses to navigate and are too costly for most small businesses to endure, Brookings reported. To the difficulties Brookings identified, add the risk of starting a new business, the difficulty of finding the investment to start a tech company and the dearth of local business talent to take technology to market and you get an idea of why growth of advanced industries in Albuquerque is so slow.

More and more big companies are creating their own venture investment arms Thu, Aug 11, 2016, 06:15 Updated: Thu, Aug 11, 2016, 17:24 Karlin Lillington An exhibitor stand at the Web Summit in Dublin in 2015: the fundraising landcsape for start-ups is generally a hazardous strip of prickly land running between a rock and hard place . Photograph: Eric Luke         Investment into technology startups from corporate venture capital (CVCs) continues in a steady rise, as more established companies create venture arms.  CVC units are special divisions within companies such as Cisco, Google and Intel – but also, non-tech sector companies in varied sectors, such as General Mills and NBC Sports – that invest into young companies, providing an alternative funding source.   Why do they invest? Reasons are varied, but perhaps the most frequently cited is that they provide a fast way into understanding or expanding into a promising sector or application of technology, compared to setting up a dedicated in-house R&D project from scratch. And of course, they can provide investment returns – or losses – to the CVC parent company.  CVCs have been around for a while, and haven’t always had a great reputation, in particular during the dotcom era, when many rushed in to make hallucinatory mega-deals, then rushed away in panic after the dotcom crash, some never to return. (Though to be fair, some mainstream VCs and many individual investors were scorched and followed suit.)  CVC investment dropped from a high of 16 per cent of all deals in 2000 to about half that level, for the remainder of the decade. But it has been back on a gradual rise and just hit an all-time high in the first quarter of this year, at 21 per cent. A report out this week from New York-based venture analyst CB Insights also notes that while the overall number of deals in the first half of 2016 fell slightly – by 6 per cent, to 633 – compared to the same period last year, and is at a nine-quarter low, the dollar value of those deals rose 3 per cent to $12.7 billion.  Record levels CVCs were involved in about 20 per cent of all deals in the first half of this year, and participation has ranged at 19 per cent and above over the past eight quarters. ADVERTISEMENT  In addition, the number of companies with new, active CVC units is on track to reach record levels this year, with 53 making their first investment so far in 2016. Active CVC units have more than doubled in number in the past four years. In the first quarter of 2012, 85 were making deals. In the same quarter of 2016, 188 were on the scene investing.  Globally, CVC deals are also larger than the average VC deal, and this has held true now for 14 quarters in a row. To give an example, in Q1 of this year, CVCs made $27 million in global investments, compared to $16 million from regular VCs. In Q2, the numbers were $19 million v $13 million, respectively.  European deals made up 19 per cent of all CVC investments in Q2 of this year, a five-quarter high.  And CVCs put most of their money into early-stage investments. CVC seed-stage investments are set to hit a new high this year, and 46 per cent of all deals are in seed, angel or series A rounds – which would seem to be a good thing for startups.  Is it? Some think no, perhaps most famously Fred Wilson of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, who has been scathing about CVCs for years. He now avoids deals involving any CVCs, which he refers to as “the devil”. A few years ago, in one interview at a Pando Daily event, he said he believed corporates should be buying companies, not investing in them. He did single out a few exceptions such as the venture arms at Google and Intel, which he believes function to a higher standard. On the other hand, such a view is perhaps not astonishing given it comes from a-high profile VC in a major venture firm which competes against CVCs for deals. Expertise The attractions of of a CVC investment for a young company, on the other hand, are that investment terms are generally not as onerous as they can be from mainstream VCs. And depending on the CVC, a young company can get high-level business advice and broad business expertise that VCs may not have the time, interest or ability to provide.  In addition, VCs are often looking at a fast exit and shareholder return, not the longer term possibilities of a company. CVCs, by contrast, may be more interested in developing the company, typically with an eventual direct acquisition in mind.  But that creates issues, too. Young companies can be tainted by the association with a CVC, finding it hard to find other investors or buyers when the market assumption is that the CVC parent will acquire them. Young companies may find it awkward to even discuss funding or acquisition issues at board level, given that the CVC will often hold a board position.   Plenty to think about for start-ups, which learn all too quickly that the fundraising landcsape is generally a hazardous strip of prickly land running between a rock and hard place.       Topics: Fred Wilson Union Square Ventures General Mills Cisco Intel Cvc Google United States Read More Apple’s difficulty could be rival Samsung’s opportunity Raising start-up finance is full of risks and challenges Sincere venture capitalist wanted – honesty and GSOH essential Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

News & Analysis Samsung Debuts 3D XPoint Killer 3D NAND variant stakes out high-end SSDs Rick Merritt 8/11/2016 00:01 AM EDT 5 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SANTA CLARA, Calif. – Samsung lobbed a new variant of its 3D NAND flash into the gap Intel and Micron hope to fill with their emerging 3D XPoint memory. The news came one day after Micron showed at the Flash Memory Summit performance figures for its version of the XPoint solid-state drives (SSDs) under a new Quantx brand. Samsung announced plans for what it called Z-NAND chips that will power SSDs with similar performance but lower costs and risk than the 3D XPoint drives. However, it was secretive about the details of the technology that will appear in products sometime next year. By contrast, a Micron engineer leading its XPoint SSD program was surprisingly candid in an interview with EE Times. She described current prototypes using early XPoint chips and an FPGA-based controller for the SSDs expected to ship in about a year. Samsung’s Z-NAND will deliver 10x faster reads than multi-level cell flash and writes that are twice as fast, the company said. At the drive level, they will support both reads and writes at about 20 microseconds, suggesting some of write performance comes from an enhanced controller. The Z-SSD throughput in I/O operations/second (IOPS) will be “comparable to the new Micron Quantx products,” peaking at a desirably low level of about eight queue levels, said Tien Shiah, a Samsung product marketer who said results were based on working hardware in the lab. The first drives will have a terabyte capacity. Like today’s high-end SSDs they will draw a full 25W from a PCIe Gen 3 slot to deliver maximum IOPS. Costs will be “a little bit more than standard triple-level cell flash shipping today, but it will be more cost effective than alternative memory technologies,” said Shiah, in a nod to 3D Xpoint. Engineers from Toshiba and SanDisk interviewed independently by EE Times said they believe Z-NAND is a clever implementation in a 3D NAND process of single-level flash cells.  Shiah said Z-NAND will have “SLC-like endurance.” Samsung does not appear to have a version of Z-NAND available for NVDIMM boards that plug into a memory bus. However Intel suggests it will not attack that opportunity with XPoint until sometime well after the first SSDs emerge next year. Z-SSDs claim latency (top) and performance levels that rival 3D XPoint drives. (Images: Samsung) Samsung’s move appears to be a somewhat hastily-prepared but savvy one. It positions an existing, relatively low cost technology against a newer riskier one still trying to yield. One analyst expects Intel and Micron may take a loss on initial XPoint products until volumes rise. Intel may try to recoup the loss by selling XPoint as part of a platform with more expensive processors. “It’s a gamble,” said Jim Handy of market watcher Objective Analysis (Los Gatos, Calif.). Samsung positioned Z-NAND as a sort of special case, a defensive move outside its main flash road map. Its next major product will be a 512-Gbit chip with 64-layers delivering 800 Mbits/second, said Jae Jeong, head of Samsung’s memory division. Samsung showed at its booth a wafer bearing the chips it said will ship later this year. It will use the chips to put a terabyte of storage into a novel fan-out package developed internally, he said. The chips will be used to double to 32 TBytes the density of Samsung’s high-end SAS-based SSDs. Next page: Micron gives peek at XPoint SSD Samsung showed a prototype Z-SSD at its booth.

IMFT has taken a big hit in their credibility to execute on schedule. The hole is large enough that it has allowed Samsung to roll out an entirely new product family through it - and almost thanking IMFT for doing such a great job at pioneering the market definition for them. Strategists on both sides of IMFT clearly did not reason the probabilities of this scenario occurring and greatly underestimated Samsung's R&D ability to respond in a timely fashion.  Samsung's new device has 20 uS balanced R/Ws which is music to the ears of those architecting high performance AFAs and NVDIMM-type Ps for the burgeoning In-Memory Computing market. Byte Addressability might be used by IMFT as a counter argument but the first law of semiconductor memory business; "Price will always be the deciding factor" will take the air out of that argument. The idea of using a "intelligent" prefetch mechanism to load the on-DIMM DRAM "cache" will further help remove a good deal of latency of the on-DIMM SSD.  This is a near perfect marriage of the new found need for "terabytes" on the memory channel to satisfy the demands of In-Memory Compute Configured servers realizing that a great deal of the initial market uptake consists of an installed base. Z-NAND is an equal opportunity market share thief operating in a tier where reliably high profit margins still exist.

Other than that it might even be considered by some to be a positive, increasing noise margin of the high resistance state. I think the real problem for the threshold switch matrix isolation device is the first switching voltage of the as deposited un-switched virgin amorphous material. Experience suggests the first switching voltage will be significantly higher than the normal operating voltage. Perhaps Intel/Micron have found a way of depositing the active material of the matrix isolation device is exactly the same state as it is after it has been threshold switched for the first time. As I am sure you are aware the reason the memory material is deposited in its crystalline state is to avoid the high first switching voltage.

It would be very interesting to know if these media instabilities relate to the matrix isolation device or the memory. Are the causes of these 3DXpoint instabilities related to the same old PCM problems of element separation or thermal effects, like dissipation, crosstalk and drift or new ones from the matrix isolation device or even the "new recipe memory material? A little more clarity from Intel/Micron on those points would make it a little easier to judge if January 2017 is a reasonable date for their "hopes" to be realised. The 70/30 read/ write ratio in their demonstration would suggest the threshold switch matrix isolation device is getting quite a pounding, that is if they actually threshold switch it on every read operation.

The refreshed version of the Surface Book is said to come with the new Intel Kaby Lake processor which would be able to support USB 3.1 connections. The new processor will also be accompanied by a new graphics card capable of 3D and 4K graphics, according to Windows Central. Although Windows Central did not specifically hear that the Intel Kaby Lake processor will be added, its sources did indicate updated internal components. In terms of design, this new iteration of the Surface Book will be directly addressing one of the major gripes that consumers had with the original Surface Book: the fulcrum hinge. When the original Surface Book was first revealed, it impressed a lot of people in terms of build quality since Microsoft used metal for its body. However, the fulcrum hinge that connects the tablet/display onto the keyboard bothered a lot of users. When users closed the Surface Book, the fulcrum hinge doesn’t close it all the way like in traditional laptops. A gap between the display and the keyboard is present when the laptop is closed which kind of ruined the look of the device. Windows Central’s source indicated that Microsoft is planning to completely remove that gap on the refreshed version of the Surface Book, so that when it is closed it looks more like a traditional laptop. There are no details yet on how Microsoft will be able to do that redesign without compromising the functionality of the fulcrum hinge. Related Stories Did Microsoft Delay Windows 10 Mobile Anniversary Update? Microsoft Slashes Xbox One Price Meanwhile, Microsoft is also expected to announce a Surface AIO PC which will be intended to be placed in the living room. Sources say that the Surface AIO will come in 21, 24 and 27-inch screen sizes. The 21-inch model is believed to come with a full HD 1080p screen resolution, while the 24 and 27-inch models are said to come with 4K resolution displays. There’s no confirmation yet if Microsoft is planning to sell all three models. It is quite possible that the company is simply testing out three versions of the new Surface AIO. When Microsoft announces the Surface AIO PC, the company could simply announce two models instead of three. Microsoft previously announced that it would be releasing a new Surface-branded device for this year and another three in 2017, as pointed out by The Verge. There’s no concrete evidence to confirm what Microsoft intends to release first, but a 2017 release date for the Surface Book 2 seems more likely. Intel is expected to release the Kaby Lake processors before the end of 2016, according to Tech Radar. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Samsung’s unreleased Exynos 8895 chip is reportedly reaching speeds of 4GHz Refreshed Surface Book could revamp fulcrum hinge, Surface ‘All-in-One in the works Patrick O'Rourke August 10, 2016 9:00pm With the fall looking ever closer, it’s almost time for another Surface line refresh. According to a report stemming from Windows Central, the new version of the Surface Book will feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, though the new silicon won’t start shipping until late 2016. The laptop-tablet hybrid will also feature USB 3.1, some form of updated independent graphics architecture and a 4K screen. Most interestingly, however, the Book’s fulcrum hinge, which worked great on a practical level, but wasn’t exactly aesthetically pleasing, is in store for a redesign, moving the display flush with its keyboard, adopting a look and feel similar to that of a standard laptop. In terms of the Surface Pro 5, little is known so far, though All About Microsoft’s Mary Jo Foley says her sources indicate the device will be announced this fall with a ship date only a few weeks later. It’s predicted that the Surface Pro 4 refresh will feature Intel’s Kaby Lake architecture, similar to the Surface Book, and a 4K screen, though it’s possible Microsoft could be saving UHD for its higher-end Book. A third mystery Surface device, which we reported on last month, featuring either a 21-inch 1080p display, 24-inch 4K screen or 27-inch 4K glass, could also be revealed. This new desktop device, rumoured to be called the Surface All-in-One, is designed to work in your living room, though little is known about the often-rumoured device. Rumours indicate that is the All-in-One does get a commercial release, it likely won’t be in 2016. The same can be said about the often-rumoured Surface Phone. SourceWindows Central, All About Microsoft Jon Duke Apple, take notes. Refresh your products! Microsoft is the best. Raj Singh I will definitely get the Surface Book at some point in the not too distant future but I didn’t want the first iteration hardware given that a product of its kind has never been released before. I’m convinced they’ll make it even better next time around.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 12, 2016 at 10:16AM Image source: The Motley Fool. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is facing considerable challenges, and it will take both time and money for the company to adapt to emerging trends in the industry. On the other hand, when considering aspects such as growth opportunities in strategic imperatives, attractive valuation levels, and big cash distributions via dividends and buybacks, IBM stock looks like a compelling purchase for investors right now. 1. Betting on the right businesses   IBM is a company in transition. Management is reducing its presence in businesses related to hardware and other areas with inferior potential for growth, which is having a negative impact on revenue. In addition, foreign currencies depreciation is hurting sales figures as expressed in U.S. dollars. In this context, IBM reported a 2.6% decline in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, to $20.2 billion. The business is still producing tons of cash; free cash flow amounted to $2.1 billion last quarter and to $13.1 billion in the trailing-12-month period, so financial soundness is unquestionable. Nevertheless, the fact that revenue is moving in the wrong direction is an important reason for concern. However, the company's prospects seem much better when looking under the surface. IBM is aggressively investing for growth in a group of businesses management has identified as strategic imperatives, this includes cloud, analytics, security, social, and mobile technologies. Revenue from strategic imperatives grew 12% in the second quarter, reaching $8.3 billion. The cloud segment looks particularly promising, as revenue in this division increased 30% and reached $3.4 billion during the period. The annual run rate for cloud-as-a-service revenue stands at $6.7 billion, jumping 50% year over year last quarter. Over the last year, IBM produced $31 billion in sales from strategic imperatives, and the segment now represents 38% of total company-level revenue. The way things are going, chances are strategic imperatives will continue outgrowing other segments in the coming years, so the division will most probably account for an increasing share of overall revenue in the future. This should be an important driver for IBM in terms of overall growth going forward. 2. Attractive valuation levels IBM stock is doing really well lately, shares of Big Blue have gained over 20% year to date, so short-term momentum is clearly to the upside. But things look remarkably different on a longer time frame, as IBM stock is still trading below price levels from five years ago.  In terms of valuation, IBM looks fairly conveniently priced. The stock carries a price to earnings ratio of 13.2 times earnings over the last year. As a reference, the average company in the S&P 500 index trades at a price to earnings ratio of 20, while the average company in the same industry carries a price to earnings ratio in the neighborhood of 17.3. The following table compares several valuation metrics for IBM versus other big tech companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The four companies operate in different industries, so the comparison is not completely straightforward. Nevertheless, we are still talking about big and mature tech corporations with below-average growth that are paying consistent dividends.  Looking at ratios such as price to earnings, price to free cash flow, price to sales, and dividend yield, IBM is cheaper than Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel across the board. Company P/E P/FCF P/S Dividend Yield IBM 13.2 16.8 1.93 3.5% Microsoft 27.7 32 5.24 2.5% Cisco 15.4 42.2 3.14 3.4% Intel 16.9 23.5 2.92 3% Data source: SEC filings and FinViz.  3. Big dividends and buybacks Not only is IBM stock paying a higher dividend yield than other tech players facing similar difficulties, the company also has a pristine trajectory of dividend payments over the years. IBM has paid uninterrupted dividends in every year since 1916, proving the business is strong enough to produce consistent cash flows under all kinds of circumstances. Even better, IBM has increased dividend payments in the last 21 consecutive years.  In addition to dividends, IBM has a long-standing policy of allocating free cash flow to share buybacks. This allows IBM to increase earnings per share at a faster rate than overall earnings growth by reducing the amount of shares outstanding, and the company has shrunk its share count by over 36% in the last decade. IBM Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. If IBM can jump-start sales growth via improving performance from strategic imperatives, then the stock offers substantial room for gains from currently attractive valuation levels. In the meantime, the company is rewarding shareholders for their patience with generous dividends and stock buybacks. Andres Cardenal owns shares of IBM. The Motley Fool owns shares of Microsoft.

Intel’s upcoming CPU generation, Kaby Lake, will still only be supported on Windows 10. Skylake CPU powered systems previously had to upgrade to Windows 10 before the 17th of July 2017  to continue to receive support from Microsoft. Many users complained and Microsoft claims his feedback made them extend the support period. Both Skylake powered Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 systems will continue to receive security updates till the end of the regular support period for both operating systems. That means Windows 7 will continue to receive updates till the 14th of January 2020 and Windows 8.1 support will be provided till the 10th of January 2023. Extension of the support period is possible through cooperation with Intel. The chip giant will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for Skylake systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. Intel’s upcoming CPU generation Kaby Lake and AMD’s 7th generation CPUs will only be supported by Windows 10. There will be no changes to that policy. Microsoft also still recommends Skylake system owners to upgrade to Windows 10. Windows 10 support ends at the 13th of October 2026 when the Anniversary Update is applied. Before the release of the Anniversary update the end of support was scheduled at the 14th of October 2025.

But oh no, we(MS) knows your computer better then you. That kinda mentality will go no where fast as evident by the slow Windows 10 market shares. 0 Agree Xercus Moderator Posted on: 13 Aug 16 19:21 ^We agree on that subject, an open interface is what is needed, after all who is to tell me what is better for me. Give me a set of rules and give me power to take it from there. It is really all that is needed. Then there is that other aspect, listen to the users! Collect only the bare essentials of what you need to develop the OS, not any and everything. A few more's and we're home. They will have to adapt to markets though, and so they look in envy towards the app stores, but they really do not have to as they already have a winning formula/effective monopoly, so the interesting question is why? The possible answer is they're looking for ways to earn even more/getting better margins. What I can not figure out is why they are seemingly willing to risk their entire existing user base to achieve it. No one, not even MS is THAT big and there are always some waiting in the shadows. In this isolated case however, I think MS is worthy of a clap on the shoulder - Way to go! 0 Agree TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 14 Aug 16 06:07 Personally, I don't think Microsoft should be paying any attention to what CPU you have. It shouldn't matter if you have the latest Kaby Lake CPU, or some old XP-era uniprocessor. The software updates should come regardless of how old the hardware is.

That's probably what people said when IBM tried to enter the microcomputer market. I wasn't born until the 1990s, so I can't say what the public though in the early 1980s, but I assume someone must have said "They practically have a monopoly on mainframes, what could they gain from selling cheap microcomputers?" But, IBM was smart enough to realize PCs weren't going away. Rather, they probably saw that PCs were only going to become more mainstream in the future. Microsoft has most likely seen something similar in hand-held devices. Therefore, they probably feel they must do whatever the leaders in the field of hand-held computing are doing until they can claim leadership themselves. If that happens, others will likewise feel like they must imitate Microsoft. 0 Agree roho MyCE Member Posted on: 14 Aug 16 08:16 Sounds like it was a bit of a cynical ploy to force certain users off Win 7 or 8.1, just 2 weeks after the free upgrade period "expires" they do a u turn. Probably nowhere near as many upgraders as Microsoft thought/hoped for so the decision had to be reversed. 0 Agree Xercus Moderator Posted on: 14 Aug 16 11:26 Quote: Originally Posted by TSJnachos117 That's probably what people said when IBM tried to enter the microcomputer market.

If that happens, others will likewise feel like they must imitate Microsoft. First of all, IBM never sold 'cheap' microcomputers , secondly, there is a big difference between going into another market and tweaking an existing OS in a way that has received much negative mention. I was around in the eighties, but I do not recall any negative attitude towards IBM going into the client computer market. However, I do recall much negative mention regarding their arrogance and ignorance towards customers in the server market. As we know, they got hit quite badly some years later when Microsoft came along with their NT4 and the rest is history. Now, that would qualify as a comparison to what may happen to Microsoft's client OS unless they start listening to the users and rather continue their travel on 'ignorance avenue'. The sheer amount of 3rd-party tweaks and tools, both legal and well in the grey at least should tell Microsoft that there are a lot of users who disagree with their present direction. What I notice is that there are several Linux distros being made with the more casual user in mind and given a little time, they may become real competition to Windows which really is the oddball compared to the rest, even MAC (that's just BSD and so sort of Linux as well). 0 Agree TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 15 Aug 16 03:14 I understand microcomputers were, by nature, cheap compared to mainframes (and probably still are). I also understand that IBM was, up till that point, best known for mainframes. I'm sure the IBM PC was cheap compared to whatever their newest mainframe was. The price compared to other micros was, I assume, another story. Of course, the negativity towards IBM in the early 1980s was just an assumption on my part. My bad, I guess. In any case, Microsoft's theoretical motivation doesn't make the bad things they've done right. Microsoft doesn't have the right to spy on people "because we're just imitating Google. They did it first." 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

Then there are the two large dish-shaped apparatus, each standing at opposite sides of the hall: Just whispering into one gets the message across clearly to the other side. In yet another exhibit, there is a maze and ping-pong balls, with several openings through which the balls can be “navigated” by opening and closing the flaps on the side of the maze. These are just part of the 120 interactive exhibits at the newly-opened Penang Tech Dome, a place where science is fun and much more exciting than memorising the periodic table in chemistry class. The idea of a science discovery centre was mooted by the Penang state government back in 2011 as a way to arrest the decline in the standards of English, mathematics and science among students below 15 years of age. After five years of fundraising, the steering committee finally managed to raise RM27.5 million (S$9.2 million) to turn Komtar’s old Geodesic Dome into the Penang Tech Dome. According to steering committee chairman Wong Siew Hai, the Penang Tech Dome is modelled on the San Jose Tech Centre in California, where the government provided the building and some seed money, with the rest of the funding raised from corporations and the public. State-owned development arm Penang Development Corporation (PDC) sponsored RM4 million and the free use of the Dome in Komtar while the Penang state government provided seed funding of RM1.15 million. At the opening of the Penang Tech Dome recently, Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng thanked major sponsors including PDC, IJM, Dell, Intel and other corporations and personal donors for their contributions, which have made the centre a reality. “Going forward, the Tech Dome will need further support from the industry, corporate sector and the general public to help ensure its future success,” he said. The Penang Tech Dome occupies two levels, with six main galleries. It is also the first science centre in the world to exhibit the Digital Autopsy Machine, which will be displayed in London and New York only next year. The first section is the Optics section, where the laser room is located and where the science behind the various types of light and their influence on human perception is explained through very simple interactive devices. From there, you move on to the Forces and Motion section, where gravity, momentum, kinetics and dynamics are again explained through interactive experiences, including the G-Drop, a gigantic slide where you get hoisted up and then slide down. Then there is the Robotics section, where visitors learn what makes a robot and how it functions. There are even robotic arms to control for a full interactive experience of how robots work. Naturally, there is an Information Technology section to explain the nuts and bolts behind modern technology and how modern-day devices and appliances are created. This is where the making of tablets and smartphones are explained and demonstrated. On the second level, there is a Life Tech section, where the digital autopsy machine is displayed, and which also comprises various sections on other diagnostic systems, nutrients and the science behind keeping people healthy through technology. On the same level is the Electromagnetism section, where topics such as electricity and magnetism are demonstrated through mini-interactive experiences in which visitors can experience magnetic fields and the flow of electrons on their own. Finally, there is a Children’s Exploration Zone for younger children who may not be able to grasp some of the more sophisticated exhibits. There will also be an observatory slated to open at the end of the year. Besides the permanent exhibits, the Penang Tech Dome will have a line-up of events, and Science, Technology, English and Maths (Stem) programmes almost every month. This month, an Education Toys Demo together with FisherTechnik, Grow Kid and Science Explorer will be held along with a celebration of the Perseid Meteor Shower by the Astronomical Society Penang. A Japanese Technology Weekend will be held in September with events and workshops lined up by Sony EMCS (Malaysia), Toray Group (Malaysia) and Murata Electronics (Malaysia). The Penang Tech Dome is open daily from 10am-6pm except for Tuesdays.

Resend activation e-mail Opposable Thumbs / Gaming & Entertainment No Man’s Sky Windows port launched today, is kind of a mess Button remapping woes, framerate hitches; first patch already online. by Sam Machkovech - Aug 12, 2016 8:15 pm UTC Login to bookmark 238 Three days after its PlayStation 4 launch, the space-exploration game No Man's Sky is now live for Windows PC gamers (via either Steam or GoG). But if you've been anywhere near PC gaming for the past few years, you won't be surprised to find out that combining "small development team," "video game that promises 18 quintillion planets," and "worldwide simultaneous launch on all kinds of PCs" is a dangerous mix. The game's Steam reviews, which have surpassed 5,700 as of press time, are sampling out as "mostly negative," with frequent complaints about framerate hitches and total system crashes. Though Steam's reports must be considered anecdotal, more than a few trustworthy voices are piping up online to report issues with No Man's Sky, despite using systems that far exceed the game's minimum spec, which calls for older cards like the GTX 480 and Radeon 7870. Even users with high-end solutions like the GTX 1080 or two GTX 980Ti cards in SLI mode are reporting major stutters—on a game that runs on a comparatively so-so PS4 console with a mostly consistent 30 FPS refresh. Ars Technica is running two NMS test sessions on high-end PCs at the moment, and both of them are running GTX 980Ti cards with SSD drives, 16GB of RAM, and either a Skylake i5 or a Haswell i7 Intel chip. We're seeing inconsistent framerates, in spite of both computers in question having fully updated drivers on Windows 10. The game's PC version defaults to a 30 FPS cap, which can be disabled in the normal options menus. But with this setting turned on, the game can't help but hitch down to an apparent 20 FPS on a regular basis, not to mention throw up frequent display hitches of half a second at a time. Removing that framerate cap can get play up to a smooth 60 frames per second, and we enjoyed more consistent framerates without the cap. But even those framerates can bounce down to 30 or less at random intervals. The game also suffers from freezing hitches, even without apparent spikes in visible geometry like creatures or spaceships. Developer Hello Games chief Sean Murray took to Twitter to ask users to check their video cards' drivers and make sure their video cards are compatible with OpenGL 4.5. Otherwise, he offered little recourse beyond "we'll try to resolve ASAP" for affected users. A patch was already uploaded within minutes of the game's 1pm EDT launch on Friday, but Ars' tests came after that patch went live. Beyond these rendering-engine issues, we've noticed some surprising sloppiness in how NMS treats PC gamers. While the game supports total button remapping on either keyboard-and-mouse or gamepad, its on-screen prompts don't update accordingly. For example, harvesting a resource always brings up a prompt saying what button triggers the action. But if you remap that button (on keyboards, it defaults as E), the prompt will either remove the button hint entirely or continue asking that you press the E key. (Those remaps do not apply to the "rename your discoveries" interface, by the way. So if you like uploading custom names for your creatures and planets, we hope you like the default button assignments.) The game's floating-menu interface was apparently built with joysticks in mind, which PC gamers have been finding out the hard way. Mouse scroll wheels cannot be turned on to scroll between menus or through text, and players are also forced to hold-to-confirm every menu interaction in the game. If you'd hoped that using a mouse would simplify the game's constant use of menus and loot-sorting, you may be disappointed. Oh, and don't try alt-tabbing out of the game. That's a guaranteed crash. We imagine some of those interface bits could see an update before long, but we're surprised to see such usability issues not checked before the game's launch. How long the widespread stutters will last, however, is anybody's guess. Expand full story Promoted Comments Xenoveritas Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post I haven't had any issues with alt-tabbing the game. (In fact, I'm alt-tabbed out right now!) I did, however, discover that changing pretty much ANY of the graphics options makes the game constantly blink on my computer. Like, the screen just goes completely black, at a rate that leaves the game entirely unplayable. Changing them back is an effort in either massive frustration or just editing the No Man's Sky\Binaries\SETTINGS\TKGRAPHICSSETTINGS.MXML file. (Just throwing that out there for anyone else who needs to tweak graphics settings or needs to know where to look to revert a setting change they made that makes the game effectively unusable.) The problem is that changing anything requires restarting the game. If you're just starting out and haven't touched your ship yet, you haven't created a save. So do that before playing with options and be prepared to hunt for the "Quit to Desktop" option (it's in the Options tab of the menu for some reason). And that's ignoring things like apparently I may have broken the game by taking the preorder ship. Who knows. 13 posts | registered 9/24/2014 Reader comments 238 You must login or create an account to comment.

Before you head to the lake, check out Xconomy Seattle’s review of a couple of healthcare IT investments; Apple’s acquisition of Turi (nee GraphLab, then Dato) and the future of the iPhone; new funding for Zenoti and Kepler Communications; a new fund for Keiretsu Capital; a 12th Man licensing deal; and Paul Allen’s new music festival. —We’ve seen a couple of significant healthcare IT investments in the last week. Accolade, which provides personalized guidance on healthcare decisions to employees of large, self-insured employers, topped up its Series E funding round to the tune of $70 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Madrona Venture Group, among others. The company recently established a second headquarters here under the leadership of Rajeev Singh, a co-founder of Concur, one of the Seattle-area’s biggest startup success stories. That followed last week’s $11 million investment in 98point6, which is hiring software engineers and physicians to “deliver direct patient care through technology.” Both companies have in common a focus on delivering healthcare help—or, in the case of 96point8, care itself—through technology. The Northwest, and specifically University of Washington, has been a hub for development of telemedicine practices going back four decades, at first as a way to provide care in remote areas. It’s an area that appears poised for significant growth, according to a new survey by the National Business Group on Health, which represents 425 large employers. The survey, which polled 133 companies with more than 15 million covered individuals, found that nine out of 10 employers plan to offer telehealth services in 2017, in states that allow it. That’s up from seven out of 10 that planned to do so in 2016. The group’s CEO, Brian Marcotte, says large employers are placing less emphasis on the design of their healthcare plans for the coming year, and thinking more about “optimizing how health care is accessed and delivered. That translates into expanded telehealth services,” among other efforts, he says in a news release. And that should bode well for companies like Accolade, 98point6, and their competitors. For more on what Washington can do to encourage healthcare IT innovation, check out Rob Arnold’s piece in the Xconomist Forum. —ICYMI late last week, Turi—formerly known as Dato and GraphLab, but all the while one of Seattle’s most prominent machine learning startup companies—was acquired by Apple. GeekWire first reported the news (and today has a report on rumors that Apple may be looking for a very large chunk of Seattle-area office space) but oddly, a week has gone by with no public acknowledgement of the deal from Turi’s leaders or investors. Need to know basis. For a glimpse at why Apple is making acquisitions in machine learning, check out Wade Roush’s iPhone 7 predictions. He argues that the software on our mobile devices needs to catch up with the hardware, which is nearing perfection—at least for the current world of the touch user interface. “What’s missing is an organizing idea—a new way of packaging and interacting with the information on our mobile devices. Something that will make iOS look as primitive as the operating system on a 2003 Treo or Blackberry. “And here’s my big prediction: that idea is Siri. Or rather, her future offspring. To make the next leap, Apple and its competitors need to figure out how to build more powerful conversational agents, so that computing can finally move off the screen and into our daily lives.” To do that, Apple needs to race against the rest of tech giants for experts in machine learning and other artificial intelligence precursors. Turi’s staff included lots of people with that expertise. See, for another example, Intel’s $400 million-plus acquisition this week of Nervana Systems, a San Diego machine learning startup. —Zenoti, which provides management software geared for spas, salons, and resorts, raised a $15 million Series B funding round from lead investor Norwest Venture Partners, and Accel Partners, which invested in the company’s $6 million Series A round. The 6-year-old Mercer Island, WA-based company says it will invest some of the new capital to expand its offerings for fitness and yoga businesses. —Kepler Communications, a 2016 Techstars Seattle company based in Toronto, Canada, announced a $5 million seed funding round from lead investor IA Ventures, joined by Techstars Ventures, Liquid 2 VC, SK Ventures, Zelkova Ventures, Plug & Play Ventures, V1 VC, Globalive Capital, and BDC. The funding will support the company’s launch of two communications satellites by the end of 2017, which will form the initial pieces of a network that the company says will reduce costs and latency for accessing satellite data. Co-founder and CEO Mina Mitry has high praise for the support the company received during its time in Seattle, citing in particular Techstars Seattle’s managing director, Chris DeVore, and Joe Landon of the Space Angels Network. It’s worth reading Mitry’s perspective on the fund-raising process, and the out-sized attention the tech world pays to venture funding events, as opposed to more meaningful milestones on the path to building a real business: “All too often I find entrepreneurs get praise for raising investment while those building businesses that bootstrap to exciting revenues go unnoticed. The converse should be true as bootstrapped businesses have actually built a machine (business) that works. We’re only at what I like to call step 0 of execution; we’ve got the parts and resources to build our machine, but some assembly is required. “Fund raising quickly becomes a toxic activity that takes away from building a real business. It’s easy to get roped in by the allure of travelling to different destinations, meeting exciting people, and landing investor checks, so much so that you unwittingly ignore (or want to ignore) very real problems that need to be solved. To that end, I made every effort to minimize how much of the team’s most precious and finite resource – time – would be spent to get the necessary money resource. This came at the cost of isolating myself from most business operations and the team for an extended period of time. Needless to say, I’m happy to be off the fundraising trail.” —Keiretsu Capital, the managed investment fund set up in 2015 to invest alongside angel investing groups, including its namesake, Keiretsu Forum, announced a $4.2 million second fund. That brings the fund’s total to $10 million, of which more than $5 million has been invested in upwards of 40 companies. The remainder is earmarked for investment through early 2018. Keiretsu Capital is headed by CEO Nathan McDonald, who also chairs the Keiretsu Forum Northwest, which last year saw its members plough a record $43.5 million into startup companies. —At Xconomy, we pay close attention to university technology transfer and intellectual property licensing deals. This one doesn’t have much to do with tech or biotech, our usual focus areas. But hey, it’s almost football season, and today happens to be August 12, so: When the Seahawks first went to the Super Bowl in 2006, putting their 12th Man fan base in the national spotlight, it attracted the ire of Texas A&M, whose football team has a proud 12th Man tradition dating to 1922. I wrote about it for The Seattle Times. A decade later, Texas A&M says it has reached a new licensing agreement for the “12th Man,” which the Aggies trademarked in 1990. A clip from the Seahawks website. 12s, not 12th Man. The five-year deal prohibits the Seahawks from using “12th Man” on the Ring of Honor in the stadium, and the Seahawks franchise can’t use it on social media. The Seahawks pay Texas A&M a licensing royalty covering limited use in the Pacific Northwest. But the team mostly now uses “12” or “12s”—which is much more inclusive than the gender-specific 12th Man—in reference to the fan base. Anyway, the first pre-season game is Saturday at the Kansas City Chiefs.   A rendering of a concert stage in the North Plaza of CenturyLink Field. Via Upstream Music Fest + Summit. —And while we’re on the subject of the Seahawks and CenturyLink Field, word came this week that team owner Paul Allen is launching a new festival around another one of his passions: music. Allen’s Vulcan Inc., which just pulled off a well-received art fair, announced the Upstream Music Fest + Summit to take place May 11-13, 2017, in venues in and around Pioneer Square, including the plaza north of the football stadium. The event looks like a South By Southwest-style combination of conferences and concerts, highlighting artists based in the Northwest. From the event’s Website: “At our Summit we’ll collide music, gaming, tech, media, design, and more to tackle today’s toughest industry challenges and open up opportunities within the new entertainment economy.” Benjamin Romano is editor of Xconomy Seattle.

The PC version of No Man’s Sky was released today, and this version of the game already seems a bit disappointing. The good news is that the game supports a variety of resolutions, from 640 by 480 all the way up to 4K, and a good number of other graphical options and settings. Be aware that the game is locked at 30 frames per second upon launch, and you’ll have to manually bump that up if you want a smoother experience. The controls are also fully remappable, and a mouse and keyboard will give you more options and finer controls than a standard gamepad, although the game also ships with gamepad support if you prefer to play in that manner. On paper, this is a full-featured PC release with all the little fiddly bits that we were hoping for. In practice, it doesn’t seem to be quite ready for prime time. I’m playing on a system with an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU, 16 GB of RAM and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080. It’s a test system that’s on loan, and it’s a bit overpowered to play a game that was first released on the PlayStation 4. And I’m still seeing issues with frame rates. It doesn't help that you have to restart the game every time you adjust the graphics settings or Alt-Tab out of the application. For reference, here are No Man's Sky's minimum specifications: OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions) Processor: Intel Core i3 Memory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: Nvidia GTX 480, AMD Radeon 7870 Storage: 10 GB available space The game hitches and the frame rate drops at random moments, and it’s obvious enough to be distracting. The PS4 version doesn’t quite look as good as the game being played at 3440 by 1440, but it’s a much smoother experience. I also tabbed out of the game to make these notes, and it doesn’t seem like I can tab back into the game. Other people on social media are having similar problems; the game is having issues with stuttering and low frame rates. Sadly the PC launch of No Man's Sky is unacceptable. People are pissed. It wont launch, dips and freezes. They need to patch it ASAP. — Destin Legarie (@DestinLegarie) August 12, 2016 The game currently has 882 reviews on Steam, with a "mostly negative" rating. Our advice? Wait a bit to see if performance is improved in the near future before purchasing. The PS4 version of the game runs much better, as painful as that is to say. Hello Games is currently working on patching the PS4 version of the game, which had its own share of issues. Update: The game has already been patched, and the official Twitter account has offered some tips to get No Man's Sky running smoothly. Biggest issue reported so far is players without the Visual C++ Redist 2010. First PC patch released already! Update and restart if needed — Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 12, 2016 Number two issue so far is players who have out of date GFX drivers, or none installed. Please install latest drivers from AMD and nVidia. — Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 12, 2016 Number three please make sure your GFX card is above the min spec. OpenGL 4.5 is required to play No Man's Sky — Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 12, 2016 We've tried all these solutions, and are still seeing some performance issues. Other folks are having better luck with the game's performance by maxing the framerate cap and disabling v-sync. If you have any tips for getting the game to run better, please post them in the comments.

Known as Fuchsia, it seems to be a completely different project to Android and Chrome OS, but its purpose remains unknown. Fuchsia was uncovered this week. It first made a public appearance in early July, when Google quietly created a new repository for the operating system on its development server. The OS is open-source, allowing outsiders to peek in and contribute as Google begins to build Fuchsia. Not a lot of code has currently been written. There's a basic kernel, Magenta, that targets "modern phones and modern personal computers" and the beginnings of a user interface stack to create apps. According to notes in the repository, the operating system can already be booted onto the Intel NUC mini-computer and Acer Switch 12 laptop. Support for the Raspberry Pi 3 is said to be coming soon. Google's choice of UI framework, responsible for creating graphical elements like the desktop and windows, has prompted discussion amongst developers. Fuchsia uses Flutter for its user interface, a framework that includes another project called Escher. Escher supports complex effects like soft shadows and light diffusion that appear out of place on the lightweight Fuchsia. In a comment on Hacker News, user pavlov proposed a reason for Escher's presence. The shadow and reflection effects that Escher specialises in are a key component of Google's Material Design Android design language, suggesting Fuchsia will run apps that are styled like current Android ones. "I think the idea here is to build an UI layer that's designed from scratch for Google's Material design language," explained pavlov. Apart from the Material Design focus, nothing else is known about Fuchsia. Google hasn't officially said anything about the OS and speculation is rife about its intentions for the project. A new operating system from a company as sizeable as Google is bound to attract attention and Fuchsia is no exception. There's currently no serious suggestion that Fuchsia is built to replace either Android or Chrome OS, Google's two current operating systems. It could be designed to combine the two into a single merged OS, as has been previously rumoured. The inclusion of a kernel that runs on phones and PCs fits with this idea, although the emphasis on lightweight software makes it less plausible. Fuchsia may be planned as an operating system for internal use by Google. It could be intended to power Internet of Things devices that require a scaled-down core, but the inclusion of a sophisticated UI stack doesn't make sense here. Hacker News users suggested the OS may be intended as a platform for virtual and augmented reality. Here, a complex UI layer is required, allowing developers to create immersive visually appealing content. A slimmed down kernel is also desirable, reducing input latency and creating higher frame rates. Fuchsia could be an OS designed from the ground-up for VR, indicating Google's growing interest in the field. Advanced users interested in the project can download and build it themselves from the source. It comes with a basic kernel, support for a handful of programming languages and a single functioning program. As Fuchsia evolves over the coming months, Google's intentions for the project should become more obvious. It may be some time before it's clear whether Fuchsia is a new device-agnostic OS for consumers or something to run behind the scenes at Google, however.

‘Our Technology Is Our Ideology’: George Siemens on the Future of Digital Learning EdSurge https://www.edsurge.com/ News Higher Education Postsecondary Learning ‘Our Technology Is Our Ideology’: George Siemens on the Future of Digital Learning By Marguerite McNealAug 11, 2016 George Siemens Check Out the EdSurge Digital Learning NetworkLet’s Go! Top Stories: What does it mean to be human in a digital age? Some people researching education technology might not spend their days wondering how their work fits into this existential question—but George Siemens isn’t "some people." “Maybe my mama hugged me extra when I was a baby.” That’s his explanation for how he thinks about the role of education in the 21st century. A researcher, theorist, educator, Siemens is the digital learning guy. He’s credited with co-teaching the first MOOC in 2008, introduced the theory of “connectivism”—the idea that knowledge is distributed across digital networks—and spearheaded research projects about the role of data and analytics in education. Siemens’ work is on the cutting edge of what’s possible in digital learning, but he doesn’t want to discuss the latest fads in education technology. Instead he wants to talk about humanity. He’s optimistic that technology can help people achieve a higher quality of life in a future where work is increasingly automated and distributed across the globe. He just doesn’t think our current university systems and edtech solutions will get us there. “Our technology is our ideology,” Siemens says. He’s worried that, rather than advancing our human potential, many edtech companies and universities are perpetuating the status quo. While machine learning and automation are obviating the need for learners to memorize content and develop routine skills, current edtech solutions still focus on helping learners develop these capabilities, he says. Instead, they should drive students to hone their uniquely human traits—the ones that will help them thrive in an increasingly automated world. Rise of the robots Siemens has both an academic and an industry perspective on digital learning. He’s a researcher and strategist with the Technology Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute at Athabasca University in Alberta. He also leads the the Learning Innovation and Networked Knowledge (LINK) Research Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington. The LINK Lab is a hub for international scholars exploring the digitization of knowledge and learning, and how this process impacts education. Siemens also serves on the advisory board of learning analytics company Civitas Learning and is a mentor to startups in Intel’s Education Accelerator. He’s currently working with adaptive technology platform Smart Sparrow as part of a research grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Throughout his various projects, of which there are too many to track, he focuses on education’s potential to develop the capabilities that make humans unique. Affect, self-awareness and networking abilities are all traits that separate mankind from machines and will be important for work and life in an increasingly automated world. The kind of knowledge that humans need to function in society looks different than it did during the Industrial Revolution. Apple supplier Foxconn recently replaced 60,000 workers with automated technology, a move that’s becoming increasingly common as machines master more routine tasks. Now that robots are flipping burgers and reading X-rays—for a fraction of the cost of human labor—learners need to prepare for careers that employ uniquely human traits like self-regulation and communication. Creativity, complex problem-solving and coordinating with others are among skills that will become increasingly important for workers to develop by 2020, according to the World Economic Forum. From adaptive learning to adaptive learners Siemens worries that current education systems aren’t adjusting to this new reality. Even the latest edtech trends are still preparing students for a concept of work and life that’s quickly becoming outdated, he says. He points to the learning management system as an example. It’s controlled, top-down, by the institution that bought it; it’s closed to anyone without a login. The LMS reflects a content-driven concept of education that encourages learners to master what the university thinks they should know. Blogs, wikis and social media, on the other hand, are distributed across networks. These technologies encourage more self-driven, open-ended exploration—skills that Siemens says are increasingly important for humans to function in their careers and society. On his blog, he’s opined that most adaptive software focuses on knowledge acquisition instead of helping students in learning to think and function in modern society. Colleges are increasingly using adaptive technology in large online or blended courses to help students learn at their own pace. But while these solutions make learning more efficient, they’re perpetuating an outdated form of learning, Siemens says. “You’ve made a process efficient that would make an awesome, productive employee in the 1960s, but you haven’t developed the mindsets, the networking capabilities and so on that you need for an individual—not just an employee, but a member of society—in 2020. To make a process more efficient that shouldn’t be done at all is a waste of time.” To some, that kind of thinking equates to putting the cart before the horse. “You can’t be an adaptive learner if you don’t know anything,” says Rory McGreal, a professor in the Centre for Digital Learning at Athabasca University. He says learners need to master content and skills before they can move on to “higher-order” functions like creative thinking. “In order to be creative, you have to have skills behind that. I think you teach creativity by giving facts and showing how to do things.” McGreal, who’s worked alongside Siemens at Athabasca, cautions against putting the learner at the center of education conversations. “This focus on the learner is a big mistake. We should look at the whole learning system and how it works—the learner, teacher, technologist, administration, community.” The path forward Our ability to look at the “learning system” and see how it works is getting better by the day. Learning analytics tools now track the digital breadcrumbs that students leave everywhere from signing up for meal plans to completing online homework assignments. Siemens says rich data about students is a game changer for higher education. “One of the most important developments for the education system of today—over the last 100 years—has been the development of data-centric models to understand learner performance and teacher activity.” Most universities have yet to use this data in meaningful ways though, he adds. Institutional leaders might be excited about the potential for data solutions like early warning systems that indicate whether students are at risk of dropping out of a course. But most of them need to do a better job of understanding how these systems work and what kinds of data they’re capturing. University staff who are buying data-driven technology should demand transparency from the companies that sell them these tools, Siemens says. That’s the only way they’ll be able to study the tools and understand how they’re impacting student outcomes. Say a company promises its solution reduces the dropout rate among first-generation students by 15 percent; Siemens argues that the university should be able to look at the company’s data—and algorithms that use the information—to understand how this happens, and to make sure the product does what it claims. Otherwise, there’s an “imbalance of power” that leaves universities—and researchers like himself—in the dark, he says. Siemens is optimistic about the future of higher education, if data remains open as colleges work with more and more companies. He says right now, universities are experiencing an “enormous unbundling.” The value of a traditional bachelor’s degree has come under fire, as students are supplementing and customizing their education with alternative options like MOOCs, programming bootcamps and nanodegree programs. As Napster “unbundled” music albums, edtech startups are unpacking the degree. But that’s not what Siemens is excited about. He’s interested in the rebundling of higher education. “If we do things right, we could fix many of the things that are really very wrong with the university system, in that it treats people like objects, not human beings. It pushes us through like an assembly-line model rather than encouraging us to be self-motivated, self-regulated, self-monitoring human beings.” The rebundling, which according to Siemens hasn’t happened yet, will upend the university’s role as a gatekeeper of knowledge. Instead, he’s hopeful that putting the pieces of higher ed back together and rearranging them will create new networks of learning that encourage students to think beyond any one discipline or career path. “It just gives us this terrific opportunity to make a system that is more humane, more reflective of the needs of individuals, and that legitimately helps this current generation of student realize that broader goals of being part of something that matters rather than something that pays.”   Comments EdSurge’s Weekly HigherEd Newsletter is Here!

A new report has now shed more light on the upcoming device, revealing there'll be three models and a new "gapless" Surface Book. According to Windows Central's Daniel Rubino, Microsoft is planning a "refreshed" line-up of Surface devices for launch next year. The current Surface Pro tablet and Surface Book laptop will be revised with "modest" updates, clearing the way for the launch of the all-new Surface all-in-one (AiO) PC. Unlike the other members of the Surface family, the new PC will be aimed at living room users. Microsoft is aiming to create an "elegant" computer that owners will want to see in their living room, according to Rubino's inside sources. Three different versions of the PC currently exist internally, giving customers a choice of display sizes and resolutions depending on budget and space. 21.5-inch, 24-inch and 27-inch variants are available. The 21.5-inch option has a Full HD 1920x1080 resolution. The larger versions get ultra-high resolution 4K panels. The sizes and resolutions may be adjusted before launch. The rest of the hardware specifications are currently unknown. The PCs are likely to be based on Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake processors but no firm details have leaked out yet. However, with Microsoft hardware still relatively obscure to most consumers, the company is likely to use the living-room-based "Surface AIO" as a flagship for its brand. That would suggest cutting-edge, high-power hardware to match the rest of the Surface line-up. As with the other members of the family, Surface AIO is likely to include a unique standout feature that makes it more suited to its purpose than its rivals. With the original Surface, it was the ability to convert seamlessly between tablet and laptop. Last year's creative-oriented Surface Book is one of the most powerful detachable notebooks ever built. The star device-defining feature of the Surface AIO is still a closely-guarded secret. It can be assumed it will be a little different to current all-in-one PCs by manufacturers like Dell, HP and Lenovo, but exactly how remains up for speculation. Microsoft isn't devoting its entire hardware team to Surface AIO. It is also working on updates to the existing Surface products, designing the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 for launch either in the fall or early next year. The Surface Book in particular is getting a reworked design, Rubino's sources said. Notably, its unique fulcrum hinge has been revised so it sits flush with the keyboard tray, allowing for a gapless design. The large hinge on the current model prevents the laptop's lid from meeting the keyboard when closed, leaving a visible gap between the two that looks unsightly and makes the Surface Book more liable to become a dust collector. The new design will solve this issue, allowing the lid to close completely like a regular laptop. Surface Book at Microsoft's October 2015 #Windows10 devices event. Microsoft October 2015 Live Event The update will also feature more modern internals, including Intel's new Kaby Lake processors again. Microsoft could offer an upgraded discrete graphics card too, turning Surface Book into an even more capable mobile workstation. Microsoft is still widely rumoured to be working on a Surface Phone, a professional-oriented smartphone to restore its now almost non-existent handheld business. No information has leaked about the project for a while, either to say it's in active development or has been abandoned. The phone is now expected to launch sometime next year. All of these reports should be taken with a grain of salt as Microsoft is yet to reveal anything about its new Surface products. It has previously hinted at a single launch this year, however, followed by three more devices in 2017. Microsoft may be planning an event this fall, coming a year after the launch of the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. There's some speculation it may wait until early 2017 though, timing the unveiling to coincide with the release of the "Redstone 2" update for Windows 10. With the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book selling well and anticipation high for a Surface Phone, Microsoft's next-generation hardware could prove to be another success, a few years on from its $900 million write down of the original Surface tablet.

VENTURE CAPITAL How This Woman Went From Homelessness to Running a Multimillion-Dollar Venture Fund A year ago, Arlan Hamilton was bouncing from couch to couch chasing a dream. Now, she's leading a $5 million venture fund focused on finding the most promising female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs.

She landed investments from top names in tech, including Marc Andreessen and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. CREDIT: Backstage Capital Advertisement After another long day of chasing down potential investors, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton was ready for bed. The only problem was, she had no idea where she would sleep. As day turned to night, Hamilton sat at a table outside of a grocery store in Palo Alto, California, with a backpack, her suitcase, and nowhere to go on this Sunday in September 2015. For more than a year, she had been pursuing her dream of starting a venture capital fund focused on female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs. But it's tough to get a fund going when you don't have any money to invest. Hamilton had met with every investor she could track down and cold-called everyone in tech she could think of. No one had written her a check. Why would they? Hamilton, an African American lesbian, was a Silicon Valley outsider. She had no track record as a venture capitalist. And she wanted to invest in a segment of founders with little proven success. She'd spent everything to bootstrap her mission. For months, she'd been homeless, sleeping on couches, in motels, out of cars, at airports. As a weary Hamilton sat, contemplating her next move, her phone buzzed. "I'm in," read the text from Susan Kimberlin, a tech veteran who made a name for herself at Salesforce and PayPal. Kimberlin was ready to bet on Hamilton to bring more diversity to tech--and her check was the lifeline Hamilton needed to get Backstage Capital up and running. Hamilton sat there in silence, lost in thought, letting the moment sink in. "I made it," she thought to herself before standing up to do a moonwalk and a little twirl. Then immediately, she went back to work, calling the startups she'd been wanting to invest in for months. She picked up her bags and started walking. "I never had to be homeless again after that," she says. Not a charity There is a wave of new venture funds focused on bringing more diversity to Silicon Valley, by investing in women, people of color, or those of the LGBT community. Backstage Capital, along with Kapor Capital and Intel Capital's diversity fund, is an exemplar of such firms. Since Kimberlin's first check, Backstage Capital has collected investments from a who's who of tech investors and executives, including Marc Andreessen, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca and his wife, Crystal English, Rose Tech Ventures managing partner David Rose, Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie, and Swati Mylavarapu of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. To date, Hamilton, 35, has invested in nine sets of founders whose companies tap into ideas and markets that have been largely ignored by the predominantly white, Asian, and male Silicon Valley. With her $5 million fund, Hamilton looks to capture 1 percent ownership in early-stage companies that are seeking their first round of funding. "Arlan's focus on diversity will unlock access to valuable talent and huge markets that haven't been on the radar of traditional investors," Sacca says. "She's out there finding companies that I would never ever have seen," marvels Rose. Hamilton's portfolio includes Text Engine, a startup that allows users with "dumb phones" to pull information from the internet; Radial, a music-streaming app focused on the soca, a Caribbean-based drum-heavy dance offshoot of calypso; and Tinsel, a hardware company that makes fashionable necklaces that double as headphones. "Last year when I was raising money, being black, being a woman, being pregnant--it was just strike after strike of what investors are not interested in," says Aniyia Williams, Tinsel's CEO. "But when I talked to Arlan, she got it right away." Lowercase Capital chairman Chris Sacca. Sacca is among the numerous big-name investors to join Backstage Capital as a limited partner. CREDIT: Getty Images Like many of her tech idols, Hamilton wears the same uniform every day: a black shirt or black hoodie that proudly sports the name "Backstage Capital" in bold purple letters. Tall, African American, and female, wearing her hair in a short black bob, Hamilton looks nothing like the majority of venture capitalists in the Bay Area--but nonetheless has the goals of any investor. "This is not a nonprofit or a charity. I want killer companies that are making money and will make money," says Hamilton, who rarely raises her calm and confident voice. "My job is to make money for my investors, and I can't do that with companies based on my heart. It has to be based on companies that are badass." As with the rest of the tech industry, diversity among venture capitalists is scarce. Among 71 of the top venture capital firms, women represent only 8 percent of senior investment teams, according to data compiled in 2015 by Social Capital and The Information. Hispanics and African Americans make up just 2 percent of those ranks. All this trickles down to startups. Only 2.7 percent of venture-funded companies are led by women, according to a 2014 report by Babson College. Just 1 percent of founders among venture-backed startups are black, according to 2010 data from CB Insights. More specifically, a mere 24 black women received any venture funding from 2012 to 2014, according to the #ProjectDiane report released in February. Hamilton, obviously, understands that some of her founders will fail, but she believes they deserve to be given the same opportunities that are often plentiful for white, Asian, and male entrepreneurs. "For all of the Mark Zuckerbergs or the successful companies that we see that are founded by white men, how many have failed?" says Alicia Thomas, CEO of Dibs, a Backstage Capital-backed startup whose technology lets gyms charge dynamic--or surge--pricing for their classes. "Women and people of color aren't given the chance to fail because it's like, 'Oh, see, that's what happened.'" Chasing billion-dollar ideas Hamilton first started studying tech in 2012. At the time, she was working in the music industry as a production coordinator, helping orchestrate shows for acts like CeeLo Green, Kirk Franklin, and Amanda Palmer. This was Hamilton's dream job, but she noticed that many of the artists and music executives she admired were investing their music money in tech. That piqued her interest. Hamilton began reading and watching anything she could get ahold of to teach her about the world of tech and venture capital. She'd watch keynote speeches on YouTube and read blog posts and books by investors, "even though I didn't understand most of it," Hamilton says with a chuckle. But she'd grown up knocking on strangers' doors as a Jehovah's Witness (she no longer practices), and had no qualms about randomly reaching out to founders and investors and offering to help in any way she could. Making connections and helping young companies land investments gave her a high. It became a hobby, something she did at home in Houston in between her artists' tours. And all her life, Hamilton had been insatiably curious. In elementary school, Hamilton would ask countless questions, often to the annoyance of her teachers. This landed her on both the honor roll and in the principal's office--for being disruptive. Hamilton, who'd grown up without much money, was often one of few black kids in her honors classes. In them, she would make a point and see it receive little attention--but then, a white boy would be praised for saying something similar. "I grew up very quickly understanding that I was going to have to do more if I wanted to be seen as equal," she says. "I was going to have to work at least twice as hard if I was even going to be given a chance or taken seriously." And, as she connected founders and investors, she saw that more often than not, it was the white male founders she helped that received the most opportunities: "It became clear really fast that there were certain people who were not getting meetings, even if they had a really great company." To the queer black woman within her, this was wrong. To the hustler within her, it was a huge opportunity. While others saw markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence as the next jackpot technologies, Hamilton saw the next billion-dollar ideas in that pool of untapped, underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a side project to her music gigs, Hamilton chased the idea of a fund focused on LGBT entrepreneurs, for about six months in 2013. "I went hard on that, but it just didn't take off at all," she says. Hamilton had no credibility in the tech industry: "There was a lot of stuff I had to prove." Her music career was on an upswing, but as months passed, Hamilton became obsessed with her idea. She decided she was going to give it another try. In August 2014, Hamilton wrote an email to all her music colleagues and told them she was putting her career on pause. "Anyone who works in music will tell you that it's hard to get a gig, and to turn down gigs is silly," says Hamilton, who was then ready to fully focus on her fund. "To turn down the only money that was coming in ... yeah, it was crazy." Aniyia Williams, CEO of Tinsel, is one of the several founders who have received funding from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital She began living off her savings while lining up entrepreneurs she hoped to invest in and scrambling to meet more investors. She just needed to find one person who believed in her. That proved tougher than she had imagined. As months went by, Hamilton was forced to leave her apartment and bounce around from one friend's couch to another. By the end of 2014, she had yet to collect a single investment check, but she had begun building her profile with powerful Silicon Valley allies, including Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the top startup accelerator. Altman couldn't invest in Backstage Capital, given his commitments to Y Combinator, but one night as Hamilton sat in a motel room in Houston, unsure when her next meal would come, Altman sent her an email. "The world needs what you're doing, and I want to help you," he said. "I just remember thinking, 'Wow. If he's saying that, that means this could be bigger than I thought,'" Hamilton says. Dear White Venture Capitalists On January 1, 2015, Hamilton relocated to Austin. A month later, she flew to San Francisco for Y Combinator's Female Founders Conference. "It wasn't, 'Oh, my god, this is Disneyland.' It was like, 'This feels right. I feel confident here. I feel like I belong,'" Hamilton says. Later, when she got accepted for 500 Startups' two-week seminar for new investors in Palo Alto, Hamilton bought a one-way ticket. She got there in May and rubbed shoulders with dozens of other rookie investors. Many were already-wealthy industry veterans. One of them was Kimberlin. The two gravitated to each other thanks to their similar investment theses: They believed diversity was technology's next great opportunity. After working in tech for 18 years, Kimberlin knew firsthand how rarely women appear atop the corporate ladder. She wanted to change that through angel investing, and Hamilton intrigued her. As part of the seminar, the investors were encouraged to establish their brands by writing essays for Medium. Write about what you know, 500 Startups' Dave McClure said. Hamilton penned a piece titled "Dear White Venture Capitalists: If You're Reading This, It's (Almost!) Too Late." It went viral. "Your goal is to make money as a VC or accelerator who is investing other people's money because you have a fiduciary duty to do everything in your power to bring your LPs returns," Hamilton wrote in her Medium post. She implored investors to dedicate fractions of their funds to underrepresented entrepreneurs and offered to help. "Therefore, if you haven't hired a team of people who are of color, female, and/or LGBT to actively turn over every stone, to scope out every nook and cranny, to pop out of every bush, to find every qualified underrepresented founder in this country, you're going to miss out on a lot of money when the rest of the investment world gets it." Hamilton's inbox exploded with emails from founders and others in tech thanking her for the post. Many invited Hamilton for meetings. Some were enticed by her arguments but not quite ready to make the jump. Others offered to bring Hamilton in--but have her work in the background, without any ability to invest. "I pitched to well-known VCs, and I was met with a pat on the head. 'Good idea, but let's talk another time,'" Hamilton says. "I thought, 'Cool. We'll talk when I'm writing a check across the table from you.'" Building brick by brick Hamilton didn't need their support. She had Kimberlin. "I got to the point where I understood what a difference it would make, what kind of possibilities it would unlock for somebody to write her that first check and let her form the fund," Kimberlin says. "It was an opportunity for me to put my money where my mouth was." Hamilton won't disclose the size of that check--but it nonetheless came just in time. "I could only go so far on my own steam," Hamilton says. "There was a breaking point where I would not be able to go any further without any capital." With the check in hand, Hamilton began calling entrepreneurs she'd met months before and finally made the investments she'd been waiting to make. She invested in entrepreneurs like Sarah Heering, co-founder of NailSnaps, which lets people print nail art designs as stickers--an idea that several male VCs failed to understand. "You as a man don't get it; you don't walk into a salon and have to sit there for an hour smelling those chemicals," Heering says. "Having females on our investor sheet is important because it helps us solve the problem." NailSnaps co-founders Angel Anderson, left, and Sarah Heering are among nine sets of founders who have received investments from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital But one limited partner does not a venture fund make, and while Hamilton's Medium post spread her name, she still needed endorsements. That's when Stewart Butterfield came in. Butterfield, the co-founder and CEO of Slack--Inc.'s Company of the Year in 2015--is uniquely positioned to affect diversity in tech. While Slack's work force--around 600 employees--is tiny next to the likes of Google and Facebook, the company is growing so rapidly that its hiring over the next year or two could make it one of the first major tech companies to reach, or approach, gender and ethnic parity. Butterfield has hired multiple leaders in the tech diversity movement, including Erica Baker, an engineer who left Google after she was reprimanded for raising awareness over salary inequality, and Leslie Miley, a former engineering manager at Twitter who left the company over its lack of diversity. Butterfield is among the few elite CEOs who has spoken about the topic at length, and he has given the limelight to his underrepresented employees during key moments, like the night Slack won the Crunchies award for Fastest Rising Startup. When Butterfield caught wind of Backstage Capital, he followed Hamilton on Twitter and sent her a direct message. He wanted to invest. "Stewart Butterfield changed things," Hamilton says. "It added more legitimacy to what I was doing." With Butterfield's support, Hamilton's momentum picked up. "Each time we got a Stewart, each time we got a Marc Andreessen, it was one more step in us knowing we were on the right track," she says. "Every time we could tell our LPs that someone else had joined, it was a celebration." She was still building the fund brick by brick--but now, when she had conversations with prospective investors, she could point to Kimberlin's and Butterfield's names on her list of limited partners. "She's hustling," says Slack's Miley, who also decided to invest in Hamilton. "Whether it's chasing down billionaire investors or showing up at fundraising events, you know she put the work in to get where she is." Many of Backstage Capital's LPs are venture capitalists themselves, but Hamilton supplied an opportunity to discover entrepreneurs they might have otherwise missed. "She gets access to entrepreneurs that your typical Valley investor might not," says Lars Rasmussen, an angel investor and veteran of Google and Facebook. "It's almost like using an unfair advantage by knowing Arlan and using her connections into an area that is overlooked, and wrongly overlooked." Others who have invested in Hamilton see it as doing their part to add diversity to the industry they love. "Part of our reason for backing Arlan is acknowledging and understanding that everyone in tech has these blind spots," says Zachary Bogue, co-managing partner of the firm Data Collective. Box CEO Aaron Levie speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2015 in New York City. Levie is one of several tech leaders who have invested in Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Getty Images Creating the next generation Now that her fund's up and running, Hamilton has the tough task of proving her thesis. Despite all her big-name investors, the fund is small, and, she says, must be run lean. Her investments are typically seed-round bets that range from $25,000 to $100,000. "The next stage will be going out and finding truly world-class companies that can be game-changing in their respective markets. That's the hard part for any investor: still being incredibly selective on where you're going to put the capital to work," says Aaron Levie of Box. Levie joined Backstage Capital as an LP this spring. "It'll be exciting to see how the portfolio evolves over time." For Backstage Capital, it's not enough to spot promising entrepreneurs. Hamilton and her staff--she now has a full team that includes Kimberlin as a venture partner--don't expect to see any returns on their investments within the next five years, so in the meantime, it's important that they, like many other top VC firms, help these founders get to the next stage. "We try to punch higher than our weight, so if we're putting $50,000 in, we try to do enough work so it feels like we gave you half a million dollars," Hamilton says. The Backstage Capital business model is to connect founders with bigger investors--like those she's brought into her fund. Because, she says, "our $50,000 check means nothing if that company can't raise again." There's also this, Hamilton says: If Backstage's founders succeed, they'll become the next generation of role models and angel investors themselves. Published on: Aug 12, 2016 Advertisement

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Finance  ⋮  Hardware Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) Reports A Strong Second Quarter for FY17 – Beats Analysts’ Expectation by 16 Cents with EPS of $0.53 and $1.43 Billion in Record Revenue By Usman Pirzada Posted Aug 11, 2016 65Shares Share Tweet Submit Stock image of Nvidia's GTX 1060 Graphics Card which will compete with AMD's RX 480. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) has reported a non-GAAP EPS of 53 cents, easily beating out analysts’ expectation of 37 cents per share. With a beat of 16 cents, the chip manufacturer has reported an impressive quarter and is continuing its streak. Analysts expected Nvidia to report revenues of 1.35 Billion, which the company was able to beat by a handy $80 Million for a total reported second quarter revenue of $1.428 Billion. During the first half of fiscal 2017, Nvidia spent $509 million in share repurchases and $124 million in cash dividends. Nvidia will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.115 per share on September 16, 2016, to all shareholders of record on August 25, 2016. In the wake of such a strong quarter and the fact that Nvidia holds 81% of the GPU market share (according to Jon Peddie research) the company’s share price rose to a record high of $62 and is currently trading After-hours (at the time of writing) at around $61.7. Keep in mind however, that the past few months have shown an incredible period of growth in Nvidia’s stock and a correction to support levels could potentially see the price dropping due to herding behavior. Things to remember about Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) current quarter This quarter marks a new era for the chip manufacturers AMD and Nvidia – where the transition from the 28nm node to a sub-20nm node is made (which in the case of Nvidia is 16nm FinFET+). The company has recently introduced the first generation of FinFET GPUs with GeForce branding. This is an upgrade a long time in the making since we have been stuck on 28nm for quite a few years (since 2012). The performance of these GPUs exceeded expectations and have been met with unprecedented demand in the high end segment. However: The company has yet to match competition below the $250 price point. It has been trying to make headway into the autonomous vehicle industry which is currently dominated by Mobileye. This is something that stands to change following the recent divorce of Tesla and Mobileye. While the company’s iron grip on the mainstream GPU industry is impressive, it needs to maintain its bullish momentum in other sectors to ensure proper diversification of risk. Deep Learning is something Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs are being widely implemented in and this lead is being maintained thanks to introduction of Pascal architecture with CuDNN 5 The downside risk of this company is limited in nature, however, it is still vulnerable to disruptions that originate from TSMC (including but not limited to Apple being given priority for orders on the 16nm node or bad yields both of which are likely). Specifically regarding the sub-$250 price point, the question was put to CEO Jen-Hsun Huang on the investors conference call asking whether, given his earlier statement that all Pascal chips had taped out and ramped, was Nvidia ceding the sub-$250 market to competition. The answer to that was that although all Pascal chips had taped out and ramped, they had not yet all been introduced. This of course is something readers of our site will already likely be familiar with in our previous reporting on a potential cut down 1060 3GB (which may also be introduced as the 1050). Pre-Earnings Analysis: Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia Corporation Nvidia is major supplier of chips to car manufacturers, but the vast majority of these go into the infotainment systems. The self-driving sector is something that Nvidia has not yet been very successful in breaking into. To properly diversify away from the risk of a  possibly shrinking PC market (as alleged by Intel), Nvidia is attempting to establish itself as a provider of autonomous driving technology – where it is currently trying to dislodge the well established Mobileye. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)’s GPGPU implementation is much more flexbile than Mobileye and their GPUs have a much higher MAC/s rate (the relevant metric for self driving chips) however, due to the lack of an established ecosystem, they have not been particularly successful thus far. Keep in mind however that the B2B market for production runs of things like cars are likely multi-year negotiating efforts with huge terms on both sides to be agreed before deals of this nature get signed and announced. Advertisement Deep Learning and AI is something the world has just started to foray into, and one of Nvidia’s biggest intrinsic strengths is that its GPUs are the go-to standard for deep learning clusters. Of course, how much of their revenue comes from these clusters and after taking into account upgrade cycles the impact of this particular upside diminishes somewhat. GPU Business revenue was $1.20 billion, up 25 percent from a year earlier and up 11 percent sequentially, reflecting strength in datacenter and GeForce® gaming GPU revenue. Tegra Processor Business revenue of $166 million was up 30 percent year on year and up 4 percent sequentially, reflecting growth in Tegra automotive. Gaming platform revenue was $781 million, up 18 percent from a year ago, driven by Pascal™ gaming GPU sales across  all regions. “Strong demand for our new Pascal-generation GPUs and surging interest in deep learning drove record results,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer, Nvidia. “Our strategy to focus on creating the future where graphics, computer vision and artificial intelligence converge is fueling growth across our specialized platforms — Gaming, Pro Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive….We are more excited than ever about the impact of deep learning and AI, which will touch every industry and market. We have made significant investments over the past five years to evolve our entire GPU computing stack for deep learning. Now, we are well positioned to partner with researchers and developers all over the world to democratize this powerful technology and invent its future,” During the earnings call, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang fielded a question about the penetration of Pascal thus far into the gaming segment. In answering the question, he stated that of the ~80 million GeForce cards currently in use, only about a third of those had even upgraded to Maxwell and as such Nvidia sees a huge upgrade potential still in the market to Pascal given that initial penetration is extremely small into their overall footprint, the implication of course being that just under two thirds of users are still on Kepler or older cards. Professional visualization revenue from Quadro® was a record $214 million, up 22 percent year over year and up 13 percent sequentially. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla® and Nvidia GRID™, was a record $151 million, up 110 percent from a year earlier and up 6 percent sequentially, amid strong demand for GPU acceleration related to deep learning. Automotive revenue from infotainment modules and product development contracts was a record $119 million, up 68 percent from a year earlier and up 5 percent sequentially.

This Is Not Normal » Why We Shouldn’t Want Manufacturing Jobs Back August 12, 2016 by Adam Lee Leave a Comment The words “Rust Belt” evoke a vanished age of American greatness. Cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit, once mighty economic powerhouses, now have a reputation for dwindling and decline. Their factories have closed; their populations are aged and shrunken; their civic architecture has fallen into desolation and decay, spawning the genre of “ruin porn”. And the resentment and despair of rootless former blue-collar workers is a central issue in the presidential race. This story resonates because it’s easy for most people to imagine what’s been lost. Everyone can imagine a bustling assembly line, or a foundry where molten metal is poured in torrents of flame. Fictional characters like Atlas Shrugged‘s Hank Rearden, creating factories from scratch with his bare hands, feed the popular narrative of the heroic industrialist. The conventional wisdom is that American manufacturing and industry, which offered secure jobs and a ticket into the middle class, was laid low by offshoring and free trade. There’s just one problem with this picture, and that’s that the numbers don’t bear it out: In the last 20 years, which include enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, real, inflation-adjusted U.S. manufacturing output has increased by almost 40%. Annual value added by U.S. factories has reached a record $2.4 trillion. The American manufacturing industry hasn’t disappeared – far from it. In fact, we make more stuff now than we ever did, even in the supposed golden age of industry: So in dollar terms, output is at record levels — worth more than $2 trillion. Back in 1964, remembered as a glorious time in our industrial history, factories generated only about $1.3 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars. (source) If it’s hard to find a “Made in the USA” tag on shelves, that’s because we mostly don’t make consumer goods like clothes or shoes anymore. But we do make plenty of high-tech products: pharmaceuticals, electronics, medical devices, advanced machinery, aircraft and aerospace. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, or Intel’s ultra-advanced D1D fab in Oregon, or the 3D-printing New Lab at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, are all examples of the kind of advanced manufacturing that’s going on today. In terms of value added to the economy, U.S. manufacturing output is at an all-time high. What’s at a low – and here’s where the popular story comes closest to truth – is manufacturing employment. Part of this, it’s true, is that low-skill industries have migrated to other countries. But an equally large part is that improvements in technology allow one employee to do work that once took many. It’s not the free trade, it’s the robots. (China’s manufacturing output is only slightly larger than ours, and they employ ten times as many people to do it.) Manufacturing is following the same downward trend as agriculture, where an industry that once required huge numbers of laborers is becoming more efficient and mechanized. It used to be 38% of all jobs, and is now just 8%, even as overall productivity has risen. And more innovations are coming. Engineers are using computer vision to solve a problem that’s long stymied them, namely sewing clothes. A robot can cut and weld steel plates, but fabric that can bend, stretch and wrinkle has been beyond their capability – until now. This is exactly what we should want. We shouldn’t want make-work jobs, paying people to do by hand what could be done faster and more efficiently by machines. Most old-school manufacturing jobs were dirty, arduous, dangerous, low-paid, and often all four. Lest we be tempted to romanticize them, Jacob Riis describes the sweatshops of old New York – little different from the conditions that people still labor under today – in his muckraking classic How the Other Half Lives: You are made fully aware of it before you have travelled the length of a single block in any of these East Side streets, by the whir of a thousand sewing-machines, worked at high pressure from earliest dawn till mind and muscle give out together. Every member of the family, from the youngest to the oldest, bears a hand, shut in the qualmy rooms, where meals are cooked and clothing washed and dried besides, the livelong day. It is not unusual to find a dozen persons – men, women, and children – at work in a single small room. These kinds of jobs aren’t coming back, and we should be glad for that. More and better robots will free humanity from this drudgery, and we can use the liberated brainpower to come up with more new ways to improve our lives and take us ever closer to a post-scarcity society. Of course, the real reason people are nostalgic for these jobs is that they didn’t take an advanced education. It does raise the question of what the new ladder out of poverty will be, if factory workers and garment workers are displaced by machines. I admit I don’t have a good answer for that. But whatever the solution may be, I’m certain that trying to rewind the clock and reverse the trend of human progress isn’t it.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Microsoft extends Windows 7, 8.1 Skylake lifespan Published on 12th August 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 1 Comment News Microsoft has officially extended support for Intel's Skylake chips in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through to their respective EOL dates, from a planned 2018 cessation. Microsoft has officially extended the support lifespan for its users with Skylake hardware and its previous-generation Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems. While Microsoft had originally set a deadline of July 17, 2017 for support of Skylake chips in its last-generation operating systems, as part of its not-so-gentle campaign to upgrade as many users as possible to Windows 10, it has been having second and third thoughts regarding its decision. Earlier this year Microsoft extended the deadline for cessation of support by a further year to July 2018, and now the company has announced that it's adding another three and six years to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 respectively. 'Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows, claimed Microsoft's Shad Larsen, director of Windows business planning, in the announcement as an apparent attempt to head off any suggestion that Windows 10 is proving unpopular with business users. 'At the same time, we recognise that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy. We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates.' The new deadlines, which promise security updates for Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processors, see Windows 7 supported through to the January 14, 2020 and Windows 8.1 to the January 10, 2023. 'This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel,' claimed Larsen, 'who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates.' The company has reaffirmed, however, that seventh-generation chips from both Intel and AMD - Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge respectively - will not be officially supported under Windows releases prior to Windows 10, and that 'all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.'

Clear Linux Makes HTTP/2 The Default, Adds Images To Dockerhub Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 12 August 2016 at 07:48 AM EDT. 2 Comments For those that may be interested in the Clear Linux distribution for improved performance or other innovative functionality, the third "Clear Linux Highlights" newsletter has been published to share more of the recent changes to this Linux distribution out of the Intel Open-Source Technology Center. Recent changes to Clear Linux include making HTTP/2 the default Internet protocol, both for client and server components packaged by Clear Linux -- just not any web browser default. Clear Linux also is now providing OS images on Dockerhub so that it's easy to deploy a barebones CLR container with docker pull clearlinux and makes it easy to play with Clear Linux atop any other distribution via docker run -it clearlinux. Clear Linux has also updated a wealth of packages including the new Binutils 2.27, GO 1.7, Firefox 48.0, btrfs-progs 4.7, and many others.

Local Enterprise Office Clare is providing the support required to ensure a positive return on investment and it has injected enormous confidence in budding entrepreneurs to generate and follow through on their own business ideas. The organisation, working in partnership with Enterprise Ireland, Connect Ireland and IDA Ireland, is creating an environment where companies can set up operations more quickly. County Clare is a long established and proven location for international business, home to global leaders including Zimmer, Microsemi, GECAS, Intel, Avara, Element Six and Lufthansa Technik Turbine. The same factors that influenced many leading companies in choosing Clare also apply to smaller, more mobile companies as well as start-up enterprises. The years immediately following the economic downturn in 2008 were difficult for SMEs and entrepreneurs in terms of accessing the necessary supports and training to develop their businesses. Clare County Council now delivers an all-in-one support outlet for businesses. The pooling of expertise and resources at the Council’s corporate headquarters of Áras Contaean Chláir has streamlined the process for any business seeking financial, information or training assistance. There is a strong history of successful FDIs and start-ups in Clare. The vibrant business community is complemented by a supportive local authority, a strong talent pool of graduates coming from five Third level Institutions and a high quality broadband infrastructure. Combine this with a high standard of living, low employee turnover, easy accessibility by road and air, and a comprehensive network of business parks, offices and enterprise zones the county caters for all needs. Housing the largest cluster of foreign direct investment outside of Dublin, the Shannon Free Zone remains one of Ireland’s most important investment locations. While Shannon may historically be associated with aviation its difference today lies in its ability to cater for a wide range of other sectors including ICT, engineering, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and international services. “When it comes to finding a home for a business, it’s easy at Shannon, with both Shannon Commercial Properties and Westpark Business Campus tailoring property solutions that meet new and existing businesses’ exact and technologically-advancing needs. That’s why high calibre global companies have chosen to base themselves from this West of Ireland location,” explained Helen Downes, Shannon Chamber’s chief executive. “When we mention Shannon and industry, we are more inclined to talk about companies and employment numbers, but equally remarkable are the technologically advanced products produced by these companies, and used globally.” For more info call 00353 6568 21616, email localenterprise@clarecoco.ie or visit www.localenterprise.ie/clare Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn 0 Shares No Comments August 12, 2016 COMMENTS (0) Sign in or create your account to join the discussion Sign in or create your account to join the discussion Related News View All Business News Ireland World UK WIN an Irish Ferries FREE... 0 Shares November 22, 2016 in News, Community, Competitions Stena Line 21% discount for... 0 Shares November 17, 2016 in News, Community Irish TV can be saved 0 Shares November 17, 2016 in News Register now to keep updated with the latest Irish news Email updates Competitions and give aways Full access to 28 years of archives Register Sign up to our Newsletter to be in with a chance to win a snazzy iPad and for all the latest...

VENTURE CAPITAL How This Woman Went From Homelessness to Running a Multimillion-Dollar Venture Fund A year ago, Arlan Hamilton was bouncing from couch to couch chasing a dream. Now, she's leading a $5 million venture fund focused on finding the most promising female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs.

Arlan Hamilton chased her dream of starting a venture fund to support female, minority and LGBT entrepreneurs. She landed investments from top names in tech, including Marc Andreessen and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. CREDIT: Backstage Capital Advertisement After another long day of chasing down potential investors, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton was ready for bed. The only problem was, she had no idea where she would sleep. As day turned to night, Hamilton sat at a table outside of a grocery store in Palo Alto, California, with a backpack, her suitcase, and nowhere to go on this Sunday in September 2015. For more than a year, she had been pursuing her dream of starting a venture capital fund focused on female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs. But it's tough to get a fund going when you don't have any money to invest. Hamilton had met with every investor she could track down and cold-called everyone in tech she could think of. No one had written her a check. Why would they? Hamilton, an African American lesbian, was a Silicon Valley outsider. She had no track record as a venture capitalist. And she wanted to invest in a segment of founders with little proven success. She'd spent everything to bootstrap her mission. For months, she'd been homeless, sleeping on couches, in motels, out of cars, at airports. As a weary Hamilton sat, contemplating her next move, her phone buzzed. "I'm in," read the text from Susan Kimberlin, a tech veteran who made a name for herself at Salesforce and PayPal. Kimberlin was ready to bet on Hamilton to bring more diversity to tech--and her check was the lifeline Hamilton needed to get Backstage Capital up and running. Hamilton sat there in silence, lost in thought, letting the moment sink in. "I made it," she thought to herself before standing up to do a moonwalk and a little twirl. Then immediately, she went back to work, calling the startups she'd been wanting to invest in for months. She picked up her bags and started walking. "I never had to be homeless again after that," she says. Not a charity There is a wave of new venture funds focused on bringing more diversity to Silicon Valley, by investing in women, people of color, or those of the LGBT community. Backstage Capital, along with Kapor Capital and Intel Capital's diversity fund, is an exemplar of such firms. Since Kimberlin's first check, Backstage Capital has collected investments from a who's who of tech investors and executives, including Marc Andreessen, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca and his wife, Crystal English, Rose Tech Ventures managing partner David Rose, Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie, and Swati Mylavarapu of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. To date, Hamilton, 35, has invested in nine sets of founders whose companies tap into ideas and markets that have been largely ignored by the predominantly white, Asian, and male Silicon Valley. With her $5 million fund, Hamilton looks to capture 1 percent ownership in early-stage companies that are seeking their first round of funding. "Arlan's focus on diversity will unlock access to valuable talent and huge markets that haven't been on the radar of traditional investors," Sacca says. "She's out there finding companies that I would never ever have seen," marvels Rose. Hamilton's portfolio includes Text Engine, a startup that allows users with "dumb phones" to pull information from the internet; Radial, a music-streaming app focused on the soca, a Caribbean-based drum-heavy dance offshoot of calypso; and Tinsel, a hardware company that makes fashionable necklaces that double as headphones. "Last year when I was raising money, being black, being a woman, being pregnant--it was just strike after strike of what investors are not interested in," says Aniyia Williams, Tinsel's CEO. "But when I talked to Arlan, she got it right away." Lowercase Capital chairman Chris Sacca. Sacca is among the numerous big-name investors to join Backstage Capital as a limited partner. CREDIT: Getty Images Like many of her tech idols, Hamilton wears the same uniform every day: a black shirt or black hoodie that proudly sports the name "Backstage Capital" in bold purple letters. Tall, African American, and female, wearing her hair in a short black bob, Hamilton looks nothing like the majority of venture capitalists in the Bay Area--but nonetheless has the goals of any investor. "This is not a nonprofit or a charity. I want killer companies that are making money and will make money," says Hamilton, who rarely raises her calm and confident voice. "My job is to make money for my investors, and I can't do that with companies based on my heart. It has to be based on companies that are badass." As with the rest of the tech industry, diversity among venture capitalists is scarce. Among 71 of the top venture capital firms, women represent only 8 percent of senior investment teams, according to data compiled in 2015 by Social Capital and The Information. Hispanics and African Americans make up just 2 percent of those ranks. All this trickles down to startups. Only 2.7 percent of venture-funded companies are led by women, according to a 2014 report by Babson College. Just 1 percent of founders among venture-backed startups are black, according to 2010 data from CB Insights. More specifically, a mere 24 black women received any venture funding from 2012 to 2014, according to the #ProjectDiane report released in February. Hamilton, obviously, understands that some of her founders will fail, but she believes they deserve to be given the same opportunities that are often plentiful for white, Asian, and male entrepreneurs. "For all of the Mark Zuckerbergs or the successful companies that we see that are founded by white men, how many have failed?" says Alicia Thomas, CEO of Dibs, a Backstage Capital-backed startup whose technology lets gyms charge dynamic--or surge--pricing for their classes. "Women and people of color aren't given the chance to fail because it's like, 'Oh, see, that's what happened.'" Chasing billion-dollar ideas Hamilton first started studying tech in 2012. At the time, she was working in the music industry as a production coordinator, helping orchestrate shows for acts like CeeLo Green, Kirk Franklin, and Amanda Palmer. This was Hamilton's dream job, but she noticed that many of the artists and music executives she admired were investing their music money in tech. That piqued her interest. Hamilton began reading and watching anything she could get ahold of to teach her about the world of tech and venture capital. She'd watch keynote speeches on YouTube and read blog posts and books by investors, "even though I didn't understand most of it," Hamilton says with a chuckle. But she'd grown up knocking on strangers' doors as a Jehovah's Witness (she no longer practices), and had no qualms about randomly reaching out to founders and investors and offering to help in any way she could. Making connections and helping young companies land investments gave her a high. It became a hobby, something she did at home in Houston in between her artists' tours. And all her life, Hamilton had been insatiably curious. In elementary school, Hamilton would ask countless questions, often to the annoyance of her teachers. This landed her on both the honor roll and in the principal's office--for being disruptive. Hamilton, who'd grown up without much money, was often one of few black kids in her honors classes. In them, she would make a point and see it receive little attention--but then, a white boy would be praised for saying something similar. "I grew up very quickly understanding that I was going to have to do more if I wanted to be seen as equal," she says. "I was going to have to work at least twice as hard if I was even going to be given a chance or taken seriously." And, as she connected founders and investors, she saw that more often than not, it was the white male founders she helped that received the most opportunities: "It became clear really fast that there were certain people who were not getting meetings, even if they had a really great company." To the queer black woman within her, this was wrong. To the hustler within her, it was a huge opportunity. While others saw markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence as the next jackpot technologies, Hamilton saw the next billion-dollar ideas in that pool of untapped, underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a side project to her music gigs, Hamilton chased the idea of a fund focused on LGBT entrepreneurs, for about six months in 2013. "I went hard on that, but it just didn't take off at all," she says. Hamilton had no credibility in the tech industry: "There was a lot of stuff I had to prove." Her music career was on an upswing, but as months passed, Hamilton became obsessed with her idea. She decided she was going to give it another try. In August 2014, Hamilton wrote an email to all her music colleagues and told them she was putting her career on pause. "Anyone who works in music will tell you that it's hard to get a gig, and to turn down gigs is silly," says Hamilton, who was then ready to fully focus on her fund. "To turn down the only money that was coming in ... yeah, it was crazy." Aniyia Williams, CEO of Tinsel, is one of the several founders who have received funding from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital She began living off her savings while lining up entrepreneurs she hoped to invest in and scrambling to meet more investors. She just needed to find one person who believed in her. That proved tougher than she had imagined. As months went by, Hamilton was forced to leave her apartment and bounce around from one friend's couch to another. By the end of 2014, she had yet to collect a single investment check, but she had begun building her profile with powerful Silicon Valley allies, including Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the top startup accelerator. Altman couldn't invest in Backstage Capital, given his commitments to Y Combinator, but one night as Hamilton sat in a motel room in Houston, unsure when her next meal would come, Altman sent her an email. "The world needs what you're doing, and I want to help you," he said. "I just remember thinking, 'Wow. If he's saying that, that means this could be bigger than I thought,'" Hamilton says. Dear White Venture Capitalists On January 1, 2015, Hamilton relocated to Austin. A month later, she flew to San Francisco for Y Combinator's Female Founders Conference. "It wasn't, 'Oh, my god, this is Disneyland.' It was like, 'This feels right. I feel confident here. I feel like I belong,'" Hamilton says. Later, when she got accepted for 500 Startups' two-week seminar for new investors in Palo Alto, Hamilton bought a one-way ticket. She got there in May and rubbed shoulders with dozens of other rookie investors. Many were already-wealthy industry veterans. One of them was Kimberlin. The two gravitated to each other thanks to their similar investment theses: They believed diversity was technology's next great opportunity. After working in tech for 18 years, Kimberlin knew firsthand how rarely women appear atop the corporate ladder. She wanted to change that through angel investing, and Hamilton intrigued her. As part of the seminar, the investors were encouraged to establish their brands by writing essays for Medium. Write about what you know, 500 Startups' Dave McClure said. Hamilton penned a piece titled "Dear White Venture Capitalists: If You're Reading This, It's (Almost!) Too Late." It went viral. "Your goal is to make money as a VC or accelerator who is investing other people's money because you have a fiduciary duty to do everything in your power to bring your LPs returns," Hamilton wrote in her Medium post. She implored investors to dedicate fractions of their funds to underrepresented entrepreneurs and offered to help. "Therefore, if you haven't hired a team of people who are of color, female, and/or LGBT to actively turn over every stone, to scope out every nook and cranny, to pop out of every bush, to find every qualified underrepresented founder in this country, you're going to miss out on a lot of money when the rest of the investment world gets it." Hamilton's inbox exploded with emails from founders and others in tech thanking her for the post. Many invited Hamilton for meetings. Some were enticed by her arguments but not quite ready to make the jump. Others offered to bring Hamilton in--but have her work in the background, without any ability to invest. "I pitched to well-known VCs, and I was met with a pat on the head. 'Good idea, but let's talk another time,'" Hamilton says. "I thought, 'Cool. We'll talk when I'm writing a check across the table from you.'" Building brick by brick Hamilton didn't need their support. She had Kimberlin. "I got to the point where I understood what a difference it would make, what kind of possibilities it would unlock for somebody to write her that first check and let her form the fund," Kimberlin says. "It was an opportunity for me to put my money where my mouth was." Hamilton won't disclose the size of that check--but it nonetheless came just in time. "I could only go so far on my own steam," Hamilton says. "There was a breaking point where I would not be able to go any further without any capital." With the check in hand, Hamilton began calling entrepreneurs she'd met months before and finally made the investments she'd been waiting to make. She invested in entrepreneurs like Sarah Heering, co-founder of NailSnaps, which lets people print nail art designs as stickers--an idea that several male VCs failed to understand. "You as a man don't get it; you don't walk into a salon and have to sit there for an hour smelling those chemicals," Heering says. "Having females on our investor sheet is important because it helps us solve the problem." NailSnaps co-founders Angel Anderson, left, and Sarah Heering are among nine sets of founders who have received investments from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital But one limited partner does not a venture fund make, and while Hamilton's Medium post spread her name, she still needed endorsements. That's when Stewart Butterfield came in. Butterfield, the co-founder and CEO of Slack--Inc.'s Company of the Year in 2015--is uniquely positioned to affect diversity in tech. While Slack's work force--around 600 employees--is tiny next to the likes of Google and Facebook, the company is growing so rapidly that its hiring over the next year or two could make it one of the first major tech companies to reach, or approach, gender and ethnic parity. Butterfield has hired multiple leaders in the tech diversity movement, including Erica Baker, an engineer who left Google after she was reprimanded for raising awareness over salary inequality, and Leslie Miley, a former engineering manager at Twitter who left the company over its lack of diversity. Butterfield is among the few elite CEOs who has spoken about the topic at length, and he has given the limelight to his underrepresented employees during key moments, like the night Slack won the Crunchies award for Fastest Rising Startup. When Butterfield caught wind of Backstage Capital, he followed Hamilton on Twitter and sent her a direct message. He wanted to invest. "Stewart Butterfield changed things," Hamilton says. "It added more legitimacy to what I was doing." With Butterfield's support, Hamilton's momentum picked up. "Each time we got a Stewart, each time we got a Marc Andreessen, it was one more step in us knowing we were on the right track," she says. "Every time we could tell our LPs that someone else had joined, it was a celebration." She was still building the fund brick by brick--but now, when she had conversations with prospective investors, she could point to Kimberlin's and Butterfield's names on her list of limited partners. "She's hustling," says Slack's Miley, who also decided to invest in Hamilton. "Whether it's chasing down billionaire investors or showing up at fundraising events, you know she put the work in to get where she is." Many of Backstage Capital's LPs are venture capitalists themselves, but Hamilton supplied an opportunity to discover entrepreneurs they might have otherwise missed. "She gets access to entrepreneurs that your typical Valley investor might not," says Lars Rasmussen, an angel investor and veteran of Google and Facebook. "It's almost like using an unfair advantage by knowing Arlan and using her connections into an area that is overlooked, and wrongly overlooked." Others who have invested in Hamilton see it as doing their part to add diversity to the industry they love. "Part of our reason for backing Arlan is acknowledging and understanding that everyone in tech has these blind spots," says Zachary Bogue, co-managing partner of the firm Data Collective.

CREDIT: Getty Images Creating the next generation Now that her fund's up and running, Hamilton has the tough task of proving her thesis. Despite all her big-name investors, the fund is small, and, she says, must be run lean. Her investments are typically seed-round bets that range from $25,000 to $100,000. "The next stage will be going out and finding truly world-class companies that can be game-changing in their respective markets. That's the hard part for any investor: still being incredibly selective on where you're going to put the capital to work," says Aaron Levie of Box. Levie joined Backstage Capital as an LP this spring. "It'll be exciting to see how the portfolio evolves over time." For Backstage Capital, it's not enough to spot promising entrepreneurs. Hamilton and her staff--she now has a full team that includes Kimberlin as a venture partner--don't expect to see any returns on their investments within the next five years, so in the meantime, it's important that they, like many other top VC firms, help these founders get to the next stage. "We try to punch higher than our weight, so if we're putting $50,000 in, we try to do enough work so it feels like we gave you half a million dollars," Hamilton says. The Backstage Capital business model is to connect founders with bigger investors--like those she's brought into her fund. Because, she says, "our $50,000 check means nothing if that company can't raise again." There's also this, Hamilton says: If Backstage's founders succeed, they'll become the next generation of role models and angel investors themselves. Published on: Aug 12, 2016 Advertisement

By Souvik DasSouvik Das Published Date 12 - Aug - 2016 | Last Updated 12 - Aug - 2016 Tweet   Titan Smart Analog Digital Watch 19595 When Titan had launched the Juxt, the seasoned watchmaker seemed to be taking cautious steps into the world of smartwatches. The Titan Juxt was essentially a well built and designed analogue wristwatch, with a tiny monochrome OLED display that relayed call, messages and other notifications from your smartphone, along with footsteps, distance and calorie data. The Juxt Pro, launched yesterday at Rs. 22,990, is a different story altogether. The Juxt Pro does not look exactly like the first iteration, and the only thing that is retained is the density and bulk of the watch chassis. The first attempt was Titan’s joint effort with HP, which provided the watchmaker with the engineering and the software for the smart bit of the Juxt. With the Juxt Pro, meanwhile, Titan has gone solo, engineering its own software, its own app and the necessary internals for it. It is powered by the Intel/Rockchip XMM6321 dual-core chip clocked at 1GHz, along with 512MB of RAM, a 450mAh battery and 4GB of native storage (of which 2.4GB is user-accessible). All of this is adorned by a 1.3-inch, full circular IPS LCD display offering 360x360-pixel screen resolution and 278ppi pixel density, and Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 protects it. The all-metal smartwatch can withstand up to 3 ATM pressure, and remain submerged in up to 30 metres of water. On paper, this is one of the most well-equipped smartwatches around. Even in terms of build, the Juxt Pro is crafted from 316L surgical grade steel, and is heavier than any smartwatch that I can recall. It is by far one of the sturdiest, although it seems a tad too large for many. I personally preferred the seamless flow of symmetry on the Juxt’s design, and the abrupt use of plastic on the black ring somewhat disrupts the all-metal feel that Titan wants to bring. The Juxt was one device that I loved in terms of design, but the Juxt Pro feels a bit too bulky for my preference. To be frank, this watch will only suit those with heavier wrists, and even then the weight of it feels a bit too much. Titan has even built the software in use here, by itself. The Juxt Pro gets a different app for itself and not the same as the Juxt, which Titan can (and probably will) merge into a single app in future. The Juxt Pro’s software is not the best-looking out there, and even in terms of animation and resolution of animation panels, it lags behind Samsung’s Tizen, Android Wear and watchOS. But there are plenty of encouraging signs. For one, the UI is smooth and functional, and seems to have every option in place. All it needs is a cosmetic overhaul to make it look more premium. Titan offers 20 preset watch faces and five customisable ones, and the numbers will go up with time. As with the rest of the UI, the watch faces are neat and responsive, but do not look the best. The Juxt Pro gets an accelerometer, haptic engine and pedometer to keep a track of your steps, giving basic fitness functions to it. Titan claims about 12 hours of Always On time with the Juxt Pro, and 36 hours on standard mode. It survived a little over 26 hours with 78% charge, so 36 hours should be achievable. Once it reaches 20%, the Juxt Pro gives you a Low Battery warning, and switching to low battery mode will only show you the time. Titan is selling the Juxt Pro at select World of Titan outlets and on its own online portal, acknowledging the niche audience for its smartwatch. The Juxt Pro has all the ingredients required for a competent smartwatch, and all that seems due is a certain amount of refinement to suit its premium market placement.

Over the past few years, SGI has concentrated on the big-iron end of the server market and high-performance computing. It's this technology that HPE wants to bolster its hardware lineup. "At HPE, we are focused on empowering data-driven organizations," said Antonio Neri, general manager of HPE's enterprise group, on Thursday. "SGI's innovative technologies and services, including its best-in-class big data analytics and high-performance computing solutions, complement HPE's proven data center solutions designed to create business insight and accelerate time to value for customers." SGI, which made millions in the 1990s with its pioneering workstations, has been in decline for well over a decade. Its MIPS-based workstations were the darlings of the entertainment industry in particular, starring in a generation of films such as Jurassic Park – which featured SGI systems behind and in front of the camera – as well as Terminator 2, Men in Black, Forrest Gump, and so on. SGI sold gear into other industries, too, and to the military; it came up with the 3D graphics API OpenGL, which is still used just about everywhere today; it ported UNIX System V to MIPS, calling the resulting operating system IRIX; and it was responsible for the GPU in the Nintendo 64. After getting caught out by the rise of low-cost x86 clusters, SGI languished, and its own Intel workstations built in response were shunned by the industry. It got caught out moving to Chipzilla's ill-fated Itanium processors before shifting to Xeon parts, and went through two bankruptcy motions before being bought by Rackable Systems in 2009 for $42.5m. "Our HPC and high-performance data technologies and analytic capabilities, based on a 30+ year legacy of innovation, complement HPE's industry-leading enterprise solutions. This combination addresses today's complex business problems that require applying data analytics and tools to securely process vast amounts of data," said Jorge Titinger, CEO and president of SGI. "The computing power that our solutions deliver can interpret this data to give customers quicker and more actionable insights. Together, HPE and SGI will offer one of the most comprehensive suites of solutions in the industry, which can be brought to market more effectively through HPE's global reach." Or at least, that's what both sides are hoping. HPE paid $7.75 per SGI share to acquire the company, a 30 per cent premium on its stock price at the close of the market. SGI's total revenue for the 12 months to June 24 this year was $533m, up from $521m a year ago. It made a net loss of $11.1m, which is better than the $39m it lost the year before. Its operating costs nudged up to $168.7m from $145.6m due to overheads from rising sales, marketing and general admin. "SGI, the victim of a cash cow business selling to military and the biggest companies in the world, never made a transition to PC graphics. It could have been Nvidia. Instead, it’s now a footnote," El Reg columnist and VRML co-inventor Mark Pesce blogged earlier today. "This is a sad day, because without SGI, much of modern VR simply wouldn’t exist. They paid for a lot of pioneering research work — yes, in order to sell more systems, but nonetheless they paid for the infrastructure that people still use today – such as OpenGL – to create virtual worlds." ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 37 Comments More from The Register HPE CEO Meg Whitman endorses Hillary Clinton, dumps on Trump Avowed Republican says reality TV star 'would endanger our prosperity and national security' 25 Comments Dude, you got a Dell lawyer: HPE sues high-flying ex-exec after defection to EMC Can anyone leave this company without a lawsuit being filed? 20 Comments HPE dumps software biz into the bargain bin For sale: Slightly used Autonomy, price negotiable 10 Comments Now be honest – would you take divorce advice from Meg Whitman?

Later processors, like Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's Bristol Ridge, will not be supported on 7 and 8.1 at all. To use those processors, their associated devices will need to be running Windows 10 (or, you know, Linux or something). This has just changed for Skylake, but not for Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge. Skylake will now be supported through the entire life-cycle of Windows 7 (January 14, 2020) and Windows 8.1 (January 10, 2023). This is particularly good because Skylake was already released and in the hands of users when they first announced pulling the plug. Now users will know before they purchase their hardware (albeit not before many have purchased a retail copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.x with transfer rights that intend to continually upgrade beyond Skylake or to AMD's Zen architecture) that Microsoft will not support it outside of Windows 10. Source: Microsoft Comments Post a comment August 11, 2016 | 06:18 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) Between large corporations and governments a lot of people are too big for their britches. reply August 11, 2016 | 06:36 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) WTF M$, a double standard for AMD and Bristol Ridge, there really needs to be some Bristol Ridge and Linux OS laptop options and Zen/Polaris APU or Zen/Vega APU Linux OS laptop options. Let's hope the next Apple laptops that come after Apple's upcoming Intel and Polaris macbook pro update will be some macbooks with some Zen/Polaris APU SKUs, so I can get a laptop that runs the BSD Kernel, and will probably do fine for the Linux Kernel also as the drivers are not hard to port over. I'm tired of waiting for any Linux OS laptop OEMs to shed their Intel/Nvidia dependencies! If Apple would just dump Intel for its 2017/2018 line of macbooks and go all Zen/Polaris they would get my money! Then users could get AMD’s better graphics along with Zen’s x86 ISA running cores for better graphics on all macbook laptop SKUs! It’s not like Apple is using any top end Intel SKUs in their macbooks anyways. If Apple really wants to be relevant again in new laptop innovations they would be funding a custom Zen/Polaris APU with HBM on an interposer module and saving a lot of space for a bigger battery in its macbook line of laptops. Apple has billions to spaff away on other less important things and Apple should be really focusing on some Zen/Polaris laptops that will get the people’s business who will never switch to windows 10. Apple could be getting plenty of business from customers who would dual boot MacOS(formally OSX) with a Linux distro and run Linux/Vulkan games and graphics software. reply August 11, 2016 | 06:51 PM - Posted by Butthurt Beluga So, in laymans terms, what does this mean for the casual user? If I slap an AM4 Zen CPU into a Windows 7/8.1 machine, will it just not boot into Windows or something? Or it won't perform as well if it was supported? And the fact that Windows can do this and no governments or consumers bat an eye is just... baffling, really. reply August 11, 2016 | 08:06 PM - Posted by Scott Michaud Microsoft hasn't been too clear about that. Even if it does work, it allows them to release a security update that bricks it (we'll assume accidentally because they refuse to test 7 and 8.1 on Zen). Could just work forever, though, albeit under an ever-looming dagger. reply August 11, 2016 | 09:11 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) If the CPU/APU/SOC hardware comes out before a windows OS's EOL windows 7/8.1 should at least have enough support to run under the new hardware as it's x86 based, maybe not all the new processor’s hardware features will be supported, but really M$ is just shooting itself in the foot with this nonsense. This is really where Linux can get some market share on the newer hardware if M$ does not back off even more. M$'s risks driving more 7/8.1 users over to Linux and Apple/MacOS with all this windows 10 only hardware nonsense! The “free” windows 10 upgrade install base relative to 7’s sill top install base after even a year of nefarious tactics from M$ to ram windows 10 down peoples’ throats should be an indicator of just how many potential customers M$ will loose to Apple’s MacOS, and the Linux based PC market come 2020 and 2023. There are a lot of windows 7 “Downgrade” installs from 8/8.1 Pro versions that will be able to go back to 8.1 after 2020 with the TIFKAM crap disabled! But now all that is up in the air and users will switch to Apple’s Hardware/MacOS and Linux and M$ will lose all the 7/8.1 install base very quickly if it continues to push its foolish windows 10 tactics. This is definitely an indicator that all along people never really liked M$, and they liked 7 mostly because it stayed out of the users’ personal business and gave users more control over their own hardware. People like 7 and hate M$ more than M$ realizes, and many will go to Apple’s closed ecosystem before they go to M$’s even more closed ecosystem, as that EULA from windows 10 is much too far reaching in its ability to allow for M$’s intrusion into the end users personal privacy and loss of control over their own hardware. All that tasteless ad pushing under windows 10 will also help to push more users away from windows 10, and M$ for good. reply August 11, 2016 | 11:00 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) The more you tighten your grip, M$, the more PC systems will slip through your fingers! reply August 12, 2016 | 05:01 AM - Posted by Hakuren Does that mean that they backtrack on Skylake-E/X too?

In all seriousness though, PCPer and everyone with strong influence on the tech community should collaborate on a "Switching to Linux, and what you can do with it" video/series. A good amount of your audience probably doesn't require much help, or simply continues telling themselves "They can't switch" because they need to use software like Maya and Photoshop (like myself). Either way, something tells me we should work together to not only spend as little time on MS-OS's as possible, but contribute to other options preventing us from requiring anything else...

Used with permission MediaTek has revealed an upcoming Helio X30 system-on-chip (SoC) that will likely be one of the first 10nm fabricated SoCs to arrive when it ships in mid-2017. The deca-core mobile SoC will also be one of the first to use ARM’s new Cortex-A73 successor to the Cortex-A72, according to PhoneRadar, which based its story in part on an EETimes China interview [translated] with MediaTek CTO Zhu Shangzu. Manufactured using TSMC’s 10nm FinFET process, the mobile-focused Helio X30 has a tri-cluster design with two 2.8GHz, Cortex-A73 based “Artemis” cores, as well as four 2.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores and four 2.0GHz Cortex-A35 cores. The X30 also sports the high-end, quad-core PowerVR 7XT GPU, which is capable of driving VR headsets, says PhoneRadar. The Helio X30 will support up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and is powerful enough to drive a 26-megapixel rear-facing camera, as well as a front-facing cam. The SoC is said to support UFS 2.1 storage, as well as a three carrier aggregation (3CA) modem that supports the speedy CAT 12 LTE standard. MediaTek’s latest SoC follows its similarly 10-core, but 20nm fabricated Helio X20 and X25. These SoCs debuted the tri-cluster concept, but use only two architectures as opposed to three with the X30. The X20 and X25 have two Cortex-A72 cores and two quad-core banks of Cortex-A53 cores with different clock rates. The Helio X25, which is exclusive to the Android-based Meizu Pro 6 smartphone, clocks the Cortex-A72 cores higher to 2.5GHz instead of 2.3GHz and has a faster 850MHz version of the Mali T880 MP4 GPU. Cortex-A73 cores should provide a 30 percent better sustained performance and efficiency than Cortex-A72, claims ARM, which is in the process of being acquired by SoftBank. The tiny, 0.65 x 0.65mm design, which has been licensed by HiSilicon and Marvell, in addition to MediaTek, features an Artemis microarchitecture borrowed from the rarely used Cortex-A17 chip. Artemis emphasizes “sustained performance,” which means that mobile devices can maintain peak performance for longer periods before being forced to throttle down due to heat buildup. The Helio X30 also features power-efficient Cortex-A35 cores for its low-end cluster. According to ARM, Cortex-A35 draws about 33 percent less power per core and occupies 25 percent less silicon area, compared to Cortex-A53. The -A35 is not as power efficient as the new, IoT-focused Cortex-A32, which is slower, but smaller and more efficient. Cortex-A32 is the first ARMv8 chip that works only in 32-bit mode. Coming Up: Apple A10 and Snapdragon 821 According to PhoneRadar, the Helio X30 won’t ship for another year, either at the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third. A lot can happen in that time, including the upcoming Apple A10 due in the iPhone 7, which is said to be fabricated at 10nm as well. The latest rumors has Apple sticking with two Cortex-A72 or -A73-like cores, following the minimalist design of the dual-core, 16nm Apple A9/A9X. Previously, the A10 was rumored to have between three and six cores. In AnTuTu benchmarks the dual-core Apple A9 has beat most other Android-targeted mobile SoCs with many more cores. The A9 was edged out only by Qualcomm’s quad-core, 14nm Snapdragon 820, which has four Cortex-A72 like “Kyro” cores, although the 14nm, octa-core Samsung Exynos 8890 was close behind. In other benchmarks, the A9 has beaten the Helio X20 and X25. It’s unclear whether Apple has proven that high core counts don’t matter or whether Big.Little dual- and tri-cluster SoC designs have yet to evolve to their full potential. Battery life and other considerations are also important. It remains to be seen how these complex multi-core designs are following through on promises to offer smoother transitions between operation modes like high-power video and VR, standard text and voice, and sleep/idle. Meanwhile, with the move to VR and augmented reality, GPUs are becoming almost as important as CPUs. Indeed Imagination’s PowerVR 7XT is expected to beat out the the Helio X20’s ARM Mali GPU in high-end gaming. MediaTek cares more about competition on high-end Android devices than it does about Apple. Principally, this comes down to Qualcomm and Samsung, with upstarts like Kirin advancing from below. Qualcomm recently introduced a modest upgrade to the Snapdragon 820 called the Snapdragon 821. Due to arrive in devices later this year, the SoC is claimed to offer 10 percent faster performance and provide better battery life than the 820. Intel’s Kaby Lake Stays at 14nm If all had gone according to plan it would be Intel, not MediaTek, announcing the first 10nm processor this month. Last month, Intel began shipping its seventh-generation Kaby Lake core processors, but with few details. We do know that the 7th Gen Core CPUs, which were originally meant to debut a 10nm process, will instead stick with the same 14nm process used by the sixth-gen Skylake and fifth-gen Broadwell chips. Intel’s ditching of its traditional “tick-tock” product release cadence is a sign that the Moore’s Law pace of chip miniaturization is slowing. Still Intel’s 10nm “Cannonlake” is expected in 2017, and on the ARM side, TSMC is already working on a 7nm process. The actual transistor density of the 7nm design is expected to be very similar to the 10nm Intel process, however. Meanwhile, Kaby Lake should offer incremental performance improvements over Skylake while squashing some of the bugs that have nipped at Skylake’s heels. We’ll find out more next week at the Intel Developer Forum. One thing Kaby Lake won’t be is a mobile processor, unless you count high-end tablets and all-in-ones. Intel appears to have dropped future development on its 14nm “Cherry Trail” Atom SoCs, which failed to win over many phone vendors, although more embedded-oriented SoCs like the “Braswell” Celeron, Pentium, and Atom x5-e8000 continue to do well.

HPE is not to be confused with HP Inc. HPQ, the computer and printing division of the original parent company, Hewlett-Packard.   Based in Fremont, CA, Silicon provides high-performance computing (HPC) services such as servers, storage, and data center solutions to clients in the cloud computing, oil & gas, e-commerce, social networking, and other industries. “At HPE, we are focused on empowering data-driven organizations,” said Antonio Neri, executive vice president and general manager of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. “SGI's innovative technologies and services, including its best-in-class big data analytics and high performance computing solutions, complement HPE's proven data center solutions designed to create business insight and accelerate time to value for customers.” The rise of cloud computing and data processing software has been notable. This deal continues a merger trend in the industry, with Intel Co. INTC recently announcing plans to purchase deep-learning startup Nervana Systems for $400 million. Although Intel currently dominates the HPC market, Hewlett Packard hopes to use its synergies with SGI to “strengthen the leading position and financial performance of the combined businesses,” as per the official announcement. Hewlett Packard expects the acquisition to have no effect on earnings in the first full year following its closing, and then an accretive effect from there onward. The company expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2017. Hewlett Packard has seen just one earnings estimate revision in the last 60 days, a downward revision for next fiscal year from $2.03 to $2.02 in earnings per share. It has seen a year-to-date price change of 42.8%, and is in an industry that ranks in the top 39% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Hewlett Packard Enterprises currently sits at a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) due to the aforementioned earnings estimate revision. The Zacks Rank is a truly marvelous trading tool. Our ranking system has beaten the S&P 500, yielding an average return of 25% per year for the last 29 years! Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Over the past few years, SGI has concentrated on the big-iron end of the server market and high-performance computing. It's this technology that HPE wants to bolster its hardware lineup. "At HPE, we are focused on empowering data-driven organizations," said Antonio Neri, general manager of HPE's enterprise group, on Thursday. "SGI's innovative technologies and services, including its best-in-class big data analytics and high-performance computing solutions, complement HPE's proven data center solutions designed to create business insight and accelerate time to value for customers." SGI, which made millions in the 1990s with its pioneering workstations, has been in decline for well over a decade. Its MIPS-based workstations were the darlings of the entertainment industry in particular, starring in a generation of films such as Jurassic Park – which featured SGI systems behind and in front of the camera – as well as Terminator 2, Men in Black, Forrest Gump, and so on. SGI sold gear into other industries, too, and to the military; it came up with the 3D graphics API OpenGL, which is still used just about everywhere today; it ported UNIX System V to MIPS, calling the resulting operating system IRIX; and it was responsible for the GPU in the Nintendo 64. After getting caught out by the rise of low-cost x86 clusters, SGI languished, and its own Intel workstations built in response were shunned by the industry. It got caught out moving to Chipzilla's ill-fated Itanium processors before shifting to Xeon parts, and went through two bankruptcy motions before being bought by Rackable Systems in 2009 for $42.5m. "Our HPC and high-performance data technologies and analytic capabilities, based on a 30+ year legacy of innovation, complement HPE's industry-leading enterprise solutions. This combination addresses today's complex business problems that require applying data analytics and tools to securely process vast amounts of data," said Jorge Titinger, CEO and president of SGI. "The computing power that our solutions deliver can interpret this data to give customers quicker and more actionable insights. Together, HPE and SGI will offer one of the most comprehensive suites of solutions in the industry, which can be brought to market more effectively through HPE's global reach." Or at least, that's what both sides are hoping. HPE paid $7.75 per SGI share to acquire the company, a 30 per cent premium on its stock price at the close of the market. SGI's total revenue for the 12 months to June 24 this year was $533m, up from $521m a year ago. It made a net loss of $11.1m, which is better than the $39m it lost the year before. Its operating costs nudged up to $168.7m from $145.6m due to overheads from rising sales, marketing and general admin. "SGI, the victim of a cash cow business selling to military and the biggest companies in the world, never made a transition to PC graphics. It could have been Nvidia. Instead, it’s now a footnote," El Reg columnist and VRML co-inventor Mark Pesce blogged earlier today. "This is a sad day, because without SGI, much of modern VR simply wouldn’t exist. They paid for a lot of pioneering research work — yes, in order to sell more systems, but nonetheless they paid for the infrastructure that people still use today – such as OpenGL – to create virtual worlds." ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 37 Comments More from The Register HPE CEO Meg Whitman endorses Hillary Clinton, dumps on Trump Avowed Republican says reality TV star 'would endanger our prosperity and national security' 25 Comments Now be honest – would you take divorce advice from Meg Whitman?

The company's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is currently 'BB+', and the Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. Western Digital amended the April 29, 2016 Existing Loan Agreement to establish New Senior Secured Term B-1 Loans, the proceeds from which will be used to refinance outstanding principal amounts under the Senior Secured U.S. Term B Loans, reducing annual interest expense. Western Digital expects amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured U.S. Term B Loans will be $3 billion, pro forma for a $750 million voluntary prepayment expected to be consummated contemporaneous with the Amendment's Effective Date. Terms of the Amended Loan Agreement are substantially the same as those of the Existing Loan Agreement. All obligations of Western Digital under the Amended Loan Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by each of the company's wholly-owned domestic Restricted Subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Amended Loan Agreement are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the Borrowers' and Guarantors' tangible and intangible assets, including 65% of the voting stock of first tier foreign subsidiaries. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Diversified Storage Portfolio: Fitch believes the SanDisk acquisition, closed May 12, 2016, diversifies Western Digital's technology portfolio. The combination positions Western Digital for next generation storage platforms optimizing hard disk drives (HDDs), NAND flash-based solid state drives (SSD) and software, while mitigating nearer-term SSD cannibalization of HDDs. --Increased Scale: The SanDisk acquisition increases Western Digital's scale and supports higher investment intensity, driven by rapid industry evolution around cloud driven data growth and new storage architectures, including 3D NAND, and larger competitors. Should operating cash flows at Western Digital's joint venture (JV) with Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba) or equipment leases be insufficient to keep pace with 3D NAND development intensify, Western Digital and Toshiba Corporation may jointly decide to contribute capital to the JV. --Margin Expansion Roadmap: Fitch expects cost synergies from the SanDisk acquisition and integration of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (Hitachi) will drive profit margin expansion. Fitch believes Western Digital is on track to achieve cost synergies, including $474 million of run-rate cost synergies exiting calendar 2016 and $800 million exiting calendar 2017 related to Hitachi. Given Western Digital's high fixed cost model, lower fixed costs should drive operating EBITDA margin expansion to the mid-20s from the low 20s on a pre-synergy basis. --Commitment to Debt Reduction: Fitch expects rapid debt reduction from free cash flow (FCF) and tax efficient use of offshore cash, made possible in connection with a restructuring that is expected to relocate SanDisk's domestic intellectual property (IP) offshore, will result in the Company achieving its 1.5x total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) target in the intermediate-term. Fitch expects annual FCF of $1.5 billion to $2 billion beyond the near term, during which Fitch believes the vast majority of cash restructuring costs will largely offset recurring FCF. Until Western Digital achieves the 1.5x total leverage target, Fitch expects the company will limit share repurchases to offsetting dilution. --Significant Technology Risk: Fitch believes Western Digital is subject to significant technology risk from the storage industry's rapid evolution and emergence of new storage architectures. Western Digital's strategy of layering optimized software onto hybrid HDDs/SSDs for next generation platform solutions shifts the company's focus to hyper-scale and traditional data center markets but also intensifies technology risk related to a wider array of competitors with alternative technologies. --3D NAND Roadmap: Fitch believes Western Digital could structurally trail competitors in 3D NAND-based products and solutions through the intermediate term, potentially adversely impacting operating results and reducing FCF for debt reduction. Western Digital plans to ship meaningful volumes of its next generation 3D NAND technology, BiCS3, in the first half of calendar 2017, while Samsung, Micron and Intel currently are shipping 3D NAND. Western Digital is accelerating fab conversion to 3D from 2D NAND to increase the mix of 3D NAND to approximately 40% of total wafer capacity by the end of 2017, in line with the industry. --Revenue Pressures and Volatility: Fitch expects Western Digital will face near- to intermediate-term revenue pressures and that increased exposure to datacenter spending should amplify volatility. Fitch expects the continuation of negative PC unit growth and increased SSD cannibalization of HDDs in PCs and performance enterprise. Fitch expects SanDisk's removable retail business will continue being pressured by the increased use of cloud based storage and the decreased use of single function electronic devices, such as cameras. Meanwhile, a sales mix shift to datacenters should improve visibility but also add top line volatility from capex cycles. Beyond the next two years, Fitch anticipates low- to mid-single digit organic revenue growth from market growth in datacenters and enterprise markets. --High Leverage Reduces Flexibility: Leverage was a Fitch estimated just over 4x for fiscal 2016, excluding expected cost synergies but pro forma for the repayment of the Bridge Loan and refinancing and $750 million Term Loan B repayment. Including cost synergies, Fitch estimates leverage closer to 3.5x. Fitch believes reducing leverage is imperative for Western Digital, as investments in innovation, including potential IP-driven acquisitions, are critical to long-term success given rapid technology evolution. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low-single digit organic revenue growth in 2017 and mid-single revenue growth in 2018, driven by client SSD unit growth, moderating PC unit declines, and significant data growth driving enterprise SSD and nearline HDD unit growth; --Significant synergies related to Western Digital's integration of Hitachi and SanDisk driving meaningful profit margin expansion, despite pressures in the removable retail business and core NAND markets such as smartphones; --Repatriation of foreign cash for debt prepayment; --No increases to the dividend or share repurchases beyond anti-dilution until the company achieves its target leverage of 1.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings may be downgraded if Fitch expects: --Sustained negative revenue growth, likely from i) slower than anticipated growth within enterprise that is insufficient to offset the secular decline in PCs and the removable storage market, or ii) market share losses to competing technologies, including 3D NAND; or --Slower than expected debt reduction resulting in total leverage sustained above 3x. Positive rating actions would require Fitch's expectations for: --Consistently positive mid-cycle organic revenue growth from successful implementation of the company's strategy, including increased penetration in enterprise growth markets by leveraging its technology stack; and --Western Digital to reach 1.5x total leverage from significant voluntary debt reduction. LIQUIDITY Fitch believes Western Digital's liquidity was adequate as of July 1, 2016 and consisted of: --$8.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, $1.3 billion of which located in the U.S. and $3 billion of which was used to repay the $3 billion Bridge Loan; --An undrawn and fully available $1 billion Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility expiring April 29, 2021. Fitch's expectations for $1.5 billion to $2 billion of annual FCF beyond the near term also support liquidity. In the near-term, Fitch believes cash restructuring costs will largely offset recurring FCF. Pro forma for incurring the $3 billion of Term Loan B-1 and repayment of $3.75 billion of Term Loan B and Bridge Loan after the recent quarter end, total debt was $13.2 billion at July 1, 2016 and consisted primarily of: --$4.125 billion Senior Secured Term Loan A expiring April 29, 2021; --$3 billion Senior Secured Term Loan B expiring April 29, 2023; --Euro 885 million Senior Secured Term Loan B expiring April 29, 2023; --$1.875 billion of 7.375% Senior Secured Notes due April 1, 2023; and --$3.35 billion of 10.5% Senior Unsecured Notes due April 1, 2024. FULL LIST OF CURRENT RATINGS Western Digital Corporation --Long-Term IDR 'BB+'; --Senior Secured RCF 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior Secured Term Loan A 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior Secured Term Loan B 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior Secured Notes 'BBB-/RR1'; --Senior Unsecured Notes 'BB+/RR4'.

(AFP/Lars Hagberg) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Canada IS Islamic State jihadists Related Stories French mayor bans burqinis on Cannes beaches Argentina identifies last victim of AMIA bombing, 22 years on Bombing in Thai seaside resort town kills 1, injures 20 Uproar over Egypt’s policy of state-dictated Friday sermons At least 7 civilians dead, dozens wounded in two attacks in Turkey Two planes land safely in Brussels after bomb threats UK Labour event drops Israeli-linked firm, loses security Duma survivor Ahmed Dawabsha rehospitalized with fever, infections Video appears to confirm use of attack drones by Hezbollah The Islamic State’s news agency claimed Thursday that a Canadian man killed by police a day earlier was a member of the jihadist group and acting on its general instructions. Aaron Driver, 24, was killed Wednesday during a police raid outside the home where he was staying with his sister in the town of Strathroy, Ontario, after he detonated a small explosive in the back seat of a cab. He was detained last year for pro-IS media posts, and an investigation has revealed his extensive ties to foreign jihadists. An unnamed source told the Amaq Agency that Driver “was a soldier of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to call to target coalition countries.” Referring to #AaronDriver, #ISIS 'Amaq Agency called him a "soldier of the Islamic State" #Canada pic.twitter.com/s7RIv5PYyx — SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 11, 2016 Police said they acted to thwart an imminent “potential terrorist threat.” Driver first came to the attention of authorities in October 2014 with tweets in support of IS and justifying the killing of a soldier standing guard at the Canadian National War Memorial in Ottawa by a young Muslim convert. In June 2015, a court ordered him to undergo religious counseling, wear an electronic monitoring bracelet and stay off the internet. Those restrictions were gradually loosened and were scheduled to expire this month. A convert to Islam, Driver’s views had apparently become increasingly radical after he began following the war in Syria online. “If a country goes to war with another country or another people or another community, I think that they have to be prepared for things like” the October 22, 2014 attack in Ottawa, Driver told the CBC. “And when it does happen they shouldn’t, they shouldn’t act surprised. They had it coming to them; they deserved it.” Still, he publicly disavowed violence. “I don’t think there’s a reason for Canadians to think that I’m a threat,” he said. The RCMP, however, revealed that Driver had been in “fairly constant contact” with violent extremists around the world. They included two members of the Islamic State group, a British youth arrested for his involvement in a terror plot targeting Australia, and Elton Simpson — one of two Americans who launched an attack on a Texas exhibition of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed last year. Investigators searching Driver’s home in 2015 found a recipe for homemade bombs on his computer. In a video released by the RCMP on Thursday, Driver warned Canadians: “You have Muslim blood on your hands and for this we will have your blood.” He called Canadians and their allies “mischief makers” who spread “oppression and corruption.” “You will pay for everything that you have done against us,” he said, dressed in black clothes and a balaclava. According to Canadian media, Driver converted to Islam in his teens after a difficult childhood and a split with his father. Public broadcaster CBC said his mother died when he was seven years old. Driver and his father — a Canadian soldier — recounted last year in interviews with the CBC how their relationship had become strained. The father, whose name was withheld, said his son had become increasingly withdrawn. “It was like he turned out the lights and put a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on the door,” the father told CBC. “When he was living at home, he was very secretive; a lone wolf. He didn’t bring friends over, never talked about where he was going and what he was doing,” Driver’s father said. Driver lived away from home during most of his teenage years. At age 17 he turned to religion. Baptized Christian in his birth province of Saskatchewan, he started reading the Bible, he said, but added “I just decided it couldn’t possibly be the word of God.” After exploring other religions, he converted to Islam.

The benches appeared on Ashes of the Singularity‘s benchmark database this week, and seem to originate from the engineering sample. While not indicative of AMD Zen’s final form, they give a good indication of where the company is headed prior to the platform’s reported 2017 launch. According to WCCFTech (who snagged a few screens of the benches before they were taken down), there are two engineering samples being tested here. One is a hyper-threaded octa-core, with 16 total threads and a base clock of 2.8GHz (which turbos up to 3.2GHz). There’s also an AMD RX 480 GPU to help the system through the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark. And the results? According to similar systems on the database running the RX 480 at 1080p, the AMD Zen does rather well. It manages an average system framerate of 58 fps, second to only the Intel Core i7 4790 (65 fps). The Zen is also faster than the Intel Core i5 4670K, which managed just 52 fps on a similar system. More impressive yet is AMD Zen’s performance compared to its older peers, notably the 4.2GHz FX-8300. The latter could only manage a steady 42 fps, with nearly a GHz difference in potential clock speed. That at least points to promising performance for the AMD Zen chip. Although we can’t draw any conclusions from these numbers, it is key to note that this could be the first AMD chip in a day and age that can perform alongside its Intel contemporaries. And if AMD can somehow undercut Intel in terms of price, AMD may just rise from its slow-burning ashes. But that’s for 2017’s silicon gods to answer. For now, have a look at WCCFTech’s full report.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz August 11, 2016: 12:14 PM ET America's top retailers in trouble These are tough times for people working at department stores and other big mall-based retailers. Macy's (M) announced on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores. The company didn't give any details about how many people would lose their jobs. But more and more department stores that are mall stalwarts, companies like Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Sears (SHLD) and Kohl's (KSS), are losing customers -- and laying off workers. According to figures from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, more than 43,600 layoffs have been announced in the retail sector so far this year. The only two sectors to cut more jobs in 2016 are energy -- due to the massive drop in oil prices over the past two years -- and computers, largely a reflection of layoffs at Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), IBM (IBM, Tech30), Intel (INTC, Tech30) and other old school tech giants. Retail's biggest problem is the shift in how -- and where -- people shop. More consumers are shopping online as opposed to at brick and mortar stores. Related: Macy's closing another 100 stores "The traditional retail industry in some respects is facing Armageddon. There were far too many stores built," said Mark Cohen, professor and director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. Macy's set to close 100 stores It's no secret that department stores have lost ground to online retail king Amazon. The success of Amazon is a big reason why Walmart just bought hot e-commerce startup Jet.com for more than $3 billion. Shopping online is an international phenomenon, too. China's Alibaba just reported strong results on Thursday. But Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Alibaba (BABA, Tech30) aren't the only reason that Macy's and other traditional retailers are closing up shop and letting employees go -- or going bankrupt, like Sports Authority, Aeropostale and Pacific Sunwear. Consumers are increasingly interested in bargain hunting. It makes sense given how sluggish the overall economy is. Discount retailers like TJX (TJX) -- which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls -- Ross Stores (ROST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) are doing well. And Walmart (WMT) is rebounding after a miserable 2015. Related: More trouble at the mall. Gap sales sink again Cohen said that more and more retailers are racing to the bottom -- and are being forced to slash prices to attract customers. "Black Friday starts at Labor Day now," Cohen quipped. The rise of so-called fast fashion is also eating into sales at department stores, as well as once hot clothing retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Gap (GPS). Meanwhile, H&M, Zara and Forever 21 are all doing extremely well. So it may be a mistake to say that all malls are dying -- and that consumers have stopped spending. Yes, many malls are in trouble, especially in big cities. But malls in the more affluent suburbs are merely evolving. Think of all the malls that now have Apple (AAPL, Tech30) Stores as big tenants instead of Macy's. Other retailers outside of the bargain basement realm are still doing extremely well, too. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are thriving as consumers invest more in sprucing up their home or apartment instead of buying new clothes, toys or handbags. That's why it's important to take a look at the bigger picture in retail. Even though the loss of nearly 44,000 traditional retail jobs is bad news for the U.S. economy, other retailers are still in hiring mode. According to the official jobs figures from the government, retailers have added nearly 200,000 jobs this year. This category includes the struggling department stores, but also auto dealers, home improvement chains, supermarkets and "non-store retailers" -- a sub sector that includes Amazon and other e-commerce players. The non-store retailers have added nearly 15,000 jobs this year. Furniture and home furnishing stores have added almost 17,000 jobs. Electronics stores have added more than 4,500 jobs. Related: Why Americans are no longer shopping til they drop The overall retail business isn't going the way of the dinosaur or dodo. But some retailers are. "The retail business is not dead, but some legacy retailers are dying," Columbia's Cohen said.

Kansas Republican Congressman Mike Pompeo told FOX News that the report substantiates claims made by 50 whistleblowers at CentCom: (Pompeo) “Senior analysts were providing data up to the very top, the very top of the intelligence community at CentCom and they were changing that data.” The five-month investigation found no conclusive evidence that White House officials ordered the reports to be doctored.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft extends support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on Intel Skylake devices 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Aug 11, 2016 at 17:04 GMT3 months ago Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that they will only support select Skylake PCs on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Also, they listed over 100 models of PCs with Intel’s 6th generation of processor(Skylake), that will be supported on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. And support for these PCs will be provided until July 17, 2017. Later, they announced changes to the previous announcement by extending the support for 1 more year. Today, they are making changes to this support policy once again. This change is designed to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10. There are now over 350 million devices on Windows 10 and more than 135 billion hours of use since the launch, with enterprise customers deploying Windows 10 to devices every day. We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software. This policy change primarily applies to commercial customers who are currently managing deployments with Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, and does not apply to customers running Windows 10. Today Windows 7 is in extended support and support will end for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, and support for Windows 8.1 will end January 10, 2023. 6th Gen Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. As previously communicated earlier this year, future silicon platforms including Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (e.g. Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.

Retail earnings have also been encouraging. The domestic markets could attempt to break out of the recent lackluster trading phase, although overbought levels might put a lid on the gains.   U.S. stocks retreated on Wednesday, coming under pressure on valuation concerns, with oil's slide providing a reason for liquidating holdings. The major averages opened higher and held above the unchanged line in late morning trading. After slipping below the unchanged, the averages moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session.    The Dow Industrials ended down 37.39 points or 0.20 percent at 18,496, the S&P 500 Index closed 6.25 points or 0.29 percent lower at 2,176 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,205, down 20.90 points or 0.40 percent.    Sixteen of the thirty Dow components declined, while the remaining fourteen stocks advanced. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Nike (NKE), Intel (INTC), American Express (AXP) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM) fell steeply, while Disney (DIS) and Wal-Mart (WMT) gained ground.    Among the sectors, biotechnology, oil service, banking and oil stocks came under selling pressure, while gold stocks advanced.    Currency, Commodity Markets    Crude oil is currently slipping $0.12 to $41.59 a barrel. The September futures ended the previous session down $1.06 at $41.71 a barrel. The drop seen in the previous session came following the release of the weekly petroleum status report for the week ended August 5th, which showed that crude oil stockpiles increased by 1.1 million barrels to 523.60 million barrels. Stockpiles were at historically high levels for this time of year.  Meanwhile, gasoline inventories fell by 2.8 million barrels but were well above the upper limit of the average range. Distillate inventories declined by 2 million barrels, dropping to levels near the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year  Refinery capacity utilization averaged 92.8 percent over the four weeks ended August 5th compared to 92.6 percent for the four weeks ended July 29th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,351.40 an ounce, down $0.50 from the previous session's close of $1,351.90 an ounce. On Wednesday, gold gained $5.20. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 101.30 yen compared to the 101.29 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1158 compared to yesterday's $1.1176. Asia    The major Asian closed mixed on a fairly quiet day, with the Japanese market closed for a public holiday. The Australian, Chinese and Taiwanese markets retreated, while most other major markets moved to the upside. Even as the negative lead from Wall Street and oil's weakness pressured stocks, traders derived some encouragement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand trimming its official cash rate.    Australian stocks retreated, as oil's drop weighed on the market. The All Ordinaries Index opened lower and languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 28.80 points or 0.51 percent at 5,599, falling for the second straight session.    Utility, telecom, financial and energy stocks fell steeply, but IT and consumer discretionary stocks saw strength.    China's Shanghai Composite ended at 3,003, up 16.11 points or 0.53 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at a 1-week high of 22,581, up 88.12 points or 0.39 percent.    On the economic front, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its Official Cash Rate by 25 basis points to a new record low of 2.00 percent, with the central bank attributing the decision partly to low inflation. The decision was in line with expectations and came after the central bank held fire for two straight months.    The Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore reported that GDP in Singapore rose 2.1 percent year-over-year in the second quarter following a 1.8 percent increase in the first quarter. On an annualized quarterly basis, GDP rose 0.3 percent, faster than the 0.1 percent increase in the first quarter.     Europe    European stocks saw volatility in early trading, as traders react to mixed earnings news and oil's weakness.  The French and German markets have since then seen solid gains, while the U.K. Market is lower.   In major corporate news, Thyssenkrupp reported a drop in third quarter profits, weighed down by weak steel prices, although the decline was not as steep as feared. Deutsche Telekom's second quarter profits also fell, but the company confirmed its guidance for the full year. K+S issued weak full year profit guidance, blaming it on lower potash prices.     Henkel reported strong second quarter results and raised its margin guidance for the full year. RWE reported a decline in first half profits, weighed by weakness at its trading business. The company confirmed its full year outlook.     TUI AG lowered its sales growth outlook for the year. Glencore reported declines in copper production for the second quarter. Among insurers, Aegon reported a wider than expected loss for its second quarter, while Zurich Insurance reported a higher operating profit.     On the economic front, the results of a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed that housing activity in the U.K. slowed in July. The house price balance came in at +5 following a reading of +15 in June, while economists expected a reading of +6.    U.S. Economic Reports    First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits edged slightly lower in the week ended August 6th, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The report said initial jobless claims slipped to 266,000, a decrease of 1,000 from the previous week's revised level of 267,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to dip to 265,000 from the 269,000 originally reported for the previous week. With an increase in non-fuel prices more than offsetting a downturn in fuel prices, the Labor Department released a separate report unexpectedly showing an uptick in U.S. import prices in the month of July.   The report said import prices inched up by 0.1 percent in July after climbing by an upwardly revised 0.6 percent in June. Import prices had been expected to drop by 0.4 percent compared to the 0.2 percent increase that had been reported for the previous month. The Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.2 percent in July after advancing by 0.8 percent in June. The Treasury Department is set to announce the results of its auction of 30-year bonds at 1 pm ET.    Stocks in Focus  Alibaba (BABA) reported better than expected first quarter results. Kohl's (KSS) reported better than expected results but it trimmed its adjusted earnings per share guidance, which however is in line. Macy's (M) also reported better than expected second quarter results and announced plans to shut down 100 full-line stores. A. Schulman (SHLM) lowered its adjusted earnings per share for the full year, citing deteriorating market conditions facing the industry in its largest regions in the U.S. and Europe.   Dillard's (DDS), Nordstrom (JWN), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Ruby Tuesday (RT) are among the companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Worst IPO flops of 2016 Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Offices Of Samsung, Pension Fund Raided Over Scandal Involving President Infineon Sees Higher FY17 Revenues, Raises Margin View, Despite Weak Q4 Profit Volkswagen Brand Focuses On Electric Cars, US In Transformation Plan Twitter Suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's Account Briefly HP Q4 Profit Meets View - Update What's In The Offing For These Biotech Stocks?

Download Drivers for Acer’s Aspire XC-603 and XC-603G Desktops The files are suitable for Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 platforms Aug 11, 2016 12:42 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Since Acer has provided all drivers required by its Aspire XC-603 and XC-603G desktop models to run at their best and provide maximum performance, stability, and usability, we have gathered them all in a single list so that owners of these Acer products can easily set up their devices. In terms of compatibility, the desktops, as well as their drivers, are suitable only for the 64-bit variant of Microsoft’s Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 platforms. Trying to apply them on other operating systems isn’t recommended and might lead to various malfunctions. In terms of the producers providing these files, know that Intel has put on the line its Chipset, USB 3.0, TXE (Trusted Execution Engine), and AMT (Active Management) packages while Realtek will enable the full functionality of the Ethernet, card reader, and audio components. Moving forward, Realtek, along with Atheros, ensures the well-functioning of the device’s wireless capabilities (WLAN and Bluetooth). Moreover, Intel installs its HD Graphics build to improve the CPU’s gaming performance while AMD wakes up the dedicated video card so that owners can take details to a whole new level (however, it depends on what GPU model you have). That said, if you own one of these devices (or intend to buy them), download Acer Aspire XC-603 Drivers or download Acer Aspire XC-603G Drivers, apply them, perform a reboot upon completion, and check our website as often as possible to stay up to speed with the latest releases. #Aspire XC-603#Aspire XC-603G#Drivers#Acer#Desktop reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Download Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate X483 and X483G Notebooks Download All Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate P246-M Notebooks Download Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate P245 Notebook Models Download All Drivers for Acer’s TravelMate B117-M Notebooks Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks ASRock Rolls Out New BIOS Updates for IMB-791, IMB-380-L, and IMB-370-L Boards Leica S (Typ 007) Camera Receives New Firmware - Download Version 4.1.0.0    Acer Aspire XC-603 New Apps Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Seymour: Browse through, edit, convert and arrange your photo collection in categories based on the author with this user-friendly application Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Dopamine Portable: Seamlessly organize your music collection and find your favorite tracks based on title, artists, genres, albums or playlists with this software solution Dopamine: Keep your music collection neatly organized based on albums, genre, playlists or tracks so you easily find tracks using this music player Vectorworks: Designed for professionals, this application enables you to create architectural designs, landscapes, theatrical productions and more Portable PhotoLine: A simple to use application bundled with photo editing functions that allows you to enhance, distort, as well as paint over an opened picture Reader comments Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks more on: Intel i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Home Send a Tip Giveaways @appmodo iPadmodo Appmodo iPhone Android BlackBerry Windows Phone Reviews Games How To Free Apps Send a Tip Twitter RSS Sixa – New Cloud Computing Service for Designers By Adam on Aug 11, 2016 at 4:33 am San Francisco, California – Mykola Minchenko and Ievgen Nechaiev have officially launched Sixa, a new cloud computing service for designers of all stripes. Sixa is a full computer that operates right from the cloud via a client app. It includes your choice of hardware and software and is capable of running the most demanding applications. The Company allows users to access a powerful computer in the cloud for complex tasks such as video-editing, design, 3-D modelling, development, gaming or VR. Sixa offers custom computers for developers, designers, and gamers, and each comes with preinstalled software for their specific use cases. Cloud computer can be accessed from any device with a wifi connection. Users can access the service through multiple platforms, including web, PC, Mac, iOS and Android. “Usually, when it comes to multimedia content, remote desktop protocols start to lag, drop the frames, and degrade the picture quality, the sound will be bad, or there will be no sound at all,” Mykola Minchenko, Sixa CEO, explained. “We wanted to change this because we thought of having the user experience from working on the cloud computer without traditional remote desktop protocol limitations.” Sixa computers have an Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) processor, 30GB of RAM, 200GB SSD Disk, Windows 2012 R2, and pre-installed software including FileZilla, Ruby, Visual Studio 2015 Community, Microsoft OneDrive, Adobe Flash, Google Chrome, Firefox, Dropbox, Silverlight, .NET, and Atom. Unlike other cloud computing services SIXA has external devices support, Full HD screen and unlimited resolution. “We’ve seen how lower server and storage costs and increased accessibility to the Internet have empowered tech startups to build great, valuable businesses,” says Adora Cheung, Partner at Y Combinator, where Sixa was accepted in May 2016. “We’re excited to see Sixa further lower the barrier for entrepreneurs to build even more powerful applications and solve the difficulty of building across the ever-growing fragmentation of new game-changing technologies.” For more information, please contact Kateryna Kondrunina or visit Sixa online. Sixa Screenshot Screenshot Sixa, Inc. was founded in September 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company is a graduate of Startupbootcamp Istanbul acceleration program (September – December 2015) and has been backed by Y Combinator to join its Summer 2016 batch.

You get one drink if you’re lucky. Wi-Fi is available, but you’d be crazy to pay for it. recommends 2016 HP Chromebook 13 7/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Clean, business-casual design. Solid battery life. Good keyboard, good speakers, good performance. It can be your only computer, because Chrome OS is so much more than a browser. Tired The trackpad sometimes feels and works like something's gone horribly wrong. You might not want a touchscreen now, but you will soon. Buy It Now   |  HP How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection A few seconds after takeoff, I didn’t know quite what to expect as I reached into my bag for HP’s new Chromebook 13. I had work to do, but couldn’t remember if I’d saved the right Google Docs to work offline. I had a movie, but the last time I tested a Chromebook on a plane it couldn’t even play back 1080p. The biggest knock on Google’s Chrome OS always has been that it’s useless offline—it’s just a browser, after all, and what good is a browser without an Internet connection? Luckily, I’d been upgraded to first class (Gold Medallion FTW), so worst-case I’d stash the computer and pound bad wine for an hour. When I opened the Chromebook 13 and entered my password, the computer sprang to life. All my docs and files were there. Interstellar played beautifully on the gorgeous high-res screen. When I selected a Google Doc, it opened in a tab, and the only sign that I was offline was a small lightning bolt alongside the document’s name. Forty-five minutes later, I closed the lid and returned my tray table to its upright and locked position. I’d barely tapped the battery. The $499 Chromebook 13 is, in many ways, the Chromebook you’ve been waiting for. It falls between Google’s glorious, preposterously expensive Chromebook Pixel, and everyone else’s craptastic Chromebooks. Google and HP desperately want to prove Chromebooks can be more than cheap, student-friendly laptops. This is a Business Laptop, a Primary Device, a laptop to use as your only machine. They kind of pulled it off. The machine looks high-end: Brushed metal, monochrome logos, just one or two stupid stickers that take entirely too much effort to peel off the palmrest. It’s a half-inch thick and a bit less than three pounds, which isn’t small but doesn’t feel any bigger than a MacBook Air. The Chromebook 13 is understated and polished. It looks like an upper-middle-class Windows PC, which I suspect is exactly what HP was going for. It uses low-power versions of Intel’s latest Skylake chips, which are more than adequate for keeping up with the three dozen or so browser tabs I usually have going. (My review unit sports a Core M5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. At $819, it’s the most expensive model, and overkill. Get the cheapest one with the great screen.) Most of the processor’s effort goes toward powering the 13.3-inch screen, a gorgeous 3200×1800 panel that looks just a bit oversaturated but is as good as any laptop screen out there. It’s not a touchscreen, which you’ll hardly notice now but will almost certainly miss later. The speakers are fine, and the webcam isn’t a total horror show. The battery lasts eight to nine hours. The $499 Chromebook 13 is, in many ways, the Chromebook you’ve been waiting for. Switching to the Chromebook 13 might be easier than getting used to, say, Apple’s new MacBook. For one thing, it has ports, plural: two USB-C and one USB 3, along with a microSD slot. You can charge your computer and connect a hard drive at the same time. What a world! The keyboard, too, is so much deeper and more tactile that you’ll figure it out long before your adapt to the MacBook’s membrane mashers. The keys do bottom out harshly when you whack ’em hard, but at least you’re hitting the right keys. The trackpad is the only truly bad thing about the Chromebook 13. It’s often so rough and jumpy that I end up clicking daintily, making a face I’d probably make if I ever had to defuse a bomb, hoping I don’t accidentally delete something while trying to click “Bold.” When I do click, the trackpad crunches, like there’s a Cheerio under there. Still, the Chromebook 13 is more than enough laptop for most people, at a price most people can stomach. Chrome OS is the same deal: If you don’t think you can do everything in a browser, well, you’re probably wrong. You probably do everything in a browser already, unless your life requires Photoshop or Premiere or some other $800 software. (In that case, you could buy an iPad and a Chromebook 13 and still save money, but I digress.) I absolutely could switch to a Chromebook. I spent more than a week using this one for work, for Netflix, for everything. It could do anything I needed. What I missed, coming from the Macs I’ve used for a decade, was the fiddly stuff—the keyboard shortcuts, the crazy file system, the superpowered multitasking and window management. I hated not being able to type “ship” and have it populate my shipping address. Most of all, I missed having 1Password, but then 1Password launched a web app! Big day. Yes, switching to a Chromebook takes work, and Chrome OS feels less powerful than macOS or Windows. But almost nobody cares. Yes, switching to a Chromebook takes work, and Chrome OS feels less powerful than macOS or Windows. But almost nobody cares. Most people don’t use Alfred or Atext, or go to great lengths to master Evernote’s global keyboard shortcuts. They just want a good computer at a good price. The HP Chromebook 13 is exactly that. There are cheaper Chromebooks (the Asus Chromebook Flip is a good one), but they’re ugly and compromised. There’s a cooler Chromebook with a better trackpad, but it’s much more expensive. HP threw this one right down the middle and nailed it. If you’re looking for a new computer and have $500 to spend, this is the one to buy. For now, anyway. This is where things get sort of weird. Right now, you don’t really need a touchscreen on a Chromebook. But this fall, when Chrome OS and Android begin their conscious coupling and the Google Play store comes to Chrome OS, you’ll have literally millions of reasons to want one. (HP says the next Chromebook 13 will have one.) Over the next few months, Android apps will force Chromebook makers to reconsider absolutely everything about their devices. We’ll see new form factors, new sensors, new ideas about what a laptop even is when a laptop can run smartphone apps. If you can wait to buy a Chromebook, sit tight. If you can’t, buy this one.

Inside, it can be configured with up to Intel's new Core i7 6820HK processor, and we should feature NVIDIA's next-gen GeForce GTX 10 series GPU.     MSI's upcoming GT72VR Dominator gaming laptop stood out for me, as it will reportedly feature a 120Hz display, which MSI says is "the fastest mobile display". This excites me beyond belief, as it'll be the first gaming laptop with a super-fast 120Hz refresh rate on a gaming notebook.   There will also be a 4K IPS panel offering, with MSI promising 100% Adobe RGB. Inside, MSI will include upgraded audio technologies with sound from Dynaudio, and the GT83VR and GT73VR Titan gaming laptops featuring Nahimic 2 and Audio Boost 2 technologies.   MSI is expected to unveil their new gaming laptops in the coming weeks.

Kyiv denies these allegations.  UPDATE: The brother of Yevhen Panov, who was detained and charged by Russian authorities with preparing terror attacks in Crimea, has asked Ukrainian officials for help in securing his release. Panov, a Ukrainian citizen, is being held on the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. Yevhen Panov is a Ukrainian truck driver who previously volunteered in the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine. Moscow claims Panov worked as a Ukrainian military intelligence officer, Kyiv denies the allegations. His brother Igor Kotelyanets spoke to RFE/RL's Current Time TV. Yevhen Panov is so far the only man that Russia has officially named among the several arrested alleged ‘terrorists'. Moscow claims that Panov, born in Zaporizhia, works for Ukraine's Intelligence service, the agency which trained the so-called sabotage group and, ultimately, organized the ‘terror acts' in Crimea. Learn how the events unfolded in the alleged terrorist attack in Crimea  Russia media released images of Panov, escorted by FSB. There are bruises on his face. According to the Kremlin, Panov has been interrogated and ‘is making a confession". Ukraine, in turn, categorically denies that Panov is a member of the Intel service. Igor Kotelianets says he is the brother of the arrested man. He has a different version of what has happened. Read also: An August Surprise from Russia? ‘I still cannot believe that this is real. My brother has been kidnapped. There is no other way for him to end up in Crimea' Kotelianets posted on Facebook. After Russian aggression started, Panov joined the ranks of the army. Upon his return from the conflict zone, he became a technician at the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhia while being a volunteer and helping the servicemen. "He would never go to Crimea. Yevhen always said that Crimea was gone and he was indifferent towards this fact", Kotelianets says in an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Censor.net.ua Read also: Putin raises stakes over alleged Ukrainian terror plot in Crimea - Guardian Kotelianets tells in an interview with Ukrainian media outlets, prior to the incident his brother was going to spend his time with friends and come back home Monday, but he never did.

Microsoft Surface Book 2 Could Launch with Redesigned Hinge, Kaby Lake CPUs GO New info emerges on 2nd-generation ultimate laptop Aug 11, 2016 05:16 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is expected to launch the new Surface Book 2 laptop in the fall of this year, and since we’re getting closer to the rumored unveiling date, more information arrives to provide us with a glimpse into what the new device could bring to the market. First and foremost, it’s worth noting from the very beginning that the Surface Book 2 won’t be a massive redesign of the first generation, but will come with upgraded hardware and small refinements here and there, including the hinge. One of the most plausible rumors concerns the upcoming line of CPUs, with WindowsCentral claiming that Microsoft is pondering launching the Surface Book 2 with the Kaby Lake lineup of processors. Intel’s new chips are not yet available but are expected to see daylight later this year, so Microsoft might be trying to align the release of its second-generation laptop with the one of Kaby Lake. If this is true, the laptop could benefit from a wide range of improvements allowed by the CPU, including 3D and 4K graphics, as well as USB 3.1 support - this is very likely to be offered, especially given that Microsoft is building the Surface Book to offer as many connectivity options as possible. Redesigned hinge In terms of design, the Surface Book 2 will come with only small improvements over its predecessor, but it turns out that one of these improvements concerns the hinge. Although it was introduced with much fanfare by Microsoft at the October 2015 hardware event, the hinge has become a rather controversial feature, with many people criticizing this design choice and claiming not only that it’s ugly but also that it allows dust to easily slip in between the keyboard and the display. While these claims are more or less well founded, it appears that Microsoft wants to deal with the problem once and for all, so the Surface Book 2 will introduce a redesigned hinge that eliminates the gap between the screen and the keyboard when the laptop is closed. It remains to be seen how much of these rumors is true, but at first glance, all these upgrades really make sense, given the fact that Microsoft wants to improve its products based on customer feedback. #Microsoft#Surface#Surface Book#Surface Book 2#Microsoft Surface subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Band 2 Now Super Cheap in the US As Third Generation Debut Nears Microsoft Launches Panorama Feature for Windows 10 Mobile Phones Microsoft Releases BSOD Fix for Windows 10 Anniversary Update Builds on Surface Microsoft Announces FY16 Q4 Results, Reveals Strong Windows Performance Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    The Surface Book and its controversial hinge New Apps Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Seymour: Browse through, edit, convert and arrange your photo collection in categories based on the author with this user-friendly application Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Dopamine Portable: Seamlessly organize your music collection and find your favorite tracks based on title, artists, genres, albums or playlists with this software solution Dopamine: Keep your music collection neatly organized based on albums, genre, playlists or tracks so you easily find tracks using this music player Vectorworks: Designed for professionals, this application enables you to create architectural designs, landscapes, theatrical productions and more Portable PhotoLine: A simple to use application bundled with photo editing functions that allows you to enhance, distort, as well as paint over an opened picture Reader comments Load old comments   US President-Elect Donald Trump Can’t End Russia’s War Against American Software more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Having found an unlikely ally in the Guinness Book of World Records during the company's early days, Tuli believes the best of Internet is yet to come. It was in the winter of 2012 that I first met Suneet Singh Tuli, the Founder and CEO of a little known Canadian firm called DataWind. The company had shot to fame when it won a Government of India tender for low cost educational tablet, Aakash. Tuli tells me that in 2010 when he first heard about the Indian government expressing interest to develop a low-cost tablet, mainly for educational purposes, he immediately wrote an op-ed piece in a newspaper saying it was not possible. "I was very skeptical and did not believe the idea was plausible," says. But, by the end of January 2011, Tuli was one of the many technology provider CEOs who put ink on the tender to build the tablet for a then unheard-of $35. Providential changes So, how did his idea change? According to Tuli, the coming of Android as an operating system, which is an open source platform, opened the door a bit. It was cracked open further by Google, when instead of going with the giant that is Intel, Google opted for Nvidia or Qualcomm for its microprocessors. "Going with the latter, Google ended up creating unprecedented competition in the microprocessor industry and the pricing collapsed," explains Tuli. Also, Tuli realized that Android had a monetization engine attached to it, so one could make money on content applications and services and not just on the hardware. This allowed him to pull out a more aggressive price. Tuli bid for the Aakash tablet at a market price of $49.98, on which he won the tender. The next lowest bid was at $65. Earlier inventions Tuli graduated from the University of Toronto in 1990 and is a colorful man. An engineer, in the days when there were no Internet, he noticed a problem when large blueprints/drawings needed to be cut in pieces to be sent through regular fax machines. Tuli's company DataWind came out with the large-format fax machines for engineers and architects in 1992. At $40,000 for a pair of fax machines, Tuli found no takers for his product and came up with a brilliant marketing ploy. He approached the Guinness Book of World Records and soon held the record for the world's largest fax machine. "That gimmick created so much publicity that sales for my product did very well from then on," says Tuli. Such was the result that by 1995, three years after it started up, Tuli went public with his startup on the NASDAQ. Years later, at his dentist's, Tuli stumbled on an interesting article in a magazine. Wanting to take it home, Tuli was caught tearing the page off the magazine when the dentist walked in! He decided to come up with a battery-operated pocket scanner, which could be used as a mobile office peripheral. Naysayers were quick to point out that companies like HP will crush him. Again, no sales happened and again Tuli took the familiar route of approaching the Guinness personnel. Today, he holds the record for the world's thinnest scanner. It's been around two decades since Tuli created the record, but there is still no Chinese competitor to the product. Rallying on For a DataWind, a project like Aakash had huge implications. For all the controversies around the company and Aakash (which the company called Ubislate), became a household name. For every reason why the Aakash tablet may not work, there was a very strong case why it would. "Our aim for many years has been to prove that affordable technology can impact education," says Tuli. An RTI query shows the Aakash tablet project was official shelved in 2015, but Tuli is firm on his quest to bridge the digital divide. "In places like the UK, the unconnected are the elderly, also known as silver surfers. In India it's a very different segment and it is the masses," says Tuli. My Big Plunge feat. Datawind The biggest problem for Tuli has been in terms of inventory and meeting demand. Industry analysis in 2011 had predicted that between 2.5-5 lakh units of tablet would be sold every year, but Aakash had propelled it to two million individual end-user pre-bookings and four million corporate/institutional/bulk orders in the year 2012. At six million orders, that was 20X analyst estimates of the Indian tablet market and 50 % of the Indian PC market. At one point Tuli needed around Rs 500 crore in inventory financing alone. According to the unaudited financial results for nine month periods ended December 31, 2015 the Company reported revenue of 41,913 Canadian Dollar as compared to revenue of 20,718 Canadian Dollar for the same period ended December 31, 2014. The net loss for the company has also halved to about 3,702 Canadian Dollar for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a net loss of 6,922 Canadian Dollar for the same period ended December 31, 2014. The fourth quarter of FY 2016 has been particularly good for DataWind as it sold over 300,000 units in the emerging market countries. The momentum continues as it sold 34.2% of all tablets in India during the first quarter of 2016, ahead of second-place Samsung, which sold 20.9% of all tablets says a recent CMR report. IDC is its report also states DataWind rules the tablet market, followed by Samsung in second place and Lenovo in third place. What works for Tuli is the cheap price of the tablets. At times, a dinner for two costs more than the price of the tablet. DataWind is particularly strong in the sub Rs. 5000 tablet segment where CMR says it holds a remarkable 74.4% market share. Incidentally, this is also the fastest growing segment having increased to 46% of the overall tablet market in India. It has as many as five products in the Rs. 5000 and below range. DataWind is also riding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of "Make in India." The company has rolled out half a million Internet-enabled tablets and smartphones from its production facility that was opened in July 2015 in Amritsar. "I think the best of the Internet is yet to come and I think if you can be part of the revolution that creates access you will create lots of opportunities," says Tuli.

Make programs 5x faster - the easy way Download OpenCL - 666.4 KB Download demo - 49.1 KB Introduction This project is going to show you that a modern Core I7 is probably the slowest piece of programmable hardware you have in your PC. Modern Quad Core CPUs have about 6 Gflops whereas modern GPUs have about 6Tflops of computational power. This project can dynamically execute simple programs written in a C dialect (OpenCL C) on your GPU, CPU or both. They are compiled and executed at run time. This is also going to show that GPU programming does not have to be hard. In fact, you only need a little bit of basic programming skills for this project. If you want to skip the introduction and dive into using this, feel free to download the source code. Do I Need This? Your computer is a very powerful machine. By using only the CPU to execute tasks, you might waste about 90% of its potential. If you have a piece of code which is concurrent and you want to speed it up, this is the right project for you. Ideally, all your data fits into some float or other numeric arrays. Examples for a potential speed up would be: Work on pictures or movies Any work that can be done parallel Do hard number crunching on your GPU Save energy and time by using GPU and CPU in parallel Use your GPU for any task and have your CPU free to do something else Keep in mind that this project uses OpenCL. Unlike Cuda, it runs on any GPU (Amd, Nvidia, Intel) and also on the CPU. So any program you write can be used on any device. (Even phones) These are the results for simple prime calculation: As you can see, you really can speed up your program a LOT. Native C# is 5x slower than the best speed you can get on your PC. This is not even the best case scenario. The speedup factor can approach 500x in pure multiply add workloads. (GPUs really shine in this domain). If there are many ifs, the CPU can be better sometimes. Most importantly, it is really easy to write a program for your GPU and CPU with this class. How Do I Use It? OpenCL programming can be a very time consuming task. This helper project will reduce your programming overhead so that you can concentrate on the core problem. It is written in C# but could be adapted to any .NET language and also C++. Imagine you wanted to know all prime numbers from 2 to 10^8. Here is a simple implementation in C# (yes, I know there are much better algorithms to calculate primes). static void IsPrimeNet(int[] message)
{
    Parallel.ForEach(message, (number, state, index) =>
    {
        int upperlimit = (int)Math.Sqrt(number);
        for(int i=2;i<=upperlimit;i++)
        {
            if (message[index]%i == 0)  //no lock needed. every index is independent
            {
                message[index] = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    });
} Now we take this code and translate it to OpenCL-C. The following Kernel is declared as a string in a file, inline or in a resource file. kernel void GetIfPrime(global int* message)
{
    int index = get_global_id(0);

    int upperl=(int)sqrt((float)message[index]);
    for(int i=2;i<=upperl;i++)
    {
        if(message[index]%i==0)
        {
            //printf("" %d / %d\n"",index,i );
            message[index]=0;
            return;
        }
    }
    //printf("" % d"",index);
} OpenCL does wrap your kernel (piece of code to run) in a loop. For simple 1D Arrays, you can get the index by calling get_global_id(0); The upper index of your index is passed when you invoke the kernel. For more information, check out this link. Instead of int[], you write int* and so on. You can also pass every other primitive type (int, float...). You have to pass arguments in the same order in which you declared them. You can also call printf inside your kernel to debug later. You can define as many methods as you like inside the kernel. You pick the entry point later by calling Invoke("Name Here"). OpenCL C is the same as C but you cannot use pointers and you also have some special data types. For in depth information, check out this link. Here is how you would use this project: Add the Nuget Package Cloo Add reference to OpenCLlib.dll. Download OpenCLLib.zip. Add using OpenCL static void Main(string[] args)
{

    int[] Primes = Enumerable.Range(2, 1000000).ToArray();
    EasyCL cl = new EasyCL();
    cl.Accelerator = Accelerator.Gpu;        //You can also set the accelerator after loading the kernel
    cl.LoadKernel(IsPrime);                  //Load kernel string here, (Compiles in the background)
    cl.Invoke("GetIfPrime", Primes.Length, Primes); //Call Function By Name With Parameters
    //Primes now contains all Prime Numbers
}

static string IsPrime
{
    get
    {
        return @"
        kernel void GetIfPrime(global int* message)
        {
            int index = get_global_id(0);

            int upperl=(int)sqrt((float)message[index]);
            for(int i=2;i<=upperl;i++)
            {
                if(message[index]%i==0)
                {
                    //printf("" %d / %d\n"",index,i );
                    message[index]=0;
                    return;
                }
            }
            //printf("" % d"",index);
        }";
    }
} With this, you can dynamically compile and invoke OpenCL kernels. You can also change your accelerator (CPU, GPU) after you have loaded the kernel. If you want to use every bit of computational power of your PC, you can use the class MultiCL. This class works by splitting your work into N parts. Every part is pushed onto the GPU or CPU whenever possible. This way, you get the maximum performance from your PC. You also know how much work is already done which is not possible with EasyCL. static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int[] Primes = Enumerable.Range(2, 1000000).ToArray();
    int N = 200;
    MultiCL cl = new MultiCL();
    cl.ProgressChangedEvent += Cl_ProgressChangedEvent1;
    cl.SetKernel(IsPrime, "GetIfPrime");
    cl.SetParameter(Primes);
    cl.Invoke(0, Primes.Length, N);
}

private static void Cl_ProgressChangedEvent1(object sender, double e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.ToString("0.00%"));
} How Does It Work? This work references the Nuget package Cloo. With Cloo, calls to OpenCL are possible from .NET. It basically hides all the implementation details you need to know to use OpenCL and Cloo. To get more information about your kernel or device, use the class OpenCL. There are 3 classes in this project: EasyCL (Call Kernels very easily) MultiCL (Call Kernels on GPU and CPU at the same time) OpenCL (Call Kernels and get some information about your device) Internally, every call to Invoke calls the corresponding methods in the OpenCL API: void Setargument(ComputeKernel kernel, int index, object arg)
{
    if (arg == null) throw new ArgumentException("Argument " + index + " is null");
    Type argtype = arg.GetType();

    if (argtype.IsArray)
    {
        Type elementtype = argtype.GetElementType();

        //ComputeBuffer<int> messageBuffer = new ComputeBuffer<int>(context,
        //ComputeMemoryFlags.ReadOnly | ComputeMemoryFlags.UseHostPointer, (int[])arg);

        ComputeMemory messageBuffer = (ComputeMemory)Activator.CreateInstance
                                      (typeof(ComputeBuffer<int>), new object[]
        {
            context,
            ComputeMemoryFlags.ReadWrite | ComputeMemoryFlags.UseHostPointer,
            arg
        });
        kernel.SetMemoryArgument(index, messageBuffer); // set the array
    }
    else
    {
        //kernel.SetValueArgument(index, (int)arg); // set the array size
        typeof(ComputeKernel).GetMethod("SetValueArgument").MakeGenericMethod(argtype).Invoke
                      (kernel, new object[] { index, arg });
    }
} Every time you change the kernel or the accelerator, the program gets recompiled: For a faster prototyping phase, this class also tells you why you cannot compile your kernel. public void LoadKernel(string Kernel)
{
    this.kernel = Kernel;
    program = new ComputeProgram(context, Kernel);

    try
    {
        program.Build(null, null, null, IntPtr.Zero);   //compile
    }
    catch (BuildProgramFailureComputeException)
    {
        string message = program.GetBuildLog(platform.Devices[0]);
        throw new ArgumentException(message);
    }
} It is very important to know that if your GPU driver crashes or kernels use 100% of your GPU for more than 3 seconds (on pre Win10 machines), the kernel will get aborted. You should dispose the EasyCL object after that. //If windows Vista,7,8,8.1 you better be ready to catch:

EasyCL cl = new EasyCL();
cl.InvokeAborted += (sender,e)=> Cl_InvokeAborted(cl,e);

private void Cl_InvokeAborted(EasyCL sender, string e)
{
     //your logic here
} For some reason, I don't know it is faster to invoke an empty kernel first and then all subsequent calls are faster. (OpenCL initialization maybe). What is Missing? In the current form, this class cannot use multiple GPUs. (If requested, I will implement it.) You cannot choose if you want to use the host pointer or read write access to int[] passed to the kernel. I did not see any performance gain by setting an array to read only. This class is written for PCs. With Visual Studio/Xamarin, it should be easy to adapt it for phones. (Modern Smartphones with 8 Cores do rival most Laptops in performance.) How Can I Help?

Re: Interesting results filipxsikora13-Aug-16 6:37 filipxsikora 13-Aug-16 6:37  It's too much, my graphics card runs out of memory. But I've programmed some functions which do some easy calculations: static string MMulSingle
{
    get
    {
        return @"
        kernel void MMulSingle(global const float* arr1, global const float* arr2, global float* arr3) 
        {
            int index = get_global_id(0);
                    
            arr3[index] = (float)sqrt(pow(arr1[index], 2.0f) * pow(arr2[index], 2.0f));
        }";
    }
}
 
static string MMulDouble
{
    get
    {
        return @"
        kernel void MMulDouble(global const double* arr1, global const double* arr2, global double* arr3) 
        {
            int index = get_global_id(0);
                    
            arr3[index] = sqrt(pow(arr1[index], 2.0) * pow(arr2[index], 2.0));
        }";
    }
}
 
static void MMulNetSingle(float[] arr1, float[] arr2, float[] arr3)
{
    int size = arr1.Length;
 
    Parallel.For(0, size, (index) =>
    {
        arr3[index] = (float)Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(arr1[index], 2) * Math.Pow(arr2[index], 2));
    });
}
 
static void MMulNetDouble(double[] arr1, double[] arr2, double[] arr3)

        arr3[index] = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(arr1[index], 2) * Math.Pow(arr2[index], 2));
    });

Infuehr 13-Aug-16 7:30  It really is very interesting that C# with float does perform 7x worse that OpenCL. Combined with the GPU you can get 10x the performance and C# is not that slow to begin with. I think the wrong performance before has to do with the kernel. Maybe the Compiler does something strange on OpenCL since the result of MAD_1024 is not used anywhere in the original project. Thx for sharing.

You will need to update the CreateContext functions which cause these exceptions: void CreateContext()
{
    if (_device == Accelerator.Gpu)
    {
        platform = ComputePlatform.Platforms[0];
        context = new ComputeContext((ComputeDeviceTypes)(_device), new ComputeContextPropertyList(platform), null, IntPtr.Zero);
    }
    else if (_device == Accelerator.Cpu)

        platform = ComputePlatform.Platforms[1];

    }
    queue = new ComputeCommandQueue(context, context.Devices[0], ComputeCommandQueueFlags.None);
}
 Make sure your platforms indexes match with my indexes with debugger (check if your GPU is at index 0 and your CPU is at index 1, if not adjust indexes appropriately).

(1) Although I've done the same, watch those hardwired values in your code, e.g., "// pick first platform ComputePlatform platform = ComputePlatform.Platforms[0];", or "string message = program.GetBuildLog(platform.Devices[0]);". (2) The C# Parallel.ForEach can be simplified, from data parallel into task parallel, boosting the performance of the step significantly, something like this: static void IsPrimeNet(int[] message)
{
    int size = message.Length;
    Parallel.For(0, size, (index) =
    {
        int number = index + 2;
        int upperlimit = (int)Math.Sqrt(number);
        for(int i=2; <= upperlimit; i++)
        {
            if (message[index]%i == 0)  //no lock needed. every index is independent
            {
                message[index] = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    });
}
 (3) Instead of Cloo, I would recommend something like Cudafy for C#, which dynamically translates C# code into CUDA/C++ source, compiles, and then runs. I wrote a similar tool called Campy.Net, which uses a different API altogether, more like C++ AMP and C# lambdas but it's still a toy and I have not worked on it for a long time. Re: Good work D. Infuehr11-Aug-16 13:14 D. Infuehr 11-Aug-16 13:14  Thank you for your feedback. I used AMP quite a lot too. Since I wanted to use it in a higher level language i went with OpenCL. I am not sure if Cuda works on AMD too. I really wanted to see this work everywhere. Since you seem to know this stuff can you tell me why some other people get these exceptions? use of type 'double'requires cl_khr_fp64 extension to be enabled even though they are? Re: Good work Ken Domino12-Aug-16 10:57 Ken Domino 12-Aug-16 10:57  You are probably right, CUDA won't work on AMD GPUs--although there is some talk that it might someday (e.g., Nvidia's CUDA Language Can Now Run On AMD, Intel GPUs - TechFrag). In OpenCL 1.2, double is optional, so the cl_khr_fp64 is required--when using double. However, I'm not sure why the compiler is thinking the sqrt() call is double as you cast to float. Feels like a bug. It might be worthwhile for others to try compiling the kernel using clcc. For me, the kernel compiles fine for the Intel GPU as well as the NVIDIA GPU. However, if I change the code to use doubles, then it doesn't compile for the Intel GPU, but it does compile for the NVIDIA GPU. kernel void GetIfPrime(global int* message) 
{
    int index = get_global_id(0);
    int m = message[index];
    double t = m;
    double u = sqrt(t);
    int ul = (int)floor(u);
    int upperl = ul;
    for(int i=2;i<=upperl;i++)
    {
        if(message[index]%i==0)
        {
            message[index]=0;
            return;
        }
    }

HP’s Spectre, which the company is touting as the world’s thinnest, is one such example. With its high-quality hardware and refined design, the $999.99 Spectre seriously raises the bar for ultra-thin laptops. Still, there are some important considerations to make before picking one up. Here’s a closer look at what it was like to use the HP Spectre. How it Looks and Feels The HP Spectre looks unlike most other laptops out there. Made of aluminum and carbon fiber, the notebook has a sleek black appearance accented with a shiny gold hinge. HP clearly paid attention to the details here: the keys feature a gold trim to match the notebook’s glossy hinge. Meanwhile, the speakers, located to the left and right of the keyboard, look as if they’ve been etched into the keyboard deck. The gold hinge, however, does have the unfortunate tendency to collect fingerprint smudges. At roughly 0.41 inches thin and 2.45 pounds, the Spectre is supremely slim and light. Apple’s MacBook Air, by comparison, is 0.11 inches thin at its slimmest point but 0.68 inches at its thickest, while Dell’s XPS 13 is between 0.3 and 0.6 inches thin. The Spectre has a 1,920×1,080 resolution 13.3-inch screen, which is sharper than that of the MacBook Air but not as dazzling as those offered on some other ultrabooks. Still, for most people, it’ll be more than adequate for watching Netflix or browsing photos. Using It Keyboard quality is arguably one of the most important characteristics of a laptop. A poor keyboard can make it difficult or just plain frustrating to interact with your computer. Thankfully, the Spectre’s keyboard is among the best I’ve used on a laptop. The key travel is deep, providing rich feedback and making it comfortable to type at a quick pace. It’s exactly what should be expected of a premium notebook. The touchpad, however, could use some improvement. I found it to be sluggish and laggy at times, and I had to tweak a few settings to get an enjoyable experience. If you’re seeking a laptop primarily for work and entertainment, the Spectre should be plenty fast. It runs on Intel’s latest processors, and buyers have the option of choosing between a Core i5 or Core i7. I’ve been using the $1,099 Core i7 variant for a mix of web browsing, casual gaming, light photo editing, and streaming Netflix, and I haven’t come across any stutters or hiccups. However, the Spectre’s fans get noisy fairly often, which can be distracting. Those who typically watch TV shows or blast tunes from their laptop will likely be pleased with the Spectre’s Bang & Olufsen speakers, which offer rich and powerful audio. But the productivity-minded should keep in mind that the Spectre offers only three USB Type-C ports, plus a headphone jack. USB Type-C is certainly the future, but for now you’ll need adapters to connect the Spectre to most equipment — like external monitors. I didn’t get great battery life out of the Spectre, but I believe my testing circumstances were part of the problem. The notebook’s battery depleted after about four hours of use, which is unusually low. That said, the Wi-Fi signal in my office kept dropping in and out over the course of writing this review, and the battery may have been drained while the laptop was searching for a signal. It’s probably safe to expect around six hours of battery life out of the Spectre under normal circumstances. Conclusion With its latest Spectre, HP has proven that there is a way to improve laptop design without compromising the computing experience. The HP Spectre is a marvelously slim, attractive machine that tackles all of the basics, offering a sturdy keyboard and fast performance. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider other options. If you don’t need a Core i7 processor and don’t mind something slightly thicker, the Dell XPS 13 is definitely worth a look, especially since it’s about $100 cheaper than HP’s notebook and provides a similar experience. Chromebooks, meanwhile, are increasingly compelling options for the budget-minded. But in general, the Spectre is priced fairly considering most ultrabooks cost around $1,000. All told, HP’s Spectre is a top contender among today’s Windows 10 laptops. 4 out of 5 stars Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Microsoft controversially announced back in January that anyone still running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on a Skylake-based PC after July 17, 2017, would receive only “the most critical” security fixes – and these would only be released if they didn’t "risk the reliability or compatibility" of Windows 7 and 8.1 on other (non-Skylake) systems." In March, Microsoft pushed this date back a year to July 17, 2018, which still meant support would end earlier than for systems powered by its older Broadwell processors. But today, the company is pushing the date back again to bring it in line with the support lifetime of Broadwell. January 14, 2020 is now the last day for Windows 7, and Windows 8.1 will be supported until January 14, 2023. This also applies to Windows Embedded 7, 8, and 8.1 devices. “Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows. At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy,” wrote Microsoft director of Windows business planning, Shad Larsen, in a blog post. The post also mentions that future Intel chips Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge will only be supported on Windows 10. Microsoft says the change is “to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10.” Related Reads Touch-based Office preview now available for Windows 10 This Microsoft tool tries to guess your age and gender based on a photo Microsoft releases browser-based Skype Meetings for small businesses 12 comments 189 interactions Share this article: Video Highlight Now Read This… Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation Win 10 Creators Update bringing smaller update downloads Microsoft stops sales of Windows 7 and 8.1 OEM licenses Popular 8 comments The Best Mice: Overall + Gaming, Wireless, Travel & More 10 comments The Best Video Game Gamepad Controllers Load Comments 12 ...

The report forecasts the global cloud security market in retail sector to grow at a CAGR of 20.91% during the period 2016-2020. Increasing mobile workforce will be a key trend for market growth. The mobile workforce in the US was 96 million in 2015, and it will reach 105 million by the end of 2020. Developing regions have been witnessing a change in the working culture of organizations. With constantly changing business scenarios, organizations are required to develop a mobile workforce in order to stay competitive. The demand for flexible IT services is increasing, which can be met by cloud solutions. In addition, changes in work locations, time zone barriers, and the need to access official and confidential data using employees' personal devices is resulting in an increased demand for cloud services. In order to address these changes, IT service providers are providing tailor-made cloud services for smartphones and tablets. This trend will strengthen in the future, thereby pushing the market growth. According to the report, increase in phishing and malware attacks in retail sector will be a key driver for market growth. Approximately 63% of the data breaches in 2015 were due to default, stolen, or weak passwords. A major reason for the adoption of cloud security is the increase in cloud-specific attacks such as crimeware, cyber-espionage, and DoS. The growing use of cloud-based services has led to the increase in cloud security attacks, which results in data theft and identity theft. Further, the report states that inconsistent network performance will be a challenge for the market. One of the major requirements for the efficient performance of cloud security solutions is a strong and robust network connection. However, developing regions and some parts of developed regions are still plagued with slow and unstable network connections. The lack of proper network connections will expose cloud services and applications to cyber-attacks. Slow network connections also lead to time lags or latency issues. This makes it difficult to identify and provide access to authorized users and affects the reliability of cloud security solutions, thereby hindering their adoption.

While many IoT projects are more hype than reality, Davra Networks has woked with Cisco to create an end-to-end IoT platform that was first rolled out in Huntsville, Texas. The platform includes IoT gateways placed on buses to add a layer of video and passenger-counting technology to ensure the safety and security of students. The gateways also gather data to help school districts reduce carbon emissions by measuring the fuel efficiency of buses. ‘The business grew quickly from Texas to Oklahoma and New York and we are talking with school districts in Florida and elsewhere to deploy the technology’ – PAUL GLYNN, DAVRA It has since been deployed in Oklahoma and is going into school bus fleets in New York in Q4 of 2016. Talks are ongoing with schools in Tennessee and Florida. Keeping the IoT revolution rolling Paul Glynn, CEO, Davra Networks It is just one facet of the kind of work that Davra does. The a 24-strong company is based in Dublin’s IFSC, where most of its R&D and product development takes place. Davra is also working on other public-facing IoT projects, including tram networks in San Diego and rail networks in Canada. “Our focus is on transport and smart cities,” explained Paul Glynn, CEO of Davra. According to Glynn, Davra is a spin-out from Crannog Software, itself a spin-out from Lan Communications, which was bought by Eir in 1999. Crannog was bought by Fluke Networks in 2007. “Our initial plan with Davra, which we set up in 2011, was to focus on networking. We were doing internet of things before anyone called it internet of things,” said Glynn. “I sometimes compare internet of things to e-commerce, it isn’t an industry in itself, it is just a new way of using technology by old industries. People get caught up in this concept of the internet of things being this whole new industry that is going to take over the world. It is just existing industries using technology in different ways.” In recent weeks, Davra won the Best Overall Platform award at the IoT Evolution Battle of the Platforms competition, where it competed in categories including transport, smart cities and manufacturing. The platform was recognised for its superiority in real-time monitoring, tracking and data management. Real-time, reliable data is key to machine age The Davra Networks RuBan real-time data dashboard The secret sauce of Davra is its RuBan platform, which helps system integrators gather relevant information from vehicles and present the data in a real-time dashboard. This data helps companies increase employee productivity, passenger safety, reduce fuel costs, optimise driving routes and perform vehicle tracking. When we spoke to Glynn last week he was in San Francisco meeting potential venture capital investors who will bring Davra to its next stage, which, as well as product development, includes expanding its presence in the US, Europe and the Middle East. “We see a huge opportunity to manage the data that comes from the edge of the network. People think IoT is just gleaning data from sensors, but the reality is that is extremely difficult and expensive to do. However, our software managed the quality and the quantity of the data that is coming back and this is critical for real-time local decision-making.” The key to Davra’s strategy to winning the vital IoT landscape in the US is partnerships and the company works closely with Cisco and Intel on key projects. “We don’t believe there will be a single Google of IoT, that one single platform will manage sensors across multiple industries. We tend to focus on specific niches like transport, smart cities and manufacturing. For example, our partner in the manufacturing space is industrial technology giant Rockwell. And we have partners who are dedicated to healthcare.” Glynn said that because of the siloed nature of IoT deployments, companies are struggling to get real value out of their IoT investments. “What we bring to the table is a platform that lets you get any data from within a vehicle. If a driver hits the brakes we automatically tag the video to see what was happening in the cab or among the students in the bus. If a driver leaves a geofenced area for any reason our system knows it and raises the alarm. This is vital for, obviously, safety but also insurance purposes.” Davra’s entry into the US school transportation market – there are more than 500,000 yellow buses in North America by Glynn’s reckoning – was unplanned. “It began as a project to deliver Wi-Fi to the buses because many kids in Texas and Oklahoma live in rural areas and spend hours on the buses. But because Cisco routers and gateways also come with GPS chips, there was the opportunity to add in layers of functionality that would boost safety. “The business grew quickly from Texas to Oklahoma and New York and we are talking with school districts in Florida and elsewhere to deploy the technology.” Glynn said that all of Davra’s technology is designed and built in Dublin. “The purpose of our investment round will be to build out the team and expand in the US and other markets. We are taking a different approach to most Irish tech companies by going directly to Silicon Valley venture capital firms because they have a different mindset to European investors. “Investors in Silicon Valley are quite jaded with most IoT plays because some of them are novel rather than realistic. But they like what we are doing because we have real customers with real problems to solve.” American school bus image via Shutterstock Related: US, The Interview, smart cities, internet of things, funding and investment, transport Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Start-ups Meet the 5 start-ups smartening up Dublin’s booming cycle scene 23 Sep 2016172 Shares Hiring Now Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Help develop the future of sales and trading Be part of a globally successful team Working at the leading edge of IoT Innovation Dublin gears up for five smart solutions to cycle problems 16 Sep 2016212 Shares Comms The cable guy: David C McCourt on Ireland’s broadband future 3 Aug 2016101 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Slideshow 14 Views from the Flash Summit Rick Merritt 8/12/2016 08:00 AM EDT 11 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- New persistent memories and techniques promise to reshape computing. At the Flash Memory Summit here, engineers talked about how they are driving shifts in everything from server design and network storage to machine learning and flash chip prices. One of the hot topics of the event was closing the gap between flash storage arrays on the network and solid-state drives (SSDs) on the server. The idea that systems could access flash memory whether it is local or on the other side of the data center is driving new system, silicon and software designs. Fueling the trend, the NVM Express group just released a specification to enable the NVMe flash interface to run over networks such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and Infiniband. The so-called NVMe over fabrics spec supports various schemes for direct memory access. The upcoming PCI Express Gen 4 standard also is driving the move, in part because PCIe already forms the plumbing for NVMe.  The Gen 4 speeds will blow away older SAS and SATA interfaces on solid-state drives. Ultimately PCIe is expected to dominate SSDs and become relatively low cost. There’s plenty of work to be done, noted Stefanie Woodbury, director of advanced architecture at Micron and design lead for the company’s 3D XPoint-based SSDs. Interoperability will be critical given three fabrics, multiple direct-memory schemes and various block, file and streaming storage semantics –as well as emerging memory types such as 3D XPoint, she said. Micron's Woodbury showed a prototype 3D XPoint SSD. (Images: EE Times) “I was at Seagate when we introduced the first Fibre Channel drives so this sounds familiar,” Woodbury said. The trend is opening an opportunity for a whole new class of flash controller designs, said Tim Canepa, a chief controller architect at Seagate who previously worked at SandForce. Engineers can’t create effective products by patching together SSD and a fabric controllers. Ground up designs are needed, Canepa said, noting the controller space has a healthy crop of several stealth startups – some of them attracted by the need for chips for emerging memory types such as the Intel/Micron 3D XPoint. Other chip and system startups showed their wares at the event. Kalray demoed its processor with 288 custom VLIW cores running NVMe over Ethernet based on version 2.0 of the RoCE direct-memory access approach. Mellanox and Chelsio are among other chip makers hoping to offload such jobs from host processors. At the systems level, Mangstor showed its dual-socket servers integrated with flash and Mellanox network cards. But the company claims its software for NVMe over fabrics, which was out ahead of the SNIA spec, is its secret sauce. The competition is stiff. E8 Storage won an award at the show for its flash array which delivered a whopping 10 million I/O operations/second (IOPS) while supporting 100us reads and 50us writes over NVMe.

In July they were still saying that it ships this year but at IDC it seems that they only mentioned cloud access this year to XPoint, guess they might be counting that as shipping. In 2015 Micron was talking XPoint gen 2 ramping at the end of 2016 and "emerging memory gen 1" in late 2017. Maybe Intel has the controller ready sooner so they'll take all the output next year and ship a little in consumer while qualification in server takes a bit longer? Would explain the gap between what Micron has been saying and Intel's claims. When Intel talks about shipping, they don't mention volumes and it wouldn't be unusual if the ramp is 1 year after they start shipping.

It seems I may not have been very clear on some of the key points I attempted to make. You probably know that I'm very aware of Intel's FPGA direction. So your point that one could build an arch POC to implement the Data Coprocessor is correct. The key points I was trying to make are the following: 1. The PCI(e) IO architecture is over 20 years old. Admittedly a lof ot enhancements have been made in the 20 years to increase BW, reduce latency and to reduce somewhat processing overhead. However it has been designed for traditional IO such as network adapters and storage controllers with embedded DMA channels and some local data handling facilities. 2. In the main time server memory capacity has been increasing due to the advancements of DRAM density. Most of the memory capacity today is used to store data (hence the In Memory Processing trend). SCM will exasperate it further if the SCM density projections are correct.  3. The argument I was trying to make is to 'right size" the main memory for OS/HV/App/Temp, Heap etc storage and create a new low latency attach point for SCM to the CPU but not through the memory channels and controlled by the CPU's memory controller, rather an evolved version of DCP, where DCP would become the SCM's memory controller. Both the performance demand of the applications and the access models warrant to create this new peer level function for SCM. IMHO it is time to think about server architectures beyond what the PC/AT defined long time ago.  Regards   Balint Fleischer Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: NVMe over Fabrics Error rick merritt   8/13/2016 1:09:02 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Fixed, thx!

Chandler: Meet your City Council candidates Chris Coppola , The Republic | azcentral.com 8:45 a.m. MST August 16, 2016 Chandler’s next city election is scheduled for August 2016, when three City Council seats will be up for grabs. Any seats that are not won outright in August would result in a runoff election in November. (Photo: The Republic) Eight candidates are vying for three open seats on the Chandler City Council in the Aug. 30 primary election. Two seats are guaranteed to be filled with council newcomers as current members Jack Sellers and Rick Heumann will reach their term limits in early January. New members will be seated soon after. If there are not enough candidates who win seats outright in the primary — by obtaining more than 50 percent of votes cast —  a runoff election will be held Nov. 8. The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com asked Chandler candidates several questions. Below are excerpts from their responses. To see all questions and complete responses, along with detailed biographical information, visit votersguide.azcentral.com. Information on candidates in all local, county and state races is available on the Web page. THEVOTERGUIDE My Ballot - #azvotes: azcentral politics' 2016 Voters Guide Matt Eberle Website:http://matteberle.com Facebook: Matt Eberle for Chandler City Council What makes you the best person for the job? I have over 20 years of proven financial leadership within Fortune 500 and publicly-traded companies, holding roles including treasurer of the parent company of a Nasdaq company, director of finance with a Fortune 100 and controller. In addition, I have mergers and acquisitions experience, having been a part of multi-billion dollar mergers with large household-named companies. ... Policy decisions that promote lifestyle, safety, and growth can be complicated, and require collaboration, tenacity and patience. I am accessible and open to ideas, understanding that there are more great ideas in a group and as an individual. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? 1. Set aside reserve for the future. 2. Pay down existing debt. 3. Give the taxpayers back their hard-earned money. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I would change anything that threatens our way of living. We can always look for opportunities in entertainment and lifestyle, and we see the beginning of our downtown being developed to a new level. Over the next few years we will continue to see a transformation downtown as well as in other parts of the city. Nora Ellen Nora Ellen  (Photo: Special for The Republic) Website:  ElectNoraEllen.com Facebook: Nora Ellen What makes you the best person for the job? As the only incumbent in this race I have a proven track record. ... I have worked on four budgets, helped in updating our General Plan that takes place only every 10 years and fulfilled what I promised to do when I ran the first time. That is, to push to make Chandler a world-class economy with beautiful and safe neighborhoods, and to ensure fiscal responsibility along the way. This I will continue to do. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? We currently have a 15 percent contingency reserve and a budget stabilization reserve. Should we have a surplus above these important amounts, I would follow what the Citizen Budget Survey showed in the priority based budget goals. The most important areas by priority are: fire emergency response; police patrol services; criminal-investigations services and traffic management; and street rehab and maintenance. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? While I believe Chandler is doing a great job in our operations, since coming on council I have advocated for our city to operate with the latest and best technologies in all areas so we are the most efficient running city. This is especially important when it comes to our police and fire departments in keeping our residents safe. ... I also want our businesses to have what they need online to streamline their business-startup process, in getting permits, and accessing helpful resources that will boost their ultimate success. Seth Graham Website:graham4chandler.com Facebook: Seth Graham for Chandler City Council in 2016 What makes you the best person for the job? For myself and my family, this is much more than just a career move or a political stepping stone. I sincerely feel I was born to serve the people of Chandler and to contribute to their prosperity and success. ... Regardless of where you live or who you know, municipal residents expect and deserve the highest level of attention regarding their concerns. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? I would use and encourage other council members to use the surplus monies for public-safety hiring, parks and recreation (improving our overused sports fields) and save a large portion to reduce taxes and fees charged to residents and businesses. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I love most of the big events Chandler offers throughout the year. I would change how Chandler operates some of these big events. I would look at the least popular in attendance and local business participation. The under-performing events waste taxpayers' money and city resources. They should be eliminated or reworked. Aaron Harris Sr. Website:electaaronharrissr.org Facebook: Elect Aaron Harris Sr. for Chandler City Council 2016 What makes you the best person for the job? I have a great affection for our city as evidenced by my civic interests and affiliation with the Chandler Gilbert Family YMCA and service to the community as the chair of the city of Chandler citizens panel for review of police complaints and use of force. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? A needs assessment should be conducted in order to prioritize the best use of funds. Maximizing the city’s contingency fund would also be recommended in order to offset any unforeseen emergencies, safety concerns, economic crises, and also funding one-time and ongoing reserves for various city projects. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I would focus on prioritizing and expediting the redevelopment of aging communities and parks within the city. Parks support the engagement of the great citizens of Chandler and provide a venue where citizens can participate in recreational activities and events that promote the overall well-being of our community. Parks and aquatic centers across the city should be equal and offer well-kept and safe amenities for all citizens. Sam Huang Sam Huang  (Photo: Special for The Republic) Website: SamHuang.net Facebook: SamHuang4Chandler What makes you the best person for the job? With the vision to lead and passion to serve, (I) pledge not only to ensure Chandler remains a great city to live, work, and play, and also to take Chandler to the next level. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? Add water features in parks; repeal grocery tax; reduce impact fees; expand libraries and library services; promote more arts and cultural activities; support parks/recreation, public safety and museums. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? Revitalize old communities Greg Pekau Website: greggpekau.com Facebook: Gregg Pekau for Chandler What makes you the best person for the job? Mayor Boyd Dunn asked me to serve on Chandler’s Neighborhood Advisory Committee during the Great Recession. I served as a commissioner from 2008-2011,  working with citizens, neighborhood leaders and HOA’s to protect home values, resolve community issues and ensure proper engagement with city services and resources. I have worked in management and leadership positions for Intel Corporation since 2001. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? Invest in our “rainy day” fund to handle unexpected future economic downturns; pay down or pay off long-term debt to keep our tax rates low; accelerate key projects (water infrastructure, roads, etc.) that were planned for future years; invest in one-time expenses for critical items such as needed technologies and training for our first responders. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? Chandler families are going to Gilbert, Tempe and Phoenix for entertainment more and more frequently. We need a vibrant entertainment experience in Chandler year round to build upon our concerts, festivals and current entertainment options. We should work with our developers and business community to find the right fit of entertainment uses and options for Chandler. John Repar Website: johnreparforchandler.com Facebook: John Repar for Chandler City Council What makes you the best person for the job? I am experienced in civic affairs through previous service to Union City, Calif., and current involvement in Chandler. I have the time to be available to serve, the interest to follow up on detail, the experience to apply my skills and the motivation to follow through to obtain results. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? I believe some of the older parts of town could use a face lift through road improvements, lighting, walkways, and recreational facilities. Some type of program to stimulate residents for landscaping and maintenance of properties. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I think there is a little too much discussion about "build out" as though it is some type type of huge event. This will simply come in time. Puts way too much pressure on pushing for revenue sources instead of continued economy of operations and detailed planning of infrastructure maintenance. Mark Stewart Mark Stewart.  (Photo: Special for The Republic) Web site: Stewart4Chandler.com Facebook: Stewart4Chandler What makes you the best person for the job? As an entrepreneur and small-business owner, I have a bold vision for Chandler. One that inspires and energizes the city by creating a community of innovation. One that empowers small businesses and startups by reducing regulation and lowering taxes. A vision that attracts and retains bedrock companies to Chandler and sees the limitless potential for growth and prosperity. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? Maintaining the city’s financial health so we can operate from a position of strength is critical. Our second priority must always be ensuring our first responders have everything they need. Keeping the city financially secure ensures continued low taxes. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? We can think big and I will work to achieve the next evolution of our city. Maintaining the high quality of life that residents have come to expect as we grow means ensuring public services and infrastructure keep pace with our city’s growth. We must strive for the next level, rather than settling.
