Should you sell NVIDIA after its disappointing start in 2017? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 18, 2017 at 4:00PM NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) was one of the hottest stocks in 2016, surging 220% throughout the year and crushing the NASDAQ's 20% gain. But that rally abruptly petered out in 2017, and the stock has declined 3% year-to-date. Does that weak start indicate that NVIDIA could be running out of steam? Or is the stock merely taking a breather before fresh catalysts propel it to new highs? Let's take a closer look at the bearish and bullish cases to find out. NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 powered Roborace vehicle. Image source: NVIDIA. Why NVIDIA might be running out of steam A common bearish argument against NVIDIA is that the stock simply got ahead of itself. NVIDIA's current P/E of 40 marks a multi-year high and doesn't compare favorably to analyst expectations for 10% non-GAAP earnings growth this year. That's a significant slowdown from its 83% growth in fiscal 2017. NVIDIA's revenue is only expected to rise 16% this year, compared to 38% growth in 2017. Several factors are causing this slowdown. First, the expiration of NVIDIA's graphics cross-licensing deal with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) this month will reduce its revenues by $66 million per quarter. While that impact might seem small relative to the $2.2 billion in revenues it generated last quarter, it was "free" revenue which went directly to NVIDIA's bottom line and accounted for 9% of its non-GAAP net income. NVIDIA also faces fresh competition in its high-growth gaming GPU and automotive CPU markets this year. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will launch its next-gen Vega GPUs within the next three months, which could put a lot of pressure on NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal-based GeForce cards. NVIDIA's high-end GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Image source: NVIDIA. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel are both aggressively scaling up their automotive chip businesses. Qualcomm will likely close its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, making it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world. Intel recently announced that it will acquire Mobileye, which supplies 90% of the world's top automakers with collision detection systems. Both Qualcomm and Intel believe that these purchases will bolster their presence in connected and driverless cars -- which could threaten NVIDIA's early lead with Tegra processors. Intel has also taken notice of NVIDIA's progress in data centers, where it's been pairing its Tesla GPUs with non-Intel CPUs for machine-learning purposes. To strike back, Intel recently launched its new "Knights Landing" Xeon Phi processor, which reportedly outperformed the Tesla GPUs in several scientific benchmarks. Why NVIDIA might be taking a breather NVIDIA faces more challenges this year than it did before, but the company has kept its core businesses healthy with a steady stream of fresh partnerships. In the driverless car market, NVIDIA partnered with Baidu to develop a driverless platform last August, partnered with Bosch to create a next-gen driving supercomputer called Xavier in early 2017, and unveiled a proof-of-concept autonomous truck with Paccar in March. In the data center market, NVIDIA launched a new hyperscale GPU accelerator blueprint with Microsoft in March, which is aimed at strengthening its cloud-based AI computing capabilities. NVIDIA also pushed back against AMD in the console market by supplying Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) with the Tegra X1 SoC for its new Switch console. Initial demand for the Switch seems strong, which indicates that the console could become a new pillar of growth for the Tegra line alongside connected cars. The Nintendo Switch. Image source: Nintendo. As for gaming GPUs, NVIDIA plans to counter AMD's Vega with its next-gen Volta GPUs. The Volta probably won't arrive until early 2018, but hardcore gamers might skip the Vega in favor of this next-gen chipset. All these factors indicate that its core growth businesses of gaming GPUs, data center GPUs, and Tegra CPUs should all continue growing for the foreseeable future. The verdict: NVIDIA is just taking a breather NVIDIA faces a lot more headwinds than it did before, but it's still making solid progress across the gaming, AI, and connected car markets. Its P/E of 40 admittedly looks high, but investors should also note that the stock also trades at 37 times 2018 earnings, 31 times 2019 earnings, and 24 times 2020 earnings -- so that multiple will eventually cool off to more reasonable levels. Investors shouldn't expect NVIDIA to repeat its massive gains from last year, but they also shouldn't believe the stock will fall off a cliff. I believe that the stock will trade sideways over the next few quarters, until the company proves that new challenges from AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm won't throttle its long-term growth.   Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The new Connected Modular 45 timepiece uses an Intel SoC, runs Google’s Android Wear 2.0, and is listed with 'expanded functionality'. Tag Heuer will also offer a variety of customization options for the new smartwatch and aim to address different market segments with the new product. Furthermore, the watchmaker says that the Connected Modular 45 design could easily fit a mechanical module and be converted into a regular timepiece. Tag Heuer, Google and Intel formally introduced their first-gen connected smartwatch in late-2015. The wristwatch was the first device of the kind for Tag Heuer and for Intel, and so it was largely a test vehicle for both of them. As it turned out, the Tag Heuer Connected was considered a success by its developers and with the second generation they decided to install a more capable computing platform, a better display and introduce customizable design options. The use of Google Android Wear 2.0 should expand the overall functionality of the new smartwatch, in order to offer more features. Tag Heuer will offer different configurations of the Connected Modular 45: 11 standard versions available in retail and additional configurations upon request. Each timepiece consists of three key elements which users can mix and match: the watch module, the lugs, and the strap. All watch modules are made of grade 5 titanium 5 with a sand-blasted satin finish (of a chosen color), but users can choose bezels of different colors made of ceramic, gold, aluminum, titanium, and even covered with diamonds. The lugs can match the bezels and thus can be made of aluminum, titanium, ceramic and so on. Finally, the manufacturer will offer a variety of straps featuring different colors (black, brown, red, green, etc.) made of calfskin, rubber, ceramic or titanium. The central piece of the Connected Modular 45 is, of course, the watch module. The latter is based on the Intel Atom Z3400-series SoC (Merrifield, two Silvermont cores, 1 MB cache) equipped with 512 MB of LPDDR3 memory (down from 1 GB in the previous-gen model) and 4 GB of NAND flash memory. The device comes with a wireless module featuring Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS and NFC as well as a host of sensors, including an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a tilt detection sensor and an ambient light sensor. In addition, the module has a water-resistant microphone and a vibration/haptics engine, but no speaker. The most notable upgrade of the new Tag Heuer smartwatch is the new 1.39” AMOLED display, with a 400×400 resolution and 287 PPI, which is higher than many competing wearable devices. The display is covered with a 2.5-mm sapphire glass, just like many Swiss-made watches. As for the battery, the manufacturer states that it has a capacity of 410 mAh and claims it can last for up to 25 hours. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Processor Intel Atom Z3400-series 2×Silvermont PowerVR G6400 GPU RAM 512 MB LPDDR3 Storage 4GB eMMC NAND flash Display 1.39" AMOLED 400×400 resolution 287 PPI pixel density 2-point touch Display Protection 2.5-mm Sapphire Glass Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi NFC GPS Sensors accelerometer gyroscope tilt detection sensor ambient light sensor Battery 410 mAh Battery life: 25 hours Charging Magnetic charging cable Water Resistance 50 meters/50 atmosphere Color Black, titanium, aluminum, gold, diamond, etc. Strap Rubber, leather, ceramic, titanium Dimensions Diameter: ≦ 45 mm Height: 13.75 mm Inputs One button, touchscreen Operating System Google Android Wear 2.0 with phone application by Tag Heuer Compatibility Google Android 4.3+ Apple iOS 9+ Price Starts at €1600/$1650 All the Connected Modular 45 watch modules are 50 meters water resistant, just like mechanical watches by Tag Heuer. Now, speaking of mechanics, when someone buys the Connected Modular 45, they can easily switch the smartwatch module with a mechanical watch module that Tag Heuer offers: a moderately-priced Swiss mechanical movement module with 3 hands (calibre 5) or an expensive COSC-certified chronograph Tourbillon Heuer 02-T. Both are also water resistant. One of the things that Tag Heuer has learnt since the launch of the original Connected smartwatch is that there is a market for premium smartwatches. As a result, the Connected Modular 45 will be available at different price points depending on their external finish. The starting price of the smartwatch is $1650/€1600/£1400, but when fully beefed up with diamonds, their price increases to around $7000. Additionally, Tag Heuer offers the so-called Deluxe Box Set that includes one Connected Modular 45 (in grade 5 titanium, with titanium lugs and brown natural leather strap) and one chronograph Heuer-02T tourbillon mechanical module for a total price of €16,650/$17,000 (ex. tax). Both electronics and mechanical modules come with a two-year warranty. Sources: Tag Heuer, Google, Intel.

But maybe there is a better way to get this kind of watch, I mean, really the exact same capabilities with less money? Here you go http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watch-phone/pp_57617... . Same display (AMOLED, 1.39 inch 400x400), bigger battery (450mAh), metal case (you don't really need titanium, you will die before this watch is destroyed), full android experience - you can install everything you like, quad core CPU (compared to two Intel Silvermont), 1GB of RAM compared to 512, 8GB of storage compared to 4GB, SIM support compared to...nothing. Shall I continue? The only thing missing on the Finow X5 plus compared to this watch is the missing Tag Heuer badge which....can be engraved easily. Reply mjeffer - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link This is aimed at people who buy luxury watches and they would have zero interest in buying that one you linked. This is for a niche market and for that market this price is right in line. Reply shabby - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link There's nothing luxurious about this watch, its a regular smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it, it will drop in value as soon as you put it on your wrist... meaning its not a luxury watch at all. Reply eddman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link "smartwatch with a "high end" brand stamped on it" ...which is the whole point. Rich people buy brands. That's the most important thing to them. Specs might be important to some extent but are secondary for them. Reply geekman1024 - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link well, this watch and that one which yeeeeman linked, might be manufactured by the same Chinese factory....if that's the case, that will be a rather sad and funny ironic. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link It's stereotypical to say wealthy people care about branding. I'd argue to the contrary. People who have wealth are more effective money managers that understand the value of things and take into account product specifications, value for the cost, brand prestige, AND (something you forgot which is most important) the usefulness of a particular purchase. These trinkets are more for the upper middle class sorts that are trying to demonstrate wealth, but are actually not exactly above the masses of working class they're trying to escape. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link I have to disagree with this. There are some wealthy people who are concerned with specifications and performance, but "most" wealthy people cannot be bothered to research items they are purchasing. Half the time they have an assistant who will be doing the purchasing for them, and the other half just buys whatever their friends have or whatever is most expensive. Truly wealthy people don't have time to sit down for a couple hours researching each purpose. They just tell their assistant "I need a new watch, get me a new Rolex and make it a good one" or something to that effect. We all probably have our own unique experiences with the wealthy that might guide our understanding, but my personal example would be my uncle in-law. The man is worth a few hundred million dollars, and all he cares about is prestige and appearance. He only buys/drives Mercedes "because it's a Mercedes", his watch is a Rolex, the list goes on and on. He doesn't know the first thing about tech, but he knows that "Apple is the best" so whatever is Apple, he buys. That doesn't make him dumb, the man is a brain surgeon and a lung surgeon, he is a brilliant man. He just doesn't have time to research "toys" which is what stuff like this is to the wealthy. It's one more watch to add to their collection. Nothing more. Reply boozed - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link That is how luxury brands like Tag Heuer operate. In the case of its mechanical watches, they're generally lightly modified off-the-shelf movements (e.g. ETA, Sellita) surrounded by a bunch of marketing. It's not so much about the value proposition. Reply yeeeeman - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link I fully agree with what you said, just wanted to show how outrageous this offer is.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run).

My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM.

Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely?

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument.

No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Finance Analysis: Intel Agrees To Buy Mobileye, Is The Company Worth $15.3 Billion? By Usman Pirzada Mar 16, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel has made the decision to diversify away from its core business to a very significant extent with the acquisition of Mobileye for $15.3 Billion. Mobileye currently accounts for 70 percent of the global market for driver-assistance and anti-collision systems. It employs 660 people and had adjusted net income of $173.3 million last year.On paper, the deal looks good, the market for autonomous vehicles is clearly a race Intel wants to get into and analysts have commented that this might be a fair price for something that is “key technology” to break into this sector. So the question then becomes, is Mobileye worth $15.3 Billion? The deal and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC 35.58 0.88%)’s past record I’ll tell you right off the bat that I am not going to be giving an alternative valuation for the acquisition, just pointing out some considerations regarding Mobileye that could point to an over-valuation driven by the heating arms race among autonomous-automobile companies. Let’s start off with a little bit of context, Intel has a history of reacting incorrectly to new and emerging platforms. The most clear example of this is the fact that it refused to jump onto the smartphone ship until it was too late and in the process missed what could have been the biggest diversification opportunities of recent past. Another example would be spinning out its cyber security division, formerly known as McAfee, in a deal valuing it at $4.2 billion including debt, five years after having bought McAfee for $7.7 billion. Related NVIDIA and AMD Witness Increased GPU Market Share in Q4 2016 As Intel Declines – Green Team Market Share Now at 17.5%, Red Team at 14.4% Keeping that in mind, we can see how it might set the stage for Intel(NASDAQ: INTC 35.58 0.88%) overcompensating in a manner of speaking and jumping on-board whatever seemingly disruptive opportunity comes up next. Goldman Sachs projected the market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles would grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035. So in terms of the sector it has chosen to diversify into, there is very little argument; the autonomous market is definitely an opportunity for Intel and it will definitely be the big leagues of the future.  So the race itself that Intel has opted for is one it should very much try to get into. Mobileye however, may or may not be the right horse depending on a number of variables which we will get into this article. Lets start with the basics, the first question that we can ask is what will be Mobileye’s state post-acquisition and what exactly has Intel in store for the Israeli chip designer. Interestingly, according to Intel, it will be giving Mobileye an unusual amount of autonomy, integrating its own automated driving group with Mobileye’s operations under Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua, who will lead the unit from Israel. The two companies already have an ongoing relationship in the form of their ongoing collaboration with German automaker BMW on a project to put a fleet of around 40 self-driving test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year So considering the fact that Intel is paying a premium of 60 times Mobileye’s earnings, about four times the premium that Qualcomm is paying to acquire the Netherlands’ NXP, just what is the verdict on this deal. As is always the case however, the answer isn’t in black on white, and depends primarily on how Intel utilizes the company. To give our readers some more context, Mobileye adopted the MIPS approach recently going to use Intel’s technology for its fifth generation of Vision processors that are going to enter the market sometime in 2021. Comparing Mobileye’s offerings to that of competitors like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA 108.47 2.27%) In terms of current offering, Mobileye plans to introduce the EyeQ4 chip by 2018 – a truly worthy upgrade (to the EyeQ3) with 14 computing cores, out of which 10 are accelerators. You will have your usual 4 cores as well as accelerators of three different kinds: PMA (Programmable Macro Array), VMP (Vector Microcode Processors) and MPCs (Multithreaded Processing Clusters). The actual count will be 4 Cores, 6 VMPs, 2 PMAs and 2 MPCs for the EyeQ4. This will result in approximately 1.26 Billion MAC/s or 2.5 Tflops. And here is the best part – all of this will be done while staying within a TDP Target of less than 5 Watts. Unfortunately however, there is a problem with Mobileye’s approach to tackling ADAS and the self-driving challenge. According to statements of their own key execs, the market started accelerating towards self driving much faster then they had anticipated. Their products utilize fixed function philosophy and while they have a high utilization rate and were much faster then GPUs previously, not only are they starting to fall behind in terms of the performance increase offered every year but aren’t as flexible or powerful as Nvidia’s approach – which is basically machine learning on the go. Take the EyeQ4 processor for eg which will have (in roughly comparable terms) a performance rating of 1.5-2.5 TFLOPs where as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA 108.47 2.27%) is equipping Tesla cars with the Drive PX 2 set which can churn out 24 TFLOPs. I have seen some arguments which point out that the cuDNN equivalent utilization is roughly 0.3 for GPUs and even if we assume that Tesla has made no in-house optimizations, you are still looking at a bare bones performance of 8 TFLOPs. So Nvidia’s worst case scenario is 3.2x faster than the best Mobileye chip (which hasn’t even fully landed yet) right now. Related PC Gaming Hardware Market Breaches $30 Billion For The First Time in History – High-End Hardware Accounts For 43% Share Advertisement Let’s talk about the Intel-Mobileye chip now. The EyeQ5 will probably be designed in advanced 10nm or below FinFET technology node and will feature eight multi-threaded CPU cores coupled with eighteen cores of Mobileye’s next-generation, innovative, and well-proven vision processors. Taken together, these enhancements will increase performance 8x times over the current 4th generation EyeQ4. The EyeQ5 will produce more than 12 Tera operations per second, while keeping power consumption below 5W, to maintain passive cooling at extraordinary performance. Engineering samples of EyeQ5 are expected to be available by first half of 2018 and are supposed to be delivered to market by 2020. Let’s compare this to an upcoming product Nvidia has already announced: Xavier is a complete system-on-chip (SoC), integrating a new GPU architecture called Volta, a custom 8 core CPU architecture, and a new computer vision accelerator. The processor will deliver 20 TOPS (trillion operations per second) of performance, while consuming only 20 watts of power. As the brain of a self-driving car, Xavier is designed to be compliant with critical automotive standards, such as the ISO 26262 functional safety specification. Xavier samples will be available the fourth quarter of 2017 to automakers, tier 1 suppliers, startups and research institutions who are developing self-driving cars with availability in 2018. Wccftech NVIDIA Drive PX 2 NVIDIA Xavier SOC Name Parker Xavier Process Technology 16nm FinFET 16nm FinFET+ CPU 12 Core CPU 8 Core CPU CPU Architecture 8 x A57 4 x Denver2 4 x ARM64-bit GPU Architecture Pascal Volta Total Chips 2 x Tegra X2 2 x Pascal MXM GPUs 1 x Xavier Compute TFLOPs 8 TFLOPs ~6.6 TFLOPs Compute DLTOPs 24 DLTOPs 20 DLTOPs System Memory 8 GB LPDDR4 (50+ GB/s) TBD Graphics Memory 4 GB GDDR5 (80+ GB/s) TBD TDP 250W 20W Roadmap Current (Tesla Motors) Upcoming, expected 2018 So where does that leave Intel? Nvidia is first and foremost a GPU designer and when the name of the game is DNN, it will be able to provide both the back-end for training as well as the onboard system for fully autonomous driving systems. Mobileye and Intel however can only provide one (the onboard system) since CPUs have never been good at deep learning applications. The lack of GPGPU IP is another weakness in the Intel-Mobileye fit that could potentially hurt its chances of fully utilizing the acquisition. Nvidia Corporation can provide both the back-end and the front-end (in a manner of speaking) for autonomous driving systems. That said, this is something Intel can tackle in numerous ways. The first way to do it would be to to utilize its in-house talent that it poached from Nvidia (An example being Sanjay Gongalore from NVIDIA. At NVIDIA, Gongalore served as director of GPU ASIC Engineering). Secondly (and admittedly less probably), it can utilize the Radeon IP it already has to provide backend functionality to compliment the Mobileye initiative. In any case, one thing is very clear: Mobileye in its current state and function does not appear to be wholly capable of matching Nvidia in either capability or performance and will quickly be far outstripped by the fast paced chip-maker if it does not change its current fixed function philosophy. That said, Mobileye would have been a very good buy just for the IP it offers at a significantly lower premium. At the current pricing, it is priced more like the on-paper specs of the company (70% market share) without accounting for the severe risks it faces going forwards from new but powerful entrants like Nvidia Corporation. To justify its purchase, Intel must seek to broaden the vision of Mobileye and offer a truly integrative approach that matches the one provided by Nvidia.       Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Analysis: Emerging Trends in the PC and Hardware Industry for 2017 – What Do Intel, NVIDIA and AMD Have in Store?

Should you wait and see if we have a big correction? Will the Trump administration unleash the power of the economy with a huge infrastructure project and cash repatriation program? Where are the best opportunities after an eight-year bull market run? The best ideas may be the simplest: stick with big, established companies that pay dividends. One of the best sectors to stick with could be technology, and the winners could very well be some of the old guard that are adding to their capability and raising the dividends they pay to their shareholders. We screened the Merrill Lynch research database, and found four companies rated Buy that fit the bill, some of which have current catalysts that could drive share prices. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. Intel posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were flat compared to the previous year, as well as revenue that was up 1%. But both the top and bottom lines exceeded the consensus analysts’ estimates posted at Thomson Reuters. This week the company announced the purchase of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. The Israel sensor company gives the chip giant a leg up in the autonomous car competition, and it also adds many other capabilities. While some say the valuation paid is high, the dividends down the road could be worth the price. Intel investors receive a 2.96% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the shares is $42, while the Wall Street consensus target is $40.34. The stock closed Tuesday at $35.18 a share. [nativounit] Microsoft This top old-school technology stock is top pick at Merrill Lynch, and it has a massive $136.79 billion sitting on the balance sheet. Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ: MSFT) continues to find an increasing amount of support from portfolio managers, who have added the software giant to their holdings at an increasingly faster pace all of this year and last. Numerous Wall Street analysts feel that Microsoft has become a clear number two in the public or hyper-scale cloud infrastructure market with Azure, which is the company’s cloud computing platform offering. Some have flagged Azure as a solid rival to Amazon’s AWS service. Analysts also maintain that Microsoft is discounting Azure for large enterprises, such that Azure may be cheaper than AWS for larger users. Many believe the company continues to make steady progress with its cloud transition and expect Office 365 and Azure to be solid contributors to top and bottom line for the next several years. While not likely to snag the top slot from Amazon, it could add huge incremental revenue for years to come, especially when you factor in the huge revenue potential from the banks, insurance companies and the financial services industry. Microsoft has reported quarterly earnings and revenue that easily topped analysts’ expectations, as its key cloud product, Azure, saw revenue grow 102%. Fiscal fourth-quarter results exceeded the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. Microsoft shareholders receive a 2.37% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $75 price objective, and the consensus target is $69.42. The shares close most recently at $64.41. Lam Research This remains one of the top chip equipment picks across Wall Street. Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) designs, manufactures, markets, refurbishes and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. The company offers plasma etch products that remove materials from the wafer to create the features and patterns of a device. Many Wall Street analysts have highlighted the company and its peers as having a significant equipment opportunity from the NAND evolution as well. Lam Research also appears well positioned to gain share in the wafer fab equipment market, driven by a strong focus on technology inflection spending over the next few years. Despite so-so foundry and logic spending over the past year, many on Wall Street think that Lam will also continue to benefit from technology transitions such as FinFET, 3D NAND, multi patterning and advanced packaging in 2016 and beyond. Many analysts believe it is the “cleanest” semi-cap story benefiting from cyclical tailwind, SAM expansion and share gains. The analysts noted that Lam Research reported solid results and an impressive shipment outlook. The $8 billion in estimated revenues was well ahead of Wall Street expectations for 2017. The wafer spending outlook looks strong, and the company should easily grow revenues over 20% year over year in 2017 and once again outperform the industry. Shareholders receive a 1.52% dividend. The whopping $140 Merrill Lynch price target compares with a consensus target of $132.37. The shares closed Tuesday a $122.35. Qualcomm This is a top technology stock was hit hard earlier this year and is offering investors a great entry point. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) designs, develops and supplies semiconductors and collects royalties on wireless handheld devices and infrastructure based on its dominant position in CDMA and other related technology patents. In addition, Qualcomm provides systems software and components to wireless handset vendors and promotes applications and services that run on high-speed wireless networks. The company operates primarily through two segments: CDMA Technologies and Technology Licensing. The company posted inline fourth-quarter results, but a lawsuit from Apple and some regulatory pressures weighed heavily on the shares. The company was also forced to defend the licensing model it has used for years and address patent leadership. Merrill Lynch remains bullish on the company’s acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which Qualcomm is buying in an all-cash deal at $110 per share. The deal is expected to close at the end of 2017 and should be immediately accretive to earnings. The merger brings together complementary products for mobile, automotive, Internet of Things and networking applications. Shareholders receive a 3.65% dividend. Merrill Lynch has set its price target at $66. The consensus is $64.99, and shares closed Tuesday at $58.22.

Israeli company Mobileye develops Advance Driver Assistance Systems for two dozen auto manufacturers worldwide. Washington Post photo by William Booth   William Booth The Washington Post     Editor's note: The U.S. chipmaking giant Intel announced Monday that it had reached a deal to acquire an Israeli company called Mobileye for $15 billion -- making it the biggest buy of an Israeli high-tech company ever. Mobileye is a leader in the race to make self-driving vehicles a reality. Weeks ago, Washington Post reporter William Booth went for a drive in one of company's test cars. Here's how it felt. -- -- -- JERUSALEM -- Ziv Aviram has one of his tech guys bring the test car around to the parking lot. The co-founder of Mobileye tells me he's going to drive around Jerusalem without touching the steering wheel. "Hop in," the CEO says. The test car bristles with eight cameras. The interior contains laptops with blinking screens. The tech guy jumps into the back seat and begins to do things. You hear typing. Mobileye is a global player, building Advanced Driver Assistance Systems for two dozen international automobile manufacturers. These are the sensor packages that auto-brake for imminent collisions, warn drivers about lane drift and reduce speed when approaching slow-moving vehicles. Calamity-avoidance stuff. "Buckle up," Aviram instructs. "We go for a ride." This street-ready prototype is good for "proof of concept" testing, meaning it is not fully self-driving yet. When the true autonomous vehicles go on sale, Aviram promises, you won't see any cameras, maybe just lenses. The processors, satellite receivers, mapping, laser radar, sonar will all be shrunk. The tech guy in the back seat will disappear. Later, they will get rid of the steering wheel, too. I want to trust Aviram. But this is Israel, a place where people boast about how badly they drive. Many Israelis already drive without their hands on the wheel, because they are drinking coffee or having a smoke while talking on a cellphone. Aviram hand-steers Mobileye's white sedan out of the lot into traffic. He waits until he has merged onto a decent three-lane highway before he lets go of the wheel. "You're driving now in the future," he says. Mobileye is partnering with BMW, Intel and Delphi to make this happen sooner than you might think. I notice that Aviram, while in spiel mode, is not really paying total attention to the road ahead, or to the beater passenger van filled with yeshiva kids shouldering into our lane from the right, without signaling, or to the gravel truck up ahead, belching smoke, crawling in the passing lane on the left. "You're in the time machine," he purrs. We're in heavy Jerusalem traffic, I think. "You have the opportunity to glimpse how our lives will look in a few years." I'm glimpsing the van muscling into our space. Then Aviram has to subtly adjust the wheel -- for the van. This is not a gotcha moment. This is beta-testing. If the technologists in San Jose, Yokohama and Munich are right, it will soon give way to the biggest advance in automotive technology since the Ford Model T rolled off assembly lines around a century ago. In the 2020s, they say, autonomous cars will be the wheeled version of the smartphone. "In two decades, it will be illegal to drive in developed countries," Aviram predicts. He understands that this concept takes a few minutes to sink in. "The wave is too big to stop," he says. The world's first self-driving taxis, operated by a company called nuTonomy, began picking up passengers in central Singapore in August. An Associated Press reporter along for a test ride noted that "the safety driver" had to tap on the brakes -- but just once. Uber customers in downtown Pittsburgh started getting rides in semiautonomous cars with a human chaperon at the wheel in September. A journalist from Wired reported that the human driver took back control several times, but in a very low-key way: "Once, he's not happy with how long the car is waiting before slowing for a pedestrian. Another time, he manually steers around a double parked truck, knowing the system will just stop and wait for it to move." In the United States, the presence of a human driver remains a requirement -- just in case. Tragedy has already struck. An early adapter named Joshua Brown was killed while driving his all-electric Tesla Model S in hands-free Autopilot Mode in Florida last year. The vehicle crashed into a white semitrailer truck, which the car apparently thought was a cloudy sky. (Mobileye supplied the vision sensors for Tesla and blamed the radar; Mobileye and Tesla ended their relationship.) But the machines are learning. Google's car project is called Waymo, for "New Way Forward in Mobility." Autonomous cars are driving around in four cities and have racked up 2 million miles in self-driving mode. In California, which is closely tracking the experiment, Waymo operators reported 341 "disengagement incidents" in 2015, in which a test driver had to take control of the steering wheel, gas pedal or brakes. Last year, there were just 124 disengagements, despite an increase in the numbers of cars and miles driven. As the Mobileye test car cruises through tunnels down Jerusalem's Menachem Begin Expressway, Aviram says: "This is semiautonomous first implementation," meaning: Don't get too excited yet. In all, we drove at 50 mph for a half-hour along the highways. We didn't take surface streets. It was like hands-free cruise control, but better. "The vehicle understands the scene in front of us and drives accordingly," Aviram said. The car accelerated and braked, maintained its lanes and even changed lanes.

There's better imaging, sensors, sonar, software and laser radar. Faster satellite positioning, sharper detail. Still, a Global Positioning Satellite can pinpoint a position to within only about three to six feet. To self-drive, you need to be talking inches. Aviram says companies such as Mobileye and the automakers will partner to gather data from all the vehicles traveling the same roads and use it to create "drivable paths." Mapping systems pioneered by the Israeli company Waze already do this. The biggest challenge, according to Aviram, will be teaching artificial-intelligence programs humanlike intuition. He gives an example: Four cars simultaneously approach a four-way intersection with stop signs. "A machine might sit there all day, waiting," he says. But a human driver would intuit who goes first. The processors of autonomous cars will have to learn this "human-level negotiation." The hardest situation developers face? "The most effort may go into how to merge into traffic," Aviram says. Imagine a traffic circle in Rome or the entrance to New York's Holland Tunnel. The machine will have to learn from millions of possible scenarios -- as well as figure out different countries' driving habits. Later, after we safely parked the test car back at the Mobileye offices, I asked Aviram why he is unconcerned about the loss of our right to drive. "I am also a driver, and I like to drive," he said. But he has also computed the odds of injury or worse. Driver error, he noted, is responsible for 93 percent of car accidents. There are 1.5 million auto fatalities a year worldwide, and more than 50 million people injured. The economic costs are estimated at $500 billion. "Driving is like a global pandemic," he concluded. Self-driving cars are the cure -- or so he says. Then he ticked off some positives. Imagine a driving experience, he said, in which your car operates itself while you doze, work, chat, read, look out the window. "Once there were elevator operators," he said. "We don't miss them." In the future, there's no steering wheel, so the car has a little card table and passengers sit salon-style around it. The vehicle is a lightweight plastic bubble. It runs on whatever is the cleanest or cheapest energy source. What about all the taxi drivers? The truckers? My FedEx delivery person? What about Bruce Springsteen's "Thunder Road"? Bruce and Mary don't drive away in an autonomous pod. Aviram said that when the automobile was invented, the livery, buggy and horse industries rebelled, and lost. Robots are now ubiquitous in manufacturing -- and so robots will drive vehicles. I asked Aviram if he'd watched the "Terminator" films. He said he has. But not to worry.

Huawei Mate 9 review: the P10 is coming soon Nintendo Switch: better pack a powerbank for Zelda Computers / AMD Ryzen 5 revealed, to take on Core i5? By Hadlee Simons on 16 March, 2017 It was just a few weeks ago that AMD revealed the first processors in its new Ryzen family. The Ryzen 7 range is meant to close the gap to Intel’s Core i7 family, but at a much cheaper price point than Intel’s silicon. Now, the chipmaker has revealed Ryzen 5, being positioned as a rival for the Core i5. The Ryzen 5 starts with the 1400 model, being a quad-core chip running at 3.2Ghz (boosting to 3.4Ghz) and having a suggested price of US$169. Spend US$189 and you get the quad-core 1500X model, upping the ante to 3.5Ghz and 3.7Ghz when boosting. Got US$219 to spend? Then the hexacore 1600 is worth a look, delivering speeds of 3.2Ghz or 3.6Ghz when boosting. Otherwise, the top-end model in the Ryzen 5 range is the US$249 1600X, being a hexacore with speeds of 3.6Ghz (or 4Ghz for boosting). The chips, based on AMD’s long-awaited Zen architecture, are meant for gamers and content creators on desktop, the company wrote in a press statement. AMD seems to have upped its game with the Ryzen 5 series, meant to take on Intel’s Core i5 “Ryzen will ultimately bring innovation and competition to virtually every segment of the PC market, and Ryzen 5 is the next big step on that journey, designed to achieve new levels of compute performance for millions of PC users,” said Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics Group. “AMD reinvigorated the high-performance desktop market with Ryzen 7 earlier this month, and AMD Ryzen 5 now brings the power and efficiency of the ‘Zen’ core to users in the highly popular sub-$300 segment of the market.” So what kind of performance should you expect? The chipmaker cited earlier testing in the release. “Previously, AMD demonstrated the Ryzen 5 1600X beating the Intel Core i5 7600K by 69 percent in CPU performance testing using Cinebench R15 nT.” Of course, benchmarks are one thing, so we eagerly await tests from real games and real-world applications. Expect to get your hands on these chips on 11 April. Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings almost seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact AMD Takes The Fight to Intel With New Midrange Ryzen 5 Processors Azeem Ullah 5 days ago AMD shocked everyone when they released their long awaited Ryzen series of processors. At first the company released the high end processors which competed with $1000+ Intel chips and cost less than half of that. Following up on that, the chipmaker announced the rest of the Ryzen lineup. Called Ryzen 5 it includes 4 different CPU models. These are are essentially just two processors, with a normal and a beefed up frequency variant. Ryzen 5 Series Specifications and Price The highest end processor in the Ryzen 5 lineup is the Ryzen 5 1600X, which comes with a 6-core configuration and 12 threads. The base clock is set at 3.6GHz with a turbo clock of 4GHz. The 1600X also has a TDP of 95W and starts at $249. The next in line is the Ryzen 5 1600, with similar core and thread-count. It is clocked lower at 3.2GHz with a lower turbo boost of 3.6GHz. It has a TDP of 65W, like every other processor in the range that follows it. It is priced at $219. AMD is likely trying to tackle Intel’s i5-7600K chip with these two processors as they cost the same as Intel’s offering. Intel’s chip has four cores and slightly lower TDP compared with AMD’s 1600X and 1600 and does not feature hyper-threading unlike AMD’s processors. Moving on towards the less expensive CPUs, the 1500X and 1400 come in quad-core configurations with 8 threads each. The former has a base clock of 3.5GHz with a turbo of 3.7GHz,while the latter comes with a 3.2GHz base clock and 3.4GHz on boost. As for the pricing, 1500X costs $189 while the 1400 costs $169 Here, AMD is targeting the i5-7500K with the 1500X and 1400. All 3 feature the same TDP and cores but AMD offers double the threads (8 compared to 4). The price falls within the same range as well. Close Competition As for performance benchmarks, we don’t have any yet. With its high end Ryzen processors AMD tried to make up for the lack of single-core performance by including more cores and threads. However with Ryzen 5 the only difference is the number of threads which would make the competition interesting. The Ryzen 5 series is compatible with AM4 sockets, the same ones used in the high end Ryzen processors. Compatibility would not be an issue if you try to upgrade from a lower end Ryzen CPU to a higher end one. AMD will also pair the processors with its own Wraith series of optional coolers. The series is set to launch on April 11th, 2017.

Intel will buy Mobileye for more than $ 15 billion (14 billion euros), the companies said, in a deal signalling the US computer chip giant's commitment to technology for self-driving vehicles. THOMAS COEX / AFP (From L-R) Amnon Shashua co-founder and CTO of Mobileye, Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen, Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and fellow co-founder of Mobileye Ziv Aviram give a press conference at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem on March 14, 2017. US giant Intel announced it would buy Israeli car tech firm Mobileye for more than $ 15 billion (14 billion euros), the largest cross-border tech deal in the Jewish state's history. MENAHEM KAHANA / AFP Intel’s $ 15-billion purchase of Israeli firm Mobileye could help fuel the country’s rise in the driverless car industry — not as a builder of vehicles, but as the brains behind them. Monday’s deal, the largest ever in Israel’s tech sector, could help boost trade despite the fact no commercial cars are assembled in the country. The self-styled “startup nation” has no real tradition of auto manufacturing: an ignoble previous stint in the 1960s and 70s produced the fibreglass Sussita car, parts of which, according to legend, were edible for camels. But the rise of new technology including driverless cars has opened space for the tech-savvy country to excel. In 2013, Google paid more than $ 1 billion (900 million euros) for Waze, an Israeli crowd-sourced app that plots the quickest journeys in real time, followed by Monday’s $ 15 billion Mobileye deal. The company makes advanced driver assistance and accident avoidance systems for car manufacturers, and has already collaborated with Intel and BMW on self-driving car technology. It was founded in 1999 but Yossi Vardi — considered one of the fathers of Israel’s high-tech startup scene — said the automobile industry’s growth in Israel really began in 2007 when General Motors established a research and development centre. “It surprised everybody that a company like General Motors would go to Israel to source innovation and technology.” In the last three years, Vardi said, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo and others have followed suit. Most Israeli companies in the field don’t involve production, but ways to make driving more efficient. Among them are Otonomo, which provides in-depth data on car usage; Argus, one of the market leaders in protecting cars from cyber hacking; and VocalZoom, dubbed “Siri for cars.” Elan Zivotofsky, general partner at the OurCrowd equity platform that invests in a number of companies working on autonomous cars, compared it to smartphones, laptops and other sectors where Israeli technology is heavily used but the final products are still made elsewhere. “Israel is not going to be in the business of building cars,” he said. “Israel is in the business of building some of the most important core elements that will enable autonomous driving.” – ‘Doors will open’ – Vardi said the country’s military experience, with some of the world’s most advanced monitoring, laser-guiding and other technologies, place it in a good position. “When you drive a car, you cannot stop the car and wait 15 minutes for the computer to process. It has to be immediate,” Vardi said. “This kind of talent you find in the military — in airplanes etc.” The impact of Mobileye could be significant, said Yaniv Feldman, editor-in-chief of the Israeli Geektime tech blog. There are dozens of companies in the sector and Feldman reckons Israel is already one of the leading players in autonomous driving behind the United States and China. In 2016, around $ 70 million was invested in automotive tech in Israel, he said, but that will increase by “somewhere between 25 to 40 percent.” “We will probably start seeing much more activity in the space and investor interest rising,” he told AFP. None of the other companies were as advanced as Mobileye, though, he added. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli firm that claims to have developed a radically improved combustion engine, is currently seeking $ 10 million in a second round of funding. Chairman Gal Fridman said they had already noticed a change. “Since Mobileye happened, our phone is ringing all the time,” he told AFP. “Until now, when I came and told (car companies) I was an Israeli developing an engine, it was a bit odd as the country has no history of automobiles,” he said. “Now, after Waze and Mobileye, we have more credibility, I think, and doors will open easier.” What do you think?

It’s been another exciting week across the tech world, with no end of exciting news keeping us on our toes. But if you’ve struggled to keep with it all, fear not, for 7 Days is here once more with a handy walkthrough of the week’s top tech news. "Laser beam" Our journey begins this week on a beam of light, as researchers at the University of Michigan revealed significant progress in development efforts for “lightwave” computers, relying on ultra-fast laser impulses to get electrons firing at incredible speeds. Their discoveries could pave the way towards creating quantum computing devices. Amazon announced that it’s bringing support for its Alexa digital assistant to iPhones – but oddly, not in the Alexa app. Instead, the functionality is being added to the Amazon app on iOS devices. On Thursday, Apple released the seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, both for developers, and testers on its Public Beta program. A passenger on a flight to Melbourne, Australia suffered injuries when her wireless headphones ‘exploded’ on board. The incident raised fresh concerns over battery-powered consumer devices on airliners, following the ban on Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 on flights last year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke with Australia's Prime Minister, offering energy storage solutions and reliable supplies to solve recent electricity shortage issues that left 40,000 people without power in South Australia. But domestic energy suppliers criticized the government for even considering Musk’s offer, calling for a “transparent bid process” and a level playing field to give Australian companies “a fair go”. Over in the UK, telecommunications giant BT agreed to spin off its Openreach network division into a separate company that will provide rivals with access to its domestic network. Rivals such as Virgin Media mocked the move, claiming that it will make little difference to BT’s competitors and to UK customers, as Openreach will continue to offer “the same old snail’s paced network with a new shell”. In Russia, Apple was found guilty of price-fixing after regulators determined that it was compelling companies to sell many of its iPhones at a minimum retail price, stifling competition in the domestic market. Several Russians were among those alleged to have been involved in major digital attacks against Yahoo, which compromised hundreds of millions of user accounts. Image: Getty Images for Visa Visa is considering launching - or at least supporting - wearable devices with support for mobile payments – but rather than going down the ‘typical’ route of wristbands, it’s instead trialling sunglasses with NFC support. On Friday, Qualcomm announced that its processors will now be known as ‘platforms’, and that it's ditching the Snapdragon branding from its current Snapdragon 200-series chips, which will now be branded under the ‘Qualcomm Mobile’ moniker. Meanwhile, rival chipmaker Intel stunned the markets by announcing its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli company that focuses on developing technology for autonomous vehicles. The purchase is a hugely significant move for Intel, giving it a huge boost in the technology behind self-driving cars. Intel was also a key partner in the launch of Tag Heuer’s new Connected Modular 45 smartwatch, an Android Wear 2.0 device with a diverse ecosystem of modular accessories. Promising more than a day of power, along with water resistance, the new device also comes with a hefty price tag: you’ll need to hand over $1,600 to own one. Google has developed a new system to replace the infuriating CAPTCHA tool, which features on many websites that demand that you prove that you’re “not a robot”. The "invisible reCAPTCHA" system works in the background and uses magic and witchcraft "an advanced risk analysis engine" to determine that real humans are accessing websites. Meanwhile, the latest version of Chrome’s web browser brings massive improvements in power usage for PCs, as well as introducing a new offline reading mode to iOS. Google also updated its Gmail app on Android allowing users to send and request money, just as easily as sharing an attachment. Impressively, the company says that the feature is "completely free" for both senders and recipients. Sony’s new ultra-thin Android TV, the Bravia OLED 4K HDR TV, finally got a launch date and official price tag this week – but you’ll need to be earning some serious dough to be able to afford one. Samsung also announced details of its new QLED TVs this week, featuring ‘Quantum Dot’ technology, with the 55-inch models starting at almost half the price of Sony’s 55-inch OLED TVs. Those who pre-order LG’s impressive new G6 flagship in the United States will get a free Google Home speaker hub worth $129.99 with the device. T-Mobile will be offering the new phone in the US, and announced its pricing this week. Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant – but it hasn’t been a great month for the digital assistant so far. After spewing loony conspiracy theories last week, Google Assistant unexpectedly threw in ads for Disney’s new Beauty and the Beast movie a few days ago. However, Google later insisted that the ads weren’t ads at all, but rather “timely content”. And after announcing wider availability of the Assistant on Android 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat devices last month, Google confirmed this week that it won’t be supported on any Android tablets. Nougat is currently installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. Google is believed to be planning to release the newest version of the OS, Android 7.1.2, on April 3 – but for now, its long, slow rollout continues to more handsets: T-Mobile is now testing Nougat for the HTC One M9 OnePlus brings Android 7.1.1 to the 3 and 3T Google Nexus 6 owners on Android 7.1.1 get over-the-air ‘downgrade’ to Android 7.0, causing all sorts of issues on their devices Nougat heads to Samsung’s Galaxy S6 and S6 in India Samsung begins Android 7.0 rollout to Galaxy Note5 Earlier this month, Google released its latest monthly Android security updates. Some manufacturers have begun distributing the March patches quickly – but others have not: March security updates now available for Sony’s Xperia X, X Performance, X Compact and XZ AT&T brings February security updates to Samsung Galaxy Note5, Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S5 active Samsung (re)commits to monthly security updates for unlocked Galaxy smartphones in the US HMD says it will deliver monthly Android patches to the Nokia 3, 5 and 6 ZTE finally gets around to bringing January updates to its Blade V8 Pro, which was released in February The need for timely security updates was highlighted again this week with yet more Android malware having been discovered. Disturbingly, security researchers at Check Point found that malware had been pre-installed on 38 devices, including some from major manufacturers such as ZTE, Samsung, Lenovo, Xiaomi and ASUS. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be unveiled later this month, but there may not be much left for the company to announce by then. More details on the new flagships emerged this week: Images leak of Samsung Experience launcher ‘Black Pearl’ model revealed Galaxy S8 might have camera capable of capturing 1000 frames per second China expected to get exclusive S8 model with 6GB RAM Time ran out to develop the Galaxy S8’s on-screen fingerprint scanner Pricing of the new Galaxy Tab S3 was also revealed this week in the UK and US – but the new high-end tablet, which has a Snapdragon 820 chip – won’t come cheap. Also in the UK, Sony’s Xperia XZ Premium, which it unveiled at Mobile World Congress last month, has been priced at £649. After increasing the price of its Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK by 7% last week, HP is hoping to tempt people to buy the Elite x3 and Desk Dock by offering them up to £500 to trade in their existing handsets. Unfortunately, owners of Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile flagships will only get £125 for their devices. Meanwhile, Microsoft cut the price of the Elite x3 and Desk Dock this week… by 2.4%. Can’t see that making a big difference in boosting sales. Sales of Windows phones have plummeted over the last two years. Industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel wrote off Microsoft’s mobile OS this week, declaring that there’s no hope for a comeback, and that we’re now living in a “two-OS world” as far as the mobile industry goes. Microsoft gave in to that reality a long time ago, bringing more of its software to rival platforms in recent years. It’s made huge improvements to its Arrow Launcher for Android devices over the last few months, adding new support for Android tablets this week. There’s now less than a month until Microsoft ends support for Windows Vista, including security updates. Microsoft has also apparently begun blocking software updates for older versions of Windows running on the newest hardware. Some Windows 7 and 8.1 updates aren’t being offered to PCs running Intel’s latest Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, along with other new-gen chips, as Microsoft is trying to force encourage users to upgrade to Windows 10. At the same time, Microsoft is now preparing to push through certain Windows 10 updates to devices over metered connections. The company says that it will only do so for “critical fixes” and other “updates required to keep Windows running smoothly”. Microsoft has begun the process of finalizing its Windows 10 Creators Update, ahead of its anticipated release in April. The next step for the company is to select a release candidate which is likely to be distributed to Windows Insiders next week. Microsoft detailed new security improvements in the Creators Update this week, but it also revealed details of features being removed from Windows 10 as part of that update. It’s been a busy week for Windows 10 development, as three new builds rolled out to the Fast ring: 15058, 15060, and on Friday, build 15061. You can find details of the fixes and known issues in build 15061 here. The latest Windows 10 SDK Preview, build 15052, is also available, along with ISOs for build 15058. The latter build is now available on the Windows Insider Slow ring too. Microsoft hasn't yet announced a firm date for the Creators Update's release, so there's plenty of room for speculation! Microsoft released its latest cumulative updates for all versions of Windows 10 on Tuesday, including build 10240.17319 (Version 1507 – the original release of the OS), 10586.839 (Version 1511 – the November Update), and 14393.953 (Version 1607 – the Anniversary Update). However, the latest update for Windows 10 Mobile devices did not include a fix for a rather unpleasant bug that leaves all users’ photos available to view without unlocking a handset. That bug was revealed over a month ago, and yet Microsoft still hasn’t resolved the issue – we checked! Microsoft did fix nine critical security issues in Windows 10 with its latest Patch Tuesday updates though. We don’t yet know exactly when Microsoft plans to announce its second-generation Surface Book, but the device is certainly ripe for replacement. It went on sale almost a year and a half ago, but there are plenty of newer and more capable alternatives available now, including some at lower prices. This week, a report claimed that the new Surface Book 2 will have a more ‘traditional’ laptop form factor, ditching the detachable display of the current model, and thus helping to reduce the cost of the entry-level model by as much as a third, bringing its price down to as little as $1,000. The thing is, that doesn’t make a great deal of sense unless Microsoft plans to differentiate the Surface Book 2 in some other remarkable new way. Surface has always been dedicated to developing new product categories to lead the way for other manufacturers to follow with their own devices. Competing head-on with existing machines by launching a ‘conventional’ notebook would go against the Surface ethos, and would likely do little to help sales of similar laptops from Microsoft’s hardware partners. Over in the UK, Microsoft is continuing to soften the blow of its recent – and massive – price increases on the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 by extending its offer of free insurance and Office 365, along with new discounts on both devices. The total savings amount to as much as £600. Microsoft has been working with researchers in the UK on a remarkable project, helping visually impaired children to learn coding by using physical, tangible objects. And after several months in preview, Microsoft officially launched its Slack competitor, Teams, in 19 languages and 181 countries across the globe. Microsoft brought its OneDrive app, developed on the Universal Windows Platform, to the Xbox One this week. It also released Xbox Insider Preview build 15058 to the Alpha ring on Friday, bring a new feature along with a single fix, and a long list of known issues. It followed the release of build 15055 to the Alpha ring earlier in the week. Microsoft also revealed that its Alpha Preview of the new Xbox Game Pass will end on April 7. Game Pass is a monthly $10 subscription that will give gamers access to over 100 games, and will launch this Spring. For the first time in two weeks, Microsoft added four more titles to the list of Xbox 360 games that are backward compatible with the Xbox One. It also introduced a new in-game chat transcription feature for the Xbox One and Windows 10, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech support. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a recall of Energizer’s Xbox One 2X Smart Charger, following reports of potentially dangerous overheating on some units. And after releasing its 4.50 system software update for the PlayStation 4 family last week, some owners of Sony’s consoles have reported issues being able to connect to wireless networks. In happier news, Sony announced that it’s expanding its PlayStation Now service to include PS4 games, allowing PC gamers to enjoy those titles on their Windows machines. Nintendo brought a range of indie titles to its new Switch console, which launched earlier this month. But it also emerged that the Switch is vulnerable to a WebKit exploit, demonstrated through a proof-of-concept earlier this week.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 March 2017 by Military News Why Intel Is Paying $15.3 Billion to Acquire Mobileye By now, you’ve probably heard that chip giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) made waves in the tech space earlier this week by announcing a deal to acquire Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) . The dea l is noteworthy for a number of reasons, least of which is the dollar value involved. Intel is paying $15.3 billion for a relatively small company in what amounts to a shot across the bow of NVIDIA, the current leader in driverless car chips. However, this deal carries deeper implications for the semiconductor industry, so let’s look at why Intel is buying Mobileye and what it means for the parties directly and indirectly involved. Intel and Mobileye: A winning pair? Superficially, the deal seems like a match made in heaven. Intel’s long-standing growth issues in its PC and data center segments are well-known. Moreover, its failure to capitalize on the once-in-a-generation growth opportunity presented by the rise of smartphones and tablets likely left the company anxious not to miss the boat the next time around. The autonomous vehicle market looks like a similarly major opportunity for the company. In that vein, adding Mobileye suits Intel’s aims. Mobileye already enjoys partnerships with 25 automakers to install its Advanced Driver Assist System (ADAS) into their vehicles. It also has experience working with Intel, and reports indicate that the cultural similarities of the two companies were an important factor that helped facilitate the deal. Intel and Mobileye are currently working with BMW to help the automaker develop fully autonomous vehicles and bring them into wide-scale production by 2021 at the latest. However, the deal also involves at least one meaningful downside that investors need to understand. Image source: Intel Intel is paying handsomely As is the case with so many things, there was some give-and-take at work in Intel’s Mobileye buyout. Of its possible flaws, by far the most glaring is the valuation Intel put on the target. Though the long-term results could eventually validate it Intel paid a steep price to get this deal done. Mobileye generated GAAP net income of just $108.3 million on sales of $358.1 million in 2016.  At the agreed-upon price, this means Intel valued Mobileye at either 42 times sales or 141 times earnings. For those scoring at home, the S&P 500 currently trades at about 26 times earnings,  which itself is well above its historic average. Time will tell whether this deal works out for Intel shareholders, but Intel hasn’t enjoyed a lot of success with large-scale acquisitions in the past.  Its particularly garish $7.6 billion  buyout of security firm McAfee in 2011 has done little to lift the chipmaker’s financial fortunes; the jury remains out on its 2015 buyout of Altera for $16.7 billion. Plenty of potential still Perhaps the best way to sum up this move is that it’s a gutsy, all-in bet on the future of self-driving cars and Intel’s place as a major component supplier to the market. In that vein, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that autonomous vehicles will represent a potential $70 billion addressable market by the year 2030.  Beyond that, Intel believes that supporting self-driving cars will require a large amount of additional data center, network security, and cloud computing hardware — and it sees a $30 billion economic opportunity for the company in supplying chips to power those systems. If all of this comes to pass as predicted, Intel will eventually recoup far more than the $15.3 billion it is spending. So though it comes at a hefty premium, Intel’s aggressive purchase of Mobileye is the kind of potentially transformative bet this low-growth tech giant needs to make if it intends to remain relevant over the next 20-plus years.

By: AP | Published:March 18, 2017 11:26 am Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. ( Source: Mobileye) As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” Also Read: Intel to buy Mobileye for about $15 Billion in car tech push She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. Founders of Mobileye present at the Prime Minister’s office at Jerusalem. (Source: AP) He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Also Read: Uber self-driving cars are coming back to California roads Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and othe sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. (Image for representation, Source: AP) “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Also Read: California says autonomous cars don’t need human drivers Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

Now, there's a little smoke and fire in some corners of the internet, though, since a Microsoft Knowledge Base page has popped up about a potential error message that users with systems based on the forementioned CPUs might encounter when running Windows Update. More to the point, you might be told that "your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows," and that you'll need to upgrade to Windows 10. Despite this bit of news making the rounds around the web, and the fact that there's a running Reddit thread with close to 600 comments on the subject, there have yet to be reports of systems in the wild where this error message popped up. The support page doesn't appear to be a fluke, though, since searching the Knowledge Base for article 4012982 yields results in multiple languages. The company stated back as early as August 2016 that Windows 10 is the only supported version for new-generation systems, and its FAQ says as much: As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support. This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon. For example, Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel's upcoming "Kaby Lake" silicon, Qualcomm’s upcoming "8996" silicon, and AMD's upcoming "Bristol Ridge" silicon. Rather predictably, some commenters are up in arms about this event, assuming it ever pops up in production systems. However, as recently as January, Youtuber JayzTwoCents installed Windows 8.1 on a Kaby Lake Core i5 system without fuss. Veering a little into an editorial piece, there are a few things to consider. The whole situation begets the question of what are the expectations of users trying to run what's effectively a legacy OS on their new boxes, since they already knew what the support policy is. Ma and Pa may not, but it's not likely they're installing a fresh operating system on their computers anyway. There's also the matter of install media to consider. While there's a Media Creation Toolkit for Windows 10, most people trying to install Windows 7 or 8.1 will use a DVD or USB stick that (as far as we know) doesn't appear to have a CPU generation check, and possibly never will. That means that in order to not let people use an unsupported OS, it makes at least some sense that the check be done in Windows Update. Technically-minded users might point out that they're fine with running an "unsupported" operating system at their own risk, but the average user is likely not even aware of Microsoft's policy regarding Windows 7 and 8.1. In turn, he may encounter problems that he doesn't know the origin of, much less how to fix them. Flipping the subject on its head, it could be argued that at least Windows 8.1 could be supported on those CPUs, since its support ends in 2023, while Windows 7's EOL is reasonably close in 2020. At this point, it's difficult to tell if Microsoft's policy and execution on the matter creates a real problem. Tags: Windows Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 17, 2017 at 6:07PM By now, you've probably heard that chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) made waves in the tech space earlier this week by announcing a deal to acquire Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY).  The deal is noteworthy for a number of reasons, least of which is the dollar value involved. Intel is paying $15.3 billion for a relatively small company in what amounts to a shot across the bow of NVIDIA, the current leader in driverless car chips. However, this deal carries deeper implications for the semiconductor industry, so let's look at why Intel is buying Mobileye and what it means for the parties directly and indirectly involved. Intel and Mobileye: A winning pair? Superficially, the deal seems like a match made in heaven. Intel's long-standing growth issues in its PC and data center segments are well-known. Moreover, its failure to capitalize on the once-in-a-generation growth opportunity presented by the rise of smartphones and tablets likely left the company anxious not to miss the boat the next time around. The autonomous vehicle market looks like a similarly major opportunity for the company. In that vein, adding Mobileye suits Intel's aims. Mobileye already enjoys partnerships with 25 automakers to install its Advanced Driver Assist System (ADAS) into their vehicles. It also has experience working with Intel, and reports indicate that the cultural similarities of the two companies were an important factor that helped facilitate the deal. Intel and Mobileye are currently working with BMW to help the automaker develop fully autonomous vehicles and bring them into wide-scale production by 2021 at the latest. However, the deal also involves at least one meaningful downside that investors need to understand. Image source: Intel   Intel is paying handsomely As is the case with so many things, there was some give-and-take at work in Intel's Mobileye buyout. Of its possible flaws, by far the most glaring is the valuation Intel put on the target. Though the long-term results could eventually validate it Intel paid a steep price to get this deal done. Mobileye generated GAAP net income of just $108.3 million on sales of $358.1 million in 2016.  At the agreed-upon price, this means Intel valued Mobileye at either 42 times sales or 141 times earnings. For those scoring at home, the S&P 500 currently trades at about 26 times earnings,  which itself is well above its historic average. Time will tell whether this deal works out for Intel shareholders, but Intel hasn't enjoyed a lot of success with large-scale acquisitions in the past.  Its particularly garish $7.6 billion  buyout of security firm McAfee in 2011 has done little to lift the chipmaker's financial fortunes; the jury remains out on its 2015 buyout of Altera for $16.7 billion. Plenty of potential still Perhaps the best way to sum up this move is that it's a gutsy, all-in bet on the future of self-driving cars and Intel's place as a major component supplier to the market. In that vein, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that autonomous vehicles will represent a potential $70 billion addressable market by the year 2030.  Beyond that, Intel believes that supporting self-driving cars will require a large amount of additional data center, network security, and cloud computing hardware -- and it sees a $30 billion economic opportunity for the company in supplying chips to power those systems.  If all of this comes to pass as predicted, Intel will eventually recoup far more than the $15.3 billion it is spending. So though it comes at a hefty premium, Intel's aggressive purchase of Mobileye is the kind of potentially transformative bet this low-growth tech giant needs to make if it intends to remain relevant over the next 20-plus years.

Intel buys into the future of autonomous cars with Mobileye by Mekhala Roy Assistant Site Editor The hype around the future of autonomous cars and the value of data was reinforced with Intel's buying Mobileye this week.

That was the title of the presentation Intel CEO Brian Krzanich delivered at the Los Angeles Auto Show in December, and it's probably the most important thing you need to know about this week's big news from America's premier chipmaker: the acquisition of Mobileye, a leader in autonomous driving, for a cool $15.3 billion.   For anyone who hasn't been paying attention, the future of autonomous cars promises to be lucrative. As Krzanich himself said in the email he sent to Intel employees about the deal, autonomous driving is estimated to be a $70 billion "vehicle systems and data services" market by 2030. And the horsepower under the hood, as he noted, is computing. "This acquisition essentially merges the intelligent eyes of the autonomous car with the intelligent brain that actually drives the car." Krzanich touted. The partnership will allow Intel "to accelerate innovation for car-makers" and deliver the "technology foundation for highly and fully autonomous driving." The deal also reinforces Intel's new narrative -- namely that the chipmaker (which notoriously missed out on the mobile revolution) is more than a PC processing company. "We are a DATA company," as Krzanich emphatically put it in his email: "Our strategy is to make Intel the driving force of the data revolution across every technology and every industry." James McQuivey, principal analyst at Forrester Research who tracks the development of digital disruption, doesn't disagree. "Intel would be foolish not to try to join this melee," McQuivey said in an email. Indeed, the market is rich with possibilities for data service providers. "Expect the company to pull an IBM and become an autonomous vehicle consulting bureau and service provider, spinning up cloud-based resources that will ingest and analyze data from the vehicles, then spitting out not just better driving recommendations or even in-car services, but data infrastructure services that help municipalities track road use, store owners measure passing traffic, and bicyclists plan long-distance rides," McQuivey said. Fast track into the future of autonomous cars But is it a good deal? According to analysts, the Mobileye acquisition promises to make Intel a player in the future of autonomous cars. They point out that the Israeli company comes with a resume that boasts partnerships with major automakers and original equipment manufacturers; Mobileye's chips and algorithms previously powered Tesla's autopilot system. The company has a dominant market share in the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) technology space, which means that Intel now owns a leading player in adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency breaking and lane keeping. And Mobileye also has a 30% profit margin. "Intel paid a very high cost for this company and what it did was it saved Intel time," Mike Ramsey, analyst at Gartner's CIO research group, said. Beyond ADAS, Mobileye technology has rapidly evolved to support "the three pillars of autonomous driving -- sensing, mapping, and driving policy." "Not only did Intel buy the technology, but all the existing relationships with all of the major automakers and it gave them a jump of five years -- and in this business five years is an eternity," he said. Autonomous car future fueled by data David Keith, assistant professor of system dynamics at MIT, agreed that as automobiles increasingly look like computers on wheels, the demand for computing power and data analysis in vehicles is reaching new heights -- and that data is the new oil in the ecosystem. Driver assistance systems work by using machine learning to identify the environment they're in, Keith explained. In order to learn the environment, a huge amount of data is required -- indeed, millions of miles of vehicle travel data -- to train the systems to identify the environment and also make good decisions about how the vehicle should respond to its environment. "Mobileye is clearly the leader in this aspect of the business as they have huge amounts of data that they have refined and have features that are very reliable," Keith said. But the data management issues related to autonomous driving are far from solved. On a basic level, IT experts in the field have to think about where (and whether) all the data generated from vehicles gets stored, said Gartner's Ramsey. "[IT experts] are going to have to think about whether the data should be analyzed on the vehicle first and then uploaded to the cloud, and how to generate value from it," he said. Bob O'Donnell, president, founder and chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research, agreed that autonomous vehicles are pushing IT on many fronts. CIOs and other IT experts in this industry will have to think about distributed computing architectures and their implications, and about what sort of computing capabilities their companies have on the edge. "Autonomous cars serve as a poster child example of the kinds of multi-tiered analytics and the need for very strong edge based computing because that's where you should have the ability to react to real-time data coming in." O'Donnell said. And CIOs watching this from outside of the industry will want to be ready for what happens when all of that vehicle-based data becomes available to their industries, McQuivey said. "If you don't know how to follow website traffic and understand what it means, how will you be able to follow actual on-site traffic in a meaningful way?" The (un)reality of full autonomy While the technical capability of autonomous vehicles is moving pretty quickly, the commercialization prospects of the technology are more uncertain, Ramsey believes. "We are certainly sneaking up on Level 4 autonomy," he said. "But the real question is: When do we get to full automation?" Bryan Reimer, research scientist at MIT AgeLab and associate director at New England University Transportation Center, believes that true Level 5 automated vehicles may be theoretically impossible. "As SAE [Society of Automotive Engineers] defines a Level 5 autonomous vehicle, a fully self-driving vehicle needs to be able to take us from Point A to Point B under all use conditions; 'ALL' is a big word," Reimer said. But Reimer sees deployment of Level 2 and Level 3 technologies "growing even further over time." Level 4 deployments in very select ecosystems, perhaps in a city in good or reasonable weather, is something that is theoretically feasible in the next 10 years, he added. But don't expect dealer showrooms to look much different in the coming years. The smart vehicles that will continue to evolve and dominate the market place globally will look much like those today only with increasing levels of automated technologies available, Reimer said. "So while the automotive ecosystem will change over the coming decades, it's not going to forget its past instantly. It's not going to be a revolutionary change … we are going to go through an evolution." Whether Intel has an inside track to that future remains to be seen. CIO news roundup for week of March 13 While Intel buying Mobileye drew discussions about the future of autonomous cars this week, here's what else made news: Russian officials charged in Yahoo hack. The U.S. Justice Department has charged two Russian intelligence officers with facilitating the breach of 500 million Yahoo accounts in 2014. Two hackers were also charged in the 47-count indictment that includes charges of conspiracy, computer fraud and abuse, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. The Russian government used the information obtained in the breach to spy on targets that included White House officials, business executives and an airline, according to the indictment. Details of the breach were not announced until 2016, and threatened a multi-billion dollar deal to sell Yahoo's core business to Verizon. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer took a share of the heat after the breach was made public. Earlier this week Yahoo named board member Thomas McInerney as Mayer's replacement once the Verizon deal is finalized. This announcement generated additional controversy for Yahoo because McInerney’s compensation includes a higher base salary with annual cash and stock bonus that total at least double the amount Mayer received. It remains unclear what Mayer's role will be with Verizon or with Yahoo's remaining assets -- to be renamed Altaba -- after the sale, slated to close in the second quarter of this year. Tech companies unite against travel ban. A group of 58 companies, including Airbnb, Lyft and Dropbox, joined together to protest the revised travel ban on majority-Muslim countries that the Trump administration released earlier this month. The companies submitted an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii requesting a temporary restraining order on the executive action. In the brief, the group stated that the ban would "inflict significant and irreparable harm on U.S. businesses and their employees." The revised travel ban was put on hold Wednesday after a federal judge ruled in favor of the state of Hawaii's request for the temporary restraining order. In February, technology companies filed a similar amicus brief to protest President Trump's original executive order on immigration. More IT pros receive security training. As cyberattacks and data breaches continue to make headlines, a new study from Pearson VUE finds that enterprises are investing more in cybersecurity training. Among 6,605 U.S.-based IT professionals surveyed in the last year, there was 48% increase in those taking security training and a 60% increase in those taking security exams compared to prior year, the study found. Employers funded the security training for 53% of respondents, while 26% of respondents said they paid for it themselves. Enterprises are scrambling to find qualified cybersecurity personnel to face additional cyber threats: In a recent survey conducted by ISACA, 55% of organizations reported that open cybersecurity positions take at least three months to fill, 32% said they take six months or more, and 27% said they are unable to fill cybersecurity positions.

Follow Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Israel, America’s greatest ally in the Middle East, has emerged as a global trailblazer in innovative technology driving us all into a safer future. For a literal and figurative illustration of this idea, look no further than Mobileye, a global leader in computer vision for autonomous driving technology headquartered in Jerusalem. California-based Intel purchased Mobileye for a whopping $15.3 billion. This milestone purchase marks the largest-ever acquisition of an Israeli tech company. Intel is looking for Mobileye to help take it to the next level of autonomous driving systems, and Intel announced its intention to move its entire automotive unit to Israel. Mobileye’s technology, developed by Israelis, is actually a game changer that will ultimately save Americans and millions of other lives worldwide through cutting-edge safety features for drivers. I have traveled to Israel more than one dozen times, and the Israeli entrepreneurs and businessmen with whom I have met have never failed to amaze me with their boundless imagination for innovative and life-improving innovation. Its even more incredible to consider when you reflect upon the steep odds that have been stacked against the Jewish state since even before its founding. Israel is tiny, even smaller than the state of New Jersey, and is situated in the world’s most dangerous neighborhood. Radical terrorists who indoctrinate their children with hatred and embrace an irrational extremist ideology that justifies killing innocents are a constant threat. Despite living in constant vigilance against suicide bombers exploding themselves at restaurants, Hamas launching deadly rockets into civilian areas, the Iranian nuclear threat determined to wipe Israel off the map, or terrorists driving vehicles into crowds of innocent people – Israel still manages to be ranked as one of the world’s premier hubs for tech innovation. Many Americans hear the word “Israel” and automatically associate the Jewish state with images of war, terrorism and violence being inflicted upon it. But this land of milk and honey and biblical history continues to be a place where miracles happen. Israel is a global superpower in innovation and technology. Premier American and other international companies in pursuit of the most cutting-edge tech research have courted its start-ups and experts. In fact, most people may be surprised to learn that Israel boasts the highest concentration of start-ups and research and development centers per capita in the world.   A few years ago, Google purchased the Israeli start-up Waze for $1.15 billion after outbidding Facebook and Apple. The acquisition of Waze marked the first Israeli consumer-app company to be purchased for more than $1 billion, catapulting Israel’s “Start-up Nation” to the next level. That was also right around the time Apple purchased the Israeli 3D sensor company called PrimeSense for $300 million – just one of many examples of America tapping into Israel’s expertise in computer vision and tech know-how. What is truly amazing is that in addition to mastering the tech industry, Israel is also on the front line of medical innovations and has gained worldwide recognition for its unprecedented discoveries. Israeli doctors, scientists and researchers have produced pioneering medical advances that are dramatically improving the lives of millions of Americans and others worldwide. Israel is responsible for developing treatments for conditions including paralysis, cancer, diabetes, blindness, general disabilities and so much more. Israel is also a global leader in the groundbreaking tech arenas of cybersecurity, energy security, clean technology, agricultural techniques and defense systems. Israel’s achievements not only inspire, but also transcend conflicts. Israeli innovations, cures and life-saving inventions cross boundaries, politics and religions. Now just consider if Israel lived in quiet times, next to peaceful neighbors, and was not forced to invest the majority of its resources and experts into self-defense and protecting its people. Imagine the incredible Israeli potential that would be unleashed into the world. The Jewish state would be able to contribute even more life-saving and transformative innovations for the betterment of humanity. That, too, would be a modern-day miracle. I, for one, hope to see it in our lifetime.

Steinbrenner rubbed off on the Braves' general manager. While Atlanta's 188 losses over the past two seasons were "painful" in the GM's own words, they were necessary. The Braves used that time to transform one of the game's worst farm systems into one of its best, giving Coppolella great hope as his team prepares to move into its new ballpark next month. MLB.com spent time with Coppolella at George M. Steinbrenner Field -- his old stomping grounds -- before a Yankees-Braves game, discussing his time with the Boss, his evolution as an executive, what rebuilding really feels like and why he was so excited to sign the oldest player in baseball. General manager Q&As Marlins' Hill previews '17 Fish Mets' GM Alderson on analytics Alderson shares career path Alderson discusses 2017 club Mozeliak gives thoughts on 2017 Cards Rizzo on Nats, scouting vs. analytics Luhnow on analytics, unusual career path Levine shares vision of Twins' future Levine talks analytics, philosophy Team effort for Neander, Rays leadership Dombrowski on career, endgame for Sox Atkins talks Toronto's high hopes Coppolella on rebuilding, Colon Klentak on Phillies' plan MLB.com: Much to your parents' dismay, you turned down a six-figure job with Intel when you graduated college, taking an $18,000 internship with the Yankees instead. Was that a leap of faith, or did you figure that the Intel-like job would always be there for you? Coppolella: It was something where I felt like you only get one life and I felt that Intel-type job would always be there. It was something where I didn't want to wake up at 45 years old and think, "What if I took that job with the Yankees when I was 21; what could have happened?" MLB.com: The Braves finished 20-10 last season, winning 12 of their final 14 games. Did that leave the team with an excitement about 2017? Coppolella: Yeah. We feel like we're on the right track. We are going through all this pain; with John Hart, John Schuerholz, Terry McGuirk, these three men, we made a vow that we were going to go through the pain, we were going to make it short-lived, we were going to try like hell not to lose 100 games and try to build up the best farm system that we could. It was really tough. Seeing us go from 29 to one (farm system rankings) in two years has never been done. We want to stay at one for a long time; that's a source of pride for us. They made a vow and it got dark sometimes. We started out 0-9 and 9-28; even at that record, we knew we were a little bit better than 9-28. As the season went on, the big changes for us were the trade for Matt Kemp and the callup of Dansby Swanson. We felt at the end of the year like we were a team that was playing really well; the thing we lacked was starting pitching. We went 20-10 with basically Julio Teheran and Mike Foltynewicz. We still had three huge holes that we needed to get filled and that's what we were able to do this offseason. We got three one-year guys in R.A. Dickey, Bartolo Colon and Jaime Garcia that we feel will give us a chance to win every night. • PODCAST: Listen to the full interview MLB.com: With the new ballpark opening this year, I know you said you have to be patient; but was there extra pressure to try to get things turned around or at least get things better by the time the new park opens? Coppolella: When you have a new park open, you want to win. Everybody wants to win. You don't want to have a bad year where the fans see this great park and then they see a really bad team on the field. That being said, we want to win every year. Starting out 0-9 and 9-28 isn't fun. People can talk about, "We will do a rebuild," but if you ask other GMs who have gone through this the way I have, it is painful. There are nights where you're sick to your stomach. There are mornings where you don't want to go on the phone or go do any kind of interview. You fire your friends; firing Fredi (Gonzalez) was not fun. All that stuff. It sucks. Rebuilding sucks. I don't want to rebuild. We want to create a foundation here to where we don't have to ever rebuild. We are out on windows where we can be good for the next two or three years, but then we'll suck for the next five or six. We want waves of young players coming the way that John Schuerholz and Bobby Cox had it with the Braves in the 1990s to where there was always someone else there. Coppolella on SunTrust Park Coppolella on pressures that accompany a new ballpark Braves general manager John Coppolella discusses the team's new ballpark adding extra pressure to deliver championships to fans We ran out of players in 2014; part of the reason why we finished 27-40 is we didn't have any good players to call up. Part of the reason we finished 27-40 is that at the Trade Deadline when we tried to trade for players, nobody liked anybody in our farm system. That formula isn't going to work. Taking the safe college player, trading away good, young, upside players -- we're out on that. That isn't going to work. That isn't going to get us to where we are. I don't care if we have a winning season; I don't care about any of it. I care about World Series championships. Think about this: The Braves haven't won a playoff series -- one series! -- in 16 years. What are we doing? I don't care if we're .500; I want to win playoff series and I want to win championships. All of us want to do that. MLB.com: Is that something you learned working for George Steinbrenner? Coppolella: Yes. You know what? Even if you were in the World Series and lost, it was still a failure. If you don't have that mindset, why are you even playing? Why are you in this? If you don't want to win the World Series, why are you even showing up at work? What is your goal? Are you there just to make money or have some fancy job title with a cool workplace? No. Come to win. You play everything to win. I want to win. John Hart wants to win. John Schuerholz, Terry, all of these guys want to win. We haven't won a playoff series in 16 years, so we still have a lot of work to do. MLB.com: You just have to find three Hall of Fame starting pitchers and you'll be good to go. It's just that easy, right? Coppolella: (laughs) Yeah, that would be great. MLB.com: Eighteen months ago, you said, "We're not tanking ... There is a method to this madness. Judge our trades in two to three years, not now." You're 18 months removed; how do you judge those trades? Have they worked out the way you hoped? How long do you usually wait to judge a trade? Coppolella: We don't want to sound cocky, but you're in the game -- see what we've done. We feel pretty good about where it's headed in such a short period of time. We don't have all the answers and we still have a long way to go. It's real easy to kick people when they're down, when they're 0-9, when things aren't going right. That's when you find out who are your true friends, who are the people that care about you and that are still going to stay objective. Not even friends, really. It's just kind of, are there people that are going to try and feed on the dead carcass, or are they going to say, "Look, it took the Cubs five years, it took Houston seven years, it took the Royals nine years, it took the Pirates 20 years. Why don't we just give them an hour, you know? Just let them have a little time and let's see before we pass judgement and say that nobody knows what they're doing and this is the worst thing ever.' Again, we haven't won a playoff series in 16 years. What are we chasing after here? MLB.com: How have your views or philosophies toward the game changed at all, if any, since the start of your career? Coppolella: When I first started out, I was probably 90 percent analytics, 10 percent scouting. I didn't really know much about scouting; I had not scouted. As I got more into scouting through guys like Gordon (Blakeley) and Damon (Oppenheimer), I probably swung the other way where I was probably 70 percent scouting, 30 percent analytics. Right now, for me personally, I'm probably 65 percent scouting, 35 percent analytics. I feel like we're so heavy in analytics that there's value to be found through scouting because it's somewhat undervalued. MLB.com: Analytics have found their way to fans now, as well. MLB's Statcast™ has made some of these metrics more public over the past couple years. Do you think it has changed the way fans look at the game? Coppolella: Probably. I don't know if it's good or bad. I was always real good with numbers; when I was 3, I was doing ninth-grade math, basically. But when I watch the game, I love the game. It's great that guys can take the route that's 78 percent efficient; that's fine. I just like to watch a guy make the play. I just like to watch the game. If that's what our fans like, great. If they just like to watch the game, too -- I'm not saying my way is right or their way is wrong or anything, I just always loved the way the game was played. Coppolella on Statcast John Coppolella talks analytics, Statcast popularity Braves general manager John Coppolella discusses the increasing popularity of Statcast among fans and how he prefers to take in a game MLB.com: One of your notable offseason acquisitions was a 43-year-old starting pitcher. What most attracted you to Bartolo Colon? Coppolella: John Hart had a long history with him, signed him 25 years ago. John knows who this person is; I've seen it firsthand as he beat us with the Mets year after year. He's a great teammate, somebody you can count on for innings, and he has a chance -- he's 13 wins away from the D.R. record for starting pitchers, 16 away from the Latin record for starting pitchers. Say that he can hang in there for two or three more years, he has a shot at the Hall of Fame. This is a special guy. Guys just love having him on the team. There's a lot of good things. He will help our young guys in two ways. One, he will help teach them about the game. If I'm a young Braves pitcher and I see this guy at 43 years old, what I'm saying to myself is, "How do I do what he's doing? Why is he still in the game at 43? He must be doing a lot of things right, let me find out what." Coppolella on acquiring Colon Coppolella on what attracted him to Colon Braves general manager John Coppolella talks about acquiring Bartolo Colon and what the 43-year-old starting pitcher brings to the team Number two, it will let us push guys back. We don't have to force-feed starters. We started (Roberto Hernandez) three times last year. Names of players who have come through, it's embarrassing for Braves fans. It is for us, too. It just is what it is; that's where we were. We chose for that period of two years to put our money into our young players knowing that there would be a payoff. So you go and take the beating, you try to give opportunities to whomever was there, but the time for opportunities, the time to try out everything is past. It's over. MLB.com: You have said, "You don't buy No. 1 starters, you grow them." Have you always believed that? Coppolella: Yes. Look, we aren't going to be the team that's going to give $200 million to a free-agent pitcher. Whether I'm here for the next year or for the next 10 years or whatever, you want to leave the Braves in a better spot than when you got here. You want to create something special. Getting into bad contracts, tying up future payroll flexibility, that is not the way we want to go. All of these guys getting $200 million, they're on the wrong side of 30. They've thrown literally tens of thousands of pitches already. Why would we want to go that way? Why would we want to flush money down the toilet? Mark Feinsand is an executive reporter for MLB.com.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamanski, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major automaker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamanski. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said. 8 CONNECTTWEET 8 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 14:03 carewolf says: More a netbook CPU than a normal laptop CPU. But with 8 cores it is more like 4-8 netbook CPUs. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

The hearing will be titled, Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns, according to a statement from Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard BurrRichard BurrSchumer: Trump must apologize for wiretapping claim Senate panel asks Trump ally Roger Stone to preserve Russia-related records Senate Intel Committee sets hearing on Russian election interference MORE (R-N.C.) and Ranking Democrat Mark WarnerMark WarnerSchumer: Trump must apologize for wiretapping claim Senate panel asks Trump ally Roger Stone to preserve Russia-related records Senate Intel Committee sets hearing on Russian election interference MORE (Va.). The hearing will include two panels. The first, meeting at 10 a.m., will examine the "history and characteristics" of information campaigns by Russia. The second panel, which examines the "role and capabilities of cyber operations," will meet at 2 p.m. The intelligence community publicly blamed Russia for hacks of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) last year and suggested the attacks were carried out to help President Trump win. Moscow has denied any involvement in the hacking campaign. Trump has been dismissive of the intelligence community's conclusions, mostly casting blame on the DNC for poor security practices. A bipartisan group of lawmakers have advocated a thorough investigation of possible interference. Tags Richard Burr Mark Warner   View the discussion thread.

As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. (Olivier Fitoussi/AP) By Josef Federman, Associated Press | PUBLISHED: March 17, 2017 at 12:46 pm | UPDATED: March 18, 2017 at 3:24 am JERUSALEM — As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

Date: 2017-03-18Author: kopitiambot (Source: arstechnica.com) The response to AMD’s Ryzen processors with their new Zen core has been more than a little uneven. Eight cores and 16 threads for under $500 means that they’re unambiguously strong across a wide range of workloads; compute-bound tasks like compiling software and compressing video cry out for cores, and AMD’s pricing makes Ryzen very compelling indeed. Further Reading AMD’s moment of Zen: Finally, an architecture that can compete But gaming performance has caused more dissatisfaction. AMD promised a substantial improvement in instructions per cycle (IPC), and the general expectation was that Ryzen would be within striking distance of Intel’s Broadwell core. Although Broadwell is now several years old—it first hit the market way back in September 2014—the comparison was relevant. Intel’s high-core-count processors—both the High End Desktop parts, with six, eight, or 10 cores, and the various Xeon processors for multisocket servers—are all still using Broadwell cores. Realistically, nobody should have expected Ryzen to be king of the hill when it comes to gaming. We know that Broadwell isn’t, after all; Intel’s Skylake and Kaby Lake parts both beat Broadwell in a wide range of games. This is the case even though Skylake and Kaby Lake are limited to four cores and eight threads; for many or most games, high IPC and high clock speeds are the key to top performance, and that’s precisely what Kaby Lake delivers. In spite of this, reading the various reviews around the Web—and comment threads, tweets, and reddit posts—one gets the feeling that many were hoping or expecting Ryzen to somehow beat Intel across the board, and there’s a prevailing narrative that Ryzen is in some sense a bad gaming chip. But this argument is often paired with the claim that some kind of non-specific “optimization” is going to salvage the processor’s performance, that AMD fans just need to keep the faith for a few months, and that soon Ryzen’s full power will be revealed. Both parts of this reaction are more than a little flawed. It’s actually a really good gaming processor It’s true that Ryzen’s gaming performance doesn’t match Intel CPUS. If your interest is solely and exclusively gaming performance, then Intel’s Kaby Lake i7-7700K is the best chip on the market, and its price is in the same ballpark as the cheapest Ryzen, the 1700. Not even the top-end 1800X can beat the 7700K. But the 7700K is the fastest all-round gaming processor on the market today. Being “not as fast as the 7700K” doesn’t make a processor “bad” for games. It just means it’s not quite as fast as literally the fastest gaming processor ever made. For the most part, the differences between the processors are academic. In almost every case, the difference between the Ryzen and the Kaby Lake is that one has a slightly lower, but still very playable, framerate than the other. If benchmarks were showing that the Intel chips are consistently above, say, 60 frames per second while the AMD chips were consistently below, then, certainly, a good argument could be made that the Intel processor will provide a smooth gaming experience where the AMD one won’t. But generally, that’s not the case. Even where the gap is quite substantial, such as Rise of the Tomb Raider, where we saw 135fps on both the Kaby Lake i7-7700K and the (eight-core/16-thread) Broadwell-E i7-6900K, the 1800X managed 110fps. That speed is still comfortably playable. Tech Report saw even more extreme differences in Doom in OpenGL mode; 170fps for the 7700K, just 123fps for the 1800X; Tech Report doesn’t include the 6900K, but the 10-core/20-thread 6950K achieves 156fps. The 1800X certainly gives up some fps, but it remains perfectly playable. Switch to the newer Vulkan API instead of OpenGL and the difference evaporates away, with both the 7700K and the 1800X averaging 165fps. The 6950X, for what it’s worth, is slightly behind at 161fps. This is why we concluded that the 1800X was a very solid alternative to the Broadwell-E 6900X—it offers very comparable performance at less than half the price. Even for gaming, it remains a worthy contender: Ryzen is “good enough that you may well be willing to take the performance hit in some programs so that you can enjoy the big wins in others.” That’s all well and good for the games of today, but what about the games of the future? As games become more demanding, there may become a point at which the 7700K is just at the threshold of “playable framerates” and the 1800X falls short. Doesn’t that make the 1800X a bad buy? Predicting the future is an inexact science, and it’s impossible to say for certain how games of the future will behave. We can, though, make some educated guesses while recognizing that Ryzen has some features that make it a little unusual. The often made argument that software of today isn’t “optimized” for Ryzen isn’t quite right. Not because software is, in fact, optimized for Ryzen, but because it assumes a model of software optimization that doesn’t really correspond to real software. Sure, games aren’t optimized for Ryzen, but equally, they’re not really optimized for Broadwell, Skylake, or Kaby Lake. They’re just optimized in general to run faster across the board. But there is nonetheless optimization and improvement to be done.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a non-profit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research centre in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centres that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

Personal computers powered by the latest processors from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm will be blocked from receiving security updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, according to the support document. "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows and you won't receive updates," one potential message stated. That message, and another that cited error code 80240037, will be triggered when attempts to retrieve updates are made from Windows 7- or Windows 8.1-equipped devices powered by seventh-generation processors from Intel and AMD -- aka "Kaby Lake" and "Bristol Ridge," respectively -- or the next-generation Snapdragon 820 series mobile CPUs from Qualcomm. Those processors will only be supported by Windows 10, the document said, adding that that meant, "Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update." Microsoft announced the new-silicon support limitation in January 2016, when it said making Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 run on the latest processors was "challenging." The company then decreed that Windows 10 would be the only supported edition on seventh-generation and later CPUs and simultaneously dictated a substantial shortening of Windows 7 support. That popular edition would be fully supported on six-generation processors -- Intel's were dubbed "Skylake" -- until July 17, 2017. At that point, some Skylake-equipped PCs would continue to receive some security updates; other such PCs would get nothing after the deadline. Microsoft later walked back the cut-off, first by extending the end-of-support date to July 2018, then by repudiating the entire Skylake proclamation for Windows 7 and 8.1. The last move -- which took place in August -- meant that only seventh-generation and later processors from AMD and Intel were on Windows 7's and 8.1's no-support lists. Even so, the widespread reporting of the support document over the past few days seemed to catch many by surprise. And some were irate. "Chipsets are supposed to be the responsibility of Intel or AMD, not [Microsoft] and their pressure tactics," railed Rattlesnake_Shake on a Reddit thread today. "Ending support of the OS for this year's hardware shocks me a bit, especially when those OSes are good for a handful of years yet," chimed in LakeVermillionDreams yesterday, also on Reddit. Windows 7 is to receive security updates until Jan. 14, 2020, while Windows 8.1's support is to end on Jan. 10, 2023. What's unclear is whether Microsoft had pulled the trigger on the no-patches-for-older-Windows rule and was showing users the messages outlined by the support document. Microsoft did not immediately reply to questions, including whether it is now sniffing for Windows 7 and 8.1 on PCs running the banned silicon, and if it has not, when it would.

The market for autonomous vehicles, including systems, data, and services, is expected to be worth up to $70 billion by 2030. Intel is paying out $15.3 billion in cash for Mobileye shares.  Given Intel is worth around $166 billion, this is a significant chunk of money and effort for one company, but it's more than just cash going on. Once the merger is complete, Mobileye will be the leader of Intel's autonomous driving organization headquartered in Israel, combining it with Intel's existing Automated Driving Group. At the head of the new organization is Professor Amnon Shashua, Mobileye's co-founder, Chairman, and CTO, with Intel Senior Vice President Doug Davis reporting to Shashua after the transaction's close. It's a big bet for Intel. Mobileye's claims to value are a suite of technologies including computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving.  Proprietary software algorithms and EyeQ custom silicon interprets what vehicle cameras “see,” including vehicles, pedestrians, roadway markings, barriers, traffic signs and traffic lights. Mobileye products have been or will be integrated into car models from more than 25 global automakers, as well as aftermarket products.  Key partnerships have been established with BMW, Delphi, and VW.  It will take time for Intel and Mobileye to finalize the merger and move forward.  In the meantime, NVIDIA came out swinging with silicon and vehicle partnerships to grow its reach into the automotive world and beyond.  Bosch, the world's largest automobile supplier, announced it is working with NVIDIA to develop self-driving systems.  Specifically, NVIDIA and Bosch are developing an AI “self-driving” car computer built on NVIDIA's deep learning software and hardware that enables vehicles to be trained to drive, operated autonomously and updated over the air with new features and capability.   NVIDIA will provide its DRIVE PX AI computer to process the data coming in from Bosch auto sensors, including its own ADAS video system. Complicating matters, Bosch considers Intel a partner, but Mobileye a competitor in the ADAS system space.  How relations between Bosch and Intel evolve in the future is an open question, but one that will be ultimately driven by what parts and systems auto manufacturers select for their vehicles. NVIDIA also expanded its market beyond stock consumer vehicles by announcing its partnership with PACCAR.  The global truck manufacturer has the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF lines of trucks and has developed a proof-of-concept self-driving truck built on NVIDIA DRIVE PX2 technology.   Over 300 million trucks are on the roads worldwide, moving over 1.2 trillion miles a year.  In the U.S., there are about 5.6 million or so tractor trailers registered for use and 3.2 million licensed truck drivers. Incorporating self-driving capabilities and other intelligent features to commercial vehicles would save energy and improve safety.  Sixty-eight percent of all the goods in the U.S. are delivered by semi-truck, working out to 60,000 pounds of goods per person every year. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates over 500,000 truck accidents occur every year, with around 1 percent or so resulting in fatalities. NVIDIA holds a leadership position within the automotive industry at this time, but standards, technology, and the industry are still evolving to adopt to autonomous vehicles.  Given the conservative and slow-moving (by tech standards) nature of the auto industry, there's still plenty of room for both NVIDA and Intel to secure and keep market share.  More strategically, Intel is being pressed by NVIDIA not only in the auto industry, but in AI and high-end “supercomputing” applications.   With continued struggles in mobile devices and the maturing of the PC market, Intel can't afford to sit out autos, even if it has to put out $15 billion to become more competitive. If you’d like to hearn more about AI, machine learning and analytics, be sure to check out TMC and Crossfire Media’s newest conference and expo, Communications 20/20, happening July 18-20 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

Twitter Facebook Microsoft ready to block updates for Windows 7 on latest PCs But it's unclear whether it has triggered the no-update rule decreed in 2016 Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 18 March, 2017 06:03 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft may be getting ready to enforce a new support policy for Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 that was announced last year, a recently-revised support document signaled. Personal computers powered by the latest processors from AMD, Intel and Qualcomm will be blocked from receiving security updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, according to the support document. "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows and you won't receive updates," one potential message stated. That message, and another that cited error code 80240037, will be triggered when attempts to retrieve updates are made from Windows 7- or Windows 8.1-equipped devices powered by seventh-generation processors from Intel and AMD -- aka "Kaby Lake" and "Bristol Ridge," respectively -- or the next-generation Snapdragon 820 series mobile CPUs from Qualcomm. Those processors will only be supported by Windows 10, the document said, adding that that meant, "Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update." Microsoft announced the new-silicon support limitation in January 2016, when it said making Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 run on the latest processors was "challenging." The company then decreed that Windows 10 would be the only supported edition on seventh-generation and later CPUs and simultaneously dictated a substantial shortening of Windows 7 support. That popular edition would be fully supported on six-generation processors -- Intel's were dubbed "Skylake" -- until July 17, 2017. At that point, some Skylake-equipped PCs would continue to receive some security updates; other such PCs would get nothing after the deadline. Microsoft later walked back the cut-off, first by extending the end-of-support date to July 2018, then by repudiating the entire Skylake proclamation for Windows 7 and 8.1. The last move -- which took place in August -- meant that only seventh-generation and later processors from AMD and Intel were on Windows 7's and 8.1's no-support lists. Even so, the widespread reporting of the support document over the past few days seemed to catch many by surprise. And some were irate. "Chipsets are supposed to be the responsibility of Intel or AMD, not [Microsoft] and their pressure tactics," railed Rattlesnake_Shake on a Reddit thread today. "Ending support of the OS for this year's hardware shocks me a bit, especially when those OSes are good for a handful of years yet," chimed in LakeVermillionDreams yesterday, also on Reddit. Windows 7 is to receive security updates until Jan. 14, 2020, while Windows 8.1's support is to end on Jan. 10, 2023. What's unclear is whether Microsoft had pulled the trigger on the no-patches-for-older-Windows rule and was showing users the messages outlined by the support document. Microsoft did not immediately reply to questions, including whether it is now sniffing for Windows 7 and 8.1 on PCs running the banned silicon, and if it has not, when it would. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

News Week In Review: Fed Hikes, Intel Buys Mobileye, Software Earnings Boom, IPOs Strong IBD STAFF 3/17/2017 Reprints The Federal Reserve raised interest rates but didn't signal that it plans to be more aggressive, sending stocks slightly higher and bond yields sharply lower. Intel (INTC) is buying Mobileye (MBLY), putting its chips on self-driving cars, as Tesla (TSLA) raises cash for its big bet on the Model 3. Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) reported strong cloud revenue. Snap (SNAP) continued to tumble to fresh post-IPO lows, but other new issues had strong debuts. Stocks Edge Up On Fed, Big-Cap Techs The Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% for the week, briefly hitting an all-time high Friday afternoon, helped by Oracle as well as the ongoing strength of Apple (AAPL) and the FANG internet stocks.. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.1% and the S&P 500 index 0.2%, as the Fed raised rates but didn't signal a faster pace of hikes going forward.  The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from recent peaks on the "dovish rate hike," pressuring bank stocks such as the Dow's JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Homebuilders rallied on the lower yields, while steel stocks climbed on bullish earnings forecasts. Fed Hikes, But Doesn't Signal Faster Rate Rises The Federal Reserve gave financial markets what they wanted, hiking rates a quarter-point, as expected, but stuck to its plan for two more hikes this year and three next year. Policymakers' recent hawkish signals had markets bracing for a quicker ramp-up. The news was great for homebuilders like Lennar (LEN) and Toll Brothers (TOL), since it means that mortgage rates may stabilize for a time after their recent run-up, helping boost the spring selling season. Financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS), which had been pushing higher on hopes for faster rate hikes that can help lift net interest margins, took a breather after the Fed news.

Analysts described the deal as a defensive acquisition for Intel to compete against Nvidia (NVDA), which has been scoring numerous partnerships to supply the artificial-intelligence processing power for self-driving cars. Nvidia's latest partnerships are with auto parts supplier Bosch to bring self-driving cars to the masses and with truck maker Paccar (PCAR) to develop autonomous trucks.

With underwriter options, Tesla will likely raise $1.15 billion. That's less than some analysts had expected after CEO Elon Musk warned that the Model 3 would push cash levels "close to the edge." Tesla rose on the funding news after soaring on a report that the company will release a small SUV next year. Tesla shares rose 7.3% for the week. RELATED: Tesla Will Raise $1 Billion In Stock, Debt; Investors No Longer On 'Edge' Oracle Cloud Boom Fuels Earnings Oracle reported fiscal Q3 earnings that cruised past estimates as the software giant's transition to a cloud-based model picks up momentum. Oracle, which three years ago began a concerted push into cloud computing, said its software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service non-GAAP revenue jumped 85% to $1.1 billion, as total cloud revenue reached $1.2 billion, up 62%. Oracle's traditional software licensing business fell 16% as the company transitions. Oracle leapt 6% on Thursday, hitting an all-time intraday high. RELATED: Oracle Turns A Corner As Cloud Revenues Boom, Earnings Top Adobe Tops Q1 Views, Guides Higher Digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) posted better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter and gave Q2 targets ahead of forecasts. Adobe stock jumped to record high territory on the news. In Q1, Adobe earned 94 cents a share excluding items, up 42% year over year, on sales of $1.68 billion, up 22%. Analysts were looking for 87 cents and $1.65 billion. For Q2, Adobe guided analyst estimates slightly higher. Adobe shares soared to a record high Friday.

Outdoor apparel maker Canada Goose (GOOS) popped 26% in Thursday's debut and kept rising Friday. Oilfield services provider ProPetro (PUMP) priced low but rose 3.6% in its debut. The hope has been that the recent IPO of Snapchat operator Snap will lead to a burst of new issues. But after a strong IPO pricing at 17, a 44% first-day gain and a record high of 29.44 the next day, Snap shares have plunged to post-IPO lows, tumbling 11.5% for the week. RELATED: MuleSoft IPO Packs A Punch As Stock Pops On Market Debut Canada Goose Flies In Debut As Snap Digs Hole; Tech Unicorn Prices Late Oil Prices Stop Falling Crude oil prices rose 0.6% to $48.78 a barrel for the week after a big seven-session sell-off. The International Energy Agency said if OPEC keeps its production levels steady until June, the market would see a deficit of 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of the year. Right on cue, the Energy Information Administration reported a surprise 237,000-barrel drop in weekly U.S. crude stockpiles last week. Earlier, Saudi Arabia said it raised its crude output to 10.011 million barrels per day in February, up 2.7% from January, but still under the target agreed to under a production-cut deal.

But the airlines got a potential break after federal judges halted key provisions in President Trump's travel ban. In between, United raised its full-year capacity outlook. That gives travelers more options, but the expansion carries risks of overestimating demand and a competitive response from rival airlines. United last month said it would add service to 31 new destinations to serve areas that connect to its airport hubs. Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group (ALK) this week stepped up its offerings on the West Coast. United stock slid 7.7% for the week, while Delta lost 5.1% and American 2.9%.

AstraZeneca's Lynparza met its primary endpoint, hitting a median 19.1 months of progression-free survival vs. 5.5 months for patients on the placebo. In a similar trial, Tesaro's niraparib delayed reoccurrence of ovarian cancer for 21 months. A best-case review found Lynparza delayed ovarian cancer's return by a median 30.2 months. Meanwhile, Valeant Pharmaceuticals stock plunged to an eight-year low after William Ackman sold Pershing Square's entire stake in the ailing drugmaker. Pershing held 8% of Valeant, or about 27.2 million shares. Amgen announced its cholesterol drug Repatha trimmed the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death, but not as much as some had hoped. Amgen shares fell 6.4% Friday. Regeneron (REGN), Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Esperion (ESPR) also tumbled.

Despite political blowback for RyanCare from both moderate and conservative Republicans, and uncertainty over the bill's chances, a cloud remained over the hospital group.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run).

From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM.

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction.

It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not?

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

The Total Economic Impact of McAfee’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Solution –McAfee. Like many major infosec vendors, Intel Security has a data loss prevention software offering for enterprises concerned about potential exposures or leaks of corporate information. [Editor's note: Intel sold a majority stake in its security business to private equity firm TPG in September for $3.1 billion. The sale is expected to close in April, after which Intel Security will be renamed McAfee.] Intel Security's McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention is a complex suite consisting of four distinct data loss prevention (DLP) tools that can be deployed on hardware and virtual appliances. The DLP suite includes McAfee DLP Monitor, McAfee DLP Discover, McAfee DLP Endpoint and McAfee DLP Manager. Endpoint agents for McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention are deployed and managed through the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator, while the McAfee DLP Manager appliance acts as the central control hub for the full suite. McAfee DLP Monitor McAfee DLP Monitor is a network appliance-based tool for monitoring and controlling sensitive information that can be deployed using either Switched Port Analyzer ports or network taps. This DLP product, which can track and report on sensitive data in motion in real time, is a network appliance capable of detecting over 300 content types transiting over any TCP-based port and protocol. It can classify content at up to 200 Mbps. The appliance is available as either the hardware-based McAfee DLP 5500 appliance or as a VMware virtual machine. McAfee DLP Discover McAfee DLP Discover is a data at rest discovery tool capable of scanning and detecting over 300 content types in many different kinds of file repositories. Supported file types include Microsoft Office documents, multimedia files, source code, design files, archive files and encrypted files. It is capable of scanning common file repositories, including Common Internet File System, Network File System, FTP/FTP Secure, HTTP/HTTPS, Microsoft SharePoint and EMC Documentum. It's also capable of scanning Microsoft SQL, Oracle, DB2 and MySQL databases for sensitive information. This appliance-based tool is available as either the hardware-based McAfee DLP 5500 appliance or as a VMware virtual machine. McAfee DLP Endpoint McAfee DLP Endpoint is a data in use monitoring and control data loss prevention tool supporting Windows 7 SP1 and 8.x and Mac OS X 10.8.5 to 10.10 endpoints. This product is deployed and managed using McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO). It can be purchased separately from the McAfee DLP suite, thereby allowing smaller organizations already using McAfee ePO to field endpoint-only data loss prevention. McAfee DLP Endpoint has a variety of rules and policies to help protect sensitive data in use. Cloud-aware cloud protection rules block sensitive files from being synced to cloud services, such as Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Syncplicity and OneDrive. Application file access protection rules block access to sensitive files, through means such as Skype file transfer, Nero burning and iTunes syncs. Web protection rules now offer Google Chrome support, in addition to Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer (enhanced protected mode) support. McAfee DLP Manager The McAfee DLP Manager appliance is the central controller for the complete McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention suite, and it is the integration point for the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator server. While it can be used to manage select McAfee DLP tools, McAfee DLP Manager must be used with McAfee ePO to manage McAfee Endpoint. The DLP Manager allows organizations to manage up to 39 McAfee DLP components and to view all incidents generated by McAfee DLP components. Searches and reports for all McAfee DLP components can be generated through the DLP Manager. It also comes with a number of preconfigured policies to help manage McAfee DLP components. Summary McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention is designed to cover the data protection needs of a variety of enterprises; those needs include controls and policies for corporate data standards, regulatory compliance and protection against both insider threats and external attackers. The software suite is designed to scale easily from midsized organizations to large enterprises. It covers endpoint data in use, network data in transit and data at rest for several file types and databases. While McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention covers data generated and used by third-party cloud services, it does not cover mobile devices, like smartphones. Organizations interested in the McAfee DLP suite should contact the vendor or an authorized reseller for more information on pricing and licensing.  Next Steps The right DLP product depends on the type of job See how DLP can help your company protect its data Know these criteria before deciding on DLP This was last published in March 2017 Dig Deeper on Data Loss Prevention All News Get Started Evaluate Manage Problem Solve RSA Data Loss Prevention Suite: Product overview How serious are the flaws in St. Jude Medical's IoT medical devices?

(AP Photo/Olivier Fitoussi) ***ISRAEL OUT*** Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Jerusalem • As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. "In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more," said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. "Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye." VIDEOS TOP JOBS She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion's annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister's Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel's only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is "ripe for change." He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. "What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in," he said. Israel has long billed itself as "Startup Nation" for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. "This is far from a one-day or one-week story," Granoff said. "This is going to be a story for the next 10 years." Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google's more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. "The deal confirms Israel's global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies," said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. "The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups." There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. » Next page...

One representative from Intel at SXSW this week said the company hopes that President Donald Trump and the federal government will consider a new form of trade agreement, after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in January. “That’s something that we’re hoping for going forward: the good things that came out of the TPP, that trade and growth of market access and our ability to sell our products overseas,” said Norberto Salinas, senior counsel and director of government relations at Intel, during a panel about tech policy in the new administration. “The majority of our research and development is here, but 80 percent of sales are outside of the U.S.” Like many in the tech industry, Salinas also advocated for the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to temporarily employ foreign workers, typically in highly skilled jobs. Salinas said companies like Intel look to graduate students to find the next generation of innovators, but those who are from foreign countries may no longer want or be able to stay in the U.S., if Trump restricts H-1B visas. (Besides Trump, the H-1B program has other skeptics.) “If we discourage those students from coming into the United States, they’re going to end up in India, China, Canada,” Salinas said. “We also need to create a system where not only are our future innovators here on visas, but to keep them here as citizens.” Others on the panel with Salinas noted the importance of properly regulating privacy, particularly as more corporations implicitly control our personal information online as we shift more of our lives to the Web. Having a simple conversation is one example. “There are things I would say to a friend in my own home that I wouldn’t say in a crowded street, or the DMV,” said Jesse Blumenthal, the manager of technology and innovation work at the Charles Koch Institute. “As our privacy moves online, that conversation now takes place over a messaging app or a video chat. If we want to have the same association, we need to have strong privacy and encryption.” The same is true for developing industry standards about recording or relaying private information for things that connected devices in the home, car, and elsewhere, Salinas said. Creating standards that companies can or should follow is an ongoing conversation in other areas of developing technology—particularly in artificial intelligence. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has a division, the Standards Association, which focuses on developing policy recommendations, guidelines, and standards for various tech industries. The organization is currently working on them for artificial intelligence. These are standards that should have perhaps been made long ago, and now groups like IEEE are trying to catch up to the technology, said Konstantinos Karachalios, the managing director of the IEEE Standards Association. He spoke to a full audience at a discussion about ethically aligned artificial intelligence hosted by the University of Texas at Austin. “We’re almost late. Technology is advancing rapidly. Driverless cars are here, drones are flying around,” Karachalios said. “I’m worried about the algorithms that define our identity, what we’re able to do and what not. If we continue without anything, if we’re not transparent, not accountable, I think we are going into the scenario of digital slavery.” Overregulation can cause innovation to stagnate, said Derek Jinks, a professor at the UT School of Law—which underscores the importance of setting standards that can then be piecemealed into laws. The IEEE has published a first version of its recommendations for designing artificial intelligence ethically, but the conversation is ongoing and the group wants input from the general public, too, Karachalios said. Locally, the organization is working with groups like AI-Austin, a nonprofit focused on “practical and responsible” design of artificial intelligence. “What we’d like to do is create Austin as a hub” for artificial intelligence, said Kay Firth-Butterfield, the organization’s executive director. “We want to try innovative things for the benefit of our community. Once we’ve done that, we’d like to be a model for other cities, especially in the developing world.” David Holley is Xconomy's national correspondent based in Austin, TX.

In a statement, Intel says it plans to acquire Mobileye for $63.54 per share in cash. The equity value of the deal is $15.3 billion, while the enterprise value of the acquisition is $14.7 billion. "Mobileye brings the industry’s best automotive-grade computer vision and strong momentum with automakers and suppliers," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement. "Together, we can accelerate the future of autonomous driving with improved performance in a cloud-to-car solution at a lower cost for automakers.” Shares of Mobileye were up 31% in pre-market trading Monday. Intel shares were down 1.6%. Mobileye was founded in 1999, specializing in creating chips and software for autonomous vehicles, such as data analysis and mapping for self-driving systems. In an email to employees, Mobileye president and CEO Ziv Aviram and fellow co-founder Amnon Shashua said they will continue to run the company as they have previously. "An interesting journey is ahead," reads their email. "We always wanted to change the world – now we have better means of doing so." Intel says the deal will help accelerate innovation in the self-driving vehicle market, forecast to reach $70 billion by 2030. However, Intel is part of a crowded field of tech companies and automakers seeking to get their autonomous vehicles and self-driving systems on the road. Last month, Ford announced it would invest $1 billion over five years into startup Argo AI, with a plan to deliver their first autonomous car by 2021. Meanwhile, Google and Uber have struck deals with Fiat and Volvo, respectively, to create self-driving vehicles.    Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.

Based on the latest generation of HPE Apollo 6000 systems, the new supercomputer will drive the digitalization of BASF's worldwide research. "The new supercomputer will promote the application and development of complex modeling and simulation approaches, opening up completely new avenues for our research at BASF," said Dr. Martin Brudermueller, Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF. "The supercomputer was designed and developed jointly by experts from HPE and BASF to precisely meet our needs." The new system will make it possible to answer complex questions and greatly reduce the time required to obtain results from several months to days across all research areas. As part of BASF's digitalization strategy, the company plans to significantly expand its capabilities to run virtual experiments with the supercomputer. In addition, it will help BASF reduce time to market and costs by, for example, simulating processes on catalyst surfaces more precisely or accelerating the design of new polymers with pre-defined properties. "In today's data-driven economy, high performance computing plays a pivotal role in driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence," said Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "We expect this supercomputer to help BASF perform prodigious calculations at lightning fast speeds, resulting in a broad range of innovations to solve new problems and advance our world." With the help of Intel® Xeon® processors, high-bandwidth, low-latency Intel® Omni-Path Fabric and HPE management software, the supercomputer acts as a single system with an effective performance of more than 1 Petaflop (1 Petaflop equals one quadrillion floating point operations per second). With this system architecture, a multitude of nodes can work simultaneously on highly complex tasks, dramatically reducing the processing time. "Customers are always looking for systems that deliver the best performance at the best total cost of ownership," said Barry Davis, General Manager, Accelerated Workload Group, Intel. "Intel® Omni-Path Architecture is specifically designed to deliver outstanding performance while scaling cost-effectively from entry-level high performance computing clusters to larger clusters with 10,000 nodes or more -- offering a significant advantage on both fronts." Developed and built by HPE, the new supercomputer will consist of several hundred computer nodes. The supercomputer will also leverage HPE Apollo Systems to give customers simplified administration efficiencies and flexibility to match their solutions to the workload and lower their total cost of ownership.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

The better they sell, the more competitive the market. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:17 Chorltonwheelie says: Wow! So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules).

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

By Sun Motors and AP 17th March 2017, 11:15 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments AS THE world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the hub of future motoring. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. EPA 2 Israel is pushing to be a hub for autonomous vehicle innovation – and Intel’s purchase of Mobileye is at the forefront of the movement Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from censors to cyber-security to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. EPA 2 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (L), Intel CEO Brian Krzanich (C) and the co-founder and CTO of Mobileye, Ziv Aviram (R) have closely discussed Israel’s future potential in the autonomous car industry General Motors has already opened a research centre in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitisation of transportation, and digitisation is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said.   More Motors News BACK IN THE USA BBC America to launch US version of Top Gear MORBID DEAL Japan encourages elderly drivers off their roads... with FUNERAL discounts ROAD SAFETY Why 90 per cent of drivers want UK licensing tests changed LUXURY FARCE Range Rover Velar prices bumped up for British customers, while US gets cheaper deal HANDBRAKE TURN Public enquiry launched: Can Top Gear track be saved from demolition?

Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cyber-security, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centres that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” Volkswagen unveils the fully electric self-driving concept car Sedric at the Geneva Motor Show The Sun Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular KIM BOMB UN Kim Jong-Un vows to reduce US 'to ashes' with nukes if Donald Trump fires 'a single bullet' at North Korea News Exclusive HAMSTER'S 2ND HORROR CRASH Grand Tour host Richard Hammond is badly hurt in motorbike crash 11 years after almost dying in… TV & Showbiz SOME SWIM WRONG This woman stuns the web after showing off her bikini... but can YOU spot what's wrong with it?

New MacBook Pro models were released in October 2016, but we're already looking ahead to the next update of the MacBook Pro for 2017. In this article we round up and analyse all the rumours related to the new MacBook Pro 2017 - its release date, specs, design, likely pricing and new features. If you're interested in the latest MacBook Pro update, we also discuss the announcements and launch details from October 2016, and you can read more here: New MacBook Pro 2016 review. This article was updated on 17 March with news that hackers have managed to take over control of a Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. Related: Mac buying guide | Best cheap MacBook Pro deals UK When is the MacBook Pro 2017 UK release date?' The current lineup of MacBook Pro models was introduced in October 2016. Apple doesn't tend to update its Macs more often than once a year, so it isn’t likely that Apple will update the range before October 2017, and when it does Apple may only refresh part of the range. Competing pro laptops coming from Dell and HP will offer newer Kaby Lake Intel processors long before October 2017, including the Dell Precision 5520 which is available now. For business people looking for a stylish laptop this may not matter, but for creatives looking for a new Mac a move away from Apple may start to look attractive if Apple makes them wait too long. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted an update to the entire range in 2017. In October 2016 he told clients that he expected Apple to launch updated MacBooks Pros in the second half of 2017 including support for 32GB of RAM, with the proviso that Intel would launch the required processors in time. However, at that time he referenced Cannonlake processors, in February 2017 he published a new note claiming that the new MacBook Pro models will feature Kaby Lake processors and that the 13in and 15in versions of the MacBook Pro will see an update towards the end of 2017, with mass production of these models beginning in the third quarter of 2017. However, those hoping for a 32GB RAM update to the 15in MacBook Pro model in 2017 may be disappointed. The high-end MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM will not enter mass production until the fourth quarter of 2017 so it may not launch not expected until 2018. (Incidentally the Dell Precision 5520 does have a 32GB RAM configuration). How much will the 2017 MacBook Pro cost in the UK? Shortly after Apple announced the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in October 2016, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published a note to clients indicating that he expects Apple to drop prices in subsequent updates to the range. He observed that Apple tends to overprice new generations of Mac before gradually lowering prices in the following year. The pricing for the 2016 13in and 15in new MacBook Pro models begins at £1,749/$1,799 for a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and starts at $2,399/£2,349 for the 15in model. The most expensive MacBook Pro now costs £2,699/$2,799. The version of the MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar costs from $1,499/£1,449. This is the model most likely to see a price drop, potentially coinciding with an update to the 12in MacBook and the discontinuation of the MacBook Air. Processor: Will the new MacBook Pro have a Kaby Lake, Cannonlake or Apple designed processor? When they launched in October 2016 the new range of MacBook Pro models ran on Intel’s Skylake processors, the processor microarchitecture that first launched in August 2015 as a successor to Broadwell. This was a disappointment to some as the Skylake chips can only support up to 16GB of RAM (to offer a 32GB option Apple would need to use battery-hungry desktop-class RAM). Given that the MacBook Pro is pitched as a professional machine there have been calls for the next model to offer the option of 32GB RAM and naturally attention has turned to Intel’s roadmap for clues as to what processor might make this update feasible. Back in October 2016 Apple analyst Kuo had suggested that the MacBook Pro could adopt Intel’s Cannonlake processors, or should that not appear in time, Intel’s Coffee Lake processors (although that would limit the models to 16GB RAM). However, it appears that the usually accurate analyst had his chips somewhat muddled, as there are apparently no plans to design MacBook Pro-class Cannonlake chips, and Coffee Lake is not scheduled until 2018. In a note published in January 2017 Kuo predicted that the new MacBook Pro line up would feature Kaby Lake chips. Kaby Lake is the successor to Skylake. That line of processors debuted in the spring of 2016, but the processors suitable for future MacBook Pros (as suggested by beta code in macOS Sierra 10.12.4) weren’t announced until the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show. This beta code discovered in Sierra by Pike's Universum references the following Kaby Lake processors: The 13in MacBook Pro could gain the i7-7660U 2.5 GHz Kaby Lake chip; The 13in MacBook Pro with Touch bar could gain the Kaby Lake 3.1 GHz i5-7267U, 3.3 GHz i5-7287U, and 3.5 GHz i7-7567U processors; The 15in MacBook Pro could gain i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz, i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz, and i7-7920 3.1 GHz Kaby Lake processors. These new Kaby Lake processors offer better power efficiency and more advanced on-board GPU capabilities, but the processor power doesn’t see a marked increase. Dell's Precision 5520 laptop includes Kaby Lake chips and is directly comparable to the MacBook Pro. There's another possibility, Apple could move away from Intel chips and look at what's on offer from AMD. According to an Archtosh report, AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel’s i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. We think such a transition is unlikley however, given the fact that Apple had to rewrite the operating system to prepare for the Intel switch. Perhaps more likely is the idea that Apple will design its own chips (although we think all rumours about this pointed to the processor that powers the Touch Bar in the 2016 MacBook Pro. Will the new MacBook Pro 2017 have an Apple designed processor? The chip that powers the Touch Bar in the MacBook Pro may not be the only low power chip coming from Apple. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has predicted that the 2017 MacBook Pro will feature an Apple-designed chip to handle simple tasks such as email and updates while the laptop is asleep, citing "people familiar with the matter". "The chip, which went into development [in 2016], is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard's Touch Bar feature," Gurman writes. "The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer's low-power mode functionality." By building a dedicated low-power processor, Apple could reduce battery consumption for the 2017 MacBook Pro. RAM: Will the new MacBook Pro 2017 have 32GB RAM? As we mention above, a big disappointment with the 2016 MacBook Pro line up was the RAM limitations, with the models maxing out at 16GB RAM. Pro customers, such as video editors, were so disillusioned with the 2016 update that in November 2016 Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller spoke out in defence of Apple’s decision not to offer more RAM, saying that to offer more RAM would be detrimental to battery life because higher amounts of RAM would require a power-hungry memory controller unsuitable for use in portable machines. Schiller said: "To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.” The problem lies with the Intel Skylake CPUs used in Apple's MacBook Pro. These processors support up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM at 2133MHz. There are processors capable of addressing more than 16GB of memory, but these rely on less efficient DDR4 RAM and are usually deployed in desktops because they can be plugged into mains power. Understandably Apple does not wish to hinder the battery life of its laptops in this way.   Schiller has also indicated that using 32GB of RAM would require a different logic board design that would limit space for other components, including the battery. In an email to MacDaddy’s Ben Slaney, Schiller wrote: “To support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life.” So, as you can see, the calls for a 32GB RAM version of the MacBook Pro are loud enough for Apple to make a statement regarding it, but this doesn’t mean that a RAM update is immanent. A Kaby Lake processor upgrade for the MacBook Pro will not increase in the RAM cap of 16GB because the Kaby Lake processor doesn’t support LPDDR4 RAM and Apple is not expected to engineer a new RAM controller that does any time soon. An Intel processor capable of supporting LPDDR4 RAM isn't expected before 2018. Kuo still has some hope however, he predicts that Apple will start to manufacture a 15in MacBook Pro with 32GB RAM in the fourth quarter. And he thinks that Apple will adopt desktop RAM due in order to do so. Dell's Precision 5520 laptop is directly comparable to the MacBook Pro and has a 32GB RAM build-to-order configuration.  Amid calls for Apple to update the MacBook Pro, which some feel is hampered by its standard 8GB RAM (upgradable to just 16GB), Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that Apple still considers the professional creative market to be important. Comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the separation between 'creative' and 'professional' in Cook's comments could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer. Regarding Cook's comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He considers that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Graphics: What graphics card will the new MacBook Pro 2017 offer? The 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar currently offers Intel Iris Graphics 540 while the 13in model with Touch Bar offers Intel Iris Graphics 550. The 15in model offers a duel graphics card set up, with the Radeon Pro 450, or a Radeon Pro 455, alongside the Intel HD Graphics 530. The Radeon Pro 400 series launched in October, so they were new graphics processors at the time the Macs launched. The Radeon RX 500 series is expected to launch this year and could be destined for the new MacBook Pro models. Screen: What improvements might Apple make to the screen on the new MacBook Pro? The current model has an impressive 4K screen but this is still few pixels than some of the competition. The 2016 MacBook Pro can output the full DCI P3 colour space used for films for digital cinema output, however, as our colleague on Digital Arts notes in his review: "It’s the Adobe RGB colour space that really matters as this is what’s used internally by tools from Photoshop to Illustrator to Premiere Pro – and again here the MBP is lacking. In our tests with a DataColor Spyder5Elite colorimeter, we found that the MacBook Pro’s screen can output 91 percent of the colours in the Adobe RGB." In their tests Dell’s Precision 5510 and the Wacom MobileStudio Pro could output 91 percent of the colours in the Adobe RGB. In the next version of the MacBook Pro we'd like to see an improvement here. Another desirable addition to the screen would be touchscreen capabilities, something much of the competition also shares. While Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs said that he felt that touch screens were a bad idea (because they would make your arm ache) there is some value in being able to touch a screen rather than use a mouse or track pad when you are in cramped conditions, such as those in which our colleague on Digital Arts wrote his review. Battery: Is 10 hours battery life enough for the new MacBook Pro? With Apple pointing to battery life as the reason it won’t offer more RAM in the MacBook Pro you might be wondering whether there is room for improvements to battery life in the next model, or if battery life could (or should) suffer if Apple is to offer a truly pro-level machine. The 2016 machine offers 10-hours of battery life, as did earlier models. There was some question about the accuracy of this claim earlier in 2017 when Consumer Reports tested the battery life and found that is was less. However, Consumer Reports battery life tests had been influenced by a bug in Safari’s developer mode that consumers wouldn’t be using. Ports: Could the new MacBook Pro lose the headphone jack? When Apple launched the new MacBook Pro many of the familiar ports disappeared replaced by USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. The headphone jack remained despite being lost from the iPhone and iPad. Will it remain in the next version of the MacBook Pro? Possibly, although it seems likely that Apple will swap it for Lightning or another Thunderbolt 3 port in the future. Touch Bar: Will Apple improve the Touch Bar? A report on BGN outlines that Hackers at the Pwn2Own competition have exploited a security hole in Safari and take over the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar gaining root control of the MacOS on a MacBook Pro. The hackers have sent details of the attack to Apple so the company should be working on patching it now. When the Touch Bar first launched it was limited to Apple applications, however over the months it has gained functionality with many other apps including Spotify and Photoshop, and it now offers additional functionality for Microsoft Office features. You can expect more software to offer Touch Bar support in the future. Colour: Who wants a Gold MacBook Pro? The MacBook Pro series currently comes in two colour finishes: silver and Space Grey, while the MacBook series is available in Gold and Rose Gold as well. It the MacBook Pro ever likely to adopt the gold colour? We think that Apple will continue to offer gold as an option on it’s consumer focused laptops, but it will keep the more business-like silver and grey for the professional machines.

Based on the latest generation of HPE Apollo 6000 systems, the new supercomputer will drive the digitalization of BASF's worldwide research. "The new supercomputer will promote the application and development of complex modeling and simulation approaches, opening up completely new avenues for our research at BASF," said Dr. Martin Brudermueller, Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF. "The supercomputer was designed and developed jointly by experts from HPE and BASF to precisely meet our needs." The new system will make it possible to answer complex questions and greatly reduce the time required to obtain results from several months to days across all research areas. As part of BASF's digitalization strategy, the company plans to significantly expand its capabilities to run virtual experiments with the supercomputer. In addition, it will help BASF reduce time to market and costs by, for example, simulating processes on catalyst surfaces more precisely or accelerating the design of new polymers with pre-defined properties. "In today's data-driven economy, high performance computing plays a pivotal role in driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence," said Meg Whitman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "We expect this supercomputer to help BASF perform prodigious calculations at lightning fast speeds, resulting in a broad range of innovations to solve new problems and advance our world." With the help of Intel® Xeon® processors, high-bandwidth, low-latency Intel® Omni-Path Fabric and HPE management software, the supercomputer acts as a single system with an effective performance of more than 1 Petaflop (1 Petaflop equals one quadrillion floating point operations per second). With this system architecture, a multitude of nodes can work simultaneously on highly complex tasks, dramatically reducing the processing time. "Customers are always looking for systems that deliver the best performance at the best total cost of ownership," said Barry Davis, General Manager, Accelerated Workload Group, Intel. "Intel® Omni-Path Architecture is specifically designed to deliver outstanding performance while scaling cost-effectively from entry-level high performance computing clusters to larger clusters with 10,000 nodes or more -- offering a significant advantage on both fronts." Developed and built by HPE, the new supercomputer will consist of several hundred computer nodes. The supercomputer will also leverage HPE Apollo Systems to give customers simplified administration efficiencies and flexibility to match their solutions to the workload and lower their total cost of ownership.

It's OK now even if it's not the fastest gaming processor ever—but the future gets tricky. Peter Bright - Mar 17, 2017 11:00 am UTC Enlarge / What's all this gaming blather about Ryzen? Let us explain. Mark Walton reader comments 233 Share this story The response to AMD's Ryzen processors with their new Zen core has been more than a little uneven. Eight cores and 16 threads for under $500 means that they're unambiguously strong across a wide range of workloads; compute-bound tasks like compiling software and compressing video cry out for cores, and AMD's pricing makes Ryzen very compelling indeed. Further ReadingAMD’s moment of Zen: Finally, an architecture that can compete But gaming performance has caused more dissatisfaction. AMD promised a substantial improvement in instructions per cycle (IPC), and the general expectation was that Ryzen would be within striking distance of Intel's Broadwell core. Although Broadwell is now several years old—it first hit the market way back in September 2014—the comparison was relevant. Intel's high-core-count processors—both the High End Desktop parts, with six, eight, or 10 cores, and the various Xeon processors for multisocket servers—are all still using Broadwell cores. Realistically, nobody should have expected Ryzen to be king of the hill when it comes to gaming. We know that Broadwell isn't, after all; Intel's Skylake and Kaby Lake parts both beat Broadwell in a wide range of games. This is the case even though Skylake and Kaby Lake are limited to four cores and eight threads; for many or most games, high IPC and high clock speeds are the key to top performance, and that's precisely what Kaby Lake delivers. In spite of this, reading the various reviews around the Web—and comment threads, tweets, and reddit posts—one gets the feeling that many were hoping or expecting Ryzen to somehow beat Intel across the board, and there's a prevailing narrative that Ryzen is in some sense a bad gaming chip. But this argument is often paired with the claim that some kind of non-specific "optimization" is going to salvage the processor's performance, that AMD fans just need to keep the faith for a few months, and that soon Ryzen's full power will be revealed. Both parts of this reaction are more than a little flawed. It’s actually a really good gaming processor It's true that Ryzen's gaming performance doesn't match Intel CPUS. If your interest is solely and exclusively gaming performance, then Intel's Kaby Lake i7-7700K is the best chip on the market, and its price is in the same ballpark as the cheapest Ryzen, the 1700. Not even the top-end 1800X can beat the 7700K. But the 7700K is the fastest all-round gaming processor on the market today. Being "not as fast as the 7700K" doesn't make a processor "bad" for games. It just means it's not quite as fast as literally the fastest gaming processor ever made. For the most part, the differences between the processors are academic. In almost every case, the difference between the Ryzen and the Kaby Lake is that one has a slightly lower, but still very playable, framerate than the other. If benchmarks were showing that the Intel chips are consistently above, say, 60 frames per second while the AMD chips were consistently below, then, certainly, a good argument could be made that the Intel processor will provide a smooth gaming experience where the AMD one won't. But generally, that's not the case. Even where the gap is quite substantial, such as Rise of the Tomb Raider, where we saw 135fps on both the Kaby Lake i7-7700K and the (eight-core/16-thread) Broadwell-E i7-6900K, the 1800X managed 110fps. That speed is still comfortably playable. Tech Report saw even more extreme differences in Doom in OpenGL mode; 170fps for the 7700K, just 123fps for the 1800X; Tech Report doesn't include the 6900K, but the 10-core/20-thread 6950K achieves 156fps. The 1800X certainly gives up some fps, but it remains perfectly playable. Switch to the newer Vulkan API instead of OpenGL and the difference evaporates away, with both the 7700K and the 1800X averaging 165fps. The 6950X, for what it's worth, is slightly behind at 161fps. This is why we concluded that the 1800X was a very solid alternative to the Broadwell-E 6900X—it offers very comparable performance at less than half the price. Even for gaming, it remains a worthy contender: Ryzen is "good enough that you may well be willing to take the performance hit in some programs so that you can enjoy the big wins in others." That's all well and good for the games of today, but what about the games of the future? As games become more demanding, there may become a point at which the 7700K is just at the threshold of "playable framerates" and the 1800X falls short. Doesn't that make the 1800X a bad buy? Predicting the future is an inexact science, and it's impossible to say for certain how games of the future will behave. We can, though, make some educated guesses while recognizing that Ryzen has some features that make it a little unusual. The often made argument that software of today isn't "optimized" for Ryzen isn't quite right. Not because software is, in fact, optimized for Ryzen, but because it assumes a model of software optimization that doesn't really correspond to real software. Sure, games aren't optimized for Ryzen, but equally, they're not really optimized for Broadwell, Skylake, or Kaby Lake. They're just optimized in general to run faster across the board. But there is nonetheless optimization and improvement to be done. Page: 1 2 3 Next → Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

The company has just bought Mobileye, a pioneer in the autonomous driving sector, for a huge $15bn. See related  Tesla Autopilot review: We test Elon Musk’s autonomous tech in the UK BMW is putting IBM's Watson AI in the passenger seat You may not have heard of Mobileye – like many other automotive companies, their products are sourced by car makers and left unbranded. But since its creation in 1999, the Israeli company has become a leader in the autonomous sector. According to the Financial Times, its chips and cameras are installed in 15m vehicles, the company is in partnership with 25 automakers, and it has a 80% market share. When you see those figures, Intel’s acquisition makes a lot more sense. So why is Intel buying Mobileye? Mobileye might seem like a great company, but why is Intel buying it rather than, say, Mercedes-Benz? The answer is pretty simple. While car makers may label everything as their own, the truth is that much of the technology you see on the road today is developed by third party companies – including autonomous tech. And now, as growth in the smartphone and computer market slows, chip makers believe that driverless cars offer a new revenue stream. When you look at the amount of cars fitted with it, and the technology it’s using, there’s clearly huge scope for growth, and therefore a huge market for a chip maker like Intel. However, by buying Mobileye – a company which makes everything but chips for driverless vehicles – Intel can now offer a complete solution for car makers looking to buy driverless tech. Despite the high asking price, Intel is well aware of how much money it can make. In a speech last year, Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich said, “Together, we expect to be the global leader in autonomous driving, and we see this market as growing to an over $70bn TAM [total addressable market] by 2030.” Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, told the BBC. “This is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities". This isn’t a new trend either. For the last few years, nVidia has been hugely involved in the driverless tech market, while last year Qualcomm bought NXP for $47bn and Samsung bought Harman for $8bn.

Intel VP Jun He and Imec CEO Luc Van den hove during their speeches focused on the importance of Moore's Law - the ability to cram more transistors on a single chip - in the IC industry development. He claimed Moore's Law is the cornerstone on which the semiconductor revolution has been based. Since ICs become an integral part of people's lives, from PCs and mobile phones to data storage devices and the automotive industry, the chipmaking industry's ability to extend the Moore's Law is critically needed, He said. Van den hove pointed out that the industry "must" explore ways to keep the Moore's Law moving forward with innovations, as it is no longer about geometric scaling. FinFET transistor technology has extended the Moore's Law beyond 28nm, while extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technology is set to be ready to enable a full 7nm node, Van den hove indicated. The Moore's Law concept has been reshaped to some extent, Van den hove said. The complexity of semiconductor wafer designs is increasing, while transistors continue to shink in size. The trend toward 3D-chip manufacturing and design is already inevitable, Van den hove said. TEL CTO Sekiguchi Akihisa remarked that the efficiency of EUV light sources has to be enhanced through collaboration between companies. An ecosystem should be established to motivate cross-industry collaboration, said Akihisa, who urged China- and Japan-based companies to work together to accelerate EUV. Lam Research CEO Martin Anstice in his speech titled "Collaborating for Success" expressed optimism about chip demand for emerging technologies in the fields of Big Data, IoT, robotics, AI, AR and VR. Anstice also believes that the semiconductor market still has huge room for growth since chip demand has not reached its peak in the high performance computing and mass storage device fields. In addition, the availability of EUV technology will further push forward the development of the semiconductor industry, according to Anstice. And through 96 layers to 128-layer 3D NAND, the IC industry development will continue to move forward. Lam Research has stepped up its investment in China, said Anstice. The company now has more than 20 projects implemented at customer sites with 4,000 units of equipment already installed at fabs locally, Anstice indicated. China will be the main driving force behind the world's chip industry growth over the next six years, according to ASE COO Tien Wu. China will expand its fabless IC design sector's global presence to account for 42% of the worldwide IC design industry output value in the foreseeable future, said Wu. China is also looking to expand its homegrown IC foundry and IDM sectors, which will account for 25% and 20%, respectively, of the worldwide industry output value, Wu indicated. The booming IC industry in China will definitely benefit fab toolmakers and materials suppliers, Wu added. ASML president and CEO Peter Wennink suggested that technology and talent remain key elements enabling China's IC industry to catch up with its bigger international peers. Wennink disclosed ASML is looking to work more closely with China-based companies with its R&D centers in Shenzhen and Beijing. ASML also has plans to help the country develop a talent pool with a local center for training and education.

Monday's deal, the largest ever in Israel's tech sector, could help boost trade despite the fact no commercial cars are assembled in the country. The self-styled "startup nation" has no real tradition of auto manufacturing: an ignoble previous stint in the 1960s and 70s produced the fibreglass Sussita car, parts of which, according to legend, were edible for camels. But the rise of new technology including driverless cars has opened space for the tech-savvy country to excel. In 2013, Google paid more than $1 billion (900 million euros) for Waze, an Israeli crowd-sourced app that plots the quickest journeys in real time, followed by Monday's $15 billion Mobileye deal. The company makes advanced driver assistance and accident avoidance systems for car manufacturers, and has already collaborated with Intel and BMW on self-driving car technology. It was founded in 1999 but Yossi Vardi -- considered one of the fathers of Israel's high-tech startup scene -- said the automobile industry's growth in Israel really began in 2007 when General Motors established a research and development centre. "It surprised everybody that a company like General Motors would go to Israel to source innovation and technology." In the last three years, Vardi said, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo and others have followed suit. Most Israeli companies in the field don't involve production, but ways to make driving more efficient. Among them are Otonomo, which provides in-depth data on car usage; Argus, one of the market leaders in protecting cars from cyber hacking; and VocalZoom, dubbed "Siri for cars." Elan Zivotofsky, general partner at the OurCrowd equity platform that invests in a number of companies working on autonomous cars, compared it to smartphones, laptops and other sectors where Israeli technology is heavily used but the final products are still made elsewhere. "Israel is not going to be in the business of building cars," he said. "Israel is in the business of building some of the most important core elements that will enable autonomous driving." - 'Doors will open' - Vardi said the country's military experience, with some of the world's most advanced monitoring, laser-guiding and other technologies, place it in a good position. "When you drive a car, you cannot stop the car and wait 15 minutes for the computer to process. It has to be immediate," Vardi said. "This kind of talent you find in the military -- in airplanes etc." The impact of Mobileye could be significant, said Yaniv Feldman, editor-in-chief of the Israeli Geektime tech blog. There are dozens of companies in the sector and Feldman reckons Israel is already one of the leading players in autonomous driving behind the United States and China. In 2016, around $70 million was invested in automotive tech in Israel, he said, but that will increase by "somewhere between 25 to 40 percent." "We will probably start seeing much more activity in the space and investor interest rising," he told AFP. None of the other companies were as advanced as Mobileye, though, he added. Aquarius Engines, an Israeli firm that claims to have developed a radically improved combustion engine, is currently seeking $10 million in a second round of funding. Chairman Gal Fridman said they had already noticed a change. "Since Mobileye happened, our phone is ringing all the time," he told AFP. "Until now, when I came and told (car companies) I was an Israeli developing an engine, it was a bit odd as the country has no history of automobiles," he said. "Now, after Waze and Mobileye, we have more credibility, I think, and doors will open easier."

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it?

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. In this Tuesday, 14 March 2017 photo, from left: co-founder and CTO of Mobileye Prof. Amnon Shashua, Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and the co-founder and CTO of Mobileye, Ziv Aviram, attend a press conference at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem.As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. (AP Photo/Olivier Fitoussi) ***ISRAEL OUT*** "In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more," said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. "Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye." She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion's annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister's Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel's only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is "ripe for change." He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. "What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in," he said. Israel has long billed itself as "Startup Nation" for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. "This is far from a one-day or one-week story," Granoff said. "This is going to be a story for the next 10 years." Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google's more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. "The deal confirms Israel's global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies," said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. "The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups." There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel's autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. "This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak," he said. Share or comment on this article e-mail 43 shares Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules).

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 23:50 MacPoedel says: I also have a first gen Core i7 (a Core i7 860, you probably have a Core i7 920 considering the P6 motherboard and clockspeeds), OC’d to 3,8GHz and with 1800MHz RAM. It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 18:51 waltC says: Just as was true for the original Athlon, it will take a bit of time for game developers to optimize for Ryzen and for the proper Ryzen compilers to make the developer circuit. In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (third from left) meets with Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich (to his left) and Mobileye founders Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram , respectively first left and first right; (Courtesy: Haim Zach, GPO) Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. This image provided by Google shows a very early version of Google’s prototype self-driving car. The two-seater won’t be sold publicly, but Google on Tuesday, May 27, 2014 said it hopes by this time next year, 100 prototypes will be on public roads. (photo credit: AP Photo/Google) He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of elite technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. Former US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro takes a ride in Israeli MobilEye’s self-driving car (YouTube screen capture) “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. As vehicles go high-tech, Israel aims to be in the driving seat. Image of a self-driving car (Courtesy Intel) “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

Microsoft Bans Windows 7 from Updating on Kaby Lake and Ryzen Processors GO Users getting unsupported hardware error and told to upgrade Mar 17, 2017 07:34 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft has already warned that the latest-generation processors would only work on Windows 10, and now it turns out the company has made one big step towards forcing users of older operating systems to upgrade their PCs should they want to take advantage of the new chips. Devices featuring Intel’s Kaby Lake or AMD’s Ryzen processors and powered by Windows 7 are now getting an error that explains an upgrade to Windows 10 is necessary for getting more updates. Microsoft details the error in documentation published on its support page, saying that users trying to update Windows 7 on a system running on the latest chips developed by Intel and AMD could get this message: “Unsupported Hardware. Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” Additionally, another message is displayed in the Windows Update window: “Windows could not search for new updates. An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error.” Upgrade to Windows 10, Microsoft says Microsoft then puts it simply and explains that installing Windows 10 on these computers is the only option, as Windows 7 is no longer supported on the latest generation chips. “This error occurs because new processor generations require the latest Windows version for support. Because of how this support policy is implemented, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update,” it says. The only problem with this new restriction is that Windows 7 continues to be the world’s number one desktop operating system with nearly 50 percent of the PCs out there still running it. Windows 10, on the other hand, is getting close to 25 percent. Although this decision to force users to upgrade to Windows 10 could boost adoption of the latest operating system, it can also backfire quickly against Microsoft, as not only that some users might refuse to upgrade but they could also switch to Linux and give up on Windows completely. Criticism for this decision is growing these days, so it remains to be seen how many Windows 7 users are willing to upgrade to Windows 10 and install the new-generation chips. #Microsoft#Windows 10#Windows 7#Kaby Lake#AMD Ryzen subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Could Launch a $1,000 Windows 10 Laptop Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15060, RTM Now Imminent Windows 10 UAC Loophole Can Be Used to Infect Systems with Malware After Windows Vista, Microsoft's Also Retiring Office 2007 Later This Year Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15063 for PC and Mobile YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening New Instagram Update Allows Users to Save Live Videos Dutch Police Buys Unnecessary Microsoft Office Licenses by Mistake… Twice Google Releases Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta 2 for Nexus and Pixel Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install    Windows 10 is required for the latest-generation chips New Apps Hotel Management System: Keep all the data associated with your hotel in one place for more efficient management and quick access with this comprehensive application Sonos Controller: A versatile and useful application that enables you to remotely control your music players and play your favorite songs in all rooms Web Log Suite: Web server log analyzer made to generate detailed reports with visitor statistics and which has support for spider auto-detect, advanced filters, FTP, HTTP or ODBC protocols Web Log Explorer Lite: A powerful and dependable application that allows you to seamlessly perform log file analysis in order to extract detailed information Wireless Workbench: Conveniently manage the network components and monitor their activity in an easy to understand RF medium using this straightforward application Par2MultiChecker Ultimate Edition: Verify and repair PAR2 and other file types in a simple manner with the help of this easy-to-use but comprehensive piece of software Lotto-Experte fur EuroJackpot: Analyze your odds of winning the lottery based on statistical operations used on databases of real number extractions with this application Reader comments Quick Tip: Block Windows 10 Ads with These 2 Simple Settings more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

(AP Photo/Olivier Fitoussi) ***ISRAEL OUT*** JERUSALEM (AP) — As the world moves toward an era of self-driving cars, Israel is positioning itself to be the Detroit of the future. The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel's more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. "In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more," said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. "Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye." She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion's annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister's Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel's only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is "ripe for change." He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. "What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in," he said. Israel has long billed itself as "Startup Nation" for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. "This is far from a one-day or one-week story," Granoff said. "This is going to be a story for the next 10 years." Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google's more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker's autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. "The deal confirms Israel's global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies," said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. "The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups." There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren't certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel's autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. "This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak," he said. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. The success of Oklahoma’s #SoonerSquad17 means there are going to be constant comparisons by OU fans for the upcoming classes. We’re already seeing that in 2018 at the quarterback position. Freshman quarterback Chris Robison was seemingly living in Norman after his commitment in June 2015. This time around? It’s not so easy for Newbury Park (Calif.) High quarterback Cameron Rising. http://www.scout.com/player/203152-cameron-rising?s=73 Rising, a Scout 100 prospect ranked No. 51 in the Scout 100, will, however, indeed be heading back to Norman for the spring game. “We will be out there again,” said Nicko Rising, Cameron’s father. “April 6 – we’re flying out to Dallas. We will be there.” Rising will drive to Ada from Dallas where they have family before making the hour-drive and taking a two-day visit to OU on Friday and the spring game Saturday. The visit is going to be crucial because there are whispers of Rising looking around and perhaps considering other schools. The Rising family is not denying the visits, but as of now, it doesn’t feel like it has anything to do with any type of falling out with the Sooners. When Rising committed to OU back in August, he didn’t have an offer from Oregon. He didn’t have an offer from Texas. Now he does. The family visited Oregon last month and intends to visit Austin the week after OU’s spring game. A lot has been made about Nicko Rising and his relationship with Texas coach Tom Herman. Nicko said perhaps too much has been talked about in that regard as they were two years apart back at Cal Lutheran although there is some familiarity there. Nicko said he likes the way Herman interacts with his players. He makes them work hard, but he’s also a good motivator. OU fans are no doubt a bit concerned about their potential future five-star commitment visiting other schools, but it’s not a surprise to offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley. Nicko said Cameron and Riley had a conversation about what’s going on. No secrets going on here. “Cameron and Lincoln had a long discussion, and Lincoln came away confident on Cameron’s commitment,” Nicko Rising said. “He doesn’t have a problem with it.” It’s important Rising and Riley had that type of conversation. It was less than two months ago where Riley praised Robison for his loyalty to OU during the entire recruiting process. There are positions where you can see things flip-flop and can see some musical chairs, but quarterback isn’t one of them as Riley pointed out at OU’s signing day press conference. “That position is unique. It’s different,” Riley said. “The recruiting of quarterbacks almost has its own set of rules and standards. It’s unlike any other position that you normally only take one. There’s normally only one on the field. “The spots tend to go maybe a little bit quicker. Once a couple of dominoes start to fall it goes quickly. That’s a conversation we have with quarterbacks before they commit here. That if there’s any hesitation or if they’re not 100 percent sold, then don’t commit. We don’t want you to because when you do, then we’re done and you need to be done too.” The goal, it would appear, is for Rising to reach that “done” status following these trips. The Rising family made a cross-country field trip last summer, visiting a number of schools. That’s not expected to be the case here. Nicko said the visits to Oklahoma and Texas are the only ones on the docket. “After these trips, I do hope he knows,” Nicko Rising said. “I think that’s the plan. He knows what it means to be a quarterback commit. He knows how important it is to start building the rest of the class.” That last point is indeed something to watch because the Sooners are at four commitments right now for 2018 when OU was already at nine this point last year. Again, you don’t want to compare one year to the next, but it’s a natural tendency to do just that. Robison was very vocal on social media and things of that nature. Rising isn’t quite the same way, and certainly won’t be able to be in Norman as much. Doesn’t mean he’s not recruiting like last week at The Opening regional in California where Rising went the whole day wearing an OU hat. “Yes, there’s no doubt about that,” said Nicko about Cameron recruiting other prospects. “He’s always working hard to get guys.” Cameron Rising didn’t earn the Elite 11 invitation last weekend, but he’s hopeful he will be included further down the road. https://twitter.com/BrandonHuffman/status/840976546877779968 He is 100 percent back after an injury-plagued junior season where Nicko Rising said it took his son three months to finally feel like himself again. Cameron saw the field better, his football IQ has gotten greater but not being healthy put a damper on things. “It was so disappointing, so frustrating,” Nicko Rising said. “He can’t change the way he plays, but he has to know how to protect himself.” That uneven season made it impossible for the Rising family to visit Norman for a game during the 2016 season. The bond has been made with Riley, but the spring game trip is going to be pivotal in learning about other things at OU. When Rising visited OU in the summer, it was when head coach Bob Stoops was at ESPN the entire day for the Car Wash where you go from one ESPN platform to another. Stoops was able to video chat with Rising but not actually be there. The April trip can change a lot of things. “It’s about getting a feel of the school,” Nicko Rising said. “The environment, a game situation. How the city is during a game and afterwards, seeing the student being engaged. There wasn’t any of that going on last time since it was the middle of summer so it’s important.” It’s crucial for Rising to be comfortable with OU and not just Riley. Because no matter how much OU fans are going to want to downplay things, the prospect of Riley leaving for a head coaching position is very real and will be for however long Riley intends to plan on staying at OU. “I’ve always liked Lincoln,” Nicko said. “He’s always been a straight shooter. He’s Lincoln, you know. I know Cameron has always liked him. “But it’s gotta be a cause for concern. He’s a big reason why the offense does what it does. It’s not everything, but it’s important.” Throughout the last couple of months, Cameron Rising has been consistent in saying he’s committed to OU but understands other schools are going to keep coming. That’s going to have to be enough for OU fans, at least for now. “He’s solid with OU,” Nicko Rising said. “I mean he’s really solid. It’s going to take an awful lot to get him off of that and to have things change.”   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout OU commit Trae Young earns Gatorade honor Patriots increase lead as Super Bowl favorite Take 3: Spring football is here for OU OU 17-for-2017: Best O-Line for Stoops?

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from sensors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. Sponsored Content: Why Governance, Risk and Compliance is Everyone’s Business - Download the Executive Brief Today. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” Advertisement She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. “What we are witnessing is the digitization of transportation, and digitization is something that Israel has been a leader in,” he said. Israel has long billed itself as “Startup Nation” for its thriving high-tech sector and entrepreneurial spirit, powered historically by veterans of murky technology units in the military. Major tech companies including Microsoft, Apple and Google all have research and development facilities in Israel. Seasoned executives with expertise in such fields as cybersecurity, sensors, drone technology, communications and big data are now taking their knowledge to the auto field, Granoff said. “This is far from a one-day or one-week story,” Granoff said. “This is going to be a story for the next 10 years.” Mobileye, which makes software that helps cars avoid collisions, is the biggest deal in the Israeli sector so far. Intel offered $15.3 billion for the company, more than double its market value when it had its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange less than three years ago. That followed Google’s more than $1 billion purchase of Waze, an Israeli GPS app, in 2013. Jerusalem-based Mobileye, whose software processes information from cameras and other car sensors to decide where the cars should steer, has products on just about every automaker’s autonomous test fleet. The combination with Intel adds hardware, more software expertise and data centers that the companies say will hasten deployment of autonomous technology, including wider use of automatic emergency braking and other technologies that already are on the roads. “The deal confirms Israel’s global leadership position in autonomous driving technologies,” said Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd, a venture firm with investments in the sector. “The deal will also increase attention and funding for the already burgeoning Israeli cohort of next generation autonomous driving technology startups.” There are still a number of obstacles to overcome. Companies aren’t certain how the cars will drive in snow or other bad weather, and it will be difficult for cars to be programmed to handle numerous local traffic customs. Also, no one really knows yet when the cars will be safe enough to remove human backup drivers, or whether humans are prepared to turn over the driving to machines. Dozens of Israeli firms are now in the race to find solutions to these and other challenges. Among the most promising companies: otonomo, which allows car makers, apps and service providers to exchange data such as speed, temperature and battery levels; Innoviz Technologies, Oryx Vision and VayaVision, makers of sensor technology; and Argus Cyber Security, which protects cars from hackers. Levy Raiz, a partner at Tel Aviv investment firm Flint Capital, said Israel’s autonomous vehicle industry is still smaller than other industries like cybersecurity and medical devices. But he also said he sees rapid growth in the next five years. Flint does not have any holdings in the driverless car sector but expects to make up to 12 investments over the next two years, he said. “This is the priority of our second fund, which we are launching as I speak,” he said.

We want to change the world' Who rakes in billions from Intel's $15b Mobileye buy? Rony Friedman, who is stepping down as Intel Israel vice president and general manager of its Integrated IP and Technology Group, is moving to Apple, where he will head the company’s research and development operations in Israel – one of the most highly sought after positions in Israel’s high-tech industry, TheMarker has learned. Apple Israel employs about 1,000 people in Israel, most of them developing technology related to augmented reality, which is reportedly going to play a central role in the next generation of Apple products, including the next iPhone. Aharon Aharon stepped down as head of Apple Israel several weeks ago to become head of the government’s National Innovation Authority, previously known as the Office of the Chief Scientist and the main government agency supporting the high-tech industry. Friedman began his career at Intel in 1984 after completing his studies in computer engineering at Haifa’s Technion Israel Institute of Technology. Two years after he was hired he was awarded Intel’s Architecture Prize, the highest honor it accords employees, for his work in computer-aided design.   Intel on Thursday confirmed that Friedman was leaving, while Apple Israel had not yet issued a statement. Meanwhile, Maxine Fassberg, who headed Intel Israel until January, will reportedly not be leaving the company after all. Fassberg received an offer to take a temporary management role in connection with Intel’s $15 billion purchase of Mobileye this week. Intel, which said it will be making Israel the center for its autonomous-car R&D operations, did not respond to a request for confirmation.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

The better they sell, the more competitive the market. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:17 Chorltonwheelie says: Wow! So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 15:21 Chorltonwheelie says: Intel and Nvidia’s products are better than AMD’s by a measurable distance at the moment. Try not to lose any sleep over it.

I played every single game I tried without problems. Of course the performance wasn’t exactly desirable after, I don’t know, 2013. But they worked flawlessly, both as CPU/GPU and as a great space heater. Damn, those things get hot. They worked, though.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it.

It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run).

My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition.

From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM.

Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?

These days performance gains are not as massive generation to generation By Matt Bach on Mar 16, 2017, 3:00 PM 16 comments TechSpot Editor’s Note: Matt Bach is the head of Puget Labs and has been part of Puget Systems, a boutique builder of gaming and workstation PCs, since the early days. This article was originally published on the Puget blog. There is no doubt that a modern workstation will be faster than one that is more than a year or two old, but the advancement of computer technology has certainly slowed in recent years. 10 years ago, it was not uncommon to see massive performance gains generation to generation, but today we often see much smaller 10-15% performance gains whenever a new product is launched. Some areas (such as storage) are still showing massive raw performance gains, but when you benchmark the new products in a real-world scenario even these are not quite as impressive as what we used to see. These 10-15% gains per generation are not something most people will get excited about and make it difficult to determine how much of a performance gain you might see if you were to replace your 2, 3, 4, or 5 year old workstation with a new one. To try to answer this question as objectively as we can, we decided to directly compare five workstations using the highest end components over the past 6 years. Test Setup To benchmark the performance difference between different generations of workstations, we tested Photoshop with the following hardware configurations: Available ~January 2017 Intel Core i7 7700K (4 Core 4.2GHz) 4x 16GB DDR4-2400 (64GB Total) Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) 12GB Samsung 960 Pro 1TB NVMe SSD Available ~August 2015 Intel Core i7 6700K (4 Core 4.0GHz) 4x 16GB DDR4-2133 (64GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SATA SSD Available ~June 2013 Intel Core i7 4770K (4 Core 3.5GHz) 4x 8GB DDR3-1600 (32GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan 6GB Intel 335 240GB SATA SSD Available ~April 2012 Intel Core i5 3570K (4 Core 3.4GHz) 4x 8GB DDR3-1600 (32GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX 580 1.5GB Intel 335 240GB SATA SSD Available ~January 2011 Intel Core i7 2600K (4 Core 3.4GHz) 4x 8GB DDR3-1333 (32GB Total) Nvidia GeForce GTX 580 1.5GB Intel X25-M Gen 2 160GB SATA SSD   These configurations were designed first around the various Intel CPU generations (using the fastest CPU available at launch), followed by the fastest GPU that was available at that time. After that, we simply used the highest capacity of RAM supported by the platform along with the SSD model we most commonly sold at that time on Puget machines. On the software side, we will be using Windows 10 Professional and the latest version of Photoshop 2017 on each system to ensure that any performance differences we see are strictly hardware level rather than being influenced by different software versions. Unfortunately, since we don't always keep old hardware around once it is obsolete, we had to dig through our warehouse, closets and even home PCs to put together these systems. This means that some configurations are slightly off from what they ideally should be (such as using a GTX 580 instead of a GTX 680 and only a i5 3570K for the April 2012 configuration) but despite these small discrepancies our testing should fairly accurately show how a modern workstation compares to one that is 2, 4, 5, and 6 years old. Photoshop Action To start our testing, we looked at over 20 different actions including both general task like opening and saving files as well as a variety of filters (blurs, sharpen, lens correction, liquify, etc.) and a few other miscellaneous actions. Because of the high number of different tests, we are going to look at the results as an overall average across all of the tested actions. Looking at the average from the 20+ actions we tested, we get a pretty good idea of how much faster a modern workstation is for general Photoshop usage. If you go back just one generation, a system from the middle of 2015 is only going to be about 10% slower than a new system which is not terribly exciting. However, a workstation from 2013 is going to be around 25% slower than a modern workstation which means that if it takes you 10 seconds to open a Photoshop file or apply an effect on a 2013 workstation it should only take around 7.5 seconds on a modern workstation. This isn't anything dramatic, but it will certainly add up very quickly throughout a workday. If you go back even further to a workstation from 2011, that machine should be just a bit more than half the performance of a modern workstation. Again, if it takes you 10 seconds to complete an action in Photoshop on a workstation from 2011, a modern system should be able to complete that in about 6 seconds. This is a huge difference in performance! Photomerge Results To see how well a modern workstation performs when creating a panorama using photomerge, we tested with a set of both 18MP and 80MP images: Going back just one CPU generation to 2015, there is only about a 10% difference between a machine from that time and a modern 2017 workstation. However, if you go back to 2013, a workstation from that time is only 64-76% as fast as a modern workstation. If you look at the raw results, you will see that this means a photomerge of 6x 80MP images that takes 6.5 minutes on a 2013 workstation takes just 4 minutes on a new 2017 workstation. Going back even further, a machine from 2012 is only about 60% as fast as a modern workstation and one from 2011 is only 43-61% as fast. Again looking at the raw results, where a modern system takes just 4 minutes to do a Photomerge of 80MP images, a machine from 2011 will take a bit more than 9 minutes. Merge to HDR Results Just like photomerge, we again used a set of both 18MP and 80MP images to see exactly how much faster a modern workstation is: Overall, the results are not that much different than the results from the previous two sections. There is only a small difference in performance going back to 2015, but the difference gets larger and larger the further back you go. Especially if you have a workstation from 2013 or older, you can expect pretty large performance gains by upgrading to a modern workstation. Conclusion Averaging the results from the three sections, you can get a great idea of how much faster a modern workstation should be on average compared to ones from previous years. If you would rather think in terms of a new workstation being X times faster than an older system, we also have this data in a slightly different format that you may prefer: How much faster is a new 2017 Photoshop workstation? Compared to January 2011 system: 1.8 times faster Compared to April 2012 system: 1.5 times faster Compared to June 2013 system: 1.35 times faster Compared to August 2015 system: 1.12 times faster If you have a fairly new workstation that is only a few years old, it probably isn't necessary to upgrade unless your workflow requires the best possible performance. If you have a machine from 2013 or older, however, you could be looking at some very significant performance gains. You might not see a doubling in overall performance even if you have a workstation from 2011 but it will be pretty close and should significant improve your productivity. Keep in mind that we are looking strictly at high-end workstation from each time period. If you have an off-the-shelf workstation, you would actually probably see even larger performance gains than we showed since those workstations tend to not be nearly this high-end. For example, back in 2011 a typical workstation likely used platter storage drives rather than an SSD which would make opening and saving files much longer than what we saw in our testing. In addition, the majority of older workstations are not going to have nearly as powerful of a GPU as what we tested with or as much RAM. Overall, we hope that this testing helps you decide whether you should upgrade to a new workstation or not. If you found it helpful and want us to do more testing like this please let us know in the comments section. We highly value your feedback and love hearing your suggestions!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News Why Are Chipmakers So Interested in Autonomous Cars? Shutterstock photo It’s the same reason that automakers are interested in the market. Although for them, it’s also a question of preventing tech companies from encroaching on their turf. There doesn’t seem to be any likelihood of such encroachment however, at least in the near future, as there is too much to making a car that’s just too far from what tech companies do best. So the first fully-autonomous cars that make it to the market will most likely be a collaborative effort between auto makers and tech companies. The primary selling point for self-driving cars is increased safety due to fewer accidents. There has been some research suggesting that when computers take over the roads, they will remove the chances of accidents due to human error (for sleep, distraction, intoxication, carelessness, brake failure or other mechanical problems, or when it’s the other guy’s fault, or any other reason). And of course this is what is broadly propounded by the companies invested in the phenomenon. Kathy Winter, the VP and general manager of the automated driving division at Intel INTC thinks that it will also help create logistics solutions for transportation and delivery of products. But don’t expect a sudden jump from driven to driverless cars. It’s more likely that cars will increasingly incorporate features that automate certain functions over time, making them semi-automated to varying degrees. Regulatory and insurance considerations will also likely require the presence of a driver long after cars become fully-automated. The Institute of Transportation Studies at University of California, recently conducted a survey of forty experts including policymakers, researchers, government representatives, nonprofit organizations and tech companies, presenting the results in a report titled „3 Revolutions: Sharing, Electrification, and Automation.” The chief findings were as follows: 70% of survey participants think fully driverless vehicles will account for more than 20% of vehicles sold by 2040. 88% think commercially offered shared rides will make up more than 5% of all U.S. passenger miles by 2030, and 78% think commercially offered shared rides will account for more than 20% of U.S. passenger miles traveled by 2040. 70% also think that by 2050, the majority of vehicles used commercially for ride and car sharing in the nation will be zero emissions vehicles, including battery, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell electric vehicles. According to IHS Automotive forecasts, several thousand autonomous vehicles will be on U.S. roads in 2020, with the number growing to nearly 4.5 million vehicles by 2035. By then, there will be 21 million autonomous vehicles on the road globally, growing at a 43% CAGR from 2025 to 2035. No wonder everyone is excited. What’s In It For Chipmakers? Both Intel and NVIDIA NVDA say that the fully automated car will have as much electronic horsepower as a super computer. Whether a lidar or radar system is used to pick up images of the area surrounding the car, the system is based on semiconductors. These images have to be processed and matched with relevant data to decide a course of action at the blink of an eye. So there’s processing (analog, logic), communications and machine learning involved. Each of these operations will be facilitated with semiconductors. Plus there’s entertainment, displays and syncing with other devices that will also require semiconductors. Key Players The Intel Go computer and NVIDIA Drive PX 2 are designed to help cars detect pedestrians, objects, lanes, respond to traffic signals, etc. BMW is testing the Intel solution while Tesla TSLA is testing the NVIDIA solution. Baidu BIDU is developing an artificial intelligence platform that combines its cloud platform with NVIDIA self-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, etc for the Chinese market. NVIDIA has a lead in the machine learning segment and its automotive chips are already in millions of cars from a number of suppliers, which in combination, gives it an edge in the automated car segment. Intel has been in collaboration with Mobileye for quite a while and has finally announced that it will buy the Israeli supplier of self-driving technology (camera and laser-based sensors) for $15 billion. Mobileye currently sells its technology to 27 automakers across the world, so the combination will be highly advantageous for Intel.    Qualcomm QCOM , which beat Intel hands down in the mobile computing business, is also set to rule in self-driving cars (although this time, competition will be tough with both Intel and NVIDIA having gained some mileage). The company recently launched its Drive Data Platform, which is its version of a self-driving system to process the sensor inputs generated by a vehicle. The system is based on the Snapdragon 820Am and makes use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE). But there’s more. Qualcomm’s soon-to-be-completed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in an all-cash deal worth $47 billion brings on board NXP’s RF SoC for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. While IVI may not sound that exciting in the context of self-driving cars, the thing to bear in mind in this case is the SoC technology that will shrink the size of high power systems while lowering the cost. This will be quite a breakthrough for Qualcomm as a lower price will speed up adoption of its systems. Additionally, NXP is the biggest supplier of automotive chips worldwide so it has the necessary relationships to jumpstart its business. Alphabet GOOGL has developed self-driving technology of its own but its component suppliers aren’t known. Back in 2015, the company quietly acquired Lumedyne, a maker of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors including an optical accelerometer, a vibration energy harvester and a „Time Domain Switched” type of inertial sensor for $85 million. Lumedyne also had a number of patents pending approval at the time. Over the years, Google has also been hiring a growing number of people with chip design skills. In 2015 itself, Google’s Pixel team advertised an opening for a „multimedia chip architect” who can „lead a chip development effort” and „work with other engineers to take chip to product shipment”. Google was particularly looking for expertise in „image processing, video processing, stabilization.” The Pixel still uses NVIDIA chips, but Google does have internally developed self-driving technology and the greatest number of self-driving miles on record to train its self-driving system. Wrapping Up The self-driving/autonomous car conversation is just getting started. There will no doubt be much innovation in the space over the next few years, both by the biggest tech players and automakers and by smaller startups. In fact, CB Insights estimates that financing in the auto tech startup sector was over $1 billion in 2016 and more money will surely follow. This is one of the best places to be in because the technology is just being built, so it could be good business. Also, early investors can sell out their interest at a nice premium. For chipmakers it’s a rush to grab a share of the pie. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run Did you miss Apple’s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

According to IHS Automotive forecasts, several thousand autonomous vehicles will be on U.S. roads in 2020, with the number growing to nearly 4.5 million vehicles by 2035. By then, there will be 21 million autonomous vehicles on the road globally, growing at a 43% CAGR from 2025 to 2035. No wonder everyone is excited. What’s In It For Chipmakers? Both Intel and NVIDIA NVDA say that the fully automated car will have as much electronic horsepower as a super computer. Whether a lidar or radar system is used to pick up images of the area surrounding the car, the system is based on semiconductors. These images have to be processed and matched with relevant data to decide a course of action at the blink of an eye. So there’s processing (analog, logic), communications and machine learning involved. Each of these operations will be facilitated with semiconductors. Plus there’s entertainment, displays and syncing with other devices that will also require semiconductors. Key Players The Intel Go computer and NVIDIA Drive PX 2 are designed to help cars detect pedestrians, objects, lanes, respond to traffic signals, etc. BMW is testing the Intel solution while Tesla TSLA is testing the NVIDIA solution. Baidu BIDU is developing an artificial intelligence platform that combines its cloud platform with NVIDIA self-driving technology to deliver things like HD maps, vehicle control, automated parking, etc for the Chinese market. NVIDIA has a lead in the machine learning segment and its automotive chips are already in millions of cars from a number of suppliers, which in combination, gives it an edge in the automated car segment. Intel has been in collaboration with Mobileye for quite a while and has finally announced that it will buy the Israeli supplier of self-driving technology (camera and laser-based sensors) for $15 billion. Mobileye currently sells its technology to 27 automakers across the world, so the combination will be highly advantageous for Intel.    Qualcomm QCOM , which beat Intel hands down in the mobile computing business, is also set to rule in self-driving cars (although this time, competition will be tough with both Intel and NVIDIA having gained some mileage). The company recently launched its Drive Data Platform, which is its version of a self-driving system to process the sensor inputs generated by a vehicle. The system is based on the Snapdragon 820Am and makes use of the Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE). But there’s more. Qualcomm’s soon-to-be-completed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors in an all-cash deal worth $47 billion brings on board NXP’s RF SoC for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. While IVI may not sound that exciting in the context of self-driving cars, the thing to bear in mind in this case is the SoC technology that will shrink the size of high power systems while lowering the cost. This will be quite a breakthrough for Qualcomm as a lower price will speed up adoption of its systems. Additionally, NXP is the biggest supplier of automotive chips worldwide so it has the necessary relationships to jumpstart its business. Alphabet GOOGL has developed self-driving technology of its own but its component suppliers aren’t known. Back in 2015, the company quietly acquired Lumedyne, a maker of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors including an optical accelerometer, a vibration energy harvester and a „Time Domain Switched” type of inertial sensor for $85 million. Lumedyne also had a number of patents pending approval at the time. Over the years, Google has also been hiring a growing number of people with chip design skills. In 2015 itself, Google’s Pixel team advertised an opening for a „multimedia chip architect” who can „lead a chip development effort” and „work with other engineers to take chip to product shipment”. Google was particularly looking for expertise in „image processing, video processing, stabilization.” The Pixel still uses NVIDIA chips, but Google does have internally developed self-driving technology and the greatest number of self-driving miles on record to train its self-driving system. Wrapping Up The self-driving/autonomous car conversation is just getting started. There will no doubt be much innovation in the space over the next few years, both by the biggest tech players and automakers and by smaller startups. In fact, CB Insights estimates that financing in the auto tech startup sector was over $1 billion in 2016 and more money will surely follow. This is one of the best places to be in because the technology is just being built, so it could be good business. Also, early investors can sell out their interest at a nice premium. For chipmakers it’s a rush to grab a share of the pie. More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run Did you miss Apple’s 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. NVIDIA Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) are titans of the same semiconductor industry, born a generation apart. As in all human endeavors, the only constant in business is change, and Intel and NVIDIA find themselves today at different stages of their corporate life cycles. Thanks to coming adoption of technologies such as self-driving cars and artificial-intelligence (AI) software, NVIDIA has seen demand for its graphics chips move from a niche into the mainstream. On the other hand, Intel roared to global dominance during the rise of PCs and mainframe servers, but it has struggled to tap into more recent growth markets such as mobile computing, deep learning, and the like. So which is the better stock for you to buy today: Intel or NVIDIA? Let’s examine three different aspects for NVIDIA and Intel to determine which companies’ shares appear more attractive today. Financial fortitude Those same life-cycle differences reveal themselves in assessing the financial strength of NVIDIA and Intel. Look at these four important metrics of liquidity and solvency for both companies. Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio NVIDIA $6.8 billion $2.8 billion $1.7 billion 4.7 Intel $14.9 billion $25.2 billion $21.8 billion 1.7 Data sources: NVIDA and Intel investor relations; Yahoo! Finance. NVIDIA easily beats Intel in terms of near-term liquidity — as evidenced by its current ratio — and in terms of net debt, which is just a fancy accounting term for cash and equivalents minus debt. That being said, Intel’s cash flow-generation capabilities are staggering. Though $18.4 billion of its debt will mature in 2022 or later, Intel could easily erase the majority of its leverage in a single year, even after subtracting the $9.6 billion it spent on capital expenditures in 2016. Intel is also an example of a company that uses debt, or a leveraged capital structure, as a source of competitive advantage. It’s one of the few semiconductor companies that also owns its chip fabrication plants; NVIDIA outsources its fab to a consortium of partners including Taiwan Semiconductor , Samsung , and more. Operating large fixed assets such as semiconductor manufacturing plants requires plenty of capital, which explains Intel’s use of ample leverage. Either way, both companies are in fine financial shape, given their respective strategies, so let’s call this one a tie and move on. Winner: Tie. Image source: Getty Images. Durable competitive advantages NVIDIA and Intel each enjoy meaningful competitive advantages in their respective areas of the global semiconductor market. Sources estimate Intel controls 87% of the PC CPU market and 95% the server CPU market, although the exact numbers aren’t as important as knowing that Intel dominates the global PC and data center microprocessor markets, and for a predictable reason: Intel’s longtime performance advantage over the competition — namely, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)  — has allowed the company to charge higher prices per unit for its chips. Intel plows an aggressive portion of its profits back into its research and development, which has, in turn, allowed it to maintain the performance advantages of its chips. Barring execution risks, which have been a concern from time to time , this long-standing trend has served as a virtuous cycle that has allowed Intel to dominate its core markets and consistently produce above-average profits for its shareholders. The dollar values involved help flesh this dynamic out a bit more. In the past three years, AMD’s revenue has totaled $4.2 billion in 2016, $3.9 billion in 2015, and $5.5 billion in 2014. In contrast, Intel’s research-and-development budget alone has totaled $12.7 billion, $12.1 billion, and $11.5 billion over the same period. This kind of structural advantage is incredibly difficult to overcome. NVIDIA’s competitive advantages are more technological than structural at the moment. Because of its long-standing place as the creator graphics computing, on which it still focuses, NVIDIA’s chips have generally been the best of breed in each of the graphics processing applications its products serve. The company pressed that advantage with last year’s debut of its Pascal architecture, around which it launched a number of new chips. Better still, NVIDIA has used its advantage to help consolidate early leads in core growth markets such as AI computing platforms and driverless cars. In recent years, NVIDIA has become the GPU supplier to the AI efforts at Microsoft , Facebook , Amazon.com , Alphabet , and Apple , to name a few. Much has also been made of NVIDIA’s potential in self-driving cars, where it supplies the graphics chips that power the autonomous-vehicle efforts of Ford , Tesla , Volkswagen , Honda , and many more. Both of these industries figure to offer substantial growth opportunities over the coming decade, and NVIDIA’s place as the go-to supplier to support these emerging technologies speaks to their compelling value proposition. Winner: NVIDIA. Valuation The way the market is pricing Intel and NVIDIA shares should come as little surprise, given what we just learned about the outlook for their businesses. Here’s a snapshot of three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for Intel and NVIDIA. Company P/E Forward P/E EV/EBITDA NVIDIA 38.3 29.5 23.6 Intel 16.9 12.3 7.8 Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Both companies also pay dividends: Intel shares currently yield 2.9%; NVIDIA, a mere 0.5%. As for which stock appears the more attractively valued, I think both companies appear reasonably valued, given their respective growth outlooks. The multiple trends fueling NVIDIA’s growth should support its earnings growth for arguably a decade or more, so its sky-high valuation shouldn’t be a deterrent for investors with a similarly long time horizon. As more of a mature company, Intel will have its investment outlook driven by its ability to grow its EPS and return excess capital to shareholders. Its fantastic economics should allow it to do so, but it’s hard to get excited about a company that analysts see growing sales just 0.9% this year and 2% in 2018. So in terms of which company is more appropriately valued, I think both companies trade near prices that seem fair. Winner: Tie. And the winner is… NVIDIA by a nose Both companies present interesting value propositions to investors today. Intel offers a mix of profitability and income at a fairly discounted price, which could prove compelling to more conservative investors. However, many of NVIDIA’s growth markets are in their early stages, which makes it the more attractive stock to own over the long term. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000 GO Intel works with HackerOne to find the best white hats Mar 17, 2017 00:01 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Lagging behind many other tech companies, Intel has finally launched a bug bounty program, offering rewards of up to $30,000 for hardware vulnerabilities.  The program is being run via HackerOne, which enlists white hats from all over the globe to find security vulnerabilities in various software, firmware or hardware, depending on the hiring company. "We want to encourage researchers to identify issues and bring them to us directly so that we can take prompt steps to evaluate and correct them, and we want to recognize researchers for the work that they put in when researching a vulnerability. By partnering constructively with the security research community, we believe we will be better able to protect our customers," reads the announcement. Get a score, get some cash As per usual with this type of programs, the harder a vulnerability is to mitigate, the more Intel will pay white hats. The company takes into account several factors when determining the severity of a vulnerability. It first uses the CVSS 3.0 calculator to compute a base score, which is then adjusted based on the security objectives and threat model for the given product. For instance, a critical vulnerability for Intel Software will pay up to $7,500, while one found in the firmware will pay up to $10,000. The highest prize comes for vulnerabilities found in Intel hardware, where the limit was set to $30,000. The Intel Security products are not in-scope for the bug bounty programs, and neither are any third-party products and open source. Intel's Web Infrastructure is also not subject to the bug bounty program. Any acquisitions the company makes are not included in the bug bounty program for the first six months after the deal is complete. The fact that more and more companies turn to bug bounty programs is encouraging because it indicates they take security seriously. Some giants like Google have their own programs set in place, while others work together with HackerOne to run them. #Intel#bug bounty#HackerOne subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news 1Password Taunts White Hats with $100,000 "Capture the Flag" Bug Bounty Twitter Vulnerability Allowed Hackers to Access Locked Accounts Slack Bug Gave Hackers Access to Accounts, Messages, Tokens YouPorn Teams Up with HackerOne for Bug Bounty Program, Offers Up to $25,000 Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Build 15063 for PC and Mobile YouTube on Restricted Mode Blocking LGBTQ+ Content: Our System Is Flawed 7 Tips to Stay Safe from Attacks like the Fappening New Instagram Update Allows Users to Save Live Videos Dutch Police Buys Unnecessary Microsoft Office Licenses by Mistake… Twice Google Releases Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta 2 for Nexus and Pixel Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB4015438 Also Taking Ages to Install    Intel finally launches bug bounty program Related Apps BlackFog Privacy: Keep track of your network traffic in real-time so you can detect potential security leaks and data collection activities using this app Child Lock: Simple application for parents who want to restrict their children's access to the computer by disabling keyboard and mouse commands RogueKiller: Scans processes, the registry, MBR, services, the Windows task scheduler, and other areas for suspicious activity to remove malware agents CyoHash: Find out the hash of any file quickly by opening its context menu, featuring batch processing and support for MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, CRC32 RCC: Scan your operating system and Mozilla Firefox for root certificates that have been added to the trust list behind your back, with this lightweight console utility Shred: Ensure total security for your sensitive info with the help of this tool that overwrites data before deleting it while also being able to shred free space Black Bird Cleaner: Remove unnecessary files, optimize various OS settings, manage services and view system info, with this versatile piece of software Reader comments Cisco Says CIA Can Exploit 318 of Its Switches, Promises Fix more on: Cisco i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It seems clear, though, that Microsoft doesn't want these processors to work on their older operating systems. So they've decided to roll out a processor check in Windows Update on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, preventing users from download updates if their system contains a Kaby Lake or Ryzen CPU. The error message that users have been receiving on these systems reads: "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows". This update lock will no doubt annoy users who are running the latest hardware, but for whatever reason would rather not upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft is still supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through security patches and, in the case of Windows 8.1, some feature and bugfix updates, so those with the latest hardware will not be able to receive these updates. Microsoft's support page clarifies the exact processor families that aren't support in older versions of Windows: Intel seventh (7th)-generation "Intel Core" processor or a later generation AMD seventh (7th)-generation (“Bristol Ridge") processor or a later generation Qualcomm “8996" processor or a later generation Microsoft's recommended fix is, of course, to upgrade your system to Windows 10, even if it's working perfectly on an older OS. There does not appear to be any technical reason for the restriction, other than Microsoft's statement that these processors aren't supported.

Based on the latest generation of HPE Apollo 6000 systems, the new supercomputer will drive the digitalization of BASF's worldwide research. "The new supercomputer will promote the application and development of complex modeling and simulation approaches, opening up completely new avenues for our research at BASF," said Dr. Martin Brudermueller, Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and Chief Technology Officer at BASF. "The supercomputer was designed and developed jointly by experts from HPE and BASF to precisely meet our needs." The new system will make it possible to answer complex questions and greatly reduce the time required to obtain results from several months to days across all research areas. As part of BASF's digitalization strategy, the company plans to significantly expand its capabilities to run virtual experiments with the supercomputer. In addition, it will help BASF reduce time to market and costs by, for example, simulating processes on catalyst surfaces more precisely or accelerating the design of new polymers with pre-defined properties.

Armenian News Network / Groong [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] Armenia’s rising tech scene: The new Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union From: Mihran Keheyian <mkeheyian@gmail.com> Date: Sat, 18 Mar 2017 18:21:47 +0000 Armenia’s rising tech scene: The new Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union March 17, 2017 364 0 By Gev Balian The Next Web Armenia was once the center of IT innovation for the USSR. A turbulent history has stifled the economy, but things are starting to look up for the Caucasus republic. A highly-skilled, post-soviet engineering workforce and a diaspora of advocates, combined with new government initiatives, are igniting renewed growth in Armenia’s IT sector. These businesses are creating new technologies — from award-winning mobile apps to world-first presentation tools — recognized across the globe and many startups are making their way to the US. The Armenian tech industry is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, greatly exceeding the country’s two percent economic growth. Annual tech revenues from some 400 IT companies make up $475 million and by 2018, it is estimated this industry will be the dominant sector driving new wealth for the economy. Emerging startups, global expansion and initiatives from some of the biggest names in tech – from Intel to Microsoft — are creating great momentum. Armenia’s tech scene is at a real turning point. The Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union has morphed into a thriving tech startup hub, attracting global recognition. So, how is the Armenian tech scene growing? What is the country doing to drive international investment and which startups are making the biggest waves in the global tech scene? Reigniting IT innovation In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia designed and manufactured 40 percent of the mainframe computers for the military. The Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a secret building in the capital city, employed 5,000 highly skilled workers, but later fell to ruin. This is just a small portion of the “several hundred thousand specialists” that worked behind the scenes at the heart of IT innovation, according to the Union of Information Technology Enterprises in Yerevan. This history, combined with Soviet academia’s celebration for the sciences and great Armenian determination, have provided the foundation to kick-start a resurgence of tech innovation. As tech revenues continue to rise, the largest foreign investment, according to the Armenian government, is going into “telecommunications, mining, energy, air transportation and financial sectors.” Online gaming and sports betting software company BetConstruct, an investor in my company ucraft, launched in Yerevan in 2003 and today has offices worldwide. BetConstruct’s founder and CEO Vahe Baloulian told me, “When we launched, the technology sector in Armenia consisted mainly of software houses serving the nascent industries and the government and some offshoots of foreign technology companies, looking for more affordable resources. The successes of these prompted local entrepreneurs to set up development firms that would attract outsourced work.” He described how improvements in infrastructure mean opening business in Armenia today is far easier, “The old communication monopoly has been abolished, and competing providers have made the Internet a lot more affordable and accessible.” Many of the largest IT companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, are internationally headquartered with development teams based in the country. The government encourages expansion from these corporates with the implementation of its “open door” policy, designed to encourage foreign business owners and investment, with legal regimes that protect foreign capital. In 2012, Intel announced the launch of a new research center during the ArmTech Congress. US Ambassador to Armenia John Heffern reported the potential for IT growth, “The creative mind is the key to the future of Armenia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a report based on UNESCO data, according to which Armenia is the first among CIS member states with the number of inventions per capita,” he said. The multinational joined global names such as Synopsys, D-Link and “virtualization giant” VMWare after its acquisition of IT startup Integrien — each running operations from the country and taking action to rouse a new generation of tech innovation. Synopsys, the largest global company in electronic design automation (EDA), with an annual revenue of over $2 billion USD, launched offices in Armenia in 2004. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in the country, with over 650 employees. It is also heavily involved in schemes to support rising talent. Synopsys collaborates with Armenia’s Polytechnic University to provide educational programs for students, and also hiring a large number of graduates. These initiatives work to support Armenia’s youth through education and increasing work availability for skilled Armenians. But large corporates are not the only option, a burgeoning startup scene enabled by new government tax reduction schemes is changing the face of Yerevan and attracting global attention. New legislation empowers entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. However this ancient transit hub has renewed energy as the center of Armenia’s startup scene. Recent legislation has made founding, operating and growing a tech startup in Armenia much simpler. After lobbying from the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), Armenian headquartered startups, tech centers, incubators and accelerations with fewer than 30 employees, now benefit from tax privileges. Yerevan is also home to two free economic zones (FEZ) where businesses that meet certain startup requirements can operate without paying VAT, profit, property and income tax, also escaping export customs duty charges. One of these is found in the area of the RAO Mars Closed Joint-Stock Company and Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines, and is designed to enable, manufacture and export of new technologies. Today, you really can launch a startup for a very low cost — and the effects of this are a growing startup ecosystem, and a culture of excitement. Armenian businesses are gaining traction and experiencing global recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making waves in the tech industry, showing the enormous potential Armenia has as a center of innovation. Yerevan-based Triada Studio is the creator of puzzle app Shadowmatic, the winner of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best of 2015. Triada Studios launched in 1993 as a computer graphics and animation studio. Cofounder and CEOAra Aghamyan described the “huge intellectual potential” in Armenia. Aghamyan claims the biggest challenge that the Armenian tech-scene faces today is the exodus of talent, as a large number of startups end up moving to the U.S. to raise capital and reach greater audiences. “We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only make people stay in the country, but also attract great minds from all over the world,” he told me. The move to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical project manager for Armenia’s TUMO Center for Creative Technologies and founder of Armenia-based startup Lionsharp creator ofVoiceboard, “the world’s first gesture and voice controlled presentation solution.” Sharp told PSFK that a poor track record of foreign investment “plagued with corruption and losses” has created a barrier to foreign investment. This distrust combined with the challenges of networking, common in any emerging startup hub, prevents many businesses from putting their creations in front of a global audience. This is made more difficult by limited access to entrepreneurial education, language differences and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are moving to the U.S. to gain support, funding and improve their growth prospects. In April, photo-editing app PicsArt raised an additional $20M in VC, bringing its total funding to $45M and enabling the Armenia-born startup to grow its presence in China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt’s CEO Hovhannes Avoyan relocated to join the company’s Chief Revenue Officer in San Francisco, helping to further solidify PicsArt’s recognition in the U.S. tech scene. PicsArt was later that year included on Forbes’s list of ”Hottest Startups of 2015”. Influencers in the tech world are making efforts to strengthen ties between Armenia and the US. In March Triada Studios’ Ara Aghamyan wrote to President Obamaexplaining the tech community’s role in developing US-Armenian commerce. He drew attention to the issue of double taxation that deters foreign investment and restricts growth for businesses that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the first to take a stand. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEX, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and more have all gone on record in support of better economic relations to empower growth within the country. US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Repat Armenia. In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched theArmenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation. https://thenextweb.com/asia/2017/03/17/armenias-rising-tech-scene-new-silicon-valley-former-soviet-union/#.tnw_HN9VEA7c http://horizonweekly.ca/en/armenias-rising-tech-scene-the-new-silicon-valley-of-the-former-soviet-union/ [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] [ Reply to sender | Write to Groong ]

At the Mobile World Congress in February, a small device maker showcased its new augmented reality helmet for workers. Is there an opportunity for AR in business and investing? Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Mar 18, 2017 at 11:22AM We become so limited by this idea of technology replacing workers when the better idea is to power-up their senses and extend what they're capable of doing. So says Brian Mullins, founder and CEO of the augmented-reality device maker DAQRI. Those are powerful words, especially in a world where championing and empowering common workers can take you as far as the White House. Politics aside, though, the statement does beg the question: Does extending a worker's senses using augmented reality (AR) make business and investment sense? The case for augmented reality First, what is augmented reality? Unlike virtual reality (VR), which closes off the user from the real world, augmented reality works alongside it. VR has received much attention the last few years as an entertainment medium for things like video games and fully immersive movies. Last year, though, AR finally got some attention when Pokemon Go went viral. While the mobile game was an example of the potential applications for AR, DAQRI sees it being used for far more serious matters. The company was founded on the idea that AR could help empower workers with data, make them more productive, and even keep them safe. Image source: DAQRI. Because of its potential in the workplace, most estimates show that longer-term growth will favor augmented reality, not virtual. However, in 2016, the total VR/AR market brought in about $4 billion in revenue. More than half of that -- about $2.7 billion -- came from virtual reality sales. By the start of the next decade, estimates put annual AR/VR sales anywhere from $90 billion to $120 billion. While VR is leading right now, expectations are that AR will account for well over half of those estimates. The driver? Not video games and entertainment but enterprise solutions tethered to the Internet of Things and geared toward helping workers process data. What is DAQRI up to? Entering the scene last month at the Mobile World Congress 2017 was DAQRI's new Smart Helmet. Just like the name implies, this device looks like a hard hat with a front visor. But in this case, the visor is where data, pictures, and schematics are overlaid onto the real world. Image source: DAQRI. The company hopes its new device is the future of the industrial workforce, carrying a range of capabilities that workers need. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provides the brains with its sixth-generation Core m7 processor, as well as several sensors to help project depth perception to the wearer. The device carries several cameras, including an infrared and thermal imaging camera for relevant applications. The helmet looks like a byproduct of Intel's Project Alloy, its bet on augmented reality that it announced last fall. DAQRI's helmet features similar hardware as Alloy, but Intel's goggles are being presented as a multiuse device for things ranging from entertainment to office environements, rather than a hard hat for futuristic industrial workers. DAQRI followed suit and also released a less-rugged version of its helmet in goggle form, simply called Smart Glasses. The design is again similar to Project Alloy and is being marketed for less-hazardous workplaces like distribution centers and for remote experts. A case study for augmented reality Evidence has been mounting that AR at work is a good idea for businesses. For example, German logistics and shipping company DHL equipped warehouse workers with AR glasses. The company reported that the glasses-equipped employees worked 25% faster and error-free during the three-week pilot program. The potential for AR to transform the workplace is there, but it is still early. Some challenges that will need to be tackled include boosting battery life for devices and building out an ecosystem of apps. For investors, there isn't much opportunity in AR outside of the major tech players or companies like Intel making the components powering the devices. As for DAQRI, it is a very small company and not yet publicly traded. Though early in the game, AR is still worth keeping tabs on. We are in an interesting time where technology is helping us more efficiently use the massive amounts of information and data available to us. AR represents one such option that, once refined, can help businesses and employees put that information to use in the best way possible, reducing costs, boosting profitability, and more.

A message that’s spreading like ‘wildfire’ claims white people should stay indoors on April 6th or risk destruction. A fearsome message inflicting unimaginable destruction has spread like wildfire in Pretoria warning people that Black South African citizens are planning something “big”, reports Centurion Rekord. People all over social media platforms and WhatsApp crime prevention groups are scratching their heads, trying to figure out where the message is coming from. The person who constructed the message said the following: “Listen carefully. On the 6th April I need you to be very careful. Book off from work. Tell everybody to stay home. The kids too. The blacks are planning something very big in PTA and JHB and surrounding areas that day. This is not a game.” The person then tries to persuade the reader of the above by saying it is not just a story, warning people to pile up on supplies. “This is not just a story. I’m connected with some very important people and the warnings are going out. Have enough water and food.” It also incites violence: “Get some sort of weapon or two. Put the dog/s inside as well for protection. Don’t leave your house! Start warning friends and family!” The message continues to say: “We believe this to be either a practice run with destruction and death; or the start of the civil war in this country.” It states further that this mass plan is going to disrupt all things possible, including cellphones, all highways and businesses. The manufacturer of the message then goes on to say they hope they are wrong, but “Intel” from their side says otherwise. By “Intel”, they mean information of military or political value. “Let’s hope we are wrong but the Intel at the moment says we are very right to fear. The chances of this spreading to other towns and cities are very good.” The community crime prevention on social media administrator in the Moot, Susan Andrews, strongly condemns the legitimacy of the message. Andrews advised that people should not go into panic mode. “There are many well-informed people who will issue a warning to the right forums and that message will be shared as confirmed.” She also called on the public to join their Community Policing Forums (CPF) to assist the police in crime prevention and to obtain skills in cases of emergency. A post containing AfriForum’s logo was also distributed in Pretoria, warning people that the message was false, and encouraging people not to distribute it. . AfriForum, however, said they were not aware of it, as it did not come from their organisation. It said itwas distributed without their approval and the organisation dissociated itself from the content. Police could not comment on the matter by the time of going to print. – Caxton News Service Related Stories Woman seriously wounded in KZN clinic shooting 19.3.2017 DA to submit questions on security at chief justice’s office following break-in 19.3.2017 WATCH: Video evidence leads to arrest of officers for fraud 19.3.2017 JSE Currencies Commodities what's hot National Yah neh, says cop ‘exposed’ as OR Tambo thief with Lamborghini National What did Singapore teach you about racism, Helen, asks confused Ndlozi National LISTEN: UDM coalition partner insults DA counterparts Entertainment Somizi may be separated from Mbau in Metro FM ‘reshuffle’ Celebrities We are traumatised and still in shock, says Joe Mafela’s family readers' choice National PIC: Joe Mafela’s accident scene National EFF claps back at Moonsamy, says she is seeking attention National Brothers killed in butchery robbery National What did Singapore teach you about racism, Helen, asks confused Ndlozi National Brothers killed in Pretoria central business robbery poll Do you think the break-in at the Office of the Chief Justice is highly suspicious?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 March 2017 by Military News 6 Things You Didn’t Know About FireEye, Inc. Tech investors might recognize FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE) as the hot cybersecurity IPO from 2013 that fizzled out over the following years. After going public at $20, FireEye soared to the mid-$80s before concerns about its valuation, lack of profits, cash burn rate, and a secondary offering torpedoed the stock. FireEye now trades at about $10, and its sales growth has flatlined, with analysts expecting just 1% sales growth this year. I’ve discussed the many shortcomings of FireEye’s business model before, but today I’ll focus on six lesser-known facts about this struggling cybersecurity firm. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The first cybersecurity firm certified by Homeland Security In 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security certified FireEye’s Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine and  Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DHI) cloud platform under its SAFETY Act. That made it the first cybersecurity company to achieve SAFETY certification for its products, and reinforced its reputation as a „best in breed” threat prevention solutions provider. That’s why FireEye was asked to investigate high-profile data breaches at Target , JPMorgan , Sony , and other companies over the past few years. 2. Its core technologies came from an acquisition FireEye was founded in 2004 as a security appliance maker, but it wasn’t considered a major threat prevention player until it acquired Mandiant for $1 billion in 2014. Mandiant was founded by current FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, and used digital forensics and an aggressive „SWAT team” approach to contain data breaches. Mandiant rose to prominence in early 2013 after it published a report which  implicated China in cyber espionage activities. Image source: FireEye. 3. Its founder has left the company FireEye’s founder Ashar Aziz, who has been frequently hailed as  a „technical visionary,” orchestrated the company’s early development of security appliances and oversaw its acquisition of Mandiant. Prior to founding FireEye, Aziz worked at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle ) as an engineer and CTO. That’s why Aziz’s abrupt resignation from FireEye’s board of directors last August stunned investors. FireEye said that Aziz’s departure wasn’t caused by any disagreements with the company, but rather a „desire to spend more time with his family here and abroad, and also to pursue new projects.” 4. Its former CEO loved buyouts In 2012, FireEye hired Dave DeWalt, the former CEO and President of McAfee, as its CEO to prep the company for its IPO. DeWalt had a reputation for orchestrating buyouts — he engineered the sales of Documentum to EMC in 2003, and McAfee to Intel in  2011. Neither company turned out to be a great deal for the buyers — EMC sold Documentum this January, and Intel agreed to sell  a majority stake in McAfee (rebranded as Intel Security) last September. As FireEye dipped below its IPO price in late 2015, many investors speculated that DeWalt would also try to sell the company. However, DeWalt resigned last June and  was replaced by Mandia, which suggests that quick buyouts are now off the table. 5. It turned down several buyout offers Shortly after DeWalt’s departure, reports claimed that several major suitors, including Cisco and Symantec (NASDAQ: SYMC) , had tried to buy FireEye. A Bloomberg report claimed that FireEye had rebuffed the offers because they were lower than its expected buyout price of $30 per share. A Reuters report from earlier this year claimed that FireEye ended buyout talks with Symantec shortly after Mandia took over due to disagreements over the price. That time frame indicates that the talks occurred after Symantec announced the acquisition of BlueCoat for $4.7 billion, but before it agreed to buy LifeLock for $2.3 billion. 6. It’s settling a big class action lawsuit It probably isn’t surprising that FireEye is being sued by its investors. The company was hit by multiple class action lawsuits in 2014 after its secondary offering triggered a steep sell-off. The plaintiffs also allege that FireEye execs made misleading claims about the effectiveness of its threat prevention technologies. The Register recently reported that  FireEye plans to settle these lawsuits for $10.2 million. That would only account for 1.4% of its  projected revenues for the year, but it would also represent the second largest recovery ever achieved in a case argued in a California state court under the Securities Act of 1933. The settlement would also inevitably tarnish FireEye’s reputation. The key takeaways FireEye might look like a tempting contrarian play, but the company is in serious trouble. It isn’t pivoting from appliances to cloud-based services quickly enough to boost its top line growth, and Mandia’s plan to grow margins by laying off employees could dull FireEye’s competitive edge. Several of the facts I discussed in this article support that bearish case and indicate that FireEye might not ever revisit its IPO price again. 10 stocks we like better than FireEye When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Beignet 1.3 was released back in January and it was big for finishing OpenCL 2.0 for Skylake and newer. Beignet 1.3.1 that's out today is just a bug-fix update. Beignet 1.3.1 now allows a single Beignet binary to offer OpenCL 2.0 where available while dropping back to OpenCL 1.2 dynamically for older hardware, only enable OpenCL 2.0 when LLVM 3.9 is used on a x86_64 host, and more. This release also allows OpenCL-OpenGL sharing via the cl_khr_icd. A list of the v1.3.1 changes can be found via the Beignet 1.3 Git branch. Meanwhile on Git master there continues being a lot of work on the backends, cl_intel_media_block_io support, and other changes. There is also a new "newRT" branch that may be work around run-time improvements, but is still in early stages of development. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Sure, it can happen. But when's the last time you had to upgrade your OS to, er, use your OS, because of your processor? Yep, that's a new one, with Microsoft taking the first step towards discouraging the use of AMD and Intel's latest hardware on the company's older platforms of Windows 7 and 8.1. Although reports are mixed as to whether the change is actually live, a new page on Microsoft's support site outlines what users will — eventually — see when they try to download updates on Windows 7 and 8.1, while using a recent processor: Unsupported Hardware Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates. The page goes on to say that Intel's 7th-gen and AMD's Bristol Ridge chips are affected (Kaby Lake and Ryzen respectively), along with the Qualcomm 8996, better known as the Snapdragon 820. So, what's Microsoft's recommended resolution? Buy Windows 10, of course: We recommend that you upgrade Windows 8.1-based and Window 7-based computers to Windows 10 if those computers have a processor that is from any of the following generations... It's not outside the realms of possibility that someone will cook up a workaround, if you want to persist with a pre-Windows 10 platform. If you can't wait, it should be possible to use a program such as WSUS to grab updates manually. [Microsoft] Comments Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 18, 2017, 1:13pm It's not outside the realms of possibility that someone will cook up a workaround, if you want to persist with a pre-Windows 10 platform. If you can't wait, it should be possible to use a program such as WSUS to grab updates manually. The OS isn't going to stop working, you don't need a workaround to keep using older Windows versions. The 'no updates' thing is vague but the underlying reason is that you can't write security updates that make use of modern chipset features for operating systems where the hardware access layer has no knowledge of those features, and rewriting the kernel on older operating systems to introduce it to those features is difficult and quite expensive. General purpose updates may still be available (though Windows 7 is almost EOL now anyway) but security and compatibility updates just won't work - older OS's will still get updates for older chipsets because the HAL was designed for it, but they won't get updates for newer chipsets. From Microsoft's description (which could certainly use more detail), WSUS isn't likely to help as the updates simply won't exist for older versions of the OS. This isn't as big a deal as some people are making it out to be. Modern CPUs will continue to work on older operating systems just fine, the only real difference is they're effectively running in compatibility mode and half their features are unused. It's not unusual for old software (Win7 is eight years old now) to not be compatible with the latest hardware without significant rework and that's what's going on here. Reply 3 skrybe @skrybe Mar 18, 2017, 2:46pm This is the problem I have with what MS are doing; Windows 8.1 falls under the same lifecycle policy as Windows 8, and will reach end of Mainstream Support on January 9, 2018, and end of Extended Support on January 10, 2023. On January 13, Microsoft's mainstream support for Windows 7 Service Pack (SP) 1 ends. Nobody panic. ... "Extended support" -- the period during which Microsoft continues to provide for free security updates for products -- doesn't end until January 14, 2020 for Windows 7 SP1 Now MS might be able to argue for stopping updates on Win 7 since it's mainstream support has ended. Though, it's still got nearly 3 years left for extended support. Windows 8/8.1 on the other hand absolutely should be getting compatibility upgrades to support Intel and AMD CPUs being released this year. If not what is their mainstream support worth? I forgot to add, the worst thing this does is (assuming the keep working) is keep people using Win7/8/8.1 without updating their OS. Meaning more security risks and problems. Because there are absolutely people who will refuse to update to Windows10.

Editor’s Note: The RCR Wireless News Reality Check section is where C-level executives and advisory firms from across the mobile industry share unique insights and experiences. Years ago, when a person walked into their local store, the head clerk or grocer may have greeted them by name and offered them products they were likely to buy. Modern retail is a jarringly different experience, driven by a global supply chain and notorious for its lack of quality customer service. Heavy online shopping has stripped consumers of any sort of human interaction. When they do need to call customer service they are often frustrated to find a robotic voice on the other end of the line that wants them to voice their concern into a set of numbers. By 2020, a Walker survey projects that customer experience will be the No. 1 brand differentiator, usurping both price and product. To compete, stores need to improve customer service quickly and internet of things devices are poised to bring a personal touch back to retail. Take a look at Intel’s recent announcement, for example. The company recently unveiled the Responsive Retail Platform, which blends IoT sensors with cloud technology to better inform employees of customer needs and tailor their experience. When employees are stocking shelves midday or manning three of 20 check out lines, a customer can get lost in the shuffle. But now, IoT has the capability to improve this experience. Where and when to use IoT Amazon.com is winning with automated technology, from stocking shelves and taking inventory to scanning bar codes. When Amazon ships a package it requires a single minute of human labor. While a lot of technology companies are imagining a future where stores are automated, this approach could still lead to unsatisfied customers. What if someone can’t find a product? What happens when a patron needs fashion advice? Robots and automation are not good at handling these sorts of “edge” scenarios. The key to reshaping the retail terrain is to use automation to free up humans to do what they do best – creative problem solving and human interaction. If employees’ sole focus is customer service, shopping will become a more personalized, pleasant experience. The art of personalization An integrated IoT solution could enhance shopper personalization beyond anything previously possible. By using sensors and data to analyze what products similar shoppers purchase, stores can make recommendations on new products. They could also suggest a suitable backup if a product if is out of stock by inspecting the buying choices of similar customers. These changes can ultimately bolster a brand’s reputation and increase loyalty. If a customer feels they’re valued by a brand through a unique, tailored one-on-one customer experience they’ll reciprocate with loyalty to that brand and tell their friends of their good experience. The business innovations driven by IoT should not just be relegated to automated tasks. They must be integrated with the services performed by human employees. This will translate into more comprehensive customer service. The power of people Whenever a transformative technology allows for a drastically different workforce, people fear it will lead to job scarcity. The reality is that whenever there is an improvement – like IoT – those technologies will need support from the C-suite down to more tactical positions. These jobs just shift, they don’t entirely disappear. Intel has explicitly said the intention is to adjust human employees to their area of expertise – not displace jobs. There is no technological replacement that can 100% replicate the experience of human interaction. It’s hard to imagine a scenario in the near future where, say, a robotic wait staff makes a customer feel valued more than a person in the same role. It’s about striking a balance of when technology will provide value and when it will just be in excess. IoT and connected devices have the power to improve customer experience. Retailers can make better recommendations to their customers, keep the right items in stock and know exactly what products are available in their backroom. The key is freeing up people in the store to provide excellent customer service and letting robots and automated systems do the rest. If this scenario plays out the store of the future may not only have the exact products consumers want, but they can be assisted by a friendly, local clerk that knows their name.

Microsoft to force Windows 10 on Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPUs? by Joe Roberts 17 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments We already knew Microsoft was planning to offer official support solely for Windows 10 on the new Intel and AMD CPUs, but it seems the company is planning to go to great lengths to ensure these chips aren't used with older versions of the OS. A new Knowledge Base article suggests the firm will essentially block Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors from running with Windows 7 or 8.1. It seems Microsoft will not provide Windows updates for Windows 7 and 8.1 on any computers running on these new processors. Related: Windows 10 vs Windows 7 It's a move that looks designed to force users of the newer hardware to update to the latest version of Windows, as not doing so will leave their software open to security threats. According to the update, users of the new hardware will see an error message whenever they try to scan or download Windows updates, which reads "your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows". In the Knowledge Base article, the company says: "This error occurs because new processor generations require the latest Windows version for support." It goes on to explain that Windows 10 is the only Windows version that is supported on the following processor generations: Intel seventh (7th)-generation processors AMD “Bristol Ridge” Qualcomm “8996" It was previously thought that earlier versions of Windows would have some form of compatibility issues with the new CPUs, but the lack of support from Microsoft means there will also be major security concerns to consider for users. It should be said that the Knowledge Base article doesn't say explicitly that Microsoft will follow through with this plan. As the article states: "Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh-generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update.” "May" certainly suggests a level of ambiguity here, and InfoWorld, which initially brought the update to light, points out that the new policy doesn't appear to have been implemented yet. Of course, it could be that Microsoft doesn't follow through with this attempt to bring users onto its latest OS – at this point it's all very unclear.

Armenian News Network / Groong [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] Armenia’s rising tech scene: The new Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union From: Katia Peltekian <kpeltekian@gmail.com> Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2017 23:03:47 +0200 The Next Web March 17 2017     Armenia’s rising tech scene: The new Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union by Gev Balyan — in Asia Armenia was once the center of IT innovation for the USSR. A turbulent history has stifled the economy, but things are starting to look up for the Caucasus republic. A highly-skilled, post-soviet engineering workforce and a diaspora of advocates, combined with new government initiatives, are igniting renewed growth in Armenia’s IT sector. These businesses are creating new technologies — from award-winning mobile apps to world-first presentation tools — recognized across the globe and many startups are making their way to the US. The Armenian tech industry is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent, greatly exceeding the country’s two percent economic growth. Annual tech revenues from some 400 IT companies make up $475 million and by 2018, it is estimated this industry will be the dominant sector driving new wealth for the economy. Emerging startups, global expansion and initiatives from some of the biggest names in tech – from Intel to Microsoft — are creating great momentum. Armenia’s tech scene is at a real turning point. The Silicon Valley of the former Soviet Union has morphed into a thriving tech startup hub, attracting global recognition. So, how is the Armenian tech scene growing? What is the country doing to drive international investment and which startups are making the biggest waves in the global tech scene? Reigniting IT innovation In the days of the Soviet Union, Armenia designed and manufactured 40 percent of the mainframe computers for the military. The Yerevan Computer Research Institute, a secret building in the capital city, employed 5,000 highly skilled workers, but later fell to ruin. This is just a small portion of the “several hundred thousand specialists” that worked behind the scenes at the heart of IT innovation, according to the Union of Information Technology Enterprises in Yerevan. This history, combined with Soviet academia’s celebration for the sciences and great Armenian determination, have provided the foundation to kick-start a resurgence of tech innovation. As tech revenues continue to rise, the largest foreign investment, according to the Armenian government, is going into “telecommunications, mining, energy, air transportation and financial sectors.” Online gaming and sports betting software company BetConstruct, an investor in my company ucraft, launched in Yerevan in 2003 and today has offices worldwide. BetConstruct’s founder and CEO Vahe Baloulian told me, “When we launched, the technology sector in Armenia consisted mainly of software houses serving the nascent industries and the government and some offshoots of foreign technology companies, looking for more affordable resources. The successes of these prompted local entrepreneurs to set up development firms that would attract outsourced work.” He described how improvements in infrastructure mean opening business in Armenia today is far easier, “The old communication monopoly has been abolished, and competing providers have made the Internet a lot more affordable and accessible.” Many of the largest IT companies operating in Armenia, such as Microsoft, Google and Oracle, are internationally headquartered with development teams based in the country. The government encourages expansion from these corporates with the implementation of its “open door” policy, designed to encourage foreign business owners and investment, with legal regimes that protect foreign capital. In 2012, Intel announced the launch of a new research center during the ArmTech Congress. US Ambassador to Armenia John Heffern reported the potential for IT growth, “The creative mind is the key to the future of Armenia. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a report based on UNESCO data, according to which Armenia is the first among CIS member states with the number of inventions per capita,” he said. The multinational joined global names such as Synopsys, D-Link and “virtualization giant” VMWare after its acquisition of IT startup Integrien — each running operations from the country and taking action to rouse a new generation of tech innovation. Synopsys, the largest global company in electronic design automation (EDA), with an annual revenue of over $2 billion USD, launched offices in Armenia in 2004. Today it is one of the largest IT companies in the country, with over 650 employees. It is also heavily involved in schemes to support rising talent. Synopsys collaborates with Armenia’s Polytechnic University to provide educational programs for students, and also hiring a large number of graduates. These initiatives work to support Armenia’s youth through education and increasing work availability for skilled Armenians. But large corporates are not the only option, a burgeoning startup scene enabled by new government tax reduction schemes is changing the face of Yerevan and attracting global attention. New legislation empowers entrepreneurs in Yerevan Yerevan is one of the oldest cities in the world. However this ancient transit hub has renewed energy as the center of Armenia’s startup scene. Recent legislation has made founding, operating and growing a tech startup in Armenia much simpler. After lobbying from the Union of Information Technology Enterprises (UITE), Armenian headquartered startups, tech centers, incubators and accelerations with fewer than 30 employees, now benefit from tax privileges. Yerevan is also home to two free economic zones (FEZ) where businesses that meet certain startup requirements can operate without paying VAT, profit, property and income tax, also escaping export customs duty charges. One of these is found in the area of the RAO Mars Closed Joint-Stock Company and Yerevan Research Institute of Mathematical Machines, and is designed to enable, manufacture and export of new technologies. Today, you really can launch a startup for a very low cost — and the effects of this are a growing startup ecosystem, and a culture of excitement. Armenian businesses are gaining traction and experiencing global recognition. Companies such as PicsArt, Triada Studios, Plexonic and BetConstruct are making waves in the tech industry, showing the enormous potential Armenia has as a center of innovation. Yerevan-based Triada Studio is the creator of puzzle app Shadowmatic, the winner of the prestigious Apple Design Award and App Store Best of 2015. Triada Studios launched in 1993 as a computer graphics and animation studio. Cofounder and CEO Ara Aghamyan described the “huge intellectual potential” in Armenia. Aghamyan claims the biggest challenge that the Armenian tech-scene faces today is the exodus of talent, as a large number of startups end up moving to the U.S. to raise capital and reach greater audiences. “We can only overcome this by creating an ecosystem that will not only make people stay in the country, but also attract great minds from all over the world,” he told me. The move to Silicon Valley Nigel Sharp is the former technical project manager for Armenia’s TUMO Center for Creative Technologies and founder of Armenia-based startup Lionsharp creator of Voiceboard, “the world’s first gesture and voice controlled presentation solution.” Sharp told PSFK that a poor track record of foreign investment “plagued with corruption and losses” has created a barrier to foreign investment. This distrust combined with the challenges of networking, common in any emerging startup hub, prevents many businesses from putting their creations in front of a global audience. This is made more difficult by limited access to entrepreneurial education, language differences and the need to travel. As a result, Armenian startups are moving to the U.S. to gain support, funding and improve their growth prospects. In April, photo-editing app PicsArt raised an additional $20M in VC, bringing its total funding to $45M and enabling the Armenia-born startup to grow its presence in China and Japan. In 2015, PicsArt’s CEO Hovhannes Avoyan relocated to join the company’s Chief Revenue Officer in San Francisco, helping to further solidify PicsArt’s recognition in the U.S. tech scene. PicsArt was later that year included on Forbes’s list of ”Hottest Startups of 2015”. Influencers in the tech world are making efforts to strengthen ties between Armenia and the US. In March Triada Studios’ Ara Aghamyan wrote to President Obama explaining the tech community’s role in developing US-Armenian commerce. He drew attention to the issue of double taxation that deters foreign investment and restricts growth for businesses that are based in Armenia. Shadowmatic is not the first to take a stand. PicsArt, Microsoft, FedEX, NASDAQ, Marriott, Grant Thorton and more have all gone on record in support of better economic relations to empower growth within the country. US advocates of Armenian tech growth Armenia’s enormous diaspora means that there are actually more Armenians living outside of the country: There are between seven to 10 million Armenians concentrated in Russia, the US and France, in contrast to just three million within the country. Second generations Armenians today also add to this global network actively working to support Armenia’s future growth. Co-founder of Inet Technologies, Sam Simonian and his wife Sylva founded TUMO Center for Creative Technologies; a free digital learning center in Yerevan, that provides classes for around 5,000 12-18 year olds working with new technologies. Armenia boasts a number of innovative centers such as TUMO, launched as a result of international advocates, and big partnerships. Former Twitter VP, Uber executive Raffi Krikorian, sits on the board at TUMO, and is active when it comes to supporting new startups, “Honestly, if you are Armenian, I will probably want to help you” he said in an interview with Repat Armenia. In 2011, Microsoft launched the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF). The center aims to enable IT growth by supporting students and startups. It offers programs such as coding bootcamps, training courses and workshops and startup acceleration schemes that include early-seed investment, helping to power a growing startup ecosystem. Entrepreneurs also benefit from a new emergence of enterprises such as the Center for Entrepreneurship and Executive Development (CEED) which this year launched the Armenia – US IT Acceleration Program with the EIF, the Government of Armenia and the World Bank, helping to connect new startups with global markets. As with any emerging industry Armenia’s startup scene struggles with limited cash flow and a need to respond quickly to changing tech. New businesses such as Armenia’s first virtual networking and startup accelerator, HIVE and the country’s first technology-focused VC firm, Granatus Ventures, help startups to get off the ground. However, in order to compete on a larger-scale, these businesses need to attract larger audiences and global investment. But the wheels are in motion, today it is far easier than ever before. As more business leaders draw attention to both the barriers that Armenia faces, but also the potential of this emerging industry, we can expect continued growth from this ancient center of innovation. https://thenextweb.com/asia/2017/03/17/armenias-rising-tech-scene-new-silicon-valley-former-soviet-union/#.tnw_5XcXTXyv [Next Article][Previous Article][Main Index] [ Reply to sender | Write to Groong ]

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (11) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Make your next move with a beautiful website and customized domain name.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

From the storage bits through to software defined cache hierarchy, there is so much to learn and to talk about. Over the last two years, unless you were living under a rock, it would have been hard to miss the level of attention that Intel's 3D XPoint technology (a co-venture with Micron) has been getting. Billed as a significant disruption to the storage market, and claiming an intersection between DRAM and SSDs as a form of non-volatile storage, many column inches have been devoted to the potential uses of 3D XPoint. Despite all this talk, and promises that Intel's Super 7 partners are well under way with qualifying the hardware in their datacenters, we are yet to actually see it come to market - or even be actively demonstrated in any sizeable volume at a trade show. We're expecting more information this year, but while everyone is waiting, Samsung has snuck up behind everyone with their new Z-SSD product line. The Z-SSD line was announced back at Flash Memory Summit, although details were scant. This was a PCIe NVMe storage technology using Samsung's new 'Z-NAND', which was aimed at the intersection between DRAM and SSDs (sounds like 3D XPoint?). Z-NAND is ultimately still baked in as NAND, although designed differently to provide better NAND characteristics. We still don't know the exact way this happens - some analysts have pointed to this being 3D NAND/V-NAND running in SLC mode, given some of the performance metrics, but this is still unknown. At Cloud Expo Europe, Samsung had a Z-SSD on display and started talking numbers, if not the technology itself. The first drive for select customers to qualify will be 800GB in a half-height PCIe 3.0 x4 card. Sequential R/W will be up to 3.2 GBps, with Random R/W up to 750K/160K IOPS. Latency (presumably read latency) will be 70% lower than current NVMe drives, partially due to the new NAND but also a new controller, which we might hear about during Samsung's next tech day later this year. We are under the impression that the Z-NAND will also have high endurance, especially if it comes down to fewer bits per cell than current NAND offerings, but at this point it is hard to tell. Initial reports indicated that Samsung was preparing 1TB, 2TB and 4TB drives under the Z-SSD banner. At present only the 800GB is on the table, which if we take into account overprovisioning might just be the 1TB drive anyway. Nothing was said about other capacities or features, except that the customers Samsung is currently dealing with are very interested in getting their hands on the first drives.

Always nice to see competition between currently the best SSD designers (junky Intel 600p notwithstanding)! Reply ddriver - Friday, March 17, 2017 - link Optane appears to be mostly hype, for we've heard so much about its superior density and now we hear it comes to consumers in the form of piny capacity "cache". Quite frankly, nand flash is good enough, all it needs is better caching, more cache and more intelligent controllers. That alone can do miracles in terms of performance, the rest is just parallelism, which increases the rate cache can be filled from or flushed to. Currently SSDs tend to do slower because they do controller level parallelism, so the low flash die count reflects negatively on the maximum throughput rates. But nand flash can be made incorporating die level parallelism, where one splits capacity to offer multiple channels per die, making it possible to achieve tens of gigabytes per second without the need of numerous dies, only bigger and more powerful controllers. Multi channel nand flash dies + more ram cache + better controllers + a trivial LiPo battery to facilitate larger cache flushing can produce ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE faster SSDs without the need of ANY new and as usual overpriced technology.

Reply garbagedisposal - Saturday, March 18, 2017 - link Another disabled/psychotic with nothing better to do than comment on technology news. What a sad way to live life. Reply MrSpadge - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link While I often disagree with ddriver complaining about something, and especially the way he's saying it, you trying to insult him with being disabled is definitely worse. At least he sometimes has objectively valid points. Reply fanofanand - Monday, March 20, 2017 - link Not to mention in this case he isn't wrong. Reply Samus - Sunday, March 19, 2017 - link dd, always good for s hoot. Reply Cellar Door - Friday, March 17, 2017 - link Its really great to have Samsung in the market - in the last 6+ years, they are the only company pushing the envelope. Intel goes and tries to squeeze and milk the market then BAM - 840 PRO, 850 PRO, 960 PRO. And to be fair at much lower premiums then what Intel charged when x-25 was around and would be charging end customers if they could. Reply ddriver - Friday, March 17, 2017 - link "Its really great to have Samsung in the market" - and its CEO is currently in court, the company lost a good 5+ billion on the note fiasco and is about to be dismembered into tiny pieces. That's what happens when a puppet begins to outshine its master. It gets knocked down couple of notches. And by puppet and master I mean the fact that S. Korea is a US puppet state.

Mesa 13.0.6 Graphics Stack Promises Better Vulkan Drivers, over 100 Improvements GO Various crashes have been fixed for all Gallium drivers Mar 17, 2017 19:47 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov informed the community about the upcoming availability of the sixth maintenance update to the Mesa 13.0 3D Graphics Library for Linux-based operating systems. Mesa 13.0.6 should arrive soon and promises to be a major patch adding over 100 improvements to various of the shipped graphics drivers, including all Gallium ones, for which various reported crashes have been resolved, as well as r300 with a fix for an old regression that should improve support for BE hardware. "On the GLX/EGL front we have crash fixes in GLX/DRI3, ResetNotificationStrategy matches the shared context for EGL, and eglQuerySurface returns correct geometry when running under X11/DRI3," reads the mailing list announcement for the Release Candidate version of Mesa 13.0.6. Intel ANV and Radeon RADV Vulkan driver improvements It also looks like the Mesa 13.0.6 update will include over a dozen improvements and bug fixes for both Intel ANV and Radeon RADV Vulkan drivers. The Intel OpenGL drivers received some attention providing better support for Sandy Bridge chipsets, better handling of GPUs without LLC (Last Level Cache), and improved swizzle clears. The RadeonSI graphics driver has been updated as well in Mesa 13.0.6 with improvements for Tessellation shaders on both Stoney and Carrizo GPUs, and the Nouveau video drivers for Nvidia graphics cards bring compute shader improvements on various nvc0 devices. As mentioned before, the Mesa 13.0.6 patch should be out very soon, in the coming days, but there's no release date set at the moment of writing this article. If things change and the Mesa developers publish the final release of Mesa 13.0.6, we'll update the article. However, Mesa 13.0.6 could be the last in the series, so upgrading to Mesa 17 is highly recommended. In the meantime, you can test drive the Release Candidate.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Autonomous cars at SXSW 2017: transportation panacea or a long road ahead? Autonomous cars at SXSW 2017: transportation panacea or a long road ahead? By Ben Algaze on March 17, 2017 at 1:00 pm Comment AUSTIN – In 2017, automakers and suppliers continuously tout advances in autonomous vehicle technology. Just this week, Intel agreed to acquire automotive vision technology leader Mobileye for $15 billion, looking to position itself for the next big market. At South by Southwest, much of the discussion on autonomous vehicles (AV) focused on the implications of the rush to get these vehicles on the nation’s and world’s roads in the next several years. While automakers have promised fully autonomous (SAE level 5) cars by 2020 to 2022, there are still many questions to be answered. What will be the impacts on drivers and passengers? How will roads accommodate these new vehicles, especially since the old fleet of non-autonomous vehicles will not be retired any time soon? How much will autonomous technology add to vehicle costs? How much intelligence will need to be built into infrastructure (roads, signals, parking, permissible places for unloading passengers) to enable the autonomous future? How will self driving cars impact insurance costs? How will it impact health infrastructure, as auto deaths are almost 40,000 per year in the U.S., with treatment needed for many more injuries? There are no easy answers for these questions, but municipal planners, academics, and the auto industry are working to model the effects of this transition. University of Texas professor Kara Kockelman has led research into a number of these areas. According to her models, even at a 10% penetration of AVs, the economic benefits alone (direct cost savings due to efficiencies) could be $26 billion a year, with comprehensive benefits of $38 billion a year. The comprehensive benefits include estimates on a variety of factors, such as decreased injuries and death from increased safety and beneficial impacts on the environment. No one can know for sure what the benefits – or the pitfalls – will be. But most are assuming a decrease in transportation costs from greater efficiency and safety, as well as potential benefits from redesigning parts of cities for AVs that may not need to be parked next to businesses or work places. Additional benefits are likely to come from better access and lower costs of transportation for seniors and people that may have a disability that keeps them from driving. All is not rosy, however, as states and counties control and fund the building of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure that supports cars. Most of these local governments have just started to look at this technology and how it might affect travel. Most plans for roads are started as much as 15-20 years ahead of deployment, and most of those plans are not looking at smart infrastructure that may be communicating and sharing information with AVs. Some planners believe that fully autonomous (level 5) capability will only be possible in combination with smart infrastructure, like traffic signals and signage and sensors in roadways. This may be because things like construction, rule changes (lanes that may be closed or reserved certain times of day, etc.) and other up to the minute information would help an AV to not get stuck in a situation it never encountered before. The human operator question In some cases, human oversight may be key to assist AV’s AI learning. Nissan’s approach to autonomy is human assistants in call centers. A human operator would guide a Nissan AV out of a bad spot or unmanaged situation, while the artificial intelligence engine learns from that experience. Maarten Sierhuis, director of Nissan’s Silicon Valley Research Center, said that in the initial deployment one human operator could oversee 20 AVs. With AI, that would scale to up to one operator per 100 cars or more. The remote guidance technology Nissan is developing is based in part on the Mars Rover system, and is a partnership between NASA and Nissan (Sierhuis worked previously at NASA). On the legal and policy side, there is a maze of laws that control vehicles and driving in the U.S. States have scrambled to develop regulations about autonomous testing of vehicles. Some states, like California, are forcing that a driver be able to take control of an AV at any time during testing. Testing regulations bills have passed in California, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, and Florida, but have failed in many states and are still under consideration in many more. Panelists at South by Southwest also mentioned several times how the insurance industry has been relatively quiet on the whole issue of AVs. In the long term, the potential for increased safety and less human drivers is likely to be detrimental to the insurance industry’s revenue. From a policy perspective in the US, local governments are seeking guidance and standard setting by agencies such as NHTSA so that we have a relative uniform set of rules across the country for AVs to roam freely. It would be difficult if it were illegal for an AV to cross a state line on an interstate if some state had not implemented its policy on the cars. It would also be difficult if AVs depend on some smart infrastructure that is either not implemented, or implemented with a different standard, which could force a human to take control of the car. There are many other things to think about — for example, whether there should be a minimum age for riding alone in an AV. Do consumers want these cars? Finally, where are consumers in all of this? Do people want to give up the pleasure of driving? In bumper-to-bumper traffic, probably, but it may be difficult in other situations where they might want to have full control of speed and route. Can you tell an AV to hurry and cut through the park on the way to Laguardia inform Manhattan? There is still that part of the automobile as an expression of freedom that consumers may be reticent to relinquish. All the computing power, lidar, and sensors that go into AVs also add costs. Do consumers want to pay for this? The trend over the last 40 years has been increasing regulation on cars to continue to add safety equipment. Seat belts, better bumpers, airbags, headrests, high-mounted taillights, European rules on pedestrian safety, and many more things have impacted car design and added complexity and cost for safety. Autonomous technology has the potential to be the greatest safety enhancement of all, but it will also be expensive. University of Texas’ Kockelman has done some research on that area too, estimating that AV technology can add up to $5,000 per vehicle compared with one without. When they asked consumers what they expect to pay for that technology, consumers were willing to pay about $1,000 for it. Whether it really will cost $5,000 more we won’t know until AVs go into mass production, and we are years away from that. But the consumer acceptance aspect is important. Her research also showed 88% of consumers think of themselves as good drivers, and many of them may not trust a car to drive them. The AV future is coming whether we are ready for it or not, because the technologies are rapidly maturing. How far away we are from driving to work while reading our email and catching up on our social feeds, watching the latest episode of The Daily Show, or otherwise not paying attention to driving is not completely clear. But what is clear is that a tremendous amount of work needs to be done from policy, legal, regulatory, infrastructure development, and consumer education standpoints for that future to become a reality.

Expensive, but understandably so. For The fastest graphics around Made to order customisation Beautiful design and build Against Not at all cheap Hardly portable The PC has always been seen as the enthusiast’s platform for gaming for two key reasons. Reason one, it’s invariably slightly more difficult to get playing than it is on consoles. But point two is more important: it’s nowhere near as static. We wait years for new mainstream gaming platforms, but the PC gets incrementally better all the time.  Adding extras over time isn’t exactly cost-effective, but an investment in PC gaming means you’ll get the finest graphical fidelity, the most control options, and your old games will only get better as your hardware does. But starting in the right place is vitally important. Begin your PC journey behind the curve and you’ll face an uphill battle from the start. On the other hand, pick up the cream of the crop, and you’ll get a good few years of performance before you even need to think about adding anything new. And that’s what we have here: Overclockers’ custom-built Titan Gladius brings together the absolute best components – the finest graphics card on the market, speedy storage, high-end RAM – tucked incredibly neatly inside a beautiful case. When you’re ready for more, there’s room to breathe.  Price, availability and value Since it’s built to order, the Titan Gladius comes in a number of configurations. You can skimp on the case, you can dial back on the CPU, you can cut all the corners you’d like. But equally, you can bump up the core specs. A serious gamer with a serious wallet wants the best, and every component of the  £2,160.88 (US $2,668 / AU $3,475, plus shipping from UK) setup we have here is built for speed.  There’s a reason it’s so pricey, of course. It’s built to order, meaning a short wait while a technician constructs it from available parts. Then there’s the internals; a liquid-cooled, 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake i7-7700k CPU is not cheap. Neither is 16GB of extremely fast Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM, or a huge, super-speedy Intel 512GB PCI-e SSD. Oh, and the fastest graphics card on the market right now: the 11GB Nvidia GeForce 1080Ti Founder’s Edition? That’s a good £500 more expensive than the still-awesome GeForce 1060.  Whether that’s good value or not depends on your perspective. You could get decent performance from a PC that costs the same amount you’d save by dropping down a graphical step – the mid-range Zoostorm Desktop Gaming PC will set you back just £499 (around $705, AU$950) and play games just fine. But for how long? Spec sheet Here is the Overclockers Titan Gladius sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 4.2GHz Intel Core i7-7700K (quad-core, 8MB SmartCache, up to 4.5GHz with boost) Cooler: OcUK Techlabs 240mm AIO Liquid Cooler with Noiseblocker Fans Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z270F Gaming (Socket 1151) ATX Motherboard Graphics: OCUK Nvidia GeForce 1080Ti Founder’s Edition (11GB GDDR5X RAM) RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 (3000MHz) PSU: Super Flower Leadex II 750W 80 Plus Gold Modular Power Supply Storage: Intel 600P 512GB PCI-e Solid State Drive, Seagate Barracuda 2TB 7200RPM SATA mechanical drive Ports: 4x USB 3.0 (rear), 2x USB 3.0 (front) 1x USB 3.1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.1 Type-C, LAN, 3x surround sound, line in, line out, 2x front audio ports, DVI/DisplayPort/HDMI (on-board), 3x DisplayPort/1x HDMI (graphics card) Size: 230 mm x 450 mm x 400 mm Warranty: 3 years Design Our Gladius comes clad in a stunning Phanteks Enthoo EVOLV ATX case, with easy-to-remove tempered glass sides, sandblasted aluminium, and a dark interior highlighted by a small amount of internal RGB LED lighting which runs on Asus’ Aura system – meaning you can light it up in all kinds of fancy ways.  While there’s no luridly-colored watercooling tubing or ridiculous extra fancywork, the whole package is incredibly clean and open. The Gladius’ cables have been impeccably managed, unneeded bays and options being removed. This is a clean, tidy desktop PC you won’t be afraid to show off. That tidy design extends to airflow, too: even under heavy load, the CPU radiator is quiet and well positioned, and the machine never spins up to jet-engine levels despite the muscle inside; Nvidia’s Pascal GPU architecture really is something in terms of its power to heat efficiently. The unit is, however, huge. It’s a mid tower, but on the tall end of that definition, and it’s very heavy – certainly not something you’ll want to lug to a friend’s house. Performance Have we said it enough in this review? Let’s say it again: this is a top-spec PC. And it performs as such even when you’re not running games on it; the enormous PCI-e SSD means software is quick to load and super-smooth, and the WIndows 10 desktop is predictably buttery.  Benchmarks Here’s how the Titan Gladius performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark Sky Diver: 45721; Fire Strike: 21587; Time Spy: 8715 Cinebench CPU: 1059 points; Graphics: 172.85fps Geekbench Single core: 6,019; Multi core: 19,754 PCMark 8 Home Test: 5,656 GTA V: 1080p, Ultra: 60fps; 1080p, Low: 187fps The only practical connectivity option it lacks is Wi-Fi, but if you can’t solve that little problem, you probably won’t be investing in a machine this expensive. But then, if you’re spending this kind of money, desktop performance is slightly irrelevant too. As you can see in our benchmarks boxout, the numbers this machine hits are astonishing, but not unexpected. Something will come along that challenges a collection of the highest-end hardware possible – and these benchmarks are the new target for whatever that is. The Titan Gladius consistently ranks in the top 95% of all machines. But there’s a reason why… Price The Titan Gladius costs more than this reviewer’s car. It might be significantly more fun and contain fewer food wrappers, but that’s not the point: you’re going to have to be dedicated to cutting edge PC gaming to stump up this kind of cash.  There’s no question that it’s worth it for some, but a first step on the ladder at the price of six PS4 Pros might be a bit much for the average gamer. We liked It’s gorgeous, it’s ridiculously powerful, and it’s ready to give you more once today’s top-line kit becomes tomorrow’s mid-range. Since that’s going to be a long time coming, you’re making an investment in a PC that will retain its bite well into the next decade – with room to spare for upgrades that’ll keep it healthy for years beyond that. We disliked However muscular this rig might be, it’s a tough sell with the components at today’s high-end prices. It’s also not going far from your desk – there’s no mobile solution that comes even close to this level of power. Final verdict You have alternatives. You can spend less money, you can play games on lesser hardware, you can upgrade your current rig to get close.  But without a whole new setup, you won’t get the absolute best. The Titan Gladius, specced as ours was, brings together the finest components available today, for just about the best PC you can buy. It looks great, it plays great, and you probably can’t afford it – but if you’re ready for that dream PC, this is a great way to look.

(CRI) Stock Shows Promise in Retail View All Posts Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) is a company I’ve liked for a long time, and I’ve been pounding the table on it especially hard since January. It was a stock I wanted all of my subscribers to own, and owning it certainly paid off on Monday when it was announced that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would buy the company for a 34.5% premium over Friday’s closing price. Source: Shutterstock But that doesn’t make INTC stock any more attractive to me. Intel will pay $63.54 a share, or about $15.3 billion, for Mobileye. The report came out first in an Israeli newspaper, then INTC made the formal announcement. As you may recall, the two companies were already partners, joining forces with BMW last year to put 40 autonomous 7-Series sedans on the road by the end of 2017 to train them to drive in urban areas. The goal of the partnership is to have fully autonomous vehicles on the market by 2021. Mobileye is a key player and innovation leader in the autonomous automobile industry — think driverless cars, driver assistance, collisions avoidance, etc. It’s in one of the hottest spaces in technology, and I’ve said for some time that it is an idea I believe will come to fruition much sooner than many expect. The driverless car in particular is one of the real potential wow factors right now. The acquisition is not only expected to accelerate innovation within the industry, but it’s also anticipated to position Intel as a leading player. On the press release, management said: “The transaction extends Intel’s strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that build on the company’s strength in computing and connectivity from the cloud, through the network, to the device.” The deal is expected to close within the next nine months and should be immediately accretive to both Intel’s earnings and free cash flow. INTC Stock Has Its Own Problems Now, I don’t always like to toot my own horn, but this is a deal I have felt for a long time would eventually happen. In fact, in August 2015 I said on my Fox Business Show, Making Money with Charles Payne, that I felt MBLY stock was worth hanging on to as I suspected it would be acquired one day. I’m glad I was right, because my Smart Portfolio subscribers locked in a 47% profit in two months.

Getting one Scout 100 offensive tackle for a class seems like it would be enough. But Oklahoma is getting greedy and vying for two when it comes to the 2018 class. Greedy is probably the wrong word because it’s not like offensive line coach Bill Bedenbaugh hasn’t put in the work with Moore (Okla.) Southmoore commit Brey Walker and Justin (Texas) Northwest’s Darrell Simpson. http://www.scout.com/player/200652-darrell-simpson?s=73 Walker, a five-star prospect ranked No. 12 in the Scout 100, has been committed to OU since November 2015, and it doesn’t seem like nothing is going to change that. Simpson, the No. 1-ranked offensive tackle in the state of Texas and ranked No. 43 in the Scout 100, has been a frequent visitor to Norman and was back at OU recently for junior day. “I feel like I’m getting real close to Coach Bedenbaugh,” Simpson said. “I’m still just trying to make sure everything is still cool with OU.” Wherever you see Walker, you’ve been bound to see Simpson as well in the last couple of years. Beyond their trips to Norman, both have been at The Opening regional in the Dallas area the last two years and both made the final five offensive linemen two weeks ago at the Frisco regional. “I do talk to Darrell whenever I can,” Walker said. “He’s a great player. A great offensive tackle. It would be great to have him at OU so of course I talk with him.” Simpson said the same thing about constantly interacting with Walker. The two mesh well because of their personalities. But not because they’re loud, it’s the opposite. Both Walker and Simpson shy away from the spotlight, which has probably helped build their bond even more. The four-star prospect said he’s not sure where he’s going to visit this spring. LSU is one school that would love to have Simpson on campus sooner than later. Simpson has no timetable but did say he believes his top 10 will be out before his senior season starts. There’s little fear of OU not making that list and a large part of the credit does indeed have to go to Bedenbaugh for knowing exactly what chord to strike. “He’s a laid back coach,” Simpson said. “There’s no pressure with him. He just really knows how to talk to people and that means a lot.” Simpson has been to OU so many times that it’s not like any visit trumps another. However, in getting to see what the Sooners are doing in terms of upgrading their facilities, that did bring out a smile from Simpson. “It’s really special what they’re doing in terms of building new things,” Simpson said. “It’s definitely something I’ll be watching.”   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout OU commit Trae Young earns Gatorade honor Patriots increase lead as Super Bowl favorite Take 3: Spring football is here for OU OU 17-for-2017: Best O-Line for Stoops?

Microsoft to make Windows 10 compulsory for new Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPUs? By Darren Allan Operating systems   Looks like updates are going to be disabled for Windows 7/8.1 Shares Last year, Microsoft made it clear that only Windows 10 would officially support the newest processors from Intel and AMD – Kaby Lake and Ryzen respectively – but a new support article posted by the company indicates that the plan is to go further than this, and effectively block these chips from running with Windows 7 or 8.1. Block them how, exactly? The article talks about Windows updates being disabled for Kaby Lake/Ryzen machines running these older operating systems, which presents a pretty much insurmountable barrier. With no patches coming through, your PC will be open to all sorts of potential exploits and security holes – much like those still running the hopelessly outdated Windows XP. The support article discusses the error messages a user may receive when trying to run one of these new CPUs on anything but Windows 10, including the following: “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” Previously, it was thought that users running these latest Intel or AMD processors with Windows 7/8.1 would simply be doing so at their own risk in terms of not having the correct driver support, and suffering from possible instability or incompatibility issues. But having updates blocked obviously takes the risk factor to a whole new level. Feast your eyes on the best gaming headsets of 2017 Hold up a minute Before we get too carried away, though, none of this is concrete – yet.  For starters, the language used in the Microsoft article isn’t all that firm in places. For example it states: “Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 devices that have a seventh-generation or a later generation processor may no longer be able to scan or download updates through Windows Update or Microsoft Update.” Note the use of the word ‘may’, although as to quite what the uncertainty is here – your guess is as good as ours. Furthermore, as InfoWorld (which spotted this development) observes, it doesn’t seem like this policy is live yet, or at least there’s no evidence of folks who have had their updates blocked. What may be the case here is that the support article has been put in place before the actual change comes in – and presumably it’s due to kick in sooner rather than later. Unless Microsoft sees the outrage which has erupted in some corners of the internet over this, accusing them of engaging in another underhand way to push Windows 10 upgrades – and the company thinks better of it. It wouldn’t be the first time that’s happened. Indeed, last year, Microsoft originally wanted to push those running Skylake CPUs (the previous generation to Kaby Lake) to upgrade to Windows 10 by withdrawing extended support for such PCs running Windows 7/8.1 come July 2017. Following the venting of much displeasure, the software giant quickly changed things, adding another year of breathing room and clarifying that critical security patches would still be supplied even after this deadline expired.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 17, 2017 8:40am   Comments Share: Related NVDA These Trends Bode Well For Nvidia, Microsoft Intel May Have Just 'Burned' $15 Billion On Mobileye More Trading Devoid Of The Thought Process (Seeking Alpha) Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC) $15 billion acquisition of Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) gives the company immediate access to the autonomous driving and driver safety markets. But after the acquisition, some analysts argued Intel will have a lot of catching up to do to industry leaders, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Intel now has even more catching up to do after Nvidia had a busy week in announcing new self-driving deals. Working With A Truckmaker Nvidia announced on Thursday it's working with PACCAR, a global truck manufacturer. The agreement calls for the companies working together to develop solutions for autonomous vehicles. PACCAR's CEO Ron Armstrong said it's exploring automated driving systems with Nvidia, which also includes artificial intelligence capabilities. Mass Market Cars Just one day prior to the PACCAR announcement, Nvidia said it's working with Bosch, the world's largest automotive supplier. As part of the new agreement, the two companies will also be developing artificial intelligence self-driving systems for mass market cars. Nvidia noted it's developing an artificial intelligence driving car computer, which is based on Nvidia's deep learning software and hardware. The technology will enable vehicles to learn the complexities of driving, operated autonomously while also receiving updates over the air with new features and capabilities.

Still, I know you clicked. This week there was plenty of interesting news, including Don Draper, The National Grid, CAPTCHA, vibrators and The Matrix. Read on... Samsung to launch facial-recognition for mobile payments The new Galaxy S8 will reportedly employ facial-recognition technology for mobile payments within months of release. In order to recover from the Note 7 fire fiasco and to compete against a new iPhone due for launch later this year, Samsung is targeting novel functionality. The S8 will be unveiled in March and use fingerprint, iris and facial detection to verify users accessing a range of services including Samsung Pay. Bloomberg has the story from an unnamed insider, with Samsung yet to comment. Google finally rids us of clunky CAPTCHA US brings criminal charges against Russian Yahoo-hackers U.S. prosecutors have issued criminal charges against two Russian FSB spies and two hackers for their part in the 2014 Yahoo hack that affected 500m accounts. 47 charges are being brought including conspiracy, computer fraud, and access device fraud. The hack saw names, email addresses, passwords and other details stolen. More from MIT Tech Review Ghost in the Shell marketing hijacked Paramount Pictures has a neat little campaign for the new Ghost in the Shell movie starring Scarlett Johansson. A trailer directs viewers to IAmMajor.me, which allows them to customise Major's declaration and produce a personalized poster. As ever, mischief makers on social media have caught the eye by using the tool to highlight the recasting of Japanese characters in the reboot of the anime series. Make your own at iammajor.me #IAmMajor @GhostInShell pic.twitter.com/8dRnruQmsz — Ray Low (@ray_w_low) March 14, 2017 Google's DeepMind to help the UK's National Grid DeepMind, the British AI company owned by Google is discussing a potential partnership with the National Grid to improve energy supply efficiency. The company is already working with the NHS on a number of interesting projects (including a blockchain-esque method of controlling patient data). DeepMind's technology has already been used to reduce the energy needed for cooling its data centres by 40% in 2016. More from City A.M. Smart vibrators tracked illegally We-Vibe is facing a $3m class action lawsuit after gathering data on its users' sexual activity. Parent firm Standard Innovation tracked data from smartphone apps used to control a partner's smart vibrator. The data included usage times and vibration intensity. Horrifyingly, hackers at the 2016 Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas revealed that the Bluetooth device was vulnerable to remote hijacking.  More from Wired. Image via We-Vibe. Intel makes biggest autonomous car acquisition Intel plans to acquire the autonomous car hardware firm Mobileye for $15bn, the biggest autonomous car acquisiton yet, and Intel's second biggest acquisition. Mobileye’s hardware is already used by many car manufacturers, notably by Tesla until last year, after fallout following a fatal Tesla crash. Intel hopes to be big in the market, with its acquired hardware and its own chip expertise likely to see it compete with Nvidia and Qualcomm. More from the New York Times. The Matrix to be rebooted Yes, that most glorious vision of a virtual reality created within an alien dystopia is to be reborn, according to The Hollywood Reporter. It is early days for the project, which the Wachowskis are apparently not involved in. A week of Twitter hacks The McDonald's Corp Twitter account was compromised yesterday (March 16), with quite funny consequences, even if it is a bit childish to say so. Ok this is funny pic.twitter.com/lWk1ArGcHv — Margarita Noriega (@margarita) March 16, 2017  More seriously, thousands of Twitter accounts were hacked this week and used to post Nazi hashtags in the wake of a diplomatic conflict between Turkey, Germany and the Netherlands. The hashtags #Nazialmanya (NaziGermany) and #Nazihollanda (NaziHolland), along with swastikas, appeared in posts from many notable accounts, including BBC North America and the UK Department for Health. This comes after the Turkish President had accused German and Dutch governments of Nazi-style tactics, after they stopped after Turkish government ministers from addressing political rallies in the countries. More from Reuters. Don Draper's Heinz campaign comes to life It's not digital news, but it's still cool for Mad Men fans. Heinz says it has "tapped" Sterling Cooper Draper Price to deliver the 'Pass the Heinz' creative seen in one episode of the hit show. The print and billboard ads will run in New York, with a helping hand from Heinz's agency DAVID Miami.

Microsoft no longer supports operating systems older than Windows 10 (because it's been out for so long now).     Microsoft is now gimping Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPUs on Windows 7/8.1, effectively forcing you to upgrade to Windows 10 - as they've thrown a processor check into the latest Windows Update for W7/8.1 - sneaky. This update prevents Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPU owners from downloading updates, with an error message that reads: "Your PC uses a processor that isn't supported on this version of Windows".   This doesn't mean Microsoft is completely throwing Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 away, it's only for the newer Kaby Lake and Ryzen CPU architectures. Microsoft is still issuing security patches to its older operating systems, but if you're rocking a new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K or Ryzen 7 1800X, you're done. Sorry, with no love, Microsoft.   NEWS SOURCES:Techspot.com Recommended for You Samsung to invest $7 billion in 7nm chips production... Qualcomm using Snapdragon 835 to dominate Helio X30...

Microsoft says it's blocking Windows 7, 8 patches on latest AMD, Intel chips Microsoft hasn't altered its earlier position, but it all seems a little harsh. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 17 March, 2017 10:00 0 - - - - print email When Microsoft said last year that it would restrict the latest Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Ryzen silicon to Windows 10, enthusiasts wondered what would happen if they tried running those PCs using Windows 7 or Windows 8. Now we know: no new patches. Word of a new Microsoft support document surfaced Thursday, applying the stick to those bold enough to try and pair an older Microsoft OS with the latest silicon. The upshot: Windows will block any updates from appearing on your PC until you upgrade to Windows 10. Specifically, you may see one of two error messages, Microsoft said: ”Unsupported Hardware: Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows  and you won’t receive updates.” ”Windows could not search for new updates An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error.” According to Microsoft, “This error occurs because new processor generations require the latest Windows version for support,” the document says. As Microsoft has stated before, those processor generations include Intel’s 7th-generation Core chips, AMD’s Bristol Ridge, or Ryzen, processors, and the Qualcomm 8996. Windows 10 is the only Microsoft OS supported on those chips, Microsoft said.  Microsoft representatives did not respond by press time when asked for comment. Why this matters: Unfortunately, Microsoft’s support document is entirely consistent with the stance the company has taken all along: that its most modern OS was built to go hand-in-hand with the capabilities of modern silicon. However, blocking Windows Update patches to those systems that use an older OS seems awfully draconian. Couldn’t Microsoft strive for some middle ground, such as a disclaimer that there might be some incompatibility? HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 More from HP Inc Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

An almost normal segment between CNN's Chris Cuomo and Rep. Sean Duffy suddenly descended into ridiculousness when Duffy changed topics to lie about U.S intelligence services for supposedly targeting Gen. Flynn and surveilling him. Um, they were surveilling the Russians, Sean. And all of a sudden there was Trump's National Security Adviser on the Russian's phone call. Really. That's what happened. At first Rep. Sean Duffy said Trump should show his evidence that Obama wiretapped him, and it appeared like CNN's New Day would have a fairly normal segment about how the wiretapping nonsense caused an international incident with the UK, but instead turned into a fight about "alternative facts," yet again. What was I thinking? As I was saying, Gen. Flynn's conversation was captured by U.S. Intel agencies because they were monitoring the Russians, but Rep. Duffy went on and on about how awful our Intel agencies are for targeting an American citizen. You know, the one who was working as a foreign agent. Host Chris Cuomo made all the right arguments and had the facts to back up what he said, but couldn't stop Duffy from changing topics from 'Trump should put up or shut up and apologize" about his wiretapping claim, to the LIE that "intelligence services are tapping American citizens and disclosing them." One can only assume Duffy is confusing the issues on purpose to cover up for Trump and particularly Flynn. Gen Michael Flynn, Rep. Sean Duffy, Wiretapping Click here for reuse options!

Aaeon closed out the Embedded World show by announcing a more compact and COM-like UP Core version of its community-backed UP board SBC. The similarly Linux- and Android-ready UP Core will soon hit Kickstarter with a price of $69 (vs. $89 retail) with a base level of 1GB RAM and 16GB eMMC. Also at Embedded World, Aaeon unveiled several IoT-oriented products, including a LoRa gateway based on the UP SBC (see farther below). UP Core (left) vs. original UP board (click images to enlarge) The main differences of the UP Core compared to the UP include the smaller size — 66 x 56.5mm vs. a Raspberry Pi-like 85.60 × 56.5mm for the UP board – and the fact that it ships with WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 BLE instead of a GbE port. The only coastline ports are an HDMI port and a USB 3.0 port. UP Core top and bottom views (click images to enlarge) You get the same 64 bit, “Cherry Trail” Intel Atom x5 Z8350 SoC that can be clocked at up to 1.84GHz. There is also a 500MHz Intel Gen 8 HD 400 GPU featuring 12 Execution Units. Aaeon supports the SoC’s Intel AES New Instructions and Intel Identity Protection Technology. UP Core detail views, front and back (click image to enlarge) The UP Core can be further equipped with up to 4GB DDR3L RAM and up to 64GB eMMC. In addition to the coastline HDMI and USB 3.0 ports, interfaces include a UART and 2x USB 2.0 headers, compared to 4x coastline USB 2.0 ports and 2x USB headers on the UP SBC. UP Core block diagram (click image to enlarge) A DSI/eDP interface is once again available, and there are dual MIPI-CSI camera interfaces instead of one on the SBC. The 0 to 60°C board has a 5V DC jack and an RTC. UP Core 100-pin expansion interface pinout (click image to enlarge) Instead of offering the RPi-compatible 40-pin expansion bus, there is now a 100-pin docking connector. Aaeon makes no claim of RPi compatibility, but the block diagram appears to suggest that the UP Core’s 100-pin expansion interface offers the signals required for implementation of a HAT40-compatible interface on a carrier board, plus “many more (PCIe, USB, HSIC,…” according to Aaeon. The company plans to offer several carrier boards for the UP Core, and will post free schematics for the carrier spec in order to encourage third party development (see farther below). Specifications listed for the UP Core include: Processor — Intel Atom x5-Z8350 (4x Cherry Trail cores @ 1.44GHz / 1.84GHz burst); Intel HD 400 Graphics (200MHz/500MHz) Memory — 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB DDR3L-1600 RAM; 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB eMMC flash Display/camera: HDMI 1.4b port with audio (via docking) eDP (DSI) 2x MIPI-CSI (2-lane and 4-lane) Wireless — 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n; Bluetooth 4.0 BLE; antenna Other I/O: USB 3.0 port 2x USB 2.0 via headers I2S audio (via docking) 100-pin docking connector to carrier with HAT40 compatibility Other features — RTC Power — 5V DC-in @ 4A 5.5/2.1mm jack Dimensions — 66 x 56.5mm Operating system — Linux (Ubuntu, ubilinux, Yocto); Android Marshmallow; Windows 10 (full); Windows 10 IoT Core   Community orientation Like the UP board, the UP Core offers a community website, hacker-friendly documentation, and lower prices than commercial Atom-based SBCs. Neither board, however, appears to be fully open source except for the UP Core’s carrier board spec. The UP is available with Ubuntu, ubilinux, and Yocto based Linux distributions, as well as Android, but Windows 10 and Windows 10 IoT seem to be the main course here. With regard to Linux, Aaeon says “we support and enable Linux, through our UP Community.” Additionally, Aaeon is launching an UP Core carrier board reward program in order to turn UP Core carriers into open source platforms. Aaeon will share several carrier board schematics that developers can modify, or they can design from scratch from the carrier spec. Developers then submit their designs for qualification, which will include an online poll of community users. Specs for four proposed UP Core expansion boards (preliminary) (click image to enlarge) Aaeon will then post the accepted designs on the UP community site. Third parties can manufacture boards, and in some cases, Aaeon will manufacture the boards to sell at the UP shop. Additional details are available in Aaeon’s overview of the UP Core Carrier Board Reward Program, available for download here [PDF]. UP Squared In October, Aaeon went to Kickstarter to launch the community-backed UP Squared SBC, due to ship to backers in April. Starting at $98, the UP Squared features a faster Intel Apollo Lake SoC, and offers up to 8GB DDR4 of RAM and up to 128GB eMMC 5.0. Additional features include 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE, dual HDMI, SATA, M.2, and mini-PCIe, as well as new 40- and 60-pin GPIO connectors. In addition, the original UP board has appeared in Aaeon’s UP-GWS0 gateway. It also forms the foundation of a Smart Vending Now platform from Aaeon and Kii that combines the UP with with Kii’s cloud-based IoT platform for vending machines. Meanwhile, Aaeon’s parent company Asus is prepping its own maker-oriented Tinker Board. The SBC runs Debian and Kodi on a quad-core 1.8GHz Cortex-A17 Rockchip RK3288, and offers 2GB RAM, GbE, 4K video, and RPi-compatible 40-pin connector.   An UP-based LoRa gateway In addition to introducing the UP Core, Aaeon announced a LoRa Gateway & Network Server that uses a gateway with an “UP Connect LoRa” board based on the UP board. The UP Connect LoRa board adds an IMST LoRa Radio concentrator. The LoRa gateway is integrated with a LoRaWAN network server from The Things Industries. The combined solution provides gateway and device management, data management, and representation services, says Aaeon. It also provides a high grade of security, incorporating encryption from sensor to application without intermediate decryption, says the company. We’ve seen several LoRa gateway products recently, including Dragino’s OpenWrt-based LoRa Gateways and SODAQ’s Arduino-compatible LoRaONE. The LoRa (Long Range Radio) spec is a low-power wireless technology, typically based on Semtec LoRa transceivers. Compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4g standard, LoRa operates at 868MHz and 915MHz, near the lower end of the GPRS range. A single LoRa gateway can service thousands of nodes, with a range of 2.5km in urban areas up to 15km in the suburbs. The power-efficient technology uses a spread spectrum modulation type with wide-band linear FM pulses. LoRa is typically used in LoRaWAN networks, often deployed in European “smart city” networks. This Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) protocol for IoT is overseen by the LoRa Alliance. LoRa radios also support a more advanced Symphony Link protocol for more industrial and enterprise applications. At Embedded World, Aaeon also announced Spring 2017 availability of an Aaeon UP IRQF Starter Kit for IoT developers. The UP board based starter kit, which will be supported with workshops, enables developers to rapidly prototype and develop wireless- and sensor-enabled IoT products with a Microsoft Azure backend. The products use the AES-128 encryption features of the IRQF 4.0 operating system. Finally, at Embedded World, Aaeon demonstrated a pairing of the UP board with Emutex’s Linux-based ubiworx IoT software framework for embedded systems. The demonstration showed off smart home IoT solutions with the ubiworx-enabled UP board.   Further information The UP Core will appear soon on Kickstarter starting at a price of $69 (vs. $89 retail). More information may be found on Aaeon’s UP Core page on the UP-Board community site.

Previous Article Video: Watch AWS Try to Blow up Its Snowball Data Transfer Box Next Article Ascenty Secures $190M to Fund Data Center Construction in Latin America Microsoft Project Olympus server (Image: Microsoft) Blades, Data Center World, Featured, Microsoft, Open Compute Meet Microsoft, the New Face of Open Source Data Center Hardware by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on March 15, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet If you’re running a cloud platform at Microsoft’s scale (30-plus regions around the world, with multiple data centers per region) and you want it to run on the best data center hardware, you typically design it yourself. But what if there are ideas out there — outside of your company’s bubble — that can make it even better? One way to find them is to pop your head out as much as possible, but which way do you look once you do? There’s another way to do it, and it’s proven to be quite effective in software. We’re talking about open source of course, and Microsoft — a company whose relationship with open source software has been complicated at best — has emerged as a pioneer in applying the open source software ethos to hardware design. Facebook, which has been a massive force in open source software, became a trail blazer in open source data center hardware in 2011 by founding the Open Compute Project and using it to contribute some of its custom hardware and data center infrastructure designs to the public domain. But there’s been a key difference between Facebook’s move and the way things work in open source software. The social network has been open sourcing completed designs, not trying to crowdsource engineering muscle to improve its infrastructure. Late last year, Microsoft, an OCP member since 2014, took things further. In November, the company submitted to the project a server design that at the time was only about 50 percent complete, asking the community to contribute as it takes it to 100 percent. Project Olympus (that’s what this future cloud server is called) is not an experiment. It is the next-generation hardware that will go into Microsoft data centers to power everything from Azure and Office 365 to Xbox and Bing, and it’s being designed in a way that will allow the company to easily configure it to do a variety of things: compute, data storage, or networking. Learn about Project Olympus directly from the man leading the charge next month at Data Center World, where Kushagra Vaid, Microsoft’s general manager for Azure Cloud Hardware Infrastructure, will be giving a keynote titled Open Source Hardware Development at Cloud Speed. There’s a link between the design’s modularity aspect and the open source approach. Microsoft wants to be able to not only configure the platform for different purposes by tweaking the usual knobs, such as storage capacity, memory, or CPU muscle, but also to have a single platform that can be powered by completely different processor architectures — x86 and ARM — and it wants to have multiple suppliers for each — Intel and AMD for x86 chips, Qualcomm and Cavium (and potentially others) for ARM. The sooner all the component vendors get involved in the platform design process, the faster a platform will emerge that’s compatible with their products, goes the thinking. Read more: Why Microsoft Says ARM Chips Can Replace Half of Its Data Center Muscle “Instead of having a team do everything in-house, we can work with these folks in the ecosystem and then bring the solutions to market faster, which is where differentiation is,” Kushagra Vaid, general manager for Azure cloud hardware infrastructure, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. “So, it’s been a completely different development world from that standpoint versus what we used to do.” Making Data Centers Cheaper to Operate Microsoft has already seen the benefits of going the Open Compute route with its current- and previous-generation hardware developed in collaboration with suppliers. Project Olympus widens the pool of potential engineering brainpower it can tap into. About 90 percent of the hardware it buys today is OCP-compliant, meaning it fits the basic standard parameters established by the project, such as chassis form factors, power distribution, and other specs. It hasn’t always been this way. Microsoft’s Project Olympus servers on display at the Open Compute Summit in Santa Clara in March 2017 (Photo: Yevgeniy Sverdlik) The company started transitioning to a uniform data center hardware strategy for its various product groups around the same time it joined OCP. The goal was to reduce cost by limiting the variety of hardware the groups’ infrastructure leads were allowed to use. And Microsoft decided it would make that hardware adhere to OCP standards. So far, Vaid likes the results he’s seen. Standardization has helped the company reduce hardware maintenance and support costs and recover from data center outages faster. A Microsoft data center technician no longer has to be acquainted with 10 to 20 different types of hardware before they can start changing hard drives or debugging systems on the data center floor. “It’s the same hardware, same motherboards, same chassis, same racks, same management system, it’s so much simpler,” Vaid said. “They spend less time to get the servicing done. It means fewer man hours, faster recovery times.” One Power Distribution Design, Anywhere in the World Project Olympus is the next step in Microsoft’s pursuit of a uniform data center infrastructure. One of the design’s key aspects is universal power distribution, which allows servers to be deployed in colocation data centers anywhere in the world, regardless of the local power specs, be they 30 Amp or 50 Amp, 380V, 415V, or 480V. The same type of rack with the same type of power distribution unit can be shipped for installation in Ashburn, London, Mumbai, or Beijing. The only thing that’s different for each region is the power adaptor. This helps Microsoft get its global hardware supply chain in tune with data center capacity planning, and few things have more bearing on the overall cost of running a hyper-scale cloud – and, as a function of cost, end-user pricing — than good capacity planning. The less time passes between the moment a server is manufactured and the moment it starts running customer workloads in a data center, the less capital is stranded, which is why it’s nice to have the ability to deliver capacity just in time, when it’s needed, as opposed to far in advance to avoid unexpected shortages. “Essentially we can build a rack one time, and after it’s built we can very late in the process decide which data center to send it to, without having to worry about disassembling it, putting in a new PDU,” Vaid said. “It all delays the deployment.” Taking Cost Control Away from Vendors If the Project Olympus design was 50 percent done in November, today it’s about 80 percent complete. Vaid wouldn’t say when Microsoft is expecting to start deploying the platform in production. The company still maintains a degree of secrecy around timing of deployment of its various technologies. He also had no comment on the report that surfaced earlier this month saying Hewlett Packard Enterprise was expecting Microsoft to cut back on the amount of data center hardware it would buy from the IT giant. The report was based on anonymous sources, and Vaid pointed to the fact that HPE was listed as one of the solution providers involved in Project Olympus. HPE of course was one of several on the list, along with Dell, ZT Systems, Taiwanese manufacturers Wiwynn and Quanta, and China’s Inspur. That’s one of the biggest reasons behind OCP to begin with. The hyper-scale data center users drive the design, while the suppliers compete for their massive hardware orders, leaving little room for suppliers to differentiate other than on price and the time it takes to deliver the goods, flipping the world upside down for companies like HPE and Dell, who until not too long ago were enjoying market dominance. “We have full control of the cost,” Vaid said. “We can take what we want, we can take out what we don’t want, and the solution providers are just doing the integration and shipping.” Previous Article Video: Watch AWS Try to Blow up Its Snowball Data Transfer Box Next Article Ascenty Secures $190M to Fund Data Center Construction in Latin America Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

(Google Photo) Rep. Zack Hudgins, D-Tukwila A new bill in the Washington State House of Representatives seeks to regulate testing of autonomous vehicles, deal with insurance issues, and potentially create a mechanism for licensing driverless car occupants and manufacturers once the technology is ready for public use. House Bill 2131 was introduced late last month, and it isn’t meant to be voted on this session, said Rep. Zack Hudgins, D-Tukwila, a former program manager at Amazon and Microsoft and one of the bill’s co-sponsors. Legislators have been discussing autonomous vehicles throughout the last year, and the bill is meant to continue the conversation between lawmakers, government agencies and autonomous vehicles manufacturers about the nascent technology. The state, Hudgins said, is not ready for these vehicles to hit the road, and this bill aims to get various government agencies ready to deal with driverless cars. Hudgins said the bill language was mostly plucked from regulations in California. He went this way because these regulations are a known quantity, so rather than coming up with an entirely new set of rules, he wants to improve something that is already on the books elsewhere. “The bill doesn’t go into too much depth,” Hudgins said. “The bill itself isn’t trying to regulate autonomous vehicles in our state as much as start the discussion about what regulation would look like.” We’re still a long way from seeing driverless cars alongside regular vehicles at rush hour. But several companies are working on it. Among the most advanced is Google autonomous vehicle spinout Waymo, which is testing its driverless car technology in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland and other cities around the country. Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye, announced earlier this week, is another sign of the burgeoning technology in this sector. Mobileye makes sensors and camera for self-driving cars. Before going from testing to releasing driverless cars to the public, manufacturers would first have to be certified by the state’s Department of Licensing. The bill also stipulates that vehicles should have mechanisms to turn autonomous mode on and off, and means to notify drivers when the driverless system has malfunctioned. DOL would have the authority to add more rules in the future, like caps on the number of autonomous vehicles on public roads and new requirements for operators of driverless cars. According to the bill, makers of driverless cars would be required to store sensor data in the event of a crash while a vehicle is an autonomous mode in order to get a clear picture of what happened. Once driverless cars become available to the public, the bill requires manufacturers to disclose the data they are collecting. Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association. Hudgins emphasized that nothing in the bill is set in stone, and he hopes that the industry and other experts can help shape rules as the technology itself comes into focus. “There’s an old adage: If you want to find out what’s wrong with your idea put it in bill form and drop it,” Hudgins said. “That’s what we are doing. We’re throwing the bill out there and saying, ‘OK tell us what’s wrong with it.’ That’s the feedback loop that we’re looking for.” Not everyone is happy with Hudgins’ approach. Michael Schutzler, CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association, said there is still so much to learn about autonomous vehicles, and we don’t know what the technology is going to look like a couple years from now. As a result, he said, it is way too soon to regulate this technology. Other states have allowed testing free of regulation, Schutzler said, and then worked with manufacturers to get data and start building regulations around that. Schutzler told GeekWire that this bill, as is, does not lay out a clear path of regulations from testing to large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles. He encouraged proponents of the bill to take a look at the research available from tests in other states and apply it to HB 2131. Schutzler warned that the current version of the bill could hurt Washington’s ability to be a hub for development and testing of driverless cars. But, he said he is in favor of bringing in subject matter experts to improve the legislation and set the stage for regulation of autonomous vehicles. “There will be useful, relevant regulation of autonomous vehicles,” Schutzler said. “We are very supportive of the desire to draft, but we are not supportive of passing a bill at this time.” An Uber self-driving car in Pittsburgh. (Uber Photo) Hudgins and Schutzler agree that autonomous cars will drastically change travel in a variety of ways. Schutzler pointed to the established rules of the road and how they will be disrupted. Anyone who has driven consistently knows conditions, and drivers, are different everywhere. Algorithms and systems underpinning autonomous vehicles will have to take into consideration the unique nature of driving conditions in different cities. Driverless cars will force changes to infrastructure, such as optimizing road signs and stoplights so that autonomous vehicles can read them, and Schutzler argues that regulating this new technology goes far beyond the vehicles themselves. New rules should complement each other in the same way that traffic laws work together to roads and highways. “A whole bunch of systems are going to be required for autonomous vehicles to be on the road at same time as regular cars,” Schutzler said. “All those systems will create safety mechanisms that will probably end up in cars with drivers. There’s so much still yet to be figured out that we are really far away from, that to regulate just the cars, is almost silly thing to think about. It’s actually an entire system that needs to be regulated.” Hudgins said he is thinking about how driverless cars will affect other regulatory structures. For example, he said, Washington has laws requiring steering wheels in all vehicles. With autonomous vehicles, laws like that could become outdated and have to change. What happens if a car without a driver gets into accident? How does that work from an insurance perspective? These are some of the questions Hudgins wants to hash out before these cars hit the road. Additionally, the state passed a $16 billion transportation package in 2015 that will lead to a lot of new road projects. By the time many of those projects are done, autonomous vehicle technology could be ready for public consumption, so Hudgins wants to have rules and regulations in place so that they can be integrated with new projects as they are coming together rather than being forced to work retroactively to fit things together.

For more than a decade Joan worked as a documentary reporter for The National. She was also posted to Mexico City as CBC TV's Latin American bureau chief and opened CBC Radio's first bureau in Africa, covering the Rwandan genocide and South Africa's violent transition from apartheid to the democratic election of Nelson Mandela Related Stories White House eyeing executive order targeting 'conflict minerals' rule: sources Trump moves to ease Wall Street regulations, review 'fiduciary rule' for retirement advisers We know about conflict diamonds, but what about conflict gold Apple touts progress on suppliers' labour, environmental practices Intel says processors now free of 'conflict minerals' External Links Enough Project compliance cost analysis Proposed executive order (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) A battle involving some of America's most powerful men and some of Africa's most powerful warlords is being waged in Donald Trump's White House. At stake are billions of dollars, child labour, sexual violence, and the precious minerals that make our tech gadgets work. Soon after Trump took office, his plan to suspend the law on what are known as conflict minerals was leaked to the media. White House eyeing executive order targeting 'conflict minerals' rule Coltan: a new blood mineral The law was part of former president Barack Obama's 2010 financial reform package known as the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1502 of the act requires U.S. companies to avoid using conflict minerals from Congo and surrounding countries that are used to fund war, perpetuating human rights atrocities. It also asked companies to track their global supply chains and provide independently audited reports to the Securities Exchange Commission. U.S. President Donald Trump has drafted an executive order targeting a rule requiring U.S. companies to disclose whether their products contain 'conflict minerals' from a war-torn part of Africa and to report on their supply chains. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Rights groups called the transparency law groundbreaking. "The conflict minerals law is a vital way of breaking the chain between horrific human rights abuses in Central Africa and consumer products like smartphones," said Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty International's director of global issues. Tantalum, tin, tungsten (the 3Ts) and gold — heavily mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) — are referred to as conflict minerals because of the immense profits they bring in help warlords finance their wars with rival armies and the Congolese military. The Enough Project, a Washington-based NGO, refers to what is happening in the DRC as the deadliest conflict since the Second World War, with more than 5.4 million people killed since the late 1990s and millions more displaced. "The whole point of [Section 1502] was to remove the warlords," adds Joanne Lebert, executive director of Ottawa's non-profit Partnership Africa Canada. "So this is going to send a signal that it's carte blanche. They can do whatever they want." Industry fights back, wins partial victory Big business and some U.S. Republicans have spent years trying to get Section 1502 repealed or radically revised. From the very beginning, then-chair of the SEC, Mary Jo White, said that while she personally would like to see an end to the human rights atrocities in the DRC, the new law seemed "more directed at exerting societal pressure on companies to change behaviour, rather than to disclose financial information that primarily informs investment decisions." Apple touts progress on suppliers' labour, environmental practices Intel says processors now free of 'conflict minerals' In May 2012, Franklin Vargo, vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the largest industrial trade group in the U.S., testified at a House subcommittee that while NAM also abhorred what was going on in the DRC, the new rules would pose a potentially huge financial burden on his membership.

(Finbarr O'Reilly/Reuters) Later that year, three of America's largest industry associations — NAM, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable (a group of top CEOs) — filed suit against the SEC, hoping to repeal the conflict minerals law. Trump expected to roll back U.S. fuel-economy requirements Trump moves to ease Wall Street regulations, review 'fiduciary rule' for retirement advisers They won a partial victory when the court ruled that the requirement to describe products as having "not been found to be DRC conflict-free" violates the First Amendment. The rest of the law, involving documenting product supply chain and reporting to the SEC, was upheld in 2014 and then again in 2015. As the legal battles were playing out, rights and development groups were working to let the public know what mining conditions are like in the DRC. Their highest profile campaigner was House of Cards actress Robin Wright. Wright stars in a documentary called When Elephants Fight, the name taken from the African proverb, "when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers." It means that in conflicts between the powerful, it is the weak who are hurt. We know about conflict diamonds, but what about conflict gold The film documents warlords using slave labour in the mines and children forced at gunpoint to dig with their hands for the minerals that fire up our smartphones and laptops. "We are using these devices all day, every day, for our convenience and it's basically perpetuating a war," Wright said. "I find it unacceptable that as consumers we allow this to go on." DRC 'most dangerous' for women Sexual violence is also often fuelled by the militias and armies warring over conflict minerals, says The Enough Project's co-founder John Prendergast. "The Congo war has the highest rate of violence against women and girls in the world," he said. "And reports indicate that hundreds of thousands have been raped, making it the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman or girl." Human rights abuses, specifically sexual violence, have been widely reported by NGOs at small-scale artisanal mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo. (Evelyn Mayanja) Softening the profits-over-people optics, tech giants Apple, Blackberry, Motorola and Intel have decided to move away from allowing conflict minerals into their products and toward using ethically mined 3Ts. Cobalt mined with child labour used by Apple, Samsung, Sony & others, says Amnesty Intel made it clear the company wanted to be seen as a socially conscious industry leader. In early 2014, CEO Brian Krzanich announced that all of the company's microprocessors released that year would be free of conflict minerals. "As a shareholder, you should care about this, you should want us to address it," Krzanich said in a keynote speech to the SEC. "It did cost us a lot to set up this program, but now it's running, the cost of the actual materials is no more." Tech companies supporting due diligence After Trump's plan to suspend the conflict mineral law was leaked, Intel, Apple and a few other companies let it be known that regardless of whether the law was scraped, they would continue sourcing only ethically mined minerals. Jewellery giant Tiffany & Co. also weighed in with a written statement urging U.S. Congress "to support legislation that effectively promotes due diligence and transparency for the source of all conflict metals and gemstones." Apple to track suppliers' sourcing of conflict minerals Intel says its chips and processors are now free of conflict minerals Six years later, inspectors determine which mines are ethically run or "green" and the specially tagged 3Ts are shipped to smelters that are part of the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI). Companies are then expected to buy their supplies from only CFSI smelters. The Enough Project's Sasha Lezhnev believes the system is working. "In 2010, the UN said nearly every mine was controlled by a military actor," Lezhev says. "Now 79 per cent of miners are working in mines that are conflict free." Getting around the rules Evelyn Mayange, who is writing her PhD thesis on conflict minerals at the University of Manitoba, doesn't share that assessment. She says there is a desperate lack of independent monitors in the DRC, and that conflict minerals are smuggled into neighbouring countries and green-washed as they go. There is corruption, she says, at every level. "I interviewed custom officials, and two told me that when the minerals are brought from the mines, they're paid money and they just put a tag on the bags," said Mayange. "Then they go as if they're conflict free." Having recently returned from a research trip to the DRC, Mayange argues that Section 1502 of Dodd-Frank needs to be strengthened, not struck down. She says the mines need closer scrutiny on the use of child labour and sexual violence. "Of the mines I visited, 50 to 70 per cent were children. Some are working as miners, some as porters, some in prostitution, and others are just there as beggars, looking for ways to survive," she said. Mining sites in the eastern regions of the DRC employ children who work alongside adults. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that governments should protect children from work that is dangerous or might harm their health or education. (Evelyn Mayanja) Still, many believe the U.S. conflict mineral law is a critical start. Dozens of human rights, social and religious groups in the DRC and neighbouring countries are pleading with the Trump administration to keep the regulation in place. Child soldiers on front lines of Congo conflict An open letter by Congolese civil rights leader Jamal Usseni Jamael read, in part, that suspending the Dodd-Frank rule "will have negative consequences for millions" in eastern DRC. He said rebel groups will "find the means" to finance the war. "They will kill the children, they will rape the women. They will destroy all hope for the Congolese people to live in peace in their own territory."

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Tesla bulks up checking account ahead of Model III… Tesla bulks up checking account ahead of Model III production run By Bill Roberson — March 16, 2017 12:35 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: They’ve got some robots they need to buy Tesla is gearing up for mass production of its “affordable” Model 3 electric car with a fundraiser of sorts. Despite its popularity, Elon Musks’ electric car company operates pretty close to the bone financially, so they’re issuing stock to pad their checking account with just over a billion dollars, although Wall Street thinks they’re hoping to raise about $2.5 billion. Sources say Musk is actually buying about $25 million dollar in stock himself. Always nice to see the boss buy some of the baked goods. Musk says Model 3 production is scheduled to hit 5,000 cars a week this year and 10,000 a week by next year. They’ll need the capacity as pre-orders for the $35,000 car hit nearly 500,000 units after it was announced. Tesla also noted they’re working on plans for Gigafactory numbers 2,3,4 and 5 as well, so as usual, all of Tesla’s plans are… really big plans. When is the “Pringle” line coming out? Hot on the heels of their Ryzen 7 series of CPUs, AMD has announced the 5 series, which take aim at Intel’s Core i5 line of silicon chips. AMD hasn’t revealed full performance specs for the series yet, but expect them to be on par or a bit better than Core i5 stats at a slightly lower price. The base 3.2ghz Series 5 chip will go for $169, with the top-spec 3.6ghz, 6-core “1600X” variant selling for $249. All the chips can be overclocked or “boosted” for more performance, providing you can properly cool it inside your PC. The new chips will be available on April 11th, and later this year, AMD plans to introduce an even more affordable “3-series” line of CPUs, so stay tuned. I can see clearly now Anyone think the iPhone 8 or iPhone Pro or whatever it’s going to be called won’t be a big deal? Don’t tell that to Netflix, which Mac Rumors says it is planning to offer High Dynamic Range mobile content soon – especially in light of what is expected to be a very, very high-quality OLED screen on the next iPhone. How much that will enhance your Iron Fist viewing experience while riding a commuter train is up for debate, but hey, better is always… better, right? Well, we should probably just get ready for HDR content pretty much everywhere. The new LG G6 halo phone has an AMOLED screen that is both HDR 10 and Dolby Vision HDR compliant, and new tablets from just about everyone are expected to start incorporating HDR-spec performance in top level models. No complaints here, and we’ll know much more about the iPhone 8 in September. We’ve got more news on our Facebook page and YouTube channel, and be sure to tune in to this week’s DT podcasts: Close to the Metal (computers and such) on Tuesday, Trends with Benefits (general tech shenanigans)  on Thursdays, and Between the Streams (movie and TV topics) every Friday.

Skip to main content PC Games news and reviews from PCGamesN.com Reviews Hardware About Mass Effect: Andromeda|18 March 2017 Mass Effect: Andromeda PC graphics, performance and 4K analysis - the PCGamesN tech review By Matt Purslow Subscribe to PCGamesN on YouTube We’ve spent five years waiting, like Reapers lurking in dark space, but Mass Effect: Andromeda has finally dropped out of warp and is ready to be downloaded onto planetside hard drives. But is the PC version primed for flawless atmosphere breach, or does it need further calibrations? We’ve analysed every preset, setting, and option to find out just how well Andromeda runs on PC. Welcome, Pathfinder, to the PCGamesN tech review. Need to know how to fight aliens? Learn all there is to know with our Mass Effect: Andromeda combat guide.  Our tech reviews are written to offer you the broadest picture possible, focusing on hardware similar to what the majority of players have installed in their machines. We test the game on all graphical settings using an i5 powered rig with 8GB of RAM, and try to hit 60 fps with four of the most popular graphics cards. Even if your PC is not identical to our test set ups, you should still be able to estimate the performance levels you can expect from your own machine.  Graphics options (larger image)  Mass Effect: Andromeda gets off to a bumpy start with its graphical settings menu, which feel a little on the amateur side. Forgetting that they don’t feel very Mass Effect in aesthetic, they make terrible use of screen space and offer very few tooltips to help explain what each setting does. The list scrolls slowly, and requires multiple scrolls to see the entire list. It’s a pretty poor layout.  Thankfully the menus do include everything required to tailor Andromeda to your hardware. 12 different settings feels a little on the short side, but among them are the vitals like texture detail and filtering, terrain and vegetation quality, meshes, and lighting and shadows. Anti-aliasing comes in the form of FXAA and Temporal AA, while ambient occlusion is offered up in SSAO, HBAO, and HBAO Full flavours.  There’s a few personal preference settings such as an on/off toggle for film grain and chromatic aberration. You can also scale the resolution, maintaining your native resolution for the overall image but rendering the game at a lower setting.  Andromeda will auto-detect graphical settings for you, and it generally seems to select sensible, well performing options. You can take control yourself with the presets, opting for low, medium, high, or ultra. It’s important to note that when using these presets the game will use resolution scaling as a tool; at low the game will render at 720p and medium at 900p. If you’d rather stay at native resolution you’ll need to make a custom setup in order to prevent the scaling.  Outside of graphic options there’s a solid set of control settings, including a complete key rebinding menu and mouse sensitivity sliders for every movement function (on foot/in vehicles etc). You can also ‘multiply’ the field of view, making the viewing area larger in-game. Graphics analysis Tested on an Intel i5 6500k @3.2GHz, 8GB of RAM, Nvidia GTX 1060, Windows 10 For our graphics analysis we compare screenshots taken on the four standard presets of ultra, high, medium, and low. To apply any settings changes you’ll have to reset the entire game. Most modern games require exiting to the main menu, but it seems excessive to require a complete reboot. As you can imagine this is incredibly annoying when making several minute changes to maximise frame rates.  Ultra (larger image) Andromeda is a new galaxy, and BioWare have made a concentrated effort to make that apparent with the look of the game. This feels like a true generational leap ahead of Mass Effect 3, with beautifully bumpy rock formations, dense (and very weird) plant life, and mists that hang close to the ground. The lighting work is similarly strong, making the skyboxes feel genuinely sunny and offering dark, soft shadows in the more shady areas of the scene. Things look slightly hazy and unfocused in the mid-distance, but overall Andromeda produces a beautiful image on ultra settings.  This most demanding preset runs well on our GTX 1060-powered rig, too. With an average frame rate of 65 fps and a low of 47, it’s a very smooth and stable performance. It should be noted that we use the 6GB variant of the GTX 1060; BioWare’s tales of 30 fps with the same card applies to the 3GB version.  High (larger image) The high preset retains most of the quality of ultra with just a few minor changes to help boost performance. Immediately noticeable is the dramatic decrease in mist effects, although what remains still looks authentically wispy. Other changes require a closer look, such as the reduced tessellation in the rock surfaces. You can see on the floor area where certain ridges have been removed and smoothed over, but you certainly need to inspect thoroughly to find the changes.    These small changes result in an equally small performance boost; an average of 70 fps and a low of 54 fps. Medium   (larger image) A more obvious change in quality can be seen on the medium preset, most obviously in the lighting. It’s less complex, with there being a more obvious contrast between light and shadow. The terrain has also been reduced in quality, with even more of the small bumps and ridges having been smoothed out. The overall line work is far fuzzier than at high, with the Ryder’s armour looking notably poorer. While some of this is due to reduced anti-aliasing, the medium preset also scales the image down to 900p, which certainly does it no favours.  You’d hope that such concessions would result in a large performance jump, and thankfully it does. On average medium will net you 125 fps, with a low of 70 fps.  Low (larger image) At the lowest end of the graphical spectrum Andromeda looks a bit of a mess. With its blurry image and smoothed-out models it takes on the appearance of a voxel-based game, or a film viewed through a jar of incredibly dense transparent goo. Any detail is eradicated by the combination of low-grade textures and the 720p resolution, and the lighting work feels incredibly artificial.  As you’d expect, there’s a healthy performance boost for such a downgrade. Our rig managed an average of 163 fps, and bottomed out at 88 fps. I couldn’t recommend using low though; it’s not just rough-looking, it destroys the cinema of the game.  Performance benchmarks  To see how Mass Effect: Andromeda performs on various hardware setups, we have tested the game on four graphics cards; two from Nvidia, and two from AMD. We’ve sampled the most popular cards from the current and last generation of GPUs in order to offer the most useful information.  All four cards were tested at ultra settings, with every texture option up as high as they’ll go and every graphical effect turned on. For the test we played a three-minute sample that involved dynamic weather effects, running, climbing, cutscenes, and combat. The same section is repeated three times in order to find an average.  In the graph below you can see how all four cards perform.  As mentioned previously, there’s a very clear generational leap apparent in Andromeda’s graphics, and you can see that an older card like the AMD R9 380 struggles to keep up. An average of 37 fps is still playable, of course, and ultra will look far better than the console alternative. The current gen RX 470 naturally fares much better, but as one of the lower end cards available at the moment it doesn’t quite manage to hit 60 fps with all the bells and whistles turned on.  The popular GTX 1060, our main testing card, performs admirably at an average of 65 fps. It’s good news for the previous generation of Nvidia cards too, with the 970 being within four frames of 60 fps.  Several hours of play confirms that BioWare have created a very solid build with Mass Effect: Andromeda, but it’s worth saying that I did experience problems the first time I booted the game. I experienced frame rates as low as single figures, with combat being unplayable. Thankfully after rebooting my PC these issues disappeared and have never returned, not even with the use of a significantly less powerful GPU.  How does Mass Effect: Andromeda run in 4K?  Andromeda runs solidly at 1080p, but what if you own a 4K display? Our UHD test rig - rocking an i7 6700K CPU, an Nvidia GTX 1080, and displaying on an Acer Predator 4K monitor - copes as well as can be expected. At a huge 3840 x 2160 resolution on ultra settings, Andromeda runs at an average of 36 fps, and a minimum of 27 fps. We wouldn’t expect close to 60 frames on a single GPU, but for a game as effects-heavy and detailed as Andromeda, it’s nice to see that it maintains a playable frame rate. It’s worth noting that our preset analysis found very little difference between high and ultra, so if you’re playing in 4K you should certainly consider dropping down a notch to improve performance.  How to run Mass Effect: Andromeda at 60 fps If you’re running one of the cards we’ve tested you’ll no doubt be making a decision right now: do you opt for the most beautiful image and make do with a lower frame rate, or settle for nothing less than 60 fps no matter the graphical cost? If you’re planning on doing the latter, we’ve got tips on how to achieve the gold standard frame rate on our selection of four test GPUs.     For a breakdown of how to run Mass Effect: Andromeda at 60 fps, see our settings guide below.  Nvidia GTX 970 (larger image) If a 970 is your weapon of choice, you’ll be pleased to hear there’s very little you need to do to squeeze 60 frames out of it. Simply using the high preset will ensure a smooth experience with almost all of the visual tricks still running.  Nvidia GTX 1060 (larger image) A 1060 GPU is more than capable of hitting 60 fps at ultra, so just keep those settings turned up as high as they go. If you find more taxing areas are pulling your frame rate down into the 50s, reducing one or two of the graphical elements like vegetation or terrain detail down a setting should keep you in the smooth.  AMD Radeon R9 380 (larger image)  The older R9 380 struggles with Mass Effect: Andromeda, but that doesn’t mean you can’t strike a decent balance between visuals and frame rate. Start by applying the high preset, but then adjust it to custom in order to fine tune it. You’ll want to drop anti-aliasing down to FXAA, and set post processing, lighting, shadows, effects, mesh, and vegetation down to medium. Shaders need to go a little further down, so drop those to low. It’s a more complicated setup than the other cards, but this combination will net you an average of 60 fps while looking as pretty as possible.   For a more detailed breakdown, see our R9 380’s in-game graphics menus here and here.   AMD Radeon RX 470 (larger image) Our lower-end current generation card can run Andromeda at 60 fps with a few adjustments. Using the high preset as a base, by lowering post processing, lighting, and vegetation to medium you can achieve a very playable frame rate that still looks pretty swish.  For a more detailed breakdown, see our RX 470’s in-game graphics menus here and here.   Conclusion Before I got my hands on Mass Effect: Andromeda I already had it in my head that this wasn’t going to be a great PC game. Excited as I was for exploring a new BioWare story, the unusually high recommended specs and talk of it running at 30 fps had me worried. And, as previously mentioned, things didn’t get off to a good start. While the opening scenes on the Ark were smooth, the moment I went planetside and started engaging in combat or doing anything requiring fast movement the frame rate plummeted to a crawl. I feared that I really did need 16GB of RAM and a 1070 to run Andromeda, but luckily a system reboot later and those issues were gone and I was never able to replicate them.  Andromeda, while having a more ‘concept art in motion’ look rather than photorealism, is a detail-dense and demanding game, but it runs great on mid-range modern hardware like the GTX 1060. Older and lower-end cards will struggle a little, though. This isn’t the kind of game you’d upgrade your GPU for, but thankfully the settings offer enough adjustment room to squeeze 60 fps out of weaker components.  BioWare could certainly have put more PC-centric effort into Andromeda; there’s no DirectX 12 here, and the menus feel as if they’ve been pulled from a console rather that created bespoke for our platform. Compared to the games Ubisoft have been putting out recently, Andromeda really pales as a PC game.  But a few clunky menus aren’t the end of the world, and in-game your character controls perfectly well with a mouse and keyboard. Overall it still feels like a game that was intended to be played with face buttons on a controller, but if you’re used to using the number keys to trigger abilities you’ll be very much at home here. Combined with the lovely look of the environments and the solid performance, there’s really no reason not to opt for the PC as your weapon of choice when it comes to Mass Effect: Andromeda.  Mass Effect: Andromeda| Tech Review| Bioware| EA Try these free to play games ?

Not only are the animations lengthy (~10s to zoom into current planet, rotate camera towards next planet, then fly across space and slow to arrive at new selected planet), but the FPS also hits hard there. I've been running on a 970 with the High preset, getting an average around 70 fps in open world gameplay. The galaxy map is hammering that down to an average 20-25fps (I've seen as low as 18 when it zooms the camera around the asteroid clusters). I hope this isn't because of the 970's ram issue. If that's the case then it may take dropping the textures of the map, or finding a way to limit the engine to only use 3.5gb of the GPU's ram maximum. 1 Reply using your Steam account 306 Rock1m1 1 Day ago Lots of hitches, frame rate is good but frame times must be very very uneven. 1 Reply using your Steam account 1 Lingo 1 Day ago I'd like to see how the game runs with different CPUs.

Reduced Energy Microsystems pits startup chip chops against industry giants Posted Mar 16, 2017 by Devin Coldewey 0 SHARES Next Story Instagram is the latest nexus of the Marines photo sharing scandal Advertisement Whether or not you like the so-called Internet of Things, the fact is that we do live in an internet of things, and every one of those things has a chip inside it. These chips are very advanced, of course, but also in many ways very traditional. Reduced Energy Microsystems wants to upend the status quo with a chip tech that could seriously improve the AI and computer vision capabilities of everyday devices — but that the competition is too set in their ways to adopt. REM is one of Y Combinator’s latest picks, and the accelerator helped connect them with Draper Associates, which was impressed enough to fund a $2 million seed round. There are plenty of ways to improve the performance of our devices, be they cameras or mobile phones. You can improve the software: moving from Windows 8 to Windows 10, for instance. You can improve the architecture: moving from 32-bit to 64-bit. And you can improve at the level of the chip itself, which is where REM is hoping to make its mark. Related Articles X-ray technique creates nanometer-scale 3D reconstructions of computer chips As Xiaomi’s home market share slips, the smartphone maker reportedly looks to build its own chips WTF is machine learning? Of course, chips are being improved constantly — there are new ones every year. But Intel or ARM, x64 or x86, Core or Ryzen, they’re all what’s called synchronous. That means there’s a clock somewhere that ticks forward millions of times a second, syncing all its little operational units together and producing the familiar “gigahertz” speed metric. But in these CPUs, the overall speed is limited by the speed of the clock. What if a certain operation, like a simple logic step, is done in an even smaller fraction of a second than the clock duration? Part of the CPU is just sitting there, waiting. And while a fraction of a fraction of a second doesn’t sound like much, if it’s happening in thousands of places, millions of times, it starts adding up real quick. Multiple cores and threads address this issue somewhat, but can also multiply the severity. If only there were a way to remove those operations from the tyranny of the clock… In fact, there is! Asynchronous processing lets calculations proceed at their own pace, saving time and power. Chip makers have known about it for a long time — but they’ve dedicated so many resources for so long to synchronous that there’s no chance of seeing one hit the market. REM plans to change that. I spoke with Eleazar Vega-Gonzalez and William Koven, two of REM’s three co-founders, about the company’s hopes and claims. “When you look at the embedded mobile space, you have this talk of big/little, right?” said Vega-Gonzalez, the company’s software head. “You have this wimpy ARM core that handles the easy things, then when the user starts doing something more complex, it switches over to the bigger, beefier core. That’s fine, that’s a good solution for now… but what we’re able to do is take one single core and dynamically throttle it down or up.” That throttling goes to much greater extremes than existing chips, again due to the asynchronous nature; the same chip can operate at a fraction of a volt for some purposes, then ratchet up the power smoothly and on demand. A prototype chip on a test board – the production chip is smaller, naturally. But it isn’t some exotic fabrication process — the costs of which have inhibited startups in this space for years — nor is it yet another esoteric new discipline or architecture for coders to learn. “We figured out how to use all the same design tools as the rest of the industry, and when we implement an ARM core, it still looks like an ARM core to the programmer,” said Koven, the CEO. “And users won’t see a difference, they’ll just see a part that runs better. What we do is all in between those two pieces.” The result is a standard chip that can operate at super-low voltages so it can run the bare necessities needed to run, say, a home security camera. But when necessary, it can spin up and perform facial recognition algorithms more efficiently than a traditional chip of equivalent power. So you add capabilities while improving energy efficiency — by 3 or 4 times or more, depending on the application. Perhaps it sounds a little too good to be true. If asynchronous chips are so cool, how come existing chip giants haven’t gotten in on the game? Koven, who worked at Intel for years, said they’ve purged it from their DNA. “I spent a lot of time looking for a home for this at Intel,” said Koven. “Asynchronous is kind of a dirty word at Intel. It’s just too different from what they do as an organization. They’ve thrown out a lot of technologies like this because they’re different and scary.” “It’s been tried a few times and historically what’s happened is you see these benefits but it takes way longer to get to market,” said Vega-Gonzales. “Something we’ve emphasized a lot is our internal tooling, so that we can move faster than the rest of the industry — which is exactly what lets software startups beat or exceed bigger companies.” The company is looking at things like police body cameras, DVRs, drones, and security cameras, where manufacturers and developers are looking for a way to improve their offering with state of the art features while not breaking the bank or draining the battery. The work of creating the chips is largely done, and integration with products is what the company is testing now; they expect to have prototypes by the end of the year. REM is Y Combinator’s first chip startup, but the program seems to have been helpful even if its focus is ordinarily more on software. “There was kind of a consistent push to move quickly and focus on the business and customer relations kind of thing,” said Vega-Gonzales. Technical hardware startups, it should come as no surprise, are at great risk of whiffing the product side of things and, you know, the money-making piece. “For Draper… they really believe in the future we’re trying to enable,” said Koven. “They see it’s going to take more than software to do that. And the semiconductor industry is stagnating in so many ways.” It’s not an easy space to break into for technical, market, and monetary reasons; the idea of a startup designing and making its own fundamentally different chips isn’t an easy one to swallow. So one has to admire the chutzpah with which REM is happily marching to battle. They believe in their product and it seems really to be different from anything else out there right now; with luck and ingenuity (and a couple million bucks) they may be able to get the ball rolling with some customers hungry for change in a predictable market.

Those explorations have raised concerns about Ryzen's simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) implementation, interactions between Ryzen's core layout and the Windows 10 scheduler, and to a lesser degree, the chip's Turbo behavior. That growing clamor has had many, myself included, waiting for some kind of official response, and now we have one. Just a little under two weeks from launch, AMD says that Ryzen is working just fine for the most part, and that no major changes should be expected in Windows or elsewhere to correct perceived performance issues—especially those observed by some testers in Windows 7 versus Windows 10. Instead, the company says it's working with developers to deliver "targeted optimizations" for software that "can better utilize the topology and capabilities of [AMD's] new CPU." The company also says it's aware of "many small changes that can improve Ryzen performance in certain applications," and that it's investigating some games that appear to exhibit performance regressions when Ryzen's SMT is turned on. AMD thinks those outliers can be fixed with "simple changes that can improve a game's understanding of the 'Zen' core/cache topology," although those fixes don't have a definite ETA. That attitude is consistent with PC Perspective's take that there will be "no silver bullet" for improving Ryzen performance. AMD's most concrete advice for Ryzen owners experiencing what they perceive as less-than-ideal performance is to click over to Windows' power settings and to enable the High Performance power plan, which the company says will reduce core-parking behavior and allow for faster frequency response when apps require it. The company says that optimizations for the default Balanced profile that are better suited to Ryzen desktop CPUs will be made available through an AMD-provided update by the first week of April. Not to be too smug about it, but AMD's statements about Ryzen CPUs' performance bolsters my confidence that we delivered sound numbers about these chips' performance from day one. We didn't see anything out of the ordinary from our test numbers at the time of publication, and our only complaints about the platform stemmed from some teething issues with motherboard firmware that Gigabyte has addressed with frequent updates since. Should AMD point out a specific application in our test suite from which we should expect significant performance changes, we'll retest it. Until that point, however, our basic conclusion—that Ryzen is a superb value for heavy-duty productivity and a solid gaming chip, to boot—will stand.

Currently using: Corsair H100i GTX cooler i 7 7700k CPU Gigabyte Z170 HD3 motherboard. Idle temps in the CPU reading is around 32-33 degrees with am ambient temp reading of 28 degrees. However under load (Intel burn test) It fluctuates between 60-70 degrees and 99 degrees. Not sure what is going on. I checked the mount and it is on tight. There was thermal paste. I'm wondering whether a temp reading/monitor is shot on the motherboard? Why would it fluctuate that much? I though it was maybe the cooler, but this was happening on a different cooler...which is why I went out and bought the H100i thinking it was the cooler...

If IBT, it uses AVX extensions which overvolt CPU automatically and draw much more power which creates much more heat. P95 26.6 is perfect real world max usage test and you can expect IBT to be 20-30c over the P95 temps. But whatever you're doing, stop it, 100c is very high. If that's from p95 26.6 then you have an issue. Poor contact from heatsink which can be caused by poor installation of hardware and/or thermal paste. Also make sure fan is running on the Corsair and water pump. I assume it is because your corsair link picture shows RPMs on both.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   (#8) dzy_1 Member Guru   Videocard: ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX Processor: i7 7700K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170 UD3 Memory: 16GB DDR4 3000 Soundcard: Creative Xi-fi Fatal1ty PSU: 750w Corsair 03-17-2017, 21:58 | posts: 57 | Location: USA It was done in prime I took off the contact to check to make sure it was solid, and it was. The paste was well spread out and everything. And this was happening from my last cooler too, and that was an air cooler. Got the second readings and they were still the same after the reseat. The sensors show the fan and pump are running. Not sure what else I can troubleshoot at this point, whether it is the Z170 mobo or maybe a faulty CPU?     dzy_1 View Public Profile Find all posts by dzy_1   (#9) Steppzor Master Guru     Videocard: Gigabyte 980 TI G1 Processor: Intel i7-4770K @ Stock Mainboard: Gigabyte GA-Z87X-UD3H Memory: Corsair Vengeance 16GB Soundcard: Kingston HyperX Cloud II PSU: XFX ProSeries BE 1050W 03-17-2017, 22:26 | posts: 670 | Location: Norway You still have not confirmed what prime95 version you are running.

It won't boot without it. The cooler is new so I don't think its buildup, and the cooling block temps are increasing but not up to 90 like the core. Plus it was happening on my old air cooler. Should I go and exchange the cpu for a different one to rule out the contact issue? Its a new chip so I'm still in the return period.

Since you are sure it's not a mounting issue, it could be the paste inside the CPU core and heatspreader have poor contact.. Only solution is to replace it or delid. You should probably replace it though.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   (#21) Hilbert Hagedoorn Don Vito Corleone     Videocard: AMD | NVIDIA Processor: Core i7 5960K Mainboard: X99 Memory: 16GB Soundcard: X-Fi - GigaWorks 7.1 PSU: 1200 Watt 03-18-2017, 18:29 | posts: 27,956 | Location: Guru3D testlab 100C ?? Either the GTX H100i is not functioning properly or it is a mounting issue. Have you used the right standoff screws? I have this feeling your cooling block plate is not properly touching the Intel processor heat spreader. Also please do not use Prime95 as it will go viral on your CPU much like to what Furmark does with GPUs (e.g. not a not realistic-stress workload) use something like Wprime or the internal AIDA CPU stress run or even the CPU-Z benchmark has a proper stress test Follow Guru3D on twitter - facebook and Youtube.     Hilbert Hagedoorn View Public Profile Find all posts by Hilbert Hagedoorn   (#22) dzy_1 Member Guru   Videocard: ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX Processor: i7 7700K Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170 UD3 Memory: 16GB DDR4 3000 Soundcard: Creative Xi-fi Fatal1ty PSU: 750w Corsair 03-18-2017, 19:16 | posts: 57 | Location: USA Well I was having issues with a different air cooler before this.

I used the right mounting screws it was firmly on the mb and same heat issues even if I pressed down on the block.

TAG Heuer on Tuesday unveiled the new generation of a US$1,650 (RM7,322) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel. Two days later, Montblanc followed with the US$890 Summit. Also on Thursday, Swatch Group Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers during the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry. Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple Inc., and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch.” US$15,000 watches Instead, they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear anything on their wrist, smart or otherwise. Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as US$10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while TAG Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about US$15,000.  The original version of the Apple Watch starts at US$269. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities LLP. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces. The top five brands by sales, as ranked by analyst Rene Weber at Bank Vontobel — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest releases represent a change of heart for Richemont, which owns Montblanc, and Swatch, which produces Omega. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watch-straps” and that putting electronic functions into the watch case creates a danger of obsolescence for time-honoured watchmaking practices. Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.” TAG Heuer wants smartwatch buyers to upgrade. With its first device, customers could pay extra to replace it with a traditional timepiece if they ever decided it was obsolete. For the new version introduced this week, which is Swiss-made, TAG Heuer is offering a module for an extra US$1,650 that can swap the smartwatch with a mechanical time face. Google, Apple Google’s Android operating system is behind a number of smartwatches, including Montblanc’s new gadget, which is made in China. The US tech firm has partnered with LG, and in February Huawei launched the company’s Watch 2. Models from Motorola, Sony and Fossil also run Google’s operating system. High-profile failures, such as the death of a US$17,000 luxury version of the Apple Watch and the end of smartwatch pioneer Pebble, are easier to count than successes. Market researcher IDC declared in a report this month that “wearables aren’t dead,” but growth in the category is erratic. IWC had an intelligent watch-strap plan that never saw the light of day, while Tissot is behind schedule on its Smart Touch watch, which would work with iOS and Android. IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped last year, missing a previous forecast of 28.3 million. Of the top five wearable makers, Apple’s volume dropped 7.9 per cent in 2016 while shipments at Samsung rose 39 per cent, according to the firm. Switzerland exported 25.4 million wristwatches in 2016, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. The mixed results for tech giants have eased some fears in the Swiss industry, which has reported signs of sales bottoming after 19 months of declining exports. Swatch this week forecast a rebound in US and European markets after previously reporting improvement in Asia and the Mideast. Guy estimates that TAG Heuer got slightly less than 10 per cent of its sales from its first-generation smartwatch in 2016. If the technology remains a niche product for the Swiss makers, that might be a good thing, he said. Otherwise, they risk a slippery slope in which lower-priced timepieces undercut their sales. “Watchmakers have to be careful not to start to dilute their own brand equity by launching too many smartwatches,” Guy said. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hacked websites on the rise, Google confirms Singapore beats Silicon Valley for start-up talents, survey finds Adobe, Microsoft team up to share sales and marketing data Meet Bixby, Samsung’s new artificial intelligence assistant Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple in China Google could have three Pixel handsets in store for late 2017 Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Cristiano Ronaldo wins Portuguese player of the year award Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles TAG Heuer gets smart with the Connected Modular 45 Is the MyKronoz ZeTime the future of smartwatch design?

EVGA has also included Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 2 x USB 2.0 ports joined by a USB 3.1 Type-C port.     EVGA also says it has tweaked the hell out of the features on its SC17 1070, with the company giving the laptop a "full BIOS" implementation of overclocking abilities. If you push your EVGA SC17 1070 too far, there's even a hardware clear CMOS button that'll return you to factory defaults. EVGA also claims the SC17 1070 is bloatware-free, which is a great thing to see.   The new EVGA SC17 1070 is available now from their own online store for $2550, with the company throwing in an EVGA Torq X10 gaming mouse, and a backpack.

Here’s an overview of the 10 biggest European tech news items for this week: 1) Israel’s Mobileye is being acquired by Intel for up to $15.3 billion at $63.54 per share in cash, making it the largest acquisition deal for an Israeli tech company. 2) Lots of Spotify news, again: the Swedish music streaming giant is to make some music available only to paying customers in a major change to its service, as part of a negotiation with record labels that would reduce the amount of royalties Spotify pays for songs. You can now also navigate with Waze within Spotify (and access Spotify playlists from Waze). 3) Social media companies Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to amend their terms of service for European users within a month or face the risk of fines, a European Commission official said on Friday. 4) Swiss augmented reality startup WayRay has raised $18 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Group and has announced new partnerships to bring its AR tech to cars. 5) Evrythng, a London, New York and San Francisco-based provider of an IoT smart products platform, completed its $24.8 million Series B funding. The round was led by Sway Ventures with participation from Generation Ventures and Bloc Ventures and existing backers Cisco Investments, Samsung, BHLP, Atomico, Dawn Capital and Advance Vixeid Partners. 6) UK-based insurtech company Simply Business has been acquired by US-based The Travelers Companies for approximately $490 million. 7) Nokia’s head of mobile networks, the division which accounted for more than half of Finnish telecom network equipment maker’s sales last year, is leaving the company. Nokia said on Friday it would break out services as a distinct business group from mobile networks following the departure of Samih Elhage, who joined the company in 2012. 8) Amsterdam’s EV-Box, a supplier of electric vehicle charge points, has been acquired by French electric utility company ENGIE. 9) German fintech startup Solarisbank has just raised €26.3 million. Investors include the Japanese SBI Group, Arvato Financial Solutions, and Unicredit. 10) Russia found Apple guilty of iPhone price-fixing, potentially facing fines.

Still, if you're on the road all the time, it's just not convenient to haul around a gaming desktop. Over at Asus' ROG blog, the company is showing off the 15.6" Strix GL502VS and 17.3" Strix GL702VS. These machines promise to pack serious gaming speed into a size that won't cause back injuries if you have to carry it around all day. We'll start with the graphics card. These two new machines both come with a GeForce GTX 1070 and its associated 8GB of GDDR5 memory. That's a pretty good start. Asus pairs that potent GeForce with the buyer's option of a 120Hz 1920x1080 display or a 60Hz 3840x2160 display. Both displays use IPS LCD panels and support Nvidia G-Sync. The machines come standard with Intel's Core i7-7700HQ processor, a quad-core, eight-thread design that clocks up to 3.8 GHz. Either machine can take up to 32GB of DDR4 memory running at 2400 MT/s using a pair of SODIMM slots. You can also outfit them with both M.2 storage and a 2.5" drive. Asus offers SATA and NVMe M.2 SSDs and 2.5" SATA hard drives as purchase options. The hardware on offer is certainly powerful enough for us to call one of these a "desktop replacement", and yet both the GL502VS and GL702VS are only a little over an inch thick (3 cm). They aren't light, though—the smaller GL502VS weighs 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg), while the GL702VS weighs 6.4 lbs (2.9 kg). The extra weight likely comes from the high-powered cooling hardware, comprising two relatively large radiators and a pair of blowers that exhaust toward the back of the machine. Asus' blog post talks up the repairability of these two machines, and says that removing ten Philips screws is all that's required to replace all components, short of the motherboard itself. If you aren't willing to dig into your laptop's guts, you can still use three USB 3.0 Type-A connectors, a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, or a regular old Gigabit Ethernet jack to hook up other devices. The larger GL702VS gets its Type-C port upgraded to a Thunderbolt connector. The ROG blog doesn't talk about pricing or availability for the new laptops, but Newegg already has a listing for the GL502VS-DS71. This particular model includes 16GB of memory, a 128GB SSD, a 1TB HDD, and the 120Hz display for $1699. Tags: Mobile computing Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Submissions: tips@geekwire.com Andrew Toner. (Amplero Photo) Amplero, a marketing platform fueled by artificial intelligence, announced the addition of Microsoft and Amazon vet Andrew Toner as the company’s CTO this week. Toner comes to the position after working as a principal engineering manager in Microsoft’s cloud division for a year. Throughout his career, he has spent more than nine years working for the company in both the U.S. and the U.K. He also spent six years leading engineering teams at Amazon, including in AWS, and has served as a software architect for the Seattle Sounders and a mentor for the 9 Mile Labs incubator. He will drive engineering and operations strategy for Amplero, a particularly important role as the company is preparing to expand its platform. “Seattle is a hotbed for data-centric and AI technology advancements, and Amplero is no exception. They are at the forefront of the emerging artificial intelligence industry, and the work they are doing with machine learning and multi-arm bandit experimentation is completely transforming the way brands engage with their customers,” Toner said in a press release. “I am excited to join such an innovative group that is paving the way for this new category of marketing.” Marjorie Thomas. (LinkedIn Photo) — The Allen Institute announced this week that Marjorie Thomas will join the institute as CFO on May 8. Thomas is currently the CFO of media delivery software company RealNetworks, where she has worked for the past two years. She has also held senior financial positions at Intuit, Sony Electronics and Hewlett Packard. As the Puget Sound Business Journal reports, the job listing for the CFO position details a plan to double the headcount of the Allen Institute in a surge of growth. “We are fortunate to have such an experienced, accomplished and visionary business leader join our executive team,” Allen Institute CEO Allan Jones said in a press release. “I look forward to working with Marjorie as the Institute continues to accelerate foundational research and make a transformational impact on science around the world.” Maria Karaivanova. (Madrona Photo) — Madrona Venture Group announced the addition of two new employees: Maria Karaivanova joins the firm as a principal, and Alice Ryder will serve as the company’s director of investor relations. Karaivanova joins the company from Bay-Area IT services provider Cloudflare, where she spent five years leading business development. She also has past experience at Intel and Boeing. She will use that technological expertise to evaluate investment opportunities, focusing on enterprise and security. Alice Ryder. (Madrona Photo) Ryder was previously the VP of investor relations at King Digital Entertainment, which has produced mobile games including Candy Crush. She has also held leadership positions at Expedia and Clearwire. She will work with Madrona investors and continue to build out the firm’s C-suite program, which connects C-level leadership with Madrona portfolio companies. “Both Maria and Alice embody what we look for at Madrona, experts in their field who have a passion for working effectively with entrepreneurs and innovative ideas,” said Tim Porter, managing director, Madrona. “While they have been on board just a short time, each of them has already made meaningful contributions, and we are looking forward to working together in the coming years.” Ryan Windham. (Cedexis Photo) — Portland-based Cedexis — a well-funded startup that manages the transfer of things like app data, video, and other content — announced the promotion of Ryan Windham to CEO. Windham was previously Cedexis’ VP of product and strategy, prior to which he spent three years in leadership and executive roles at F5 Networks. Cedexis’ current CEO, Scott Grout, will become the company’s executive director. “A window of opportunity has opened for Cedexis, and I, along with the company, plan to move quickly and assertively to meet the challenge. Today’s DevOps teams are looking for truly cloud-native solutions to ensure reliable, efficient, and massively scalable application delivery for modern application architectures; Openmix provides exactly the platform to meet that need. We truly are in the right place at the right time and I look forward to leading the charge for the great change ahead at Cedexis,” Windham said in a press release. Don Antonucci. (LinkedIn Photo) — Don Antonucci, previously the president of Seattle-based healthcare provider Regence Blue Shield, announced this week that he is leaving the company to serve as the chief business development officer for San Francisco-based digital healthcare company 10xHealth. Antonucci had been a leader in various Regence branches for seven years. At 10xHealth, he will oversee business development for a young cloud-based digital health service that focuses on bringing down healthcare costs for its customers. “Today’s insured healthcare markets are ripe for transformation because premiums are too high and too much healthcare is suboptimal,” Antonucci said in a press release. “Poor outcomes, wasteful workflows and high error rates account for at least 30 percent of what we do in healthcare and as much as 70 percent of what we spend. I believe the adoption of 10xHealth’s advanced IT and risk management solutions will enable the nation’s most innovative health insurers to lead their markets with a ‘best care – best cost’ competitive position and accelerate their growth in share, revenues and earnings. Having the opportunity to join the team and help scale the adoption of these advanced solutions is something I wanted to be a part of.” Paul Farmer. (The Laurel Group Photo) — Pyramid Analytics, an Amsterdam-based developer of a business intelligence suite, announced that it has hired Paul Farmer as the company’s new CFO. Farmer is based in Bellevue, Wash. Farmer previously served as CFO of the San Francisco-based mobile marketing company Swyrv. At Pyramid, he will oversee the company’s global financial operations. His hiring was announced by executive talent search firm the Laurel Group. — Ossia, a Bellevue, Wash.-based startup developing wireless charging technology, added several new executives this week. Tim Beard, a former investment banker, joins the company as chief financial officer. He has held VP positions at Deutche Bank, Merril Lynch, and more. Doug Stovall has been named chief revenue officer. He was previously the CRO at marketing and advertising firm Mobivity. Preston Woo was hired as VP of corporate development and strategic alliances. He previously spent a year as the CFO of robotics company Sarcos, and formerly worked in business development at Bellevue-based invention lab Intellectual Ventures for three years. “Tim, Doug, and Preston are part of the team that will change the way world uses power,” Ossia CEO Mario Obeidat said in a press release. “Our technology is tested and more than ready for deployment. Our newest executives have the experience and skill sets to commercialize and scale real wireless power quickly.” Clare McGrane is a GeekWire reporter who covers life sciences, biotechnology and general assignment technology stories, in addition to producing the GeekWire radio show and podcast.

The brands bid to attract millennials with a technology the industry largely snubbed until consumers began turning away from traditional timepieces. Tag Heuer this week unveiled the new generation of a $1,650 (€1,080) smartwatch it makes with partners Google and Intel.  Richemont-owned Montblanc followed with the $890 Summit.  Swatch Group chief executive Nick Hayek announced plans for a Tissot connected watch using a proprietary operating system. With the flurry of new gadgets, watchmakers are trying to attract millennial shoppers in the middle of the longest downturn on record for the Swiss industry.  Yet sales of smartwatches so far have underwhelmed, even for giant Apple, and the new tech-driven timepieces generally command lower prices than the Swiss industry’s traditional output, creating risks for brands that have jumped in. “The smartwatch market hasn’t necessarily been as big an engagement as some thought it would be. Swiss watchmakers aren’t doing this to fend off the Apple Watch,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. Instead they’re dabbling in smartwatches as a way to lure younger shoppers — who often don’t wear any watches, smart or otherwise.  Prices of Montblanc’s traditional watches run as high as $10,000, more than 10 times the price of its new gadget, while Tag Heuer’s most expensive models extend to about $15,000. “It’s a way to be on top of people’s minds, and hopefully getting people in their stores,” said Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities. So far, Swiss watch makers have insulated their high-end brands from the trend, seeking to preserve the exclusivity of more traditional timepieces.  The top five brands by sales — Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Patek Philippe and Longines — have stayed out of the smartwatch market entirely. The latest flurry of releases represents a change of heart for Richemont and Swatch.  Richemont chairman Johann Rupert previously said his brands only planned to make “intelligent watchstraps”.  Swatch CEO Nick Hayek has said he doesn’t expect smartwatches to be a “revolution.”  Bloomberg READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, technology, Montblanc, Tag Heuer, Tissot © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Did you know these six things about the struggling cybersecurity company? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 17, 2017 at 8:19PM Tech investors might recognize FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) as the hot cybersecurity IPO from 2013 that fizzled out over the following years. After going public at $20, FireEye soared to the mid-$80s before concerns about its valuation, lack of profits, cash burn rate, and a secondary offering torpedoed the stock. FireEye now trades at about $10, and its sales growth has flatlined, with analysts expecting just 1% sales growth this year. I've discussed the many shortcomings of FireEye's business model before, but today I'll focus on six lesser-known facts about this struggling cybersecurity firm. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The first cybersecurity firm certified by Homeland Security In 2015, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security certified FireEye's Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) engine and Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DHI) cloud platform under its SAFETY Act. That made it the first cybersecurity company to achieve SAFETY certification for its products, and reinforced its reputation as a "best in breed" threat prevention solutions provider. That's why FireEye was asked to investigate high-profile data breaches at Target, JPMorgan, Sony, and other companies over the past few years. 2. Its core technologies came from an acquisition FireEye was founded in 2004 as a security appliance maker, but it wasn't considered a major threat prevention player until it acquired Mandiant for $1 billion in 2014. Mandiant was founded by current FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, and used digital forensics and an aggressive "SWAT team" approach to contain data breaches. Mandiant rose to prominence in early 2013 after it published a report which implicated China in cyber espionage activities. Image source: FireEye. 3. Its founder has left the company FireEye's founder Ashar Aziz, who has been frequently hailed as a "technical visionary," orchestrated the company's early development of security appliances and oversaw its acquisition of Mandiant. Prior to founding FireEye, Aziz worked at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle) as an engineer and CTO. That's why Aziz's abrupt resignation from FireEye's board of directors last August stunned investors. FireEye said that Aziz's departure wasn't caused by any disagreements with the company, but rather a "desire to spend more time with his family here and abroad, and also to pursue new projects." 4. Its former CEO loved buyouts In 2012, FireEye hired Dave DeWalt, the former CEO and President of McAfee, as its CEO to prep the company for its IPO. DeWalt had a reputation for orchestrating buyouts -- he engineered the sales of Documentum to EMC in 2003, and McAfee to Intel in 2011. Neither company turned out to be a great deal for the buyers -- EMC sold Documentum this January, and Intel agreed to sell a majority stake in McAfee (rebranded as Intel Security) last September. As FireEye dipped below its IPO price in late 2015, many investors speculated that DeWalt would also try to sell the company. However, DeWalt resigned last June and was replaced by Mandia, which suggests that quick buyouts are now off the table. 5. It turned down several buyout offers Shortly after DeWalt's departure, reports claimed that several major suitors, including Cisco and Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), had tried to buy FireEye. A Bloomberg report claimed that FireEye had rebuffed the offers because they were lower than its expected buyout price of $30 per share. A Reuters report from earlier this year claimed that FireEye ended buyout talks with Symantec shortly after Mandia took over due to disagreements over the price. That time frame indicates that the talks occurred after Symantec announced the acquisition of BlueCoat for $4.7 billion, but before it agreed to buy LifeLock for $2.3 billion. 6. It's settling a big class action lawsuit It probably isn't surprising that FireEye is being sued by its investors. The company was hit by multiple class action lawsuits in 2014 after its secondary offering triggered a steep sell-off. The plaintiffs also allege that FireEye execs made misleading claims about the effectiveness of its threat prevention technologies. The Register recently reported that FireEye plans to settle these lawsuits for $10.2 million. That would only account for 1.4% of its projected revenues for the year, but it would also represent the second largest recovery ever achieved in a case argued in a California state court under the Securities Act of 1933. The settlement would also inevitably tarnish FireEye's reputation. The key takeaways FireEye might look like a tempting contrarian play, but the company is in serious trouble. It isn't pivoting from appliances to cloud-based services quickly enough to boost its top line growth, and Mandia's plan to grow margins by laying off employees could dull FireEye's competitive edge. Several of the facts I discussed in this article support that bearish case and indicate that FireEye might not ever revisit its IPO price again.   Leo Sun owns shares of Cisco Systems.

We know that Broadwell isn't, after all; Intel's Skylake and Kaby Lake parts both beat Broadwell in a wide range of games. This is the case even though Skylake and Kaby Lake are limited to four cores and eight threads; for many or most games, high IPC and high clock speeds are the key to top performance, and that's precisely what Kaby Lake delivers. In spite of this, reading the various reviews around the Web - and comment threads, tweets, and reddit posts - one gets the feeling that many were hoping or expecting Ryzen to somehow beat Intel across the board, and there's a prevailing narrative that Ryzen is in some sense a bad gaming chip. But this argument is often paired with the claim that some kind of non-specific "optimization" is going to salvage the processor's performance, that AMD fans just need to keep the faith for a few months, and that soon Ryzen's full power will be revealed. Both parts of this reaction are more than a little flawed. I'm just glad there's finally competition in the desktop processor space again. Intel started to charge some outrageous prices these past few years, but if you wanted the best performance, you really didn't have much of a choice. With Ryzen, AMD is showing the world it's back on track. It might not be there yet in every aspect, but it's an amazingly promising start.

Its gaming performance, however, was initially concerning. At 1080p, the company’s CPUs are well behind Intel, at least in certain titles. Additional testing in our GTX 1080 Ti review showed that these losses don’t occur across the board, even at that resolution. There’s little gap between the 1800X and the 6900K at 1440p and effectively none at all at 4K. AMD has said itself that these losses may reflect the fact that Ryzen is so different from its own previous FX processors — but that didn’t explain why some users saw higher minimum frame rates in Windows 7 as compared with Windows 10. When we contacted AMD about these questions last week, the company told us it was investigating the problem, and some of the preliminary results from that investigation are now available. In a recent blog post, AMD’s Robert Hallock shed some light on AMD’s research into this question and whether or not the Windows 10 scheduler is causing problems for AMD’s Ryzen microprocessor. From the post: We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.  [Emphasis added] As an extension of this investigation, we have also reviewed topology logs generated by the Sysinternals Coreinfo utility. We have determined that an outdated version of the application was responsible for originating the incorrect topology data that has been widely reported in the media. Coreinfo v3.31 (or later) will produce the correct results. Finally, we have reviewed the limited available evidence concerning performance deltas between Windows® 7 and Windows® 10 on the AMD Ryzen™ CPU. We do not believe there is an issue with scheduling differences between the two versions of Windows. Any differences in performance can be more likely attributed to software architecture differences between these OSes. Smoke, but no fire The fact that the issue isn’t related to thread scheduling in Windows 7 versus Windows 10 doesn’t mean that the enthusiasts who reported higher minimum frame rates in the older operating system were wrong, as such. While Microsoft takes great pains to maintain backward compatibility with older operating systems, the fact is, there are sometimes subtle performance differences between hardware when testing one OS versus another. Sources we spoke to at AMD about the minimum frame rate differences some readers have observed don’t believe the difference in game performance has anything to do with scheduler differences between Windows 7 and Windows 10. While it’s not a common occurrence, we’ve seen some of these issues crop up before. Several years ago, when testing Metro Last Light (not Redux), I observed that the game ran much more smoothly on Windows 8 compared with Windows 7 and discussed the issue with AMD, who confirmed that the OS was working as intended. An article at Tech Report from several years ago also observed that Windows 8 was actually better for Radeon GPUs than Windows 7. Our GTX 1080 Ti review demonstrated that the performance gap between Ryzen and the Core i7 is both game-specific and limited in scope. Ryzen can push the 1080 Ti just as well as Intel can at 4K. More recently, during our own Ryzen CPU tests, I tried turning on Grid: Autosport’s compatibility modes for Windows 7 and 8 to deal with some crashes I was having. While this did help stabilize the game, it also decreased the overall frame rate. (I eventually found a different method of stabilizing the game, and our tests on Ryzen and Intel CPUs were conducted with Compatibility Mode disabled.) None of these tests has direct bearing on the Ryzen situation, but they serve to illustrate the overarching point — sometimes, hardware does perform somewhat differently from one operating system to another, without any smoking gun that implies a broken OS scheduler or fundamental problem with the results themselves. This doesn’t mean that some games wouldn’t benefit from being optimized to run on Ryzen CPUs, as AMD has already stated. It just means that the thread scheduler itself is not a problem. Remember, SMT presents more cores to the operating system, but it operates by sharing execution resources within the CPU core. AMD’s previous Piledriver architecture had a completely different design that shared front-end resources like the decoder and scheduler blocks, but had separate integer pipelines with their own ALUs. It’s not ridiculous to imagine that games that expected a Piledriver-like configuration on an AMD CPU could run into problems when executing on Ryzen. AMD’s blog post illustrates the importance of not rushing to judgment when a brand new CPU debuts and throws some odd performance results. Forum dogpiles can be attractive, but that doesn’t mean they’re always right.

Chipmaker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world’s top chipmaker after Intel’s $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. “Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we’ve really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles,” he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany’s Bosch, however, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being,” Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualisation and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence - teaching computers to learn to write their own software code - for a decade. “No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving,” said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia’s processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five - full autonomy - as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. “This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,” he wrote. But Nvidia’s Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers’ cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. “We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable,” he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber, Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia’s Huang predicted those plans would speed up: “In the near future, you’re going to see these schedules pull in.” (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

The country has emerged as a global leader in the fast-growing field of driverless cars, as illustrated by Intel’s more than $15 billion acquisition of Israeli firm Mobileye this week. Israel is now home to hundreds of startups that provide everything from censors to cybersecurity to data collection for autonomous vehicles, putting it alongside Silicon Valley at the forefront of an industry that many expect to take off over the next decade. “In the last 12 months, the global interest is rising more and more,” said Lior Zeno-Zamansky, executive director of EcoMotion, a nonprofit group that promotes the smart transportation sector in Israel. “Everyone is looking for the next Mobileye.” She said the Israeli smart transportation sector has attracted some $4 billion in investment over the past four years, roughly half of it driven by two industry leaders, Mobileye and Waze. During that time, the number of Israeli startups in the sector has grown from 87 in 2013 to over 500. Virtually every major auto maker has established a foothold in Israel, and senior executives visit the country regularly. General Motors has already opened a research center in Israel, while Renault and Daimler are opening facilities as well. Other companies, including Ford, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Mazda, Hyundai, Volvo and Audi are all active in the Israeli market. In a sign of this interest, EcoMotion’s annual conference in May is expected to attract over 150 investors, up from just 10 in 2013, said Zeno-Zamansky. EcoMotion is a joint venture of the Israel Innovation Institute, the Prime Minister’s Office and the Economy Ministry. Michael Granoff, president of Maniv Mobility, Israel’s only venture firm dedicated exclusively to automotive technology, said the auto industry is “ripe for change.” He cited the high cost and inefficiencies of owning a car and sitting in traffic, as well as the large numbers of road fatalities around the world. He said Israel is well positioned to lead that change, not as a builder of cars or engines, but as a technology superpower. Josef Federman is an Associated Press writer.

Ogg March 15, 2017 9:05 am EDT Print Email Tweet Stocks were indicated to open marginally higher on Wednesday, a morning that will probably be met with a rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) later on in the day. Even with the bull market now eight years old, investors have managed to buy stocks on every pullback. Those same investors are also looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, while other reports cover stocks to sell or to avoid. Some color has been added on many of the following calls, and the consensus analyst price targets referenced are from Thomson Reuters. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was reiterated as Outperform at RBC Capital Markets, but the firm raised its price target to $155 from $140 (versus a $138.99 prior close). Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $140.28 and the consensus analyst price target was last seen at $142.69. Finisar Corp. (NASDAQ: FNSR) closed down 4% at $25.69 on Tuesday but was indicated up 1.3% at $26.03 on Wednesday. It was raised to Buy from Hold at Jefferies, and the firm noted that it believes that the recent soft results and guidance and weakness in Finisar shares stem from technical product issues that likely will be resolved shortly and concerns around China where it is confident longer-term demand trends will be strong. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was downgraded to Neutral from Outperform and the price target was slashed to $35 from $45 (versus a $35.18 close) at Credit Suisse. The firm likes the Mobileye rationale but feels the price of Intel is just too high. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) was raised to Hold from Underperform at Jefferies, but the firm is caving on a lower target by raising its target to $135 from $95 (versus a $143.19 close). This call is after Jefferies conducted a survey targeting consumers in Germany and India and found that the Netflix growth opportunity appears larger than the firm had expected. Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Merrill Lynch. This is just a day after Credit Suisse gave a similar upgrade to Outperform. The 52-week range is $61.01 to $78.48. Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) was started as Underweight and assigned an $18 price target at Cantor Fitzgerald. The shares closed down 2.4% at $20.58 on Tuesday and were indicated down 2% more at $20.17 on Wednesday. Snap’s post-IPO range has been $20.15 to $29.44, and it priced at $17 per share.

If Apple fails to make the changes we have outlined above we will be very disappointed. by Karen Haslam | 17 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Price RRP: TBC. TBC 2017 iMac preview: the specs the iMac needs We’re waiting for Apple to update the iMac, untouched since 2015. Hopefully when Apple announces the new iMac for 2017 it will address some of the problems with the current iMac. Related: 2015 27in iMac 5K review and 21.5-inch 3.1GHz iMac with Retina 4K Retina displays across the iMac range There are two different sizes of iMac, one with a 21.5in screen the other with a 27in screen. The biggest selling point at the time they launched was the 5K display on the 27in version, and the 4K display that arrived with the top-of-the-range 21in model. It is here we are hoping to see the biggest change - with the new iMac sporting a 4K display on all the 21in models, bringing the so-called Retina display to the whole line up. The current 5K and 4K displays are still excellent even when compared to the competition, so we don’t expect to see a lot of change there, but one thing many would like to see in the new model is the addition of DisplayPort 1.3 and Thunderbolt 3/USB Type-C (essentially these are one and the same). This would allow users use the iMac’s 5K screen with a different computer. The fact that people want to do this demonstrates just how good the screen is considered to be, and also the fact that as 5K (or 4K) monitors go, it’s actually quite a bargain. We shall have to see if this is indeed a possibility with the new iMac. One thing that people have crying out for for generations of iMac is the provision of more ergonomically friendly adjustments. Right now you can only barely adjust the screen, tilting it forwards or backwards very slightly. You can’t raise or lower it (unless you have a nice hefty book for it to sit on). If Apple made such adjustments possible we can see an iMac being used like a architects drawing board, which would require another change to the design… the addition of a touch screen. Will the new iMac have a touch screen? A touch screen is something some people would like to see happen to the display. These people will probably be disappointed if Apple is sticking with the philosophy of Steve Jobs that using a touch screen iMac would make your arm ache, but there is definitely a desire for touch screen abilities on some Macs. Perhaps this doesn’t apply to an iMac, but the ability to use a touch screen would be useful when commuting because using the trackpad on a laptop is difficult when you only have limited space. We can see some designers appreciating the ability to move elements around the screen by touch. We shall see just how important professional creatives are to Apple when the new iMac launches. Speaking of touch, there is some expectation that some of the features of the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro could come to the iMac, although obviously not through the means of a built in keyboard. Perhaps the Magic Touch Pad (which was introduced with the iMac back in 2015) could incorporate some of the Touch Bar features. The processor in the new iMac We expect that the new iMacs will ship with Kaby Lake processors (unless the iMacs don’t launch until much later in 2017, in which case you might see Cannonlake processors). Chances are it will be powered by Kaby Lake regardless, because Apple tends to not make a big deal out of having the latest processors if the current line up is anything to go by. While the current 27in models offer Skylake quad-core i5 chips, the 21in iMac models are still using the old Intel Broadwell chips - which were old even when Apple shipped the 21in iMac. As we said above, this was because Apple the on system graphics chip Apple uses in the 21in iMac wasn’t available for Skylake at the time the machines launched. It does mean that anyone thinking of buying a new 21in iMac would be wise to wait until Apple launches the new range for 2017 as these are likely to jump two processors. Even worse, the current entry-level model ships with a 1.6GHz Core i5-5250U processor, which is a processor normally destined for a laptop, so don’t expect much from it. As for how good the new Kaby Lake processors will be, it is thought that the top of the range iMac is likely to come with a build-to-order option of the Ti7-7700 processor, and speed tests over on Tom’s Hardware suggests that that chip is capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked (don’t expect Apple to make overclocking possible). The current build-to-order chip option runs at 4GHz. Graphics in the new iMac As we said, the reason why the previous generation of 21in iMacs was limited to that Broadwell chip was because the 21.5in models offer a graphics chip integrated on the processor itself, while the larger model offers a dedicated GPU. The 21-in models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics, while the graphics processors in the current 27in iMac are all from AMD - the Radeon R9 M380, R9 M390 and R9 M395X depending on which model you buy. As for the next generation, it looks likely that they will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, announced at the start of 2016. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations. We doubt that the new iMac will be a better proposition to gamers than the current line up. Related: 21.5in vs 27in iMac and iMac 5K vs Microsoft Surface Studio comparison review RAM in the new iMac All variants of the iMac 5K feature 8GB of RAM currently, comprised of two 4GB sticks, with the option of boosting that up to 16- or 32GB. We’d like to see 16GB as standard on the high end, we don’t expect to see RAM capabilities extending to 64GB. Ports in the new iMac One good thing about the Kaby Lake chips is they offer support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C. Right now the 27in iMac will give you two Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3.0 ports, SDXC card slot, a headphone jack and an Ethernet port. Thunderbolt 3 would allow users to plug the iMac into another computer and use that 5K display, it would also bring USB Type-C (which is incorporated in Thunderbolt 3) and obviously it would speed up any accessories plugged in. Storage in the new iMac Storage is one area where we really hope to see change in the entire iMac line up. We think that flash storage should be standard across the range, or at least a Fusion Drive (high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) should be included. It is possible to pay £90 at point-of-purchase to add a Fusion Drive to the 21in models and we think that this should be standard as the Fusion Drive makes such a significant difference to the performance. This would be a significant improvement because the current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple’s laptops. Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives. Added to this, the 21in iMac ships with an exceptionally slow 5400RPM hard drive as standard - that’s the kind of hard drive you find in a laptops (except these days you’ll be hard pushed to find a laptop with a HDD rather than an SSD/flash drive). The hard drive in the iMac undoes any of the benefits of the faster processor and graphics card. To be frank, we don’t think Apple should be shipping any iMacs with hard drives in this day and age, and while we accept that some people want the maximum storage available, and a 1TB hard drive is significantly cheaper than a 1TB SSD, Apple does offer the Fusion Drive build-to-order option that combines a flash drive with a 1TB hard drive, and in our tests this upgrade makes such a marked improvement to the entry-level iMac that we have always advised that people upgrade. It’s a no brainer. We really can’t fathom why Apple won’t just include the Fusion Drive as standard across the range, we were disappointed when the company reduced the size of the SSD element of the Fusion Drive in the 2015 line up and didn’t just offer it as standard. It was the kind of change that you could appreciate the company making if they were going to add it for ‘free’ not if they were expecting customers to pay for it. We certainly hope Apple sees sense with the 2017 iMac. Price of the new iMac Back in October Apple shocked us all by raising prices across all its products. Perhaps the increases shouldn’t have surprised us in the wake of Brexit, but the increases left prices at pretty exorbitant levels, going up as much as £400.   Prices currently start at £1,049 for the entry-level model, rising to £1,249 and £1,449 for the model with the 4K display. Given that the 4K iMac was £1,199 when it launched, you can see this is not a tiny increase. The 5K iMacs start at £1,749, rising to £1,949, with the top of the range costing a steep £2,249. It could still be said that the 27-inch iMac line-up is great value for money, if you were to purchase a 5K display of this quality it would cost a lot more than the price of the 5K iMac, and it wouldn’t come with a fast, capable, fully functioning computer. We hope to see the entry-level iMac fall back below the £1,000 level, but we certainly don’t hold out much hope for the rest of the line up returning to pre-Brexit pricing levels. OUR VERDICT The message of this article isn’t just to hold off buying an iMac for now because we expect a new range to launch soon, it’s also to say where we think Apple should be improving the new models. If Apple fails to make the changes we have outlined above we will be very disappointed. Tags: Mac , iMac Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

He did not, however, discuss the federal funding of the Michigan-based autonomous testing and development facility. Instead, the site was used as a location for the president to discuss regulatory policies and meet with automotive executives. Little was said on the subject of self-driving cars. Still, automakers routinely remind us that autonomous vehicles are right around the corner. Ford says it can have autonomous cars rolling out by 2021, Audi and Nissan have said 2020, and Volkswagen has claimed it’ll be ready for self-driving models in 2019. Tesla — which has been pioneering the technology longer than most — has stated it has the hardware necessary in its current production vehicles and would have a bulletproof system installed in 2018, anticipating regulatory approval in 2021. However, suppliers are predicting much less optimistic timelines for self-driving cars — and the dates given vary wildly.  Mobileye, which was recently purchased by Intel for a massive $15 billion, is one of very few suppliers anywhere near most carmakers’ deadlines. It and Delphi Automotive both plan to provide an off-the-shelf self-driving system by 2019, but it would only be SAE level 4 — a level some manufacturers say they would skip due to minor safety concerns. Many more, including Ford, have said they would also avoid level 3 for the mass-market. One of Mobileye’s biggest competitors, Nvidia, has said that anything before 2025 is unrealistic. And that year, decided by company co-founder Jen-Hsun Huang, is only possible thanks to automakers accelerating the development of autonomous technology over the last few years. “Because of deep learning, because of AI computing, we’ve really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles,” he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. According to Reuters, the company hosting the conference estimates it will take as much as six years longer to reach to the final stage of autonomous vehicle development. Bosch even declined to officially forecast when a totally autonomous car might become publicly available. Apparently, there are too many gray areas for anyone to say definitively. Many of the dates set by automakers are misleading when you parse out the language used to describe what they mean by “autonomous.” The vast majority of companies will actually only have SAE level 3 capabilities — meaning the car could navigate on the expressway but not in cities and would still require the driver to be prepared to take over at a moments’ notice. Others, like Tesla, say they’re on the cusp of level 5 and won’t need drivers to intervene beyond setting a destination into the computer. Technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote this week that he remains dubious of any automakers having genuinely autonomous vehicles by 2020, mainly because the liability issue is unresolved. “This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,” he wrote. This brings us back around the presidential visit. Regardless of how how quickly manufacturers and suppliers can bring the technology to the table, the government is the final piece of the puzzle. These cars will need to be regulated and evaluated before making their way to consumer garages. John Maddox, president and CEO of the American Center for Mobility, was privy to Trump’s discussion with automotive executives but didn’t hear word one about his own project. Maddox said in an interview with Crain’s Detroit Business that the president was notified of the planned $80 million site’s development but the two did not discuss any funding, despite the facility needing another $60 million to be completed. “Today was not the right time to talk about funding,” Maddox said. “We were able to talk about what we’re doing here in broad terms and about how our automotive needs to stay competitive and to do that we need to build facilities like this … and others.” [Image: Ford Motor Company] Posted in Autonomous Vehicles, Industry, News Blog, Technology Tagged as American Center for Mobility, automotive technology, autonomous cars, autonomous technology, Donald Trump, Government, Safety, self-driving technology, Suppliers Tweet Print More Reviews < Previous Post"In an Odd Twist, German Authorities Raid Volkswagen’s Internal Investigator" Next Post >"Family Feud: Ferdinand Piech Looking to Offload Stake in VW’s Ownership" Get the latest TTAC e-Newsletter! Recommended Back to Top End of Comments 22 Comments on “Suppliers Say Automakers are Just Guessing the Timeline for Self-Driving Cars...” zoomzoomfan March 17th, 2017 at 2:53 pm I still see the main two obstacles for self-driving cars as A.) cost and B.) a (crumbling) infrastructure that was not designed with them in mind. Seems like there is all the development in the world on the cars and their tech but zilch anywhere else. And, you have to keep in mind the vast majority (distance wise) of the country where public transportation is not an option and the working poor must drive themselves (in their 15-year-old GM 3800 W-Body or 2002 Dodge Neon) where they need to go. How are they going to afford self-driving tech? Simple. They’re not. Login to reply ahintofpepperjack March 17th, 2017 at 4:08 pm Most of the cost is in the software development. A couple smartphone-grade cameras and some sensors cost very little these days. Login to reply zoomzoomfan March 17th, 2017 at 4:26 pm Can they be retrofitted to be used on turn of the century Chevy Impalas and Ford Escorts? If not, that leaves a lot of people out. Keep in mind, the average age of cars on the road in the U.S. is reaching 12-years-old now. Login to reply jjster6 March 17th, 2017 at 5:00 pm Did you see the picture at the top of the page? Saying those are a “couple smartphone-grade cameras and some sensors” is like saying a Saturn-V rocket is just some fuel in a tube with an igniter on the end. Login to reply OldManPants March 17th, 2017 at 5:21 pm Pssht…. Walmart tech :-D Login to reply JimZ March 18th, 2017 at 11:01 am as the couple of Autopilot mishaps have shown, you need more than a “couple of smartphone grade cameras and some sensors.” There’s a reasons actual self-driving car prototypes use a mix of technologies; LIDAR, RADAR, and ultrasonic sensors can “see” things which photographic cameras can’t. Just look how quickly George Hotz gives up and bails any time the problem becomes too difficult. Login to reply SCE to AUX March 17th, 2017 at 3:07 pm Liability issues will ultimately limit or stop self-driving car deployment. Mfrs won’t write blank checks to plaintiffs, and buyers won’t utilize or even purchase the tech if they’re held liable. On this subject, both Volvo and Tesla are dreaming. Login to reply DeadWeight March 17th, 2017 at 3:07 pm If truly self-driving cars are unveiled and sold in the mass market, with sufficient infrastructure improvements to ensure that they are able to function even remotely satisfactorily, before the year 2040, I’ll be genuinely shocked. Also, when that moment arrives, the Jetson’s flying cars with flux capacitor propulsion systems will have already arrived and 86% of the population will be living in vertical cities and have Rosie The Robot Maids/Nannies. Login to reply JimZ March 17th, 2017 at 3:10 pm No, they said they’d skip Level 3. https://cleantechnica.com/2017/02/20/ford-skip-level-3-autonomous-cars-even-engineers-supervising-self-driving-vehicle-testing-lose-situational-awareness/ Login to reply Land Ark March 17th, 2017 at 3:34 pm I had a site visit with a representative from the Federal Highway Administration at their campus just outside DC (directly next to the CIA HQ in Langley) about a year and a half ago. They wanted me to help identify the locations of our facilities so they could determine what it would take to do some work on their campus. I inquired about what they were doing and I was told they were setting the whole place up to be able to do testing of self-driving/autonomous cars. I didn’t get any of the details of course, but it definitely seemed like at least they were gearing up to be able to help support the need should it arise. Edit: And I just looked at a satellite image and I see they’ve already done the work. If you check it out, you can see they put in some crosswalks and 2 traffic lights. That’s all supposed to simulate city driving situations. Login to reply Master Baiter March 17th, 2017 at 3:35 pm Tesla’s auto pilot is like the gull wing rear doors on the Model X: It’s an otherwise worthless parlor trick you can show off to your friends. I talked to a guy yesterday who owns a Model S. He likes the car, but he said he can’t trust the auto pilot. It gets confused at times, in particular when going through intersections where the lanes shift direction. And I agree that liability issues will kill the technology. . . Login to reply orenwolf March 17th, 2017 at 4:11 pm Of *course* they’re guessing at the timelines. Do you mean opposed to all the prescient truthsayers out there who can already see the future? Can we have less Hyperbolic headlines, please? As to the liability issue – lets not forget that this isn’t done in a vacuum. If autonomous vehicles begin to reduce the fatality rate, then there will be significant inertia, possibly at the regulatory or government level (ok, ok, everywhere BUT the US) to deal with the liability issues. these systems are going to save lives, and there is an ever-aging population that would very much like to continue to have autonomy thankyouverymuch. Yes, the combination of legal issues in the US and current political climate may well prevent it from taking hold south of the border, but it’s not going to stop progress in the rest of the world, and these multi-billion-dollar bets that the likes of Intel are making aren’t going to be stifled just because they have to go to Canada or the EU to be realized. Login to reply Matt Posky March 18th, 2017 at 5:39 pm Automakers are promising deployment on specific years, when those dates don’t match the timeline offered by suppliers it’s my job to say so. Inertia (with a whole lot of money) is already pushing this technology forward and TTAC publishes examples of this throughout the week. It’s absolutely coming, as you said. However, we have to acknowledge that that there are inconstancies cropping up while manufacturers rebrand themselves as mobility companies.

Login to reply OldManPants March 17th, 2017 at 4:30 pm Isn’t the more significant and difficult accomplishment going to be getting meat drivers off whatever roads upon which future AVs are deemed fit to operate? Don’t want the nice Eloi getting et by Morlocks =:-o Login to reply gottacook March 17th, 2017 at 5:16 pm If the Washington DC Metrorail system can’t restore automated operation after nearly 8 years since the multiple-fatality system error in June 2009, how can anyone foresee safe self-driving cars (even if older cars could be feasibly retrofitted) operating in a trackless system? Assuming a system with tracks can indeed be made foolproof to avoid another 2009-type crash, it seems to me that a feasible system with cars would involve embedding “tracks” directly in roads, along with heating elements to prevent the sorts of damage that freeze-thaw cycles, deicing chemicals, etc., can do to roads. Costly, yes, but so are the present roadbuilding + maintenance cycles; we all want infrastructure that is less likely to crumble. Also, a system that depends on communication between an individual car and its “track” wouldn’t be as likely to be hacked, as car-to-car communication wouldn’t be necessary. Login to reply SPPPP March 17th, 2017 at 7:42 pm I agree. The concept of extensive (and expensive) sensor packages to spot every possible threat and oportunity in a very complex environment is a huge problem. I would think a much more feasible solution would be implanting homing / tracking wires in roadways (at least designated ones) and let the cars follow those as primary navigation. And use the optical/radar sensors as they are currently used – mostly for automatic cruise and braking. And only use those sensors for navigation as a last resort. Login to reply bluegoose March 17th, 2017 at 6:12 pm All I would like is autonomous driving in low speed highway traffic. That is it. Maybe I’ll see that. If we don’t have completely autonomous planes and completely autonomous trains by now…how are we supposed to have autonomous cars? Jack brought this up a few weeks ago. You’ll see a plane that is completely autonomous before you will see a care that is completely autonomous. The operating environment is far too complicated. A lot of this is talk by auto companies is HYPE to raise STOCK PRICES. Login to reply Tele Vision March 17th, 2017 at 8:44 pm Autonomous cars are to keep your faces welded to your devices for longer. Login to reply DAC17 March 17th, 2017 at 8:57 pm I hope to never see these cars on the roads. I can’t imagine the damage that can be done by one good hack.

Putting a hard deadline on vaporware leads to buggy roll outs, and in this particular case that means people dying. Sure, they may be most of the way there, but the part that’s left to figure out is the really hard stuff, it’s going to take trial and error and you can’t just timeline it out based on previous progress. Login to reply speedlaw March 19th, 2017 at 8:20 pm Had just this conversation today with a systems engineer…Does the car kill you, or kill another ? If it is programmed to sacrifice the driver, no one will ever buy one, yet…. If it is programmed to kill the pedestrian/other motorist, is the owner, the maker, or the software programmer responsible ? Can it tell the difference between a dog/deer crossing the street (kill), or a child (no kill, subject to the above question). Login to reply Back to TopLeave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Right now, this 2-in-1 laptop is a little bit cheaper at Best Buy for $430. That's $70 dollars off the $499 suggested price, and about $30 to $40 cheaper than what you'll find from third-party sellers on Amazon. This convertible laptop features an 11.6-inch, 1080p resolution touchscreen, a 1.5GHz dual-core Intel Pentium 4405Y processor, 4GB RAM, and 128GB onboard SSD storage. Sure, other laptops pack a lot more power, but that's not the focus of this particular laptop. Instead, you get a system that's portable and that offers multiple form factors for a wider range of use cases. As with other Yoga devices, it can switch between a standard laptop, tablet mode, and the popular movie-viewing tent mode. [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] The laptop weighs in at 2.36 pounds, which is a great weight for a portable laptop but is a little heavy for an 11-inch device. For ports, the 710 has one USB 3.0 port and one micro HDMI. It also has Bluetooth and supports 802.11ac Wi-Fi. You won't want to run Photoshop or similar programs on this version of the 710, but it should be just fine for streaming video, dealing with documents, and managing email. And unlike larger systems, you can slip it into a small bag, too.

Carmakers, Suppliers Disagree By Georgina Prodhan | March 17, 2017 Email This Print Newsletters Tweet Article Comments Carmakers and suppliers gave widely differing timelines for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on Thursday, showing the uncertainties surrounding the technology as well as a split between cautious established players and bullish new entrants. Chipmaker Nvidia, facing direct competition with the world’s top chipmaker after Intel’s $15 billion deal to buy autonomous driving technology firm Mobileye this week, gave the most optimistic predictions. Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang forecast carmakers may speed up their plans in the light of technological advances and that fully self-driving cars could be on the road by 2025. “Because of deep learning, because of AI (artificial intelligence) computing, we’ve really supercharged our roadmap to autonomous vehicles,” he said in a keynote speech to the Bosch Connected World conference in Berlin. Germany’s Bosch, however, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, gave a timetable as much as six years longer to get to the final stage before fully autonomous vehicles, and declined even to forecast when a totally self-driving car might take to the streets. Progress is fraught by issues including who is liable when a self-driving car has an accident, bringing down the costs of sensor technology and guarding against hacking. “Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being,” Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference. Nvidia has applied its market-leading expertise in high-end computer graphics to the intense visualization and simulation needs of autonomous cars, and has been working on artificial intelligence – teaching computers to learn to write their own software code – for a decade. “No human could write enough code to capture the vast diversity and complexity that we do so easily, called driving,” said Huang. Together with Bosch executives, Huang presented a prototype AI on-board computer that is expected to go into production by the beginning of the next decade. The computer will use Nvidia’s processing power to interpret data gathered by Bosch sensors. Degrees of Autonomy On the way to fully self-driving cars, levels of autonomy have been defined, with most cars on the road today at level two and Tesla ready to switch from level four to five – full autonomy – as soon as it is permitted to do so. Level three means drivers can turn away in well-understood environments such as motorway driving but must be ready to take back control, while level four means the automated system can control the vehicle in most environments. Independent technology analyst Richard Windsor wrote in a note this week he doubted automakers would have autonomous vehicles leaving factories by a typical self-imposed deadline of 2020, mainly because the liability issue was unresolved. “This is good news for the automotive industry which is notoriously slow to adapt to and implement new technology as it will have more time to defend its position against the new entrants,” he wrote. But Nvidia’s Huang said he expected to have chips available for level three automated driving by the end of this year and in customers’ cars on the road by the end of 2018, with level four chips following the same pattern a year later. That is at least a year ahead of the plans of most carmakers that have an autonomous-driving strategy. The head of autonomous driving at BMW told the conference the luxury carmaker was on its way to deliver a level three autonomous car in 2021, but could produce level four or five autonomous cars in the same year. “We believe we have the chance to make level three, level four and level five doable,” he said. He told Reuters the decision on which levels to release would depend in part on the market, and that cars with more autonomy might first be produced in small batches for single fleets. Bosch said it saw level three vehicles being released with its on-board computer at the end of the decade, and level four driving not before 2025. Uber, Baidu and Google spin-off Waymo are testing self-driving taxis, while carmakers including Volvo, Audi and Ford expect to have level four cars on the road by 2020 or 2021. Nvidia’s Huang predicted those plans would speed up: “In the near future, you’re going to see these schedules pull in.” (Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; editing by Mark Potter) Related: Self-Driving Cars to Transform Motor Insurance in Liability Shift: Fitch Copyright 2017 Reuters.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ f t ✉ ⎕ 33 Photo: Eric Risberg/AP Outrage Over Donald Trump Is Spurring Activism in Silicon Valley Cora Currier Cora Currier 2017-03-17T18:24:30+00:00 Photo: Eric Risberg/AP Aatif Awan, a vice president at LinkedIn, was rallying to action a few hundred people milling around a plaza in the center of Palo Alto, California, many in bright-blue shirts with a fist and the words “TECH STANDS UP.” “Take your phones out of your pocket, and open your calendar app right now,” he commanded. “Now look at your schedule for tomorrow.” Awan wanted employees to pledge in meetings with their immigrant colleagues “that you will stand up for them” and fight an executive order from the president restricting entry to the United States from several majority-Muslim nations. After the ban went into effect, nearly 100 tech companies signed onto a legal brief opposing it.  But at the Palo Alto gathering, convened Tuesday to protest the Trump administration, tech workers called for more vociferous opposition. “We want to show the higher-ups, the C-Suite, that employees are behind this movement,” said Javed Ali, a designer who has worked for several technology firms and is currently developing a plug-in that would provide “pre-made content” to battle with trolls spreading Islamophobic messages on social media. Event organizers hoped outrage over Trump’s actions—one attendee called it “my woke-up-ness”—would stir to action highly-paid members of an industry that’s often ignored the concerns of the less fortunate. “I’m here to get to the people who want to change the world, but who are beginning to get that that takes more than algorithms,” said Laura Impellizzeri, of Legal Aid At Work, an organization that provides free services largely to low-income workers for wage claims, discrimination, workplace safety and other issues. “I’m trying to take advantage of this moment to get money and raise awareness.” Noel McKay, left, a program manager and Karen Latina, right, a biotech consultant, hold up signs during a Tech Stands Up rally on Pi Day, Tuesday, March 14, 2017, outside City Hall in Palo Alto, Calif. Photo: Eric Risberg/AP Brad Taylor, the event’s organizer, and a software engineer at the personalization engine Optimizely, said he was also encouraged by employee initiatives putting pressure on executives, such as a petition by IBM workers against their CEO’s overtures to the Trump administration. “The people in this industry have so much power because we’re in demand,” Taylor said. “So let’s use that to support our janitors and our baristas and let’s demand that companies who put up slogans like diversity and inclusion put them to work.” Fighting for the tech industry’s least privileged workers has in the past fallen to labor and community groups and to nonprofit coalitions like Silicon Valley Rising, who have helped to begin to organize the tech world’s service workers, an army of subcontracted labor tens of thousands strong. In recent months, security officers in hundreds of Silicon Valley sites have formed a union, as have cafeteria workers at Intel’s headquarters. Unions sent speakers to the “Tech Stands Up” rally, including Jacky Espinoza, a barista at Intel, who spoke of living in a cramped apartment with several relatives because they couldn’t afford housing in the area. She called on companies “to protect all immigrant tech workers, not just the high-skilled immigrant tech workers.” A demonstrator holds a sign during a Tech Stands Up rally on Pi Day, Tuesday, March 14, 2017, outside City Hall in Palo Alto, Calif. Photo: Cora Currier/The InterceptMaria Gonzalez, a janitor at Facebook, said she’d had the idea of tech companies declaring “sanctuary campuses,” following the movement by cities and universities to pledge not to cooperate with immigration authorities. A few hours after her speech, she said she hadn’t met any tech employees at the rally. “No one has come and talked to me about it yet, but maybe I got them to think about it,” she said in Spanish. Matt Schafer, a software engineer, is also a volunteer organizer with the Tech Workers Coalition, which began in 2015 as a way of  “breaking down divisions between service workers and white collar workers” in the sector, as he puts it. The coalition pushes initiatives such as FairHotel, urging conference-goers to stay at hotels that pay their staff good wages. Ann Badillo, an executive coach, was “pumped” about helping to organize the event. “I made a living through Silicon Valley. And now I have the bandwidth and time and the pocketbook,” she said. “It’s like being at a start-up. We’ve got that real discipline to ship a product. That’s what we do.” As the last remnants of the crowd began dispersing from the rally Tuesday — distracted, perhaps by unconscionably beautiful Palo Alto weather, or by Rachel Maddow’s tweet about Trump’s tax returns — Brad Talyor was still preaching. “America has been around for 240 years,” he said, “and while that sounds like a long time, we are still just a start up.”   Top photo: Katherine Forrest, with the group Raging Grannies, holds up a torch during a Tech Stands Up rally on Pi Day, Tuesday, March 14, 2017, outside City Hall in Palo Alto, Calif.

Here's why. Ryzen from the ashes Where to order AMD's shiny new Ryzen CPUs < > Best Laptops Best Antivirus Lumia 950 XL Lumia 950 Surface Book Surface Pro 4 Windows 10 Tip us on News! Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Moar frames AMD: Windows scheduler isn't to blame for Ryzen performance problems By Rich Edmonds Tuesday, Mar 14, 2017 at 6:13 pm EDT 21 Comments AMD claims it found no connection between the scheduler in Windows and Ryzen performance hits, but others in the community disagree. Ryzen has proved its worth already and we've only just seen the company's latest line of more advanced processors. AMD has done a stellar job in not only bringing the fight back to Intel and regaining some ground in the CPU market, but it did so while designing and launching a completely new platform. Regardless as to how you feel about AMD and its past products, that's a commendable achievement. It hasn't been the smoothest of launches, but that is to be expected with a brand new platform. Manufacturing partners need to get accustomed to things with the new AM4 motherboards, and developers need to get everything optimized on the software side. Ryzen has performed well overall in benchmarks, but there have been a few reports of performance hits, which were addressed by AMD in a recent blog post. Many have put it down to Microsoft's OS and how Windows interacts with the new line of processors. Those critics believe that instead of Windows seeing and communicating with Ryzen CPUs as 2x4 CPU Complex (CCX) configurations, the OS is actually detecting a 1x8 setup and scheduling as though memory across both core sets is uniform. This is believed to be the cause of the minor performance blips that were reported. AMD has a 2x CCX topology on its processor chips, each with four independent CPU cores. Cores one to four do not share anything with five to 8, and thus you can already imagine the problems that arise when Windows moves threads around between all cores without a thought in the world. Moving between cores one through four, or five through eight, within a CCX is absolutely fine and how Ryzen is to be deployed, but when you go from, say, core one to core seven you're going to see a slight tax in latency due to cache misses, which will lead to a loss in performance. Here's a pretty stellar explanation of the technical side of the theory: From what we've gathered from developers and engineers voicing their own opinions on the matter, the bottom line is AMD and Microsoft at the very least need the OS to work better with Ryzen and how its physical cores are configured. Interestingly, AMD says the scheduler in Windows is not the culprit: We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for "Zen," and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture. While it may be able to distinguish between the physical cores, it could be the case that Windows isn't utilizing the 2x CCX effectively when under load, incorrectly placing threads and causing issues. The company does recommend that consumers use Ryzen with the High-Performance power plan enabled in Windows because of the following: Core Parking OFF: Idle CPU cores are instantaneously available for thread scheduling. In contrast, the Balanced plan aggressively places idle CPU cores into low power states. This can cause additional latency when un-parking cores to accommodate varying loads. Fast frequency change: The AMD Ryzen processor can alter its voltage and frequency states in the one millisecond intervals natively supported by the "Zen" architecture. In contrast, the Balanced plan may take longer for voltage and frequency (V/f) changes due to software participation in power state changes. April will see an update from AMD for its processors to optimize power-policy parameters of the Balanced plan. AMD's upcoming quad-core processors should only have one CCX and thus won't be affected by these problems, but we'll have to see how things play out from the two companies with regards to eight-core Ryzen chips, especially as AMD rolls out future updates alongside Microsoft.

I expect these minor issues to improve as everyone figures out the best way to use this new design. We are talking about an 8 core 16 thread desktop CPU. Remember when we had to muddle by on ONE measely core? 16 6 days ago Reply Pappale again... more cores = not more power you can have 32 cores, if the SW is optimalized for 4 cores then you can throw your 32 cores out of the window because its useless -4 6 days ago Reply Avatar of Apathy Probably one of the truest statements you have ever spoken on here. 2 6 days ago Reply ThreeOnTheTree Depends on the task. In games? Faster cores still seems better. For encoding? More cores. Though I suppose that's also where powerful GPUs can step in. 1 6 days ago Reply csd_images Try working with professional grade applications such as Premiere Pro, Blender and others. They take advantage of all those cores and leverage them. You can even assign RAM per core under Premerie to optimise rendering footage. In addition even if an application is not multi-core optimised Windows will swap application processes to the next free processor so yes having multipe cores is useful especially if you record gaming videos where games can take advantage of one set of cores and the game recorder then use another set freeing resources (RAM permitting). 2 5 days ago Reply Pappale disagree one thing is to force a "free core" to work on a task, the other thing is when the SW automatically optimizes the process for better results. More cores sounds good but its not effective. We should wait for the real life benchmarks and see what happens 0 5 days ago Reply Annullator This is probably just a driver issue and an os patch to fix it. Windows likely doesn't see the processor for what it is so its not treating it as such. I'm sure this will get patched soon enough and everything will be fine. Normal issues when using new hardware that is different. 1 6 days ago Reply The Extreme G The article states this isn't an "issue". A driver/patch can't fix the way the chip is designed. -2 6 days ago Reply Keith Wallace No, it says AMD doesn't think it's a problem. However, there have been suggestions that contradict it, like how Windows 7 tests better than Windows 10 when benching Ryzen. -1 6 days ago Reply D3M1G0D There is no issue with the scheduler, but there is an issue with the way that Windows uses the core complexes (CCX). What Windows needs to do is treat Ryzen like a special type of NUMA processor (non-uniform memory access). Basically, it should treat each core complex like a separate CPU (although with common access to main memory) so that the threads from the complexes will not talk to each other. This is definitely something that can be patched in. 1 5 days ago Reply FearL0rd Yes. But it damages the ryzen brand 1 6 days ago Reply FearL0rd Why they didn't test it before released​the product? -5 6 days ago Reply Keith Wallace Honestly, you think they just released CPUs and never tested them? Let's think things through a little. 6 6 days ago Reply Richard Loveridge I imagine AMD know what they are talking about. I cant understand why anyone would disagree with the manufacturers of the chip itself. They have clearly investigated the claims as they state. And they say that is not the issue. Rest assured I'm sure AMD are still continuing to look for the issue. 0 6 days ago Reply Keith Wallace Because: A. AMD only said they believe things to be working correctly. B. Windows 7 has shown better bencbhmark performance than Windows 10, in some scenarios, with core management typically seen as unexpected (if I remember correctly, it was treating virtual cores as physical ones on W10). C. AMD specifically says the Balanced profile causes some of the issues, and plans to adjust its product to work with it. Odds are, Microsoft could also look into adjusting the power profile. Basically, there is a problem with W10, and AMD is going to fix it from their side, rather than having MS do it on theirs. -3 6 days ago Reply matt john2 But did the performance increased with the win7? 0 5 days ago Reply Keith Wallace Every time? No, but there have been instances: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5xkhun/total_war_warhammer_windows... However, in terms of gaming performance, W10 seems to be on-par with W7, in the best scenarios. It's got to do with the arch design, a few folks have explained it much better than I could (and better than this article has). There are quite a lot of unknowns with Ryzen, even a couple of weeks after launch. Things like RAM speeds, W10 scheduling, core parking, and the dual-CPU design have all been considered as weak points right now, but none come off as long-term issues. 1 5 days ago Reply csd_images This is probably the best breakdown I've seen of how Core Scheduling occurs and how AMD/Intel compare be aware there's a lot of high level technical details here. In essence Windows 10 is doing what it's supposed to be doing, and when Intel first released Hyptherthreading and multi-core arch's it caused as much problems. So this nothing unusual for new Architectures and most issues will be resolved over the coming months as OEMs come to terms what the processors can do. The fact AMD has a lot of performance in professional workloads that often beats Intel shows it's a problem more with compilation of software (i.e. for Intel Arch's) than anything to do with the hardware. https://youtu.be/6laL-_hiAK0 2 5 days ago Reply nusense Since the cringe Dec announcement event of Ryzen.

What is lesser known is the brand's well-received foray into wearables — uncharted territory for a Swiss watchmaker. Its newest, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, is a watch it claims blends the traditional timepiece with the convenience of tech. First off, the watch looks more like a regular watch than most other tech-enabled watches on the market. It's even considered "Swiss-made." Inside, it's got Intel-provided technology that uses Google's Android Wear OS. It does all the things you'd expect a smartwatch to do, like tell the weather and check your email. It also contains a GPS system and tracks all the activities that needs tracking. The interesting part is where the "modular" part of the name comes from. The parts that make up the Connected Modular 45 are interchangeable with other Tag Heuer mechanical watch modules, like the Heuer-02T Tourbillon and Calibre 5. Simply take out the Connected module and slip in a mechanical one when you're looking to switch it up. "While there is no future where the world is not connected, it doesn't mean a smartwatch is the best choice for every occasion," Tom Foldesi, VP for connected technology at Tag Heuer, told Esquire. "Which is why we offer our mechanical timepieces as part of the collection." It also allows small parts like lugs and bezels to be interchanged for personal preference. Tag Heuer Connected ModularMore (The modular parts that come with the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45.Facebook/Tag Heuer) The watch also comes with 30 original traditional Tag Heuer faces to switch through, and it's water-resistant up to 50 meters. The Connected Modular 45 will start at $1,650. The deluxe set in titanium — which comes with both a rubber and leather strap as well as a separate Heuer-02T Tourbillon mechanical module — will retail for $17,000.

Unlike the Ryzen 7, which targets the high-end of desktop computing, the Ryzen 5 is aimed at the mid-range and will compete with the more affordable Intel Core i5 series. The current lineup includes four SKUs, starting with Ryzen 5 1600X at the top, followed by Ryzen 5 1600, Ryzen 5 1500X, and then the Ryzen 5 1400 at the very bottom. The Ryzen 5 1600X is a 6-core part with 12 threads, 3.6GHz base clock speed and 4.0GHz boost clock speed and 100MHz XFR boost with certain coolers, 16MB L3 cache, 95W TDP and a pricetag of $249. Ryzen 5 1600 has the same core count but 3.2GHz base clock and 3.6GHz boost clock and is a 65W TDP part, which is priced at $219. It will come with AMD's new Wraith Spire cooler. Ryzen 5 1500X has 4 cores and 8 threads with 3.5GHz base clock and 3.7GHz boost clock with 200MHz XFR boost and 65W TDP. It is priced at $189 and will be available with the Wraith Spire cooler. Lastly, there is the Ryzen 5 1400, which has the same core and thread count as the 1500X with 3.2GHz base clock and 3.4GHz boost clock with 50MHz XFR, 8MB L3 cache, and 65W TDP. It costs $169 and comes with the Wraith Stealth cooler. All four parts feature an unlocked multiplier for overclocking. Like the Ryzen 7, AMD is marketing the Ryzen 5 for its core count and multithreaded performance. According to AMD's testing, the 1600X posted 69% higher score in Cinebench in multithreaded benchmark compared to the Core i5-7600K. Unlike the AMD parts, all the Core i5 processors have 4 physical cores without Hyper-Threading, which affects their multithreaded performance. However, as we saw with Ryzen 7, it is likely that Intel will still beat AMD when it comes to single-threaded performance. As we have seen time and again with games and most other applications, single-threaded performance is more important, with multi-threaded performance only being relevant to things such as video editing or if you have other things running in the background during gaming, such as video streaming. The Ryzen 5 is based on the same AMD AM4 platform as Ryzen 7 with same basic feature support. None of the parts have an integrated GPU so a dedicated GPU is a must, which shouldn't be an issue for those interested in gaming. All the parts will go on sale on April 11.

Military Sex in MacArthur suite: The sordid side of Navy bribery case Sex in MacArthur suite: The sordid side of Navy bribery case High ranking officers allegedly participated in a lavish party that included the services of prostitutes, paid for by Leonard Francis in the MacArthur Suite at the posh Manila Hotel. High ranking officers allegedly participated in a lavish party that included the services of prostitutes, paid for by Leonard Francis in the MacArthur Suite at the posh Manila Hotel. Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter February 2007 was a banner month for U.S. Navy officers indicted recently in the “Fat Leonard” bribery case. It included lavish dinners across the capitals of Asia, sex parties with prostitutes and, finally, swanky hotel rooms for officers and their wives on post-Valentine’s Day vacations — all paid for by Singapore businessman Leonard Francis, the central figure in a bribery case that has ensnared more than a dozen Navy officers serving in Asia. The alleged details of these escapades and others involving nine high-ranking Navy officers were disclosed a newly unsealed indictment from the U.S. District Court in San Diego. Francis, who owned a ship-husbanding company used by the Navy around Asia, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with U.S. prosecutors. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The month started with a seven-course dinner at Hong Kong’s Peninsula Hotel for a small group of senior officers and their wives. The debauchery heated up less than a week later, in the sprawling MacArthur Suite at the posh Manila Hotel in the Philippines. PHILIPPINES, MANILA: The Manila Hotel, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012, was the home of Gen. Douglas MacArthur for nearly six years. He had a suite at the hotel while serving as military adviser to the government of the Philippines. Catharine Hamm / Los Angeles Times PHILIPPINES, MANILA: The Manila Hotel, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012, was the home of Gen. Douglas MacArthur for nearly six years.

PHILIPPINES, MANILA: The Manila Hotel, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2012, was the home of Gen. Douglas MacArthur for nearly six years. He had a suite at the hotel while serving as military adviser to the government of the Philippines. (Catharine Hamm / Los Angeles Times) The then-chief of staff for the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Capt. David Newland, was among officers who allegedly participated in a lavish party that included the services of prostitutes, paid for by Francis. During the bash, historical memorabilia related to Gen. Douglas MacArthur was used by the participants in sexual acts, the indictment says — in one of the most graphic details to come out in what’s now a three-year-old continuing case. What’s in the MacArthur Suite? According to travel bloggers, the suite is a spectacular spread in the historic Manila hotel. It was built as a private home for MacArthur when he was military adviser to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines from 1935 to 1941. The master bedroom has a huge bed, and the dining room boasts a table for 10. In a study, there’s a desk with a portrait of MacArthur above. Other period photographs hang on the walls in frames. On the desk, a copy of MacArthur’s iconic pipe rests on a stand. One travel blogger wrote in a 2014 review: “A replica of the General's signature corn cob pipe, proudly displayed at the desk. The General's immortal words, a promise of hope and liberation, is written on the stem.” The quote is “I shall return,” MacArthur’s promise to the Philippines after it fell to the Japanese in March 1942. The only authentic pieces of furniture in the room are wooden chairs spared from damage during World War II, travel bloggers report. The federal indictment doesn’t say what memorabilia was involved in the Navy sex spree back in 2007. Despite the court filing, the hotel has issued a statement that it doesn’t have any record of U.S. Seventh Fleet officers during the time in question. These days, if you want to rent the suite it goes for around $3,500 a night. For these Navy officers, the good times didn’t stop at the MacArthur room. A few days later, some members of the same crew stayed at the five-star Shangri-La resort in Cebu, Philippines, as their ship moved around Asia. The indictment says that at this hotel, Francis also paid for prostitutes to be delivered to several U.S. Navy officers. On Feb. 14, Newland allegedly sent Francis an email in which he acknowledged: “Thank you for your hospitality in Cebu.” A week later, the party hit Singapore. This time, at least one officer brought his wife along. From Feb. 22 to 27, Newland and others stayed at the Singapore Shangri-La, for which Francis footed the $50,000 bill, according to the court filing. In an email cited in the court filing, Newland told another officer that he and his wife planned to brunch at the historic Raffles Hotel in Singapore and then “shopping, shopping, shopping.” One night the Navy officers ate at the hotel’s Blu Restaurant — which is now closed for renovations, but reviews from past years discuss menu items such as foie gras and oysters. The next night, it was a cocktail reception on a rooftop helipad, then “an extravagant dinner and live entertainment.” The indictment says this occurred at the Jaan French restaurant at the Shangri-La. But that restaurant is advertised as being located at Swissôtel The Stamford in Singapore. Two nights later, it was another meal courtesy of Francis. This time it was at the Shangri-La’s Nadaman restaurant, home to fine traditional Japanese cuisine. In March, the group moved on to the top spots in Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo, where they enjoyed Francis’ hospitality when ashore. Newland, the 7th Fleet chief of staff, made a special request to have fine wines waiting for them, according to the indictment. In addition to Newland, also recently indicted were Rear Adm. Bruce Loveless, Capt. Donald Hornbeck, Capt. James Dolan, Capt. David Lausman, Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Shedd, Cmdr. Mario Herrera and Chief Warrant Officer Robert Gorsuch and Marine Col. Enrico DeGuzman. Some of these officers are now retired. This group -- most of senior ranks, including captain -- referred to themselves by nicknames such as the Cool Kids, Band of Brothers, the Brotherhood, the Wolfpack, the Familia and the Lion King's Harem, according to prosecutors. Another nickname was apparently The O6 Ensigns, which would translate to captains who act like the most junior officers.

 There's finally a smartwatch for watch aficionados Dennis Green Mar. 17, 2017, 1:17 PM 7,658 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. Facebook/Tag Heuer Tag Heuer is well-known for making a solid Swiss timepiece at an accessible price point. What is lesser known is the brand's well-received foray into wearables — uncharted territory for a Swiss watchmaker. Its newest, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45, is a watch it claims blends the traditional timepiece with the convenience of tech. First off, the watch looks more like a regular watch than most other tech-enabled watches on the market. It's even considered "Swiss-made." Inside, it's got Intel-provided technology that uses Google's Android Wear OS. It does all the things you'd expect a smartwatch to do, like tell the weather and check your email. It also contains a GPS system and tracks all the activities that needs tracking. The interesting part is where the "modular" part of the name comes from. The parts that make up the Connected Modular 45 are interchangeable with other Tag Heuer mechanical watch modules, like the Heuer-02T Tourbillon and Calibre 5. Simply take out the Connected module and slip in a mechanical one when you're looking to switch it up. "While there is no future where the world is not connected, it doesn't mean a smartwatch is the best choice for every occasion," Tom Foldesi, VP for connected technology at Tag Heuer, told Esquire. "Which is why we offer our mechanical timepieces as part of the collection." It also allows small parts like lugs and bezels to be interchanged for personal preference. The modular parts that come with the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. Facebook/Tag Heuer The watch also comes with 30 original traditional Tag Heuer faces to switch through, and it's water-resistant up to 50 meters. The Connected Modular 45 will start at $1,650. The deluxe set in titanium — which comes with both a rubber and leather strap as well as a separate Heuer-02T Tourbillon mechanical module — will retail for $17,000.

Photo / AP Swatch Group says it is developing an alternative to the iOS and Android operating systems for smartwatches as Switzerland's largest maker of timepieces vies with Silicon Valley for control of consumers' wrists. The company's Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch chief executive officer Nick Hayek said. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said. Switzerland's four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operating systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek's strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch's own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world's smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch's approach will work better because it's trying to "think small" as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. "There's a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturise and have an independent operating system," the chief executive said. "I'm not convinced," said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. "People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object." Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialising in miniaturisation, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don't want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather. - Bloomberg Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Putting your skills to use could net you up to $30,000 if you find and report a “critical” flaw in Intel’s hardware. Reporting less severe bugs is still worth the effort, ranging in value from $500 to $1,000, according to the company’s newly rolled out bug bounty program website. “We want to encourage researchers to identify issues and bring them to us directly so that we can take prompt steps to evaluate and correct them, and we want to recognize researchers for the work that they put in when researching a vulnerability,” Intel said March 15. By partnering constructively with the security research community, we believe we will be better able to protect our customers.” Intel wants hackers to look closely at its software, hardware and firmware. The harder a bug is to fix, the more the company will pay: HackerOne Not all Intel products are eligible for this bug hunt. For example, McAfee products are excluded, and so are third party and open source products. Intel’s web infrastructure is also off limits for the bug bounty program, as are recent acquisitions (6 months after the acquisition is done). You can find more details on HackerOne, a vulnerability coordination and bug bounty platform, which also hosted the “Hack the Pentagon" program, in which 138 unique bugs were discovered and mitigated. After that program’s success, the U.S. Army followed suit with its own version, “Hack the Army,” where hackers collected a total of over $100,000 in bounty.   Happy hunting! recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Thousands of cyber attacks occur each day See the latest threats ADD A COMMENT Office 365: 5 Keys to Success Seeing the IT Road Ahead with Riverbed Command Center for Application Performance Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi I attended the Experiential Technology Conference (XTech) in San Francisco this week to hear talks about creating virtual experiences that truly immerse you in another world. It showed me that virtual reality has only scratched the surface. I liked the event, curated by Zack Lynch of Jazz Venture Partners, because it reminded me of the long view of VR and how much of a role that research and development still has to play in it. VR has made our eyes feel like we’ve gone to someplace else, but that’s only one of our senses. We have 3D sound as well, but we need more than that to achieve real immersion, said Tal Blevins, head of media at UploadVR, in a panel at XTech. The long road ahead Above: Adam Gazzaley of UCSF at XTech. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The illusions won’t seem absolutely real until all of our senses are immersed in an artificial reality. Joe Michaels, chief revenue at AxonVR, a maker of touch technology for VR, and Tom Carter, chief technology officer of Ultrahaptics, said that touch will deliver an extra sense of realism. “One of the fundamental aspects of realism in VR is touch,” said Michaels, whose company has spent four years developing that sense of touch. “One of the things you feel when you come out of the womb into the world is touch.” David Edwards, cofounder of Onotes, is making digital scent technology that is like a speaker for your sense of smell. “It’s not just visual and sound. It’s a bit unfortunate. The last few years, VR has been about putting on a head-mounted display and looking around,” Edwards said. “It should include hitting all the senses that we can to make you feel immersed in that environment.” “When your senses agree with what you are seeing, it completely transforms the experience,” said Brent Bushnell, CEO of Two Bit Circus. Carter of Ultrahaptics said that you’ll need other senses more than you realized when you are trying to grab something with your fingers. Above: David Holz, founder of Leap Motion, shows off hand-tracking in VR. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi I saw that myself when I tried out Qualcomm’s new wireless stand-alone VR headset prototype at the Game Developers Conference a couple of weeks ago. The headset used sensors to detect my fingers, using software from Leap Motion. It was cool that I didn’t have to use a touch controller. But as soon as I reached out the grab something in VR, it didn’t feel real. That was because when my fingers closed around an object, I didn’t feel anything. The headset didn’t incorporate any touch, or haptics, technology. And that’s the way it is going to be with VR. One improvement begs for another. As soon as we get wired VR headsets, we want wireless ones. As soon as we get touch controls, we want finger detection. As soon as we get finger detection, we want haptics. That’s why Edwards is working on smell. Then it kind of hit me. This is an enormous undertaking. It’s why long-term investors like Tipatat Chennavasin, cofounder of the Venture Reality Fund, say that it’s going to take decades before the full impact of VR, augmented reality, and mixed reality is realized. It reminded me of a speech by Mike Abrash, chief scientist at Oculus, speaking last fall. “Everyone in this room has jumped in to make VR happen, and our reward is we are on the leading edge of one of the most important technological revolutions of our lifetime,” Abrash said. “Thanks to all of our efforts, VR is going to leap ahead in the next five years….The reason we are all working on VR now is because of our vision of what VR will become.” What this means for startups Above: VR entertainment panelists: Margaret Wallace (left), Theresa Duringer, Noah Falstein, and Shiraz Akmal. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi And yet VR skeptics are worried about what’s going to happen in 2017. We saw 40 percent more VR startups created in 2016, but the headsets that debuted during the year only generated about 6.3 million units of sales, according to SuperData Research. That’s not going to produce enough software revenue to sustain many of those VR developers. “There’s going to be a reckoning,” said Margaret Wallace, CEO of Playmatics, on my own panel on VR entertainment experiences. And so we agreed that VR still needs patient investors, brand advocates, and passionate platform owners — Oculus and Facebook, Intel, Qualcomm, Apple, Google, and Microsoft — to sustain the investment in VR. “From what I have a sense of, there’s still a lot of investment pouring in from the platform holders,” said Shiraz Akmal, CEO of VR startup Spaces. “Seven-figure deals are happening. But the difference, at least from my perspective, is that the early days were more of a spray-and-pray kind of situation.” He added, “Now it’s more targeted. ‘Hey, we’ve invested billions in this platform, and now we need a title that can help us sell the numbers that everyone was projecting a year ago.’ The competition for those dollars is more fierce. There are bigger stakes in the development community, especially those studios that have bet on VR. Consumer adoption is — it’s adopting, but not as fast as we’d all like.” Fortunately, other fields such as healthcare, enterprise, defense will help to drive it forward. Mike Wikan, creative director at Booz Allen Hamilton, said his company has 150 developers working on high-end VR experiences for those who will pay for it today: the military. The Department of Defense spends up to $7 billion a year on training, and if you can train people better in VR, that saves money. R&D still to come Above: Adam Gazzaley of Akili and UCSF at the Experiential Technology Conference. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi The XTech event was also impressive in showing off the breadth of research going on in the space. Adam Gazzaley, showed some fascinating research about what he called a “closed loop” system. In it, we would play a game in VR, and it would produce an effect in our brain and cause us to react. Gazzaley’s brainwave sensors would capture data on the part of the brain that was stimulated. Then that data would serve as feedback for the game developers, who could refine the game to produce a better effect. The game could also adjust itself on the fly to become more difficult, as needed, for the player. Gazzaley, whose startup is Akili, is trying to use VR to help people with attention disorders. David Eagleman, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, also showed a cool vest that produces tactile feedback on your torso. He showed how a deaf person could “hear” by feeling the haptic feedback on the torso. Eagleman spoke a word into a microphone, which produced touch sensations on the vest. Then the deaf person wearing the vest spelled out the word that was spoken. The research talks also made me think of another talk by Abrash at Facebook’s F8 event last year. He said the brain doesn’t see the raw data of reality. Rather, it absorbs what comes in from our senses and processes it. It discards data that it doesn’t need and presents something that we can grasp. In other words, our eyes and senses and brain are interpreting reality for us, not presenting it. That suggests the solution for challenges of VR. We don’t have to reproduce reality. We simply have to trick the brain into thinking it’s reality. That means we don’t have to use as much computing power and other technology as we think to achieve the aim of immersion. Think about it this way. Bad VR gives us motion sickness. There’s a mismatch between what our eyes see and what our other senses are telling us, Bushnell said. VR is such a strong medium that it can produce a physiological reaction in our bodies. But if we trick our bodies and our brain, we can get a desired effect from VR. That’s why one of the XTech talks about magic, or misdirecting the brain, made a lot of sense. Stephen Macknick, professor of the department of neurology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, said that our brain can’t focus on everything, so it focuses on what it thinks matters. And that gives illusions a chance to make an impression on us. “Everything is a function of your perception and perspective and the contrast with the world around you,” Macknick said. “You get to decide the way you want to see the world.” Macknick’s talk made an impression on Noah Falstein, chief game designer at Google. “I love that he puts up a diagram showing how you’re focused on something, and the neurons receiving that image have other neurons that suppress the input from other areas,” said Falstein. “It’s not only that your brain highlights the thing you’re focused on, but it’s also turning off everything else. That’s why you don’t see things happening around you when you concentrate on one thing very intently.” Above: Two Bit Circus’ VR app made you feel like you were on a window-washing platform on a skyscraper. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi If we trick the brain into thinking that what it is seeing is real, then we don’t get sick. The illusion seems realistic and more engaging. But what if we want to trick our body in a physiological way? One VR app, The Walk VR, makes you feel like you are walking on a tightrope between the Two Towers. When I did that walk, I felt like I was going to fall. Two Bit Circus did something similar at the event. Its VR app and motion platform took you up the side of a skyscraper on a window-washing platform. You get a sense of vertigo as you look over the edge. The motion platform shakes, and you feel like you are falling. Your body gives a physiological response, and everyone around you laughs at the experience, Bushnell said. The guy in the picture above freaked out when his friend grabbed him and shook him on the platform. Theresa Duringer, meanwhile, used VR to trigger the opposite kind of physiological response. She has a fear of flying, and she created a VR app, Ascension VR, as a distraction to use on the flight. She wanted to suppress a physiological reaction, the fear of flying, and used VR to try to do that. The scale of digital reality’s road ahead Above: John Favreau (left) and Adam Gazzaley. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi All of the research and experimentation made me feel like VR is at the start of a huge undertaking. John Favreau, a Hollywood director, actor, and VR enthusiast, reminded us that we have to find the “humanity in the technology.” “So much of the time people are reading about technologies, like they’re at a race track seeing what horse will win,” he said. “You have to realize it’s a one-way street. You don’t know how the river is going to flow, but it is flowing in the direction. But if the only people who are involved with it are people who are unconcerned with the human impact of it, it’s going to shape the path. What’s the opportunity to humanize it?” And as Abrash pointed out in his talks, this is kind of like the Manhattan Project of our age. A lot of bright minds are working on it and debating the ramifications of this new technology, and the Brave New World that it will create.

That was way back when, before several NVDA stock splits. Source: Shutterstock In the early days, there were big players like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM) that all made chip sets for GPUs. And they still do. But Nvidia made really high-end GPUs. Gamers loved them. Research labs and universities loved them. NVDA carved out a solid business but was never given much attention since it was a niche and no matter how many geeks bought its GPUs, it wasn’t going to be a major player by dominating that sector. Nvidia then did what successful, out-of-the-box companies do. It looked out years in the future and decided to set a course to a new industry — visual computing. It bet that as computers got faster and broadband delivered more information faster, that visual computing would become a major part of computing for decades to come. And NVDA was right. Now, the market cap for NVDA stock is bigger than all but the biggest players in the market — INTC and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN). Because its tech is so advanced, it also has partnered with a number of companies to add their components into devices and machines built for others. It’s like car companies that feature a premium sound system or designer interior. It now looks like NVDA’s newest GPU is now on track to steal AMD’s GPU’s lunch. Also, its GPUs were selected to be in the newest Nintendo Co., Ltd. (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) gaming devices. And both of these come on the heels of a very bullish Q4 and full year earnings report for NVDA. Oddly enough, the stock sold off on the release, which is certainly a “buy the rumor, sell the news” kind of thing, because there was no reason for the selloff. And even after the selloff, NVDA stock is up 212% in the past 12 months. What’s more, the stock has already crossed back over the psychologically important $100-a-share mark. This recent performance indicates that traders sold the news, took some profits and are now back in for the next leg up. I wrote about NVDA last month after its fall from its lofty heights around $120 per share, and now it looks like the momentum is now behind the stock again, as predicted. Don’t let its price-to-earnings ratio of 41 deter you. Nvidia’s growth almost makes that a reasonable valuation, and even if it’s slightly expensive, it’s less of a premium than you see on many stocks with a lot less growth potential. With a market leading position in the biggest trends in computing — big data, virtual reality, augmented reality, internet of things, smart cars and other devices — NVDA is in the catbird seat. It’s still not too late to get in while its still consolidating. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News EANTC Tests Confirm Unique NFV Benefits of ADVA FSP 150 ProVMe /EIN News/ — Edge Device Combines Physical and Virtual Network Functions for Superior Performance Munich, Germany. March 17, 2017. ADVA Optical Networking announced today that the European Advanced Networking Test Center (EANTC) has validated the unique capabilities of its FSP 150 ProVMe. The EANTC tests found that the edge NFV device succeeded in minimizing additional latency and that its hardware-assisted support functions, such as synchronization and service assurance, can be activated without requiring compute resources. This removes negative impact on revenue-generating VNFs and enhances performance. The ADVA FSP 150 ProVMe achieves this through a combination of physical network functions and the latest Intel Xeon-D processor. Conducted by an objective and highly experienced EANTC team, the evaluation showed the independence from traffic load of specific network functions and confirmed the ease of operation through the use of open-source VNF lifecycle management. „Our evaluation confirms that ADVA Optical Networking has constructed an advanced edge-based virtualization solution with value-added hardware features. The company has succeeded in combining its vast experience in manufacturing classic Ethernet-based customer premises equipment with a solid NFV infrastructure based on the compact Xeon-D architecture,” said Carsten Rossenhövel, managing director, EANTC. „We  rigourously tested the ADVA FSP 150 ProVMe’s performance and functionality with specific focus on essential capabilities. We evaluated the solution’s VNF lifecycle management process and verified its ability to openly integrate into typical NFV infrastructure. Additionally, we confirmed that efficiency is improved by hardware-based support functions, which do not consume compute resources.” ADVA Optical Networking’s multi-technology solution combines physical network functions for low-latency forwarding and precise timing with a comprehensive set of assurance functions. A plug-in to OpenStack Neutron assures automated connectivity management with open-source NFVI management solutions. It also utilizes SR-IOV, a software acceleration technology that reduces latency and minimizes server resource consumption. The evaluation, which was conducted by EANTC, the internationally recognized independent test center, verified those advantages when compared with Open vSwitch. The results provide guidance to CSPs as they introduce NFV at the edge of their networks and look to balance performance, cost and operational complexity. „When it comes to edge NFV innovation, we’re leading the way. No other vendor can deliver these advantages. To prove to customers that our FSP 150 ProVMe delivers on its promises, there’s no better way than to subject it to rigorous trials by expert independent testers,” commented Ulrich Kohn, director, technical marketing, ADVA Optical Networking. „High-value services demand high-performance solutions at the network edge. The results of EANTC’s objective and comprehensive evaluation clearly demonstrate the major benefits of our technology. Our unique combination of virtual and physical network functions enables CSPs to offer a wide range of demanding applications far more efficiently. It means our customers can concentrate on service definition rather than worry about performance bottlenecks.” Read EANTC’s full test report on the ADVA FSP 150 ProVMe for more information: http://adva.li/eantcfsp150provme. # # # About ADVA Optical Networking ADVA Optical Networking is a company founded on innovation and driven to help our customers succeed.

Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images         Ideally, green neckties would be banned. They rarely look good; slime-coloured fashion crimes slithering down the front of their wearers’ shirts. St Patrick’s Day is one of the few times it is acceptable to wear one with a straight face. So, in offices across the globe today, hordes of expatriate Irish businessmen will swan in to work donning a green tie. Plenty of expatriate Irish women will wear the equivalent. The upper echelons of many of the world’s top companies are as littered as ever with the men and women of our business diaspora. Forget the parlour. If you’re Irish, come into the C-suite. What is it about Irish emigrants that gives them such a conspicuous presence at senior levels in global business? Clusters of senior Irish executives tend to gather in particular industries. Aviation, for example, is a proper paddy party. There is Willie Walsh running IAG, one of the world’s largest airline groups, while Declan Collier oversees London City Airport. Former Aer Lingus chief Dermot Mannion has recently worked as a top executive at Emirates and Royal Brunei Airlines. Meanwhile, Tallaght man Alan Joyce is on course this year for a decade at the helm of Australian national airline, Qantas. Joyce is an openly gay man and, as such, has had to grapple with the blokey culture of corporate Australia. Irish humour He recently spoke at a dinner for female executives. “Sometimes I just feel like one of the girls,” Joyce quipped. Perhaps it is the Irish sense of humour and national penchant for self-deprecation that helps our emigrants to get along. Demonstrating an ability to innovate, Irish executives roam all over the praries of the tech industry, including Silicon Valley. For example, Niall O’Connor, the media-shy chief information officer of Apple, has been in charge of delivering the cult company’s technology since the 1990s. ADVERTISEMENT Macroom woman Ann Kelleher has risen to corporate vice president in charge of manufacturing at chip behemoth, Intel. In Texas, Ballina man Liam Quinn is now the chief technology officer of Dell. Finance and banking remain warm houses for the global Irish, which is remarkable considering our banking crisis was, proportionally, the biggest ever. Top of the tree right now is Colm Kelleher, president and number two at Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street giant. He hails from a large family in Cork. Kelleher is known for his ruthless dispatch of internal rivals, so friendly banter musn’t be the only thing the ambitious global Irish have up their sleeves. Another Corkman, Gerry Murphy, is the London-based chairman of Blackstone International. Other Irish-born corporate dealmakers include Dubliner Conor Hillery of JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley’s Colm Donlon, who the British media once dubbed “the Harry Potter of mergers and acquisitions”. Former AIB chief executive David Duffy, who now runs Clydesdale Bank in the US, hardly yet qualifies as an emigrant – he only left Ireland last year. Then again, he previously held senior positions in London with Goldman Sachs and in Amsterdam and New York with ING. So he has been around. Predominant clan Telecoms has another prominent clan of Irish. The chief executive of Vodafone Turkey, Colman Deegan, is a Trinity graduate. Blackrock boy Ronan Dunne, who previously ran Telefonica UK, has in recent months decamped to New Jersey to run the mobile arm of Verizon. Meanwhile, Paul O’Sullivan, the chairman of Australia’s second-biggest telco, Optus, is also a Dubliner. After Joyce, O’Sullivan is probably the next most high-profile gay figure in corporate Australia. The two men were recently feted in the Australian Financial Review’s LGBTI leaders list. Perhaps the Irish really do survive and thrive in challenging environments. The male-dominated world of Premier League football, for example, would seem an odd place for a small cluster of Irish women in senior positions. Yet the reigning league champion, Leicester City, is run by Susan Whelan from Howth, while Armagh woman Margaret Byrne ran Sunderland until she quit last year. She now runs a players’ agency. Meanwhile, West Ham vice-chairperson Karren Brady, a baroness, isn’t Irish. But her father, Terry, is. Even if some of them start off as outsiders, the ability to eventually integrate appears to be many Irish business emigrants’ best trick. Avril Conroy is head of retail at Russian energy giant, Rosneft. Moscow is renowned as a difficult city for foreigners to crack, but Athlone native Conroy has emerged as one of the most senior foreign businesswomen in the city. Orna Ní Chionna is the senior independent director of that most British of institutions, the Royal Mail. She is also married to the former head of the UK’s Financial Services Authority, Lord Adair Turner, or Baron Turner of Ecchinswell, to give him his full British title. When she isn’t rubbing shoulders with the UK establishment, Ní Chionna remains a committed gaeilgeoir, which has in the past appeared to fascinate some British journalists. They adapt and integrate, but some of the most successful Irish executives abroad show an ability to make a virtue of their Irish heritage. Footnotes ... The State’s second-largest mobile operator, Three, wasn’t impressed with some opportunistic advertising from its next placed rival in the mobile market, the Eir-owned Meteor. It is suing Eir in the High Court. Three recently changed the contracts of its pay monthly customers, giving them 30 days to cancel without penalty if they didn’t agree with the changes. The exit loophole appeared to go viral in recent weeks, with online forums and message boards full of chatter about how to get out of contracts while still keeping the subsidised handset. ADVERTISEMENT Two weeks ago, Eir took advantage of the situation with a series of advertisements in Sunday newspapers extolling the virtues of its mobile plans, while comparing some of them favourably with its rival’s offerings. Three thought the ads were inaccurate and unfair and it also complained about the use of its logo in the Eir ad. The case is listed for next Monday, when Three will attempt to get it moved onto the High Court’s Commercial list. To do this, the claim must be for above €1 million. So Three obviously isn’t taking the needling from its commercial rival too kindly. The Dublin Airport Authority is almost a workers’ paradise. Trade unionists are within grasp of a majority on its board of directors. Economist Colm McCarthy, who is most definitely not a comrade, and leasing executive John Lynch both stepped down from the board this month as their terms came to an end. Both served initial three-year terms, with reappointment for a further two years. That leaves a 10-person board, including the chief executive Kevin Toland. Of the 10, there are four worker directors – Des Mullally, Barry Nevin, Eric Nolan and Denis Smyth. Siptu vice president, Patricia King, is not a worker director, but as one of the top trade unionists in the State, she may as well be. So half of the DAA board is now comprised of trade unionists. Some of the other directors’ terms appear to be nearing an end in July. Surely the trade unionists couldn’t gain overall control of the board? With Minister for Transport Shane Ross’s aversion to making State board appointments, who knows. Given his bleating about the DAA and unions in the past, wouldn’t that be ironic?       Topics: Caveat Alan Joyce Ann Kelleher Avril Conroy Barry Nevin Colm Donlon Colm Kelleher Colm Mccarthy Colman Deegan Conor Hillery David Duffy Declan Collier Denis Smyth Dermot Mannion Des Mullally Eric Nolan Gerry Murphy Harry Potter John Lynch Jp Morgan Karren Brady Kevin Toland Liam Quinn Margaret Byrne Niall O Connor Patricia King Paul O Sullivan Ronan Dunne Shane Ross Stanley Morgan Susan Whelan Turner Adair Turner Baron Willie Walsh AIB Apple Blackstone Clydesdale Bank DAA Dell Computer Emirates Goldman Sachs Group ING Group Intel Lgbti Leaders QANTAS Rosneft Royal Brunei Airlines Royal Mail Three Verizon Vodafone Read More Eason switches ‘omnichannel’ to fuse past with digital future Footnotes: Tullow Oil changes and low spirits in Temple Bar Caveat: Mathews always stood out from gang of business pundits elected in 2011 Champagne is in, CDs are out: how the CSO basket reflects changing Ireland A hold-up for €150m Liffey Valley extension might not be such a bad thing Michael O’Leary’s Belgian waffle, UPM and the ‘aw c’mon’ legal test No women directors, no problem, or so the view appears within Ireland Inc Bill Cullen back in gear at Rathmines alma mater Brophy sees red over INM Red Flag reports Caveat: Declan Ryan gets ready for tilt at Argentina Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Retail & Services Ikea Ireland reports record revenues as it pays out €11m dividend Companies The Irish making it big in global business International Gerry Thornley: Six Nations defences still on top despite bonus points Economy Always-on world making people happier, survey claims Sponsored Our trip North: ‘I couldn’t believe how much it had changed’ Who are the ‘Leaders of Tomorrow’?
