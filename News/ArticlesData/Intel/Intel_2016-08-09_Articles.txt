Photo: Bloomberg San Francisco: Tech-giant Intel on Wednesday acquired California-based deep learning start-up Nervana Systems run by an Indian-origin entrepreneur, allowing the chip maker to foray into the world of artificial intelligence. Co-founded by Naveen Rao in 2014 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Nervana has a fully-optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning. The US-based chip giant isn’t actually saying how much it is paying, but a source with knowledge of the deal said it is valued at around $408 million, Recode, a technology news website that focuses on the business of Silicon Valley reported. “Today, Iam excited to announce that Intel signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a recognised leader in deep learning,” Diane Bryant, executive vice president of Data Center Group at Intel said. “We will share more about artificial intelligence (AI) and the amazing experiences it enables at our Intel Developer Forum next week,” Bryant said. “Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” she said. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” she added. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible. We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio,” Bryant said. “We’ve always been a mission driven company. Even though we won’t be a startup any longer, our mission hasn’t changed. we are here to make a dent in the world of computation, Rao said. “With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing. We’ll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural,” he said. According to Rao, the semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world. Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realise our vision and create something truly special, Rao said. He said that the deal didn’t reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy. But by selling to Intel, we have access to technology we’d never dream about,” Rao was quoted as saying Recode. Intel is one of the world’s largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue.

The companies did not disclose terms of their deal, but online tech journal Recode pegged the transaction at more than $350 million. Founded by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao, Nervana aims to apply “neural network learning” to computers. Machine learning gives computers a humanlike ability to improve their performance over time by observing results and adjusting their actions in response. Artificial intelligence can solve arcane computing problems or for practical applications like determining which kind of shampoo an online shopper is most likely to buy. It’s a hot sector in computing, with Nvidia, Google and others designing chips to serve the market. Intel’s PC business, which makes up most of its revenue, is fading rapidly. But the company’s data center group is thriving, and the computational power inside server farms meshes neatly with the demands of machine learning. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible,” wrote Diane Bryant, Intel’s data center chief, in an online posting announcing the deal.

(Photo: Remy Gabalda, AFP Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — Intel has committed $300 million to ensure that by 2020 its staff mirrors what it calls the market availability of the U.S. tech workforce. But even that kind of cash doesn't buy overnight success. In the tech company's latest mid-year diversity report released Wednesday, most of Intel's key metrics remained flat or ticked up slightly despite concerted efforts in the past six months to target women and minorities in the hiring process. "One of the biggest learnings we’ve had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," read a note accompanying the report, which was signed by CEO Brian Krzanich, Diversity and Inclusion chief Aisha Evans and Human Resources leader Danielle Brown. Currently, Intel is 53% white and 32% Asian, a skew that is generally reflective of tech companies - from Google and Apple to small startups — as they continue to grapple with the challenge of creating a workforce that better reflects the U.S. population. USA TODAY EEOC to hold rare public hearing on tech diversity While tech firm leaders long resisted revealing the overwhelmingly white and male make-up of their work force, pressure from both media outlets and activist groups such as Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition have since made reporting diversity efforts almost de rigueur as prospective employees look for companies that reflect their own values. Achieving workplace diversity also goes beyond social justice or mere optics, as many researchers have noted that a diverse workforce typically correlates to increased corporate performance as employees are better able to anticipate the needs of a broad consumer base. Many companies now have diversity on their front burner, dedicating resources to in-house diversity programs and nontraditional outreach programs in efforts that often are led by senior leaders focusing solely on diversity and inclusion. But despite this new-found emphasis, progress is slow. In a report last month, Facebook revealed that its employee makeup has changed little over the past years despite the social media giant's intent on looking less homogeneous. Apple was the latest tech company to update its diversity numbers. Last week, the Cupertino, Calif.-based iPhone-maker revealed that its non-white workforce grew by a percentage point, although white employees also increased by 2% to 56%. African-American employees went from 8% to 9%, Hispanics from 11% to 12% and Asians from 18% to 19%. USA TODAY Few minorities in non-tech jobs in Silicon Valley, USA TODAY finds Among the key findings in Intel's latest report: female employees inched up to 25.4% from 24.8% in December 2015, while underrepresented minorities (URMs) decreased slightly to 12.3% from 12.4%. Among URMs, African-American staffing increased to 3.7% from 3.5%, while Hispanics dropped to 8% from 8.4%. The U.S. workforce currently consists of 58% women, 16% Hispanics and 12% African-Americans, according to the Department of Labor. On the hiring front, Intel's efforts remained flat with women and minorities accounting for 43.4% of all hires, compared to 43.1% in December. Of that 43.4%, 13.1% were URMs, a notable jump from the 9% figure logged in December 2014. The company also said it was at 99% pay equity for URMs. Gender pay equity is at 100%. USA TODAY Intel diversity stats show slow pace of progress Women in senior company positions grew to 18.2% from 16.5% six months ago, while those in leadership positions also increased slightly to 18.7% from 17.6%. URM representation in senior positions inched up to 6.4% from 5.8%, while those in leadership roles hit 6.9% from 6.3%. Intel also announced it had added a second woman to its board of directors, University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor Tsu-Jae King Liu. The company also noted a need to improve its retention efforts, as adding new women and minorities to the payroll can easily be offset by departing employees who don't find the environment welcoming. Intel also is grappling with a challenging business market, as it looks to reinvent itself from a chip-maker to a provider of cloud-based services powering Internet of Things devices. In April, Intel announced it would be laying off 12,000 employees, or about 11% of its global workforce.

Getty Images Advertisement Intel Corp. (IW 500/20),  which makes chips that run more than 90% of the world’s servers, said it’s buying startup Nervana Systems to add software, a cloud service and future hardware in an attempt to better tune its products for artificial intelligence work. While Intel’s Xeon processors dominate in data centers, they’re not built for the unique workloads of artificial intelligence calculations, according to Gartner Inc. analyst Martin Reynolds. Adding Nervana’s products and expertise will help it gain a foothold in a small but growing market and fend off would-be rivals such as Nvidia Inc., if it can rapidly turn its acquisition into products. “The market isn’t that big yet,” he said. “But it’s potentially a huge opportunity.” Intel’s data center unit, its most-profitable and fastest-growing business, needs to find products suited to running emerging services such as voice and picture recognition. Such artificial intelligence work is expected to become a bigger portion of the activity of the servers powered by Intel’s chips. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible,” Intel’s Diane Bryant, executive vice president of its data center business, said in a web posting. “We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio.” San Diego-based Nervana was founded in 2014. Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed.

Skip to content twitter facebook arisbox.com Latest digital, social media, business, tech, entertainment and mobile news Primary Menu Home News Apple Microsoft Google Facebook Twitter Software Apps iOS tvOS Cydia Android Windows Mobile Gadgets Gamers Playstation Xbox Arcade Movies About Search Search for: Gamers, Gaming, News, Products, Windows Review | Digital Storm Aura, the killer all-in-one PC All-in-one (AIO) desktop computers are a ubiquitous sighting in any computer superstore, actual or virtual. One of the most popular and iconic is Apple’s 5K-screened iMac $1,899.00 at Amazon, which always seems to occupy a spot at the top of our ratings charts. On the Windows-PC side, we’ve seen lots of models of late with slick designs, such as Lenovo’s Ideacentre AIO 700 $1,379.00 at Amazon. But those are mainstream models, with silicon guts that are meant for casual and multimedia use. For gamers, the AIO selection is a lot less robust. MSI’s Gaming 27 6QE $2,499.99 at Amazon is one of the few game-capable models that recently passed through our hands. One of the most potent AIOs we’ve ever tested, it packed a desktop-grade Intel Core i7-6700 quad-core processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics. We considered it mighty fast for an AIO, but its notebook-class graphics processor isn’t upgradable. And while a GeForce GTX 980M is no slouch, it is well short of the performance tier offered by desktop-class cards in traditional mid-ATX towers and some small form factor (SFF) systems. So what happens when you want an AIO with desktop graphics and upgradability? Your options have generally involved rocks and hard places, but Digital Storm is changing that with its new Aura AIO. The big differentiating point for this model isn’t its stunningly curved 34-inch WQHD (3,440×1,440-pixel) display, though it certainly is the most obvious attraction. (We’ve seen one like it in HP’s equally mesmerizing Envy 34 Curved All-in-One $1,899.99 at HP.) What’s game-changing about the Aura is the fact it uses standard desktop-PC components, not laptop-style mobile ones. Our $3,389 review unit included an Intel Core i7-6700K quad-core processor (overclocked to 4.4GHz), and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition graphics card. Both were connected on the back side of the monitor via a Gigabyte Z170N Mini-ITX motherboard, along with 16GB of DDR4-3000 RAM, a 512GB Samsung SSD 950 Pro solid-state drive, and a 1TB hard drive. The Aura’s back view, with its access panel removed, is almost as impressive as its huge display. In essence, this is a giant-screened AIO with all the power of an SFF desktop built in. The Aura still has limitations next to a traditional desktop, namely in storage. But for AIO gaming, this is the height of luxury. Let’s take a deeper dive. Design To the casual eye, the Digital Storm Aura looks like a big 34-inch monitor. A passerby might easily mistake it for just that, without realizing there’s a high-powered desktop integrated in the back. The unit’s curvature and sheer size make it an impressive sight. It measures 33 inches wide, 18 inches tall, and 4 inches deep. It rests on a heavy-duty, all-metal forked display stand, which connects midway up the rear and offers a small range of tilt adjustment. The Aura also includes a VESA mount, should you decide to go aftermarket and put it on a wall. (Use a stud finder, for sure!) The whole setup is quite heavy, ranging between 45 and 55 pounds depending on the loadout. It’s quite unwieldy to move about. The exterior construction is predominantly plastic, though the display stand, its connection point, and some of the internals are metal. The plastics used on the back made a relatively hollow sound when we tapped it with a fingernail, but those around the display itself were solid. The Aura’s backside has ventilation holes over strategic areas, notably the graphics card and the motherboard. The top of the unit is perforated the entire way across, much like a TV. To turn the unit on, press the power button under the right side of the display. A display-menu option button is to its immediate left. A faint blue light shines directly under the power button when the unit is running. A stubby Webcam sticks out the top of the Aura, connected via the sole USB Type-A 3.0 port residing there… It has usable quality for casual video chats. It can be disconnected, should you wish to use the port for something else. Features The 34-inch display is the Aura’s key selling point. Needless to say, it’s gigantic. It positively dwarfs typical 24- and even 27-inch desktop monitors. Its 21:9 aspect ratio also makes it much more elongated than the 16:9 aspect ratios of most computer displays. Video content on YouTube, Netflix, and elsewhere is generally formatted for 16:9, instead of 21:9. As a result, videos may show with a black border around the edges, simply because they don’t go wide enough. It doesn’t compromise the media quality, but just realize that not everything will make use of a screen this wide. As if the size and aspect ratio weren’t crazy enough, the whole display is curved. If you haven’t used a curved screen this big before, it’s quite the experience. The curvature adds to the immersive feeling in games, since it literally wraps the picture around the edges of your vision. The same goes for movies and pictures. The picture quality is stunning. According to Digital Storm, it’s an IPS panel with nearly unlimited viewing angles. It appears as bright as most high-end TVs, with a brightness range of 280 to 350cd/m. The high contrast, coupled with the 99 percent sRGB gamut coverage, equates to a lively image in just about any situation. For productivity purposes, there are highly practical advantages to a display like this. The extra-wide WQHD (3,440×1,440-pixel) resolution means you can stack three, four, or even five windows side-by-side with minimal resizing. A standard FHD (1,920×1,080) display would generally allow for only two windows side-by-side. In essence, this single display is like having multiple displays, except it’s one seamless panel. Thanks to the size of the monitor, we were able to see text and icons in Windows just fine without having to use its scaling feature to magnify everything. As we’ll see in the benchmarking section, graphics horsepower is very important for driving today’s games at the Aura’s sky-high resolution. All we can complain about on this display is its lack ofNvidia G-Sync support, which could help smooth out the gaming experience even more. We were expecting the Aura to include a more usable set of speakers, though. They’re rearward-facing, located in the upper corners behind the display panel. The sound performance is on the underwhelming side, with little bass and a compressed sound stage. The volume is lacking, too, not much better than a notebook with decent-quality speakers. Port selection isn’t something the Aura lacks on paper, but does in practical fact. There are no front-mounted ports at all. Behind the back right side of the panel are two USB Type-A 3.0 ports, separate headphone and microphone jacks, and the full-size SD/MMC card reader… The remaining ports face out the underside of the Aura, where the back of the motherboard is aimed… As you can see, these ports are implemented through a standard PC I/O shield. Problem is, there seemed to be no safe or practical way to tilt the Aura forward or backward on its stand enough to ease the access to these ports. We moreover found it all but impossible to identify the ports by feel, and didn’t dare try to plug something in blind. The only way to connect something underneath here was to disconnect the Aura from its stand, then wrestle the nearly 50-pound unit onto its face. You’ll want to do that exactly once! Access to the ports is otherwise unobstructed. This situation has the potential to improve if you use a VESA mount, depending on where you mount the unit and the amount of adjustment allowed by the aftermarket hardware. But you’ll want to use these ports for more or less permanent connections, such as those for keyboards and mice. The Aura’s Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5 motherboard offered respectable connectivity through this panel. At its upper left is a legacy PS/2 port, with two USB Type-A 3.0 ports underneath. The wireless antenna connectors are to its right. The antenna unit was included (not shown in most of our pictures), and it was required to achieve wireless range beyond a few feet. (Just remember to connect them before you mount the Aura in its stand!) Under and to the right of the wireless antenna connectors were two inactive video-outs: legacy DVI-D, and HDMI. (They were inactive because a dedicated graphics card was installed.) To the right of the HDMI port was one USB Type-C 3.1 (no Thunderbolt 3 support on that). Further right was Gigabit Ethernet, the last USB Type-A 3.0, a USB Type-A 3.1, and a cluster of audio ports (S/PDIF, line-in, headphone, mic, and surround jacks). The GTX 1080 Founders Edition graphics card in our review unit had DVI, HDMI, and three DisplayPorts. All were blocked off by rubber stoppers, or otherwise made inaccessible by a right-angle HDMI connector hooked into the display unit itself, via a physical HDMI-in… It’s an uncanny situation. You probably could connect another, external monitor to the Aura if youwanted, but we didn’t try. The Aura’s power connector is horizontal, located to the left of the motherboard… Like with the other bottom-mounted ports, we found it quite difficult to connect a power cable without taking the Aura off its stand. Take our word for it: connect everything you want to connect to those bottom ports before you mount the Aura on its stand. Component Access Getting to the Aura’s internals means first dismounting it from its stand, and laying it face-down. The stand arm comes out with two screws. Ten more hold in the one-piece back plastic panel. It did take a bit of gentle fingernail prying to nudge the whole piece loose. You’ll want to disconnect the slim 120mm exhaust fan attached to the plastic panel prior to fully lifting it away. The Aura’s exposed backside is an impressive sight. All of the components are carefully placed, and no bit of space is wasted… The speakers reside at the upper corners… The CPU liquid cooling unit, radiator, and cylindrical fan unit all sit at the upper left… The server-style power supply takes care of powering the computer itself, while the power brick to its left (blissfully, integrated into the unit) powers the display… To the right of the motherboard is the graphics card, connected via a PCI Express x16 ribbon extender… Removing the graphics card entails taking off a thumbscrew holding it in via a bracket on its aft end. To the right of the graphics card is a 2.5-inch drive bay. Two drives can fit here, one atop the other. Our review unit had a single mechanical hard drive… Putting back the rear plastic panel required a bit of finesse. You’ll need to fit the panel by hand, ensuring it’s snug on all sides. The five bottom screws go in easily, but the five along the top require intense eyeballing to line up with their holes. Then, it’s a matter of wrestling the Aura back onto its display stand (or VESA mount). An M.2 slot is on the motherboard, holding the boot drive, the Samsung SSD 950 Pro we mentioned earlier on. But we weren’t able to tell that from looking at the top of the board. The slot is on the underside, meaning complete removal of the motherboard is required to access it. That’s far from a five-minute task. Fortunately, the Samsung SSD 950 Pro in our Aura was 512GB, which should be roomy enough for some time, and is one of the fastest consumer drives available, thanks to its support of the NVMe protocol. You’d be hard-pressed to improve on it. Components The almost-top-tier Aura we’re reviewing had a loadout summing up to $3,389 at the time of this review. The 34-inch display is the same across models, so the differences mostly lie in the internal components. The heart of our Aura is Intel’s flagship quad-core, the Core i7-6700K. It was overclocked to 4.4GHz (8-44x multiplier), and connected to Digital Storm’s Vortex liquid cooler. The overclocking was $49 extra. Considering the “K” series processors are unlocked, you could do the overclocking yourself. The BIOS of our unit’s Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5 Mini-ITX motherboard was fully unlocked. 4.4GHz is a respectable number, considering the base Core i7-6700K runs at 4GHz even. Digital Storm also offered the Aura with Intel X99-based motherboards for Broadwell-E support, in case you want a processor with more than four cores, such as the eight-core/16-thread Core i7-6900K, or even the wildly expensive 10-core/20-thread Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition$1,649.99 at Amazon. For gaming, though, the Core i7-6700K in our review unit is the best all-around choice. The processors with six cores or more may actually have worse performance for gaming, since their cores typically run at lesser frequencies next to the quad-core. The Aura accepts one double-wide, standard length PCI Express x16 graphics card. As mentioned, the slot was populated in our review unit by Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition, the fastest single card available as of early August 2016 beside, perhaps, the just-announced Nvidia Titan X… Digital Storm offered Nvidia cards starting with the relatively anemic GeForce GTX 950$144.99 at Amazon. Given the 34-inch display panel’s 3,440×1,440-pixel resolution, which has 60 percent of the pixels of a 4K (3,840×2,160) display, the very minimum card you’d want for gaming is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060. Given that even the GTX 1080 in our review unit wasn’t hitting 60fps in some games at this resolution, we’d strongly recommend at least a GeForce GTX 1070 for a bit of future-proofing. (Digital Storm didn’t offer AMD cards in the Aura as of this writing, such as the new Radeon RX 480$299.99 at Amazon or older Fury-series cards.) Mini-ITX motherboards are all that fit in the Aura, though we’re not necessarily calling that a fault. The Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5 Mini-ITX model in our review unit had two DIMM slots for desktop DDR4 memory. They were occupied with two 8GB modules of wicked fast DDR4-3000. The maximum amount supported is 32GB, via a 2x 16GB-DIMM configuration. (A standard full-ATX motherboard in a typical desktop would have four or more slots.) For storage, the Aura has that single (and hidden) M.2 PCI Express slot and two 2.5-inch drive bays. As we noted, the M.2 slot is on the underside of the motherboard, making upgrades complicated and time-consuming.  In our review unit, one of the two bays in the 2.5-inch drive cage was populated with a Hitachi 1TB 7,200rpm drive. The 2.5-inch form factor currently limits you to 2TB hard drives. Even SFF desktops tend to have at least one 3.5-inch bay, so being restricted to 2.5-inch drives is a little disappointing. (That’s because 3.5-inch drives can be found in up to 10TB capacities.) Both electronic and physical space are at a premium in the Aura, so you may be looking at the external, network, or cloud route to get more. Digital Storm’s base Aura config was listed for $2,272, as of this writing, which included a fairly robust amount of power. That price netted a Core i7-6700 (non-K/non-overclockable) processor, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics, 16GB of DDR4-2666 RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. You could actually knock the price lower by selecting lesser components if you wanted. Bumping the graphics to a more capable GeForce GTX 1070 in the base configuration pushed it to $2,640. No matter how we configured it, the Aura always seemed to be right at or north of $2,500 for a setup capable of playing the latest AAA games at the 34-inch display’s native resolution. Airflow In traditional desktop design, air generally gets drawn in through the front, then pushed out the back or sides. The thermal playground is a bit different in the Aura, since its components are attached to the back of a huge 34-inch display. The graphics card, situated to the right of the motherboard, exhausts out the bottom of the display. It gets most of its fresh air through perforations above the entire length of the card… The processor’s liquid cooling unit exhausts out the top of the Aura, to the left of the motherboard. The remaining active exhaust is provided by a slim 120mm fan, located directly above the motherboard, mounted on the plastic rear cover. Passive airflow is courtesy of numerous perforations on the back cover. As noted previously, the entire top of the Aura is also vented. The Aura’s fans are audible at all times, though generally unnoticeable in general use. The graphics card was generally silent at idle. The CPU cooler’s cylindrical fan unit, as well as the slim 120mm fan above the motherboard, were both audible, but also hardly noticeable due to their low RPM. Playing games changed the situation a bit, with the GPU fan kicking into high gear, and the CPU cooler working much harder. The single fan in the GTX 1080 Founders Edition had no whine, but the air rushing through its long cooler was hard to ignore. The CPU cooler’s fan had a mechanical whir at its upper RPMs. All the fans combined created an audible hum, which we could hear across a living room. The mid-ATX gaming desktops we test tend to be quieter, though not always. Again, the Aura is a different design, so we’ll chalk up the extra noise as one of the acceptable (and perhaps inevitable) compromises of fitting a full-power gaming PC into the back of a huge display. We recorded component temperatures while playing Rise of the Tomb Raider for 60 minutes. With GPU-Z, we logged the GTX 1080 topping out at 87 degrees. The log showed its core boost clock fluctuating between 1,607MHz and 1,784MHz once it reached 86 degrees, usually remaining under 1,683MHz from that point forward. In other words, it wasn’t sustaining its maximum boost clock, likely due to thermal conditions. Nonetheless, we can’t necessarily fault the Aura for the GTX 1080’s minor thermal inconsistencies, as the temperatures we observed are normal for a GTX 1080 Founders Edition. The overclocked Core i7-6700K in our review unit also became quite warm. The maximum temperatures of its cores ranged from 73 to 77 degrees C by the end of our gaming sessions, measured with HWMonitor. We could hear the CPU cooling unit’s fan kick into high gear at that point. These temperatures are well below the thermal shutoff point for the Core i7-6700K, though on the high side, given that the CPU was liquid-cooled.  But they’re not a danger, by any means, nor did they negatively affect system performance.

Chrome, Firefox, and IE Browser Hijacker Distributed via Legitimate Software GO Intel McAfee warns users about Lavians software Aug 10, 2016 21:10 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Intel McAfee security experts have discovered that the latest versions of the infamous Bing.vc browser-hijacking malware are delivered via applications distributed by Lavians Inc. Security companies have known of the existence of the Bing.vc malware for more than a year, and many of them have added support for removing this threat from the computers of infected users. Intel McAfee: Blame Lavians Inc.! According to a report from McAfee, recent versions of the Bing.vc malware have been found bundled with legitimate-looking products. The security vendor is pointing the finger at a software company called Lavians Inc. "We have come across several files from Lavians Inc. that look like legitimate applications but may pose a serious risk," writes Intel's Santosh Revankar. "We have observed that Lavians Inc. is repackaging clean applications with a browser hijacker to avoid suspicion and to increase its outreach." Intel says that most of the infected files hide as driver utilities, using names such as HP DESKJET F4580 Driver Utility Setup, DELL Inspiron 5100 Drivers Utility Setup, or Acer Aspire ONE ZG5 Drivers Utility Setup. Bing.vc affects Chrome, Firefox, IE When users install these files, they'll get the legitimate application, but also Bing.vc, hidden inside a file called IconOverlayEx.dll. Bing.vc will install into Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, and it will take over the site's homepage and insert ads into visited websites. The page to which this browser hijacker will redirect all users is Bing.vc, hence the malware's name. Hijacked Google Chrome homepage This website has nothing to do with Microsoft's Bing service and is quite strange that Microsoft hasn't registered the domain beforehand or moved to take it down by now. Ironically, the Intel McAfee team has noticed that a link on this hijacked homepage leads users to a site that tries to sell them a very expensive utility to fix their browser hijacking problem. Uninstalling the infected app doesn't help Users who notice something strange and move to uninstall the original driver utility they installed will find that all files will be removed, except for IconOverlayEx.dll, which will remain on the infected system. During the uninstall routine, Bing.vc will alter the user's PC registry keys and add two new entries that will load the DLL on every boot-up. By doing so, even after uninstalling the original infected files, Bing.vc remains on the system. Users who want to get rid of this infection have to remove the registry keys by hand or use an automated PC clean-up utility that usually comes with antivirus software. Additionally, the shortcuts for each browser also need to be cleaned up by deleting the URL at the end of the application target parameter, as in the image below.

Intel Linux Video Driver Now on Par with the Windows One, Thanks to Collabora GO The graphics driver now features OpenGL 4.4 support Aug 10, 2016 21:03 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Mark Filion informs Softpedia about the latest progress made by past and present Collabora developers on bringing the Intel graphics driver on par with its Windows equivalent. In a recent blog post, Timothy Arceri reports for Collabora that it's a known fact that the open source Intel OpenGL video driver has always been behind times, always trying to catch up to the proprietary video drivers that are available for Microsoft Windows operating systems. That ends now, as the Collabora team, who has always had lots of contributions to the Linux kernel, has managed to reach a major milestone by implementing OpenGL 4.4 support to the open source Intel video driver supporting recent Intel Broadwell and Intel Skylake platforms. "At Collabora, I recently had the opportunity to implement the ARB_enhanced_layouts extension which was last extension required to enable 4.4," says Timothy Arceri. "As described in the extensions overview this extension brings six new enhancements to the GL shader language to improve the development experience for OpenGL developers." OpenGL 4.5 support coming soon to the open source Intel driver Shortly after the respective announcement, Collabora developer Timothy Arceri should start work and concentrate all of their efforts to upgrade the OpenGL support to version 4.5, thus making the open source Intel graphics driver the best and allowing users of GNU/Linux distributions to fully take advantage of their Intel hardware. In the upcoming months, Collabora's kernel developers and hackers will work hard on bringing more awesome features and performance improvements to the open source Intel OpenGL video driver, such as shader cache and loop unrolling for improving the optimization passes for the GL shader language compiler. All these goodies should be available in the next major kernel release, Linux 4.8, which has just received its first Release Candidate build. #Intel graphics driver#Intel video driver#OpenGL 4.4#OpenGL 4.5#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Fedora 24 Linux Gets Another Set of Updated Live ISO Images, Download Now Lumina Desktop Environment Hits 1.0 Milestone After Four Years of Development openSUSE Tumbleweed Linux Users Get LibreOffice 5.2 and Wireshark 2.0.5, More Canonical Makes It Easy to Port Native iOS and Android Apps to Ubuntu Mobile OS Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Collabora brings OpenGL 4.4 support to the open source Intel Linux driver New Linux Apps Vendetta Online: A MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that takes place in space Ruby: An object-oriented programming language for GNU/Linux and UNIX-like operating systems Opera: Surf the Internet in a safer, faster and easier way with the Opera browser for Linux Google Chrome: The powerful, lightweight and easy-to-use web browser developed by the well known Google company Doomsday Engine: An Open Source 3D-graphics enhanced game engine for Doom, Heretic, and Hexen games GNOME Software: A free project that provides a Software Center app of the GNOME desktop environment GNOME Music: Listen to music, upload music and share audio files across devices with this GNOME app Reader comments Vivaldi 1.5 Lands as the World's First Web Browser to Control Philips Hue Lights more on: Vivaldi 1.5 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

On Monday, the chipmaker said it had acquired the deep learning startup, making it one of several tech firms increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. By Max Lewontin, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Showgoers visit the Intel booth on the first day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January 2013. The chipmaker said Monday it had acquired the deep learning startup Nervana, joining several other tech firms that have increased their focus on artificial intelligence in recent years. Rick Wilking/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of With Intel’s acquisition of the deep learning startup Nervana Systems on Monday, the chipmaker is moving further into artificial intelligence, a field that’s become a key focus for tech companies in recent years. Intel’s purchase of the company comes in the wake of Apple’s acquisition of Seattle-based Turi Inc.  last week, while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Twitter, and Samsung have also made similar deals. Those purchases – large tech firms have bought 31 AI startups since 2011 – according to the research firm CB Insights, also underscore a shift. While AI was once thought of as a sci-fi concept, the technology behind it has come to propel a slew of innovations by hardware and software companies that both attract attention – like self-driving cars – and ones that often go unnoticed, like product recommendations on Amazon. Recommended: Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says “Intel’s acquisition of [Nervana] is an acknowledgment that this area of deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, is really an important part of all companies going forward," says David Schubmehl, an analyst who focuses on the field at the research firm IDC. Despite sci-fi tropes, robots make better managers, study says Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Intel also purchased Saffron Technologies , which aims to solve complex problems using “cognitive computing,” last fall. But, Mr. Schubmehl tells The Christian Science Monitor, “I think this [recent purchase] is noteworthy because it provides [Intel] with both software and hardware technology.” Nervana’s focus, deep learning, builds on advances in machine learning, the idea of training a computer to “think” and recognize patterns. Deep learning expands so-called neural networks, which are modeled on the human brain, to a much larger scale, allowing a computer to perform tasks such as recognizing an image of a cat without necessarily having prior knowledge of what a cat looked like.  For Intel, which has focused on cloud-based computing systems, machine learning represents a necessary step to contend with the reams of data they generate.  “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, told Recode. Working with Nervana also offers Intel an opportunity to expand machine learning capabilities in its own chips, rather than simply having software that works on top of them, Recode reports. For many users, these technologies often go unnoticed, Schubmehl notes.  “Do you really spend time thinking about when Amazon says ‘Hey, other people like this product, would you be interested in this product?’” he asks.  “That’s a product of machine learning, but you don’t think of it that way. You just look at as ‘Gee, Amazon actually knows me a little better than other people, and they’re recommending products that I’m actually interested in,’” he adds. In other cases, users have been quick to point to concerns about potential biases hidden in such algorithm-driven technologies. Last year, some complained when they noticed that the first result for a Google search for “female CEO” was a Barbie doll. In June, a video showing that a Google search for “three black teenagers” produced a series of mugshots , in sharp contrast to a search for “three white teenagers,” went viral. Civil libertarians and researchers have also expressed alarm about what happens when such technology is combined with personal data about users, as in tech firm Samsung’s acquisition of the “big data” company Joyent. “I think that a company that is involved in manufacturing devices that people hold so close to their hearts, it behooves them to tread very carefully,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told the Monitor in June. But at this point, many companies' focus on machine learning shows little sign of slowing down, Schubmehl says. For businesses making hardware, whether Intel, the carmaker Tesla, or the power titan GE, the technology offers the ability to integrate their products with software in a variety of ways. Self-driving buses , or robotic manufacturing equipment, he notes, are two of the results. "At some point it will change enterprise software, and technology in general, so that everything is machine learning-enabled in one fashion or another, so it will slow down at that point," he says. "But, I think for the foreseeable future, there’s a lot of what I would call ‘dumb’ software out there that has to be made smart."

Gabrielle Lurie/AFP SAN FRANCISCO, USA – US-based Intel on Tuesday, August 9, announced a deal to buy an artificial intelligence startup as the computer chip colossus looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding "internet of things," a concept that envisions all everyday objects having data connectivity. Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for San Diego-based Nervana Systems but US media reports put the price at more than $350 million. "With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI (artificial intelligence) technologies," Nervana co-founder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. "We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing." Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialized in combining hardware and software to help machines think in ways similar to human brains, according to the companies. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in non-consumer Xeon and Xeon Phi processors found in workstations and servers to better handle "deep learning" in the internet cloud, Intel data center group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. "While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn't relegated to novels and movies," Bryant said. "AI is all around us." Apple acquires its own AI startup Just a day earlier, August 8, Apple confirmed that it has bought US machine learning startup Turi. The Seattle-based company specializes in enabling developers to imbue software applications with artificial intelligence, so the apps learn to think more the way people do. Apple declined to elaborate the deal, telling AFP that it "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." Technology news website GeekWire cited people close to the acquisition as pegging the purchase price at $200 million. Apple has been stepping up its artificial intelligence efforts to compete against rival services from Amazon, Google and Microsoft. Improving machine learning capabilities of its Siri virtual assistant could enable it to better understand intent behind commands or queries spoken by users. Siri is spreading from Apple mobile devices to its Mac computer system, allowing users of the PCs to search their machines or the Internet with voice commands, according to recent announcements from the Silicon Valley-based company. The move expands the footprint for Siri, which is facing increased competition from Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon's Alexa and Google Now, which also use artificial intelligence. These recent acquisitions by Silicon Valley giants are a glimpse into tech's future – a future rich with artificial intelligence not completely unlike the ones we see in popular fiction. It's happening now. When Google auto-completes your search entries or when your voice assistant makes suggestions based on your previous interactions with your smartphone – that's AI. How it develops from here, we're about to see. English musician Brian Eno, quoted at Rappler's #ThinkPH event, offers the ideal: “One day, humans will be living a life of leisure, our every one need met by machines and computers, leaving us free to pursue more intellectual and creative pastimes. And rather than engaging in tedious, repetitive work, this will herald a new arrival of the leisure economy.” – Rappler.com Filed under:AI•Apple•Nervana Systems•Turi•acquisitions•artificial intelligence•Intel HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

The company provided the now-infamous rough guidelines of "1000x faster and 1000X more endurant than NAND, with 10X the density of DRAM" but did not reveal the underlying technology, or anything else for that matter. Intel also embarked on a traveling roadshow of ambiguous 3D XPoint demonstrations of its new product, which didn't do much to quell the criticism. Now, Micron has pulled back the veil on many of the details of its new line of 3D XPoint products at the Flash Memory Summit. Micron branded its new 3D XPoint SSDs as QuantX (quantum leap), and unlike Intel with its Optane products, the company was surprisingly frank on many aspects of the technology. We still do not know the base materials or even the precise definition of the technology, but we learned many of the key specifications of the product at the show. Let's start with the hardware. Micron QuantX Development Board Micron designed the NVMe QuantX prototype SSD as block-based storage, and although both Intel and Micron have teased wafers before, the four chips on the two daughterboards are the first 3D XPoint packages we have seen in the wild. The packages are unmarked, but the overall capacity of the PCIe 3.0 x8 card weighs in at 128 GB. We are unsure if there are more packages on the board, as our time with the prototype was short. If there were only four packages on the board, it would equate to 32 GB per package. Micron noted that 20nm 3D XPoint would feature a die density of 128 Gbit (16 GB) per die, so that implies that each of the four packages features a two-die stack. Achieving the ability to stack the die successfully is itself an important part of the maturation process. The 128 Gbit capacity is a far cry from the 384 Gbit (48 GB) density of Micron's 3D TLC NAND. Micron's 3D NAND does have the highest capacity per die than competing NAND types, but it features 32 layers. 3D XPoint is currently a two-layer design, and the company indicated that it expects the density to increase as the technology matures. Micron used the yellow sticker below the fan to hide the name of a partner that the company wasn't ready to reveal, and the large fan in the middle sits over a large as-of-yet undisclosed FPGA. Five Micron DRAM packages flank the FPGA, which is interesting because it indicates that Micron is likely using some form of a standard FTL (Flash Translation Layer) that manages the L2P (Logical to Physical) address map. Micron may also be using the cache to absorb incoming write traffic, but that is doubtful considering the high-endurance nature of the underlying 3D XPoint. It shouldn't require as much data massaging as regular SSDs to defray endurance issues. There are also two visible rows of capacitors. Micron likely uses the capacitors to flush the data held in the DRAM cache to the 3D XPoint in the event of an unexpected power loss. 3D XPoint is a persistent storage medium, so it will not need capacitors. The end of the card reveals a QFSP+ connector for an NVMe over Fabrics and a row of status LEDs. There also appears to be an Ethernet port (possibly for out of band management) and a traditional SAS connection on the top of the card, but with prototype boards, it is common to find a wide variety of ports that don't make it to production. Performance Micron noted that the QuantX SSD, which it designed to be a normal storage volume, provides 10X+ performance of NAND at low queue depths, a 10X+ faster response time than NAND, and 4X+ the memory capacity per CPU than DRAM. Micron's first real-time test compared the read and write latency of a NAND-based SSD, which occupies the top of the chart. The NAND write operations require 200 microseconds, and the read operations require an average of 100 microseconds. QuantX write latency (at the bottom of the chart) weighs in at 20 microseconds, while reads require only 10 microseconds. IMG_3342 IMG_3027 IMG_3342 IMG_3027 Micron presented a few charts that revealed stunning performance and scaling under light workloads. The first chart shows a PCIe 3.0 x4 connection with several QuantX SSDs. The workload consisted of a 70/30 mixed read/write 4K random workload. The yellow line along the bottom of the chart highlights the performance with a typical 1.6 TB NAND-based enterprise NVMe SSD, which topped out at a "mere" 200,000 IOPS at QD32. The 3D XPoint SSD positively blows that performance away with 900,000 IOPS during the same workload, but the main takeaway lies in the incredible scaling under light load; the 3D XPoint SSDs saturate the x4 connection at QD4. 01 02 01 02 We love to see the performance of SSDs under heavy load, but the overwhelming majority of workloads, even in heavy-duty enterprise environments, rarely exceed QD8. NAND-based SSDs require a heavy load to reach their top speed, which means that most applications utilize only a fraction of the actual performance available because the workload is not intense enough to tease out the full performance. We focus on low QD performance in our enterprise SSD tests because delivering the full performance under light loads provides a real performance boost to normal use cases. Another interesting trend is that larger NAND-based SSDs typically offer higher performance with higher capacities, which exposes more NAND packages to the incoming commands (parallelism). The chart actually includes the test results of four QuantX SSDs with varying capacities, but they all provide the full performance under light loads, so the results overlay each other. Normal NAND-based SSDs have less performance with smaller capacity points, so many users purchase unneeded capacity on large SSDs simply to reach the higher level of performance. Even a 200 GB QuantX SSD saturates the x4 bus at QD4, which means users will get more performance with less capacity, which reduces cost.  The second chart is an identical test with an x8 connection. The wider PCIe pipe provides more throughput, so the QuantX SSDs require more load to saturate the interface at 1.8 million IOPS. The QuantX SSDs exhibit a similar scaling trend during the test but reach maximum performance between QD8 and QD12 for the 1.6 TB, 800 and 400 GB capacities, whereas the 200 GB SSD tops out at QD16. Facebook Provides Real World Results Facebook, which is already working to deploy 3D XPoint into its architecture, also joined in the benchmarking party by revealing its performance results with an Intel Optane SSD prototype. The Optane SSD tripled the number of transactions that the company achieved with a normal P3600 NAND SSD during a RocksdDB throughput test, but more importantly, Optane reduced the 99.99th percentile results (worst-case latency) by more than 10X. The increase in performance is impressive, but the drastic reduction of errant I/Os will be a boon for intense transactional workloads. Facebook noted that Intel measured the results. IMG_2939 IMG_2935 IMG_2937 IMG_2939 IMG_2935 IMG_2937 How Are They Doing It? We posed a few questions to Micron during a Q&A session to determine the root of the high performance, particularly under light load. NAND manufacturers boost performance by splitting the die into several planes, which are separate sections of the NAND that respond independently to incoming program/erase commands. Planes increase performance by enhancing parallelism. NAND vendors often split die into two planes, whereas Micron split its 3D NAND into four planes. Micron confirmed our suspicions and responded that, although the 16 GB 3D XPoint die isn't split into what would be considered "normal" planes, each die features 64 regions that can independently respond to program/erase commands, which is analogous to a 64-plane architecture. This built-in parallelism allows each 3D XPoint die to respond to data requests with a similar amount of parallelism as 16 entire NAND dies. Why So Slow? The performance specifications, though impressive, are far below the promised "1000X the performance of NAND," but Micron representatives indicated that the company based these statements on the speed of the actual storage medium (at the cell level) before it is placed behind the SSD controller, firmware, software stack and drivers. These factors conspire to increase latency and decrease the performance of the final solution (i.e., the SSD). Much of the leading-edge developmental work to increase performance is focusing on peeling back these layers, and some emerging techniques, such as reducing interrupts by utilizing polling drivers (found in the Intel storage SPDK), can offer drastic performance increases. In many cases, fully utilizing 3D XPoint will require rearchitecting the entire stack, and moving 3D XPoint to the memory bus will unlock much higher performance because it is a faster bus that removes the performance-killing interrupts. Endurance Micron also revealed that its first QuantX SSDs would feature 25 DWPD (Drive Writes Per Day) of endurance over a five year period with the first generation of 3D XPoint. In comparison, some enterprise SSDs based on MLC NAND provide up to 10 DWPD, whereas TLC NAND SSDs provide between <1 to 5 DWPD of endurance. Twenty-five DWPD is hardly an earth-shaking endurance specification, and it obviously pales compared to the 1000x increase in endurance touted during the product launch. Micron noted that it is currently tuning 3D XPoint for use as a storage device, which doesn't require as much endurance as it will when it's used as a memory device (NVDIMMS on a RAM slot). Endurance is defined by the tolerance for raw bit error rates, and according to Micron, the 3D XPoint bit error rate is much lower than flash. The addition of sophisticated ECC algorithms reduces performance, and the company is balancing ECC capabilities and performance to find the "sweet spot" for storage applications. Further, 3D XPoint doesn't have to play by the normal internal SSD management rules, such as garbage collection and wear leveling, to the same extent that a NAND-based SSD does. Micron can dial back all of these processes to increase performance, and it also helps to provide the impressive worst-case latency results in the Facebook tests. Micron and Intel are designing NVDIMMs for memory applications, and the companies will tune those solutions to provide much more endurance than the storage-based products. The controllers are the real secret sauce of the development initiative, and for now, Micron is utilizing FPGAs, but one would expect the company to switch to ASICs once the design matures. 3D XPoint As Memory The biggest advances will come when we move 3D XPoint to the memory bus, but it also will require the most change. The first step is to build support in operating systems, and that work is well underway due to the increasing use of NAND-backed DRAM, and even NAND, on the memory bus with NVDIMM form factors. Software developers will begin to add in support for the new functionality by rewriting applications once the operating system vendors solidify support, but this process could take years. It took nearly ten years for the industry to begin using flash to its fullest potential, but Micron and Intel are both working to build a robust support ecosystem to speed the process with 3D XPoint. Using 3D XPoint as memory also produces a number of interesting challenges. 3D XPoint is persistent, so if someone removed a DIMM from a server, they could simply plug it into another server to retrieve the data. This is a serious security concern, so all data held in the memory will require encryption. QuantX SSDs will also feature the full suite of TCG OPAL and FIPS 140-2 encryption. For now, the best route to market is to simply provide 3D XPoint solutions as storage, because it's a drop-in replacement that will help build production volume. Shrinking lithography and stacking higher layers will increase density, which also reduces cost, but it all starts with volume, which will help reduce cost and foment widespread adoption. Power and Heat Power consumption is an overriding concern in data center applications, and that is where many of the leading-edge products will land. Micron revealed that 3D XPoint has similar power consumption metrics as NAND, largely because even light workloads will "light up all of the die." However, the device delivers much more performance than NAND so that it will deliver superior efficiency (IOPS-per-Watt). Micron is also testing the device to ensure that it meets JEDEC's stringent heat requirements for SSDs. JEDEC has much higher heat thresholds for DRAM, and it remains to be seen if 3D XPoint DIMMs will fit within the normal DRAM thermal envelope. Where To Go From Here The bad news is that Micron is not specifying a release date for its QuantX products, but Intel stated that it intends to ship its 3D XPoint-powered Optane SSDs this year. There are still a number of unanswered questions, such as what the material actually is. Price is another looming question, as it will be the key to the success or demise of 3D XPoint solutions. We expect more news to come from IDF next week. However, the amount of information trickling out of Micron shows that although 3D XPoint may not be as impressive as some expected, it would still enable a sea change in the computing paradigm. The performance on display was impressive, but one can only imagine what it is capable of with a PCIe 3.0 x16 connection, or better yet, PCIe 4.0.

New technology, and when it comes to market the performance leap could be as big as the jump from HDD to SSD, and SSDs were 10 times more expensive at the beginning. I hope this continues, but I'm also afraid of a scenario were all XPoint technology belongs to just 1 or 2 big companies, which would be awful for pricing and compatibility. 1 ammaross Aug 10, 2016, 2:25 PM Anonymous said: This little blurb gives me pause.

In the longer run 4 times more than normal nand may sounds plausible. First devices will go to big corporates that handle a lot of data, like Google and Facebook who has more money, than is needed to get very high speed storage. So first devices are like luxury sport cars, fast and expensive. 1 MRFS Aug 10, 2016, 5:35 PM > I really don't know how realistic this idea is From an analytical point of view, I share your concern. Here's why: When doing optimization research, we focus on where a system is spending most of its time. For example, if the time spent is distributed 90% / 10%, cutting the 90% in half is MUCH more effective than cutting the 10% in half. Now, modern 6G SSDs are reaching 560 MB/second on channels oscillating at 6 GHz ("6G"). The theoretical maximum is 6G / 10 bits per byte = 600 MB/second (1 start bit + 8 data bits + 1 stop bit = "legacy frame") So, what percentage of that ceiling is overhead? Answer: (600 - 560) / 600 = 40 / 600 = 6.7% WHAT IF we merely increase the channel clock to 8 GHz? Then, 8G / 10 bits per byte = 800 MB/second That alone raises the ceiling by 800/600 = 33.3% Now, add PCIe 3.0's 128b/130b jumbo frame (130 bits / 16 bytes). Then, 8G / 8.125 bits per byte = 984.6 MB/second 984.6 / 600 = 64% improvement And, what if we increase the channel clock to 12G (like SAS) -and- we add jumbo frames too: Then, 12G / 8.125 bits per byte = 1,476.9 MB/second 1,476.9 / 600 = 146% improvement I submit to you that the clock rate AND the frame size are much more sensitive factors. Yes, latencies are also a factor, but we must be very realistic about "how sensitive" each factor is, in fact, and be empirical about this question, NOT allowing theories to "morph" into fact without experimental proof. 1 manleysteele Aug 10, 2016, 5:56 PM Anonymous said: Anonymous said: This little blurb gives me pause.

It's a NAND replacement on a memory bus. The early adapters will pay a premium. I accept that. What I won't accept is 32-64GByte of storage, for the price of 2TBytes of storage in my precious memory slot. I'll just populate with memory and go on about my business in that case. Unless and until Intel and Micron get this price structure under control, I'll wait. 0 MRFS Aug 10, 2016, 6:42 PM > Unless and until Intel and Micron get this price structure under control, I'll wait. I agree 200%. Case in point: note well how Intel's emphasis is now the big data centers, at the expense of individual prosumers. ("We are NOT an oligopoly," cried the entire group of SSD manufacturers.) Plug-and-Play is also being neglected, and ways to circumvent the ceiling imposed by Intel's narrow DMI 3.0 link must come from third-party vendors. Why not populate 2.5" SSDs with 3D XPoint, and work "backwards" to raise the ceilings imposed by the upstream circuitry? If SAS clocks can oscillate at 12G, then the data channels to 2.5" Optane SSDs can go at least that fast, if not also 16G. So, start out with SAS-only 2.5" Optane SSDs. Think about the large number of 12G SAS RAID controllers to choose from, with full support for all modern RAID modes. Plug and Play, remember? The infrastructure is already in place to cool 2.5" form factors with any of several hundred chassis now being marketed worldwide. 3.5-to-2.5" adapters are a dime a dozen. If I were a decision maker at ASUS, I would start designing a motherboard with at least 4 x U.2 ports, support for all modern RAID modes and a BIOS setting allowing the clock speed to vary -- perhaps with pre-sets like 6G, 8G, 12G and 16G. While they are at it, add 128b/130b jumbo frames as another option! This approach seems a lot more sensible to me, anyway, than 3 x M.2 slots that are not bootable, that are also prone to overheating and hence thermal throttling, and that can't exceed the DMI 3.0 ceiling because those M.2 slots are all downstream of that DMI link. Heck, I remain convinced that the original architecture of PCI-Express was to permit expansion slots to be populated with new Add-On Cards withOUT needing to upgrade an entire motherboard. Wasn't that one of the main reasons why PCI-Express was developed in the first place? 1 PaulAlcorn Aug 10, 2016, 7:06 PM Anonymous said: Allyn Malventano at pcper.com writes about the U.2 chart: http://www.pcper.com/news/Storage/FMS-2016-Micron-Keynote-Teases-XPoint-QuantX-Real-World-Performance "These are the performance figures from an U.2 device with a PCIe 3.0 x4 link.

The race to the bottom has moved Flash into the realm of a primary drive system today. Xpoint is going to be similar. I expect a 128GB/256GB Xpoint setup to be coupled with some slower flash drive(s) for capacity. The entertaining part is that the slow drive will be NVMe cards and the spin drive will finally be dead in the enthusiast class machine. Continuing to reduce the storage bottleneck will be much more of a perceivable user experience change than increasing CPU performance. With all of this being piled on the PCI bus available channels are going to start becoming more relevant due to storage concerns rather than multiple GPU cards. 1 jasonf2 Aug 11, 2016, 12:23 AM Anonymous said: "Much of the leading-edge developmental work to increase performance is focusing on peeling back these layers... such as reducing interrupts by utilizing polling drivers ... can offer drastic performance increases" - I really don't know how realistic this idea is, but maybe its worth trying using pcie entries (cards, cables) inside big data (fastest nand etc..) just as SAS controllers are used in SCSI /SATA/ethernet. Does that make sense? If many pcie connections to fast data can work simultaneously and manipulate the data, then we can drop Ethernet style switches with load balancing, latency and other last millennium concerns .. no? If we look at SATA its primary target for design was a spin drive that topped out at around 30-60 megabytes per second with 8-9 millisecond seek times. The design was really there to optimize the CPUs ability to mitigate this bottleneck. For the first time we started to see serialization of the consumer hard drive bus which allowed for simpler cabling and better error handling, but at a theoretical cost of performance in latency because we now have to serialize, and then de-serialize the data. In real world performance the answer to this is to simply increase bandwidth thus it is faster, right? Not really. If we look at spin drive performance on PATA vs First Gen SATA there wasn't a real magical performance leap. A spin drive still performed pretty much the same. Some manufactures were throwing bigger cache on the board and increasing performance but not because of SATA. On the other hand SATA cables are definitely more reliable, easier to install and cheaper, thus the industry was all good with SATA. As the tech moved forward Native Command Queuing stepped in as well, which did give performance gains, but this wasn't really dependent on SATA and was a carryover from SCSI. It was a controller evolution technology that was just part of the SATA progression because by that time PATA was dead. In step SSD flash drives. Suddenly instead of 8-9 millisecond responses we move into 65 microseconds in a m25 drive. It is also reading at 250 megabytes per second and writing at 70! Suddenly your 1.5 Gigabit (remember to divide by 8 for bytes) SATA 1.0 bandwidth which is theoretically good for 188 megabytes per second (without overheads) is completely saturated. So the easy answer here is to keep jumping the bandwidth to keep up with the drives. So in concept we just keep bumping up the SATA spec and we will keep having faster drives? Well it doesn't work quite like that. Remember that issue of serializing/deserializing? It takes time. Also SATA controllers typically run on top of the PCI bus. And the PCI bus has interrupts that have to be flagged before the CPU will even look at them. Real world work loads on a computer are not about extremely large files that we move around in a linear fashion, but a ton of tiny files being appended and changed at unexpected times and most of the CPU time spent on a computer goes into an idle cycle. So first generation SSD's magic over spin drives wasn't really the bandwidth, but actually the latency reduction. Suddenly IOPS became a thing. As flash SSDs have matured the controller technology has significantly reduced the latency. So much that the SATA controller and bus simply being there became a bottleneck. Current NVMe drives are now down to 20 microsecond latency. That is with the drive sitting directly on the PCI bus. If Xpoint on the lowest level is really 1000x faster than flash the PCI(e) bus itself is already a latency bottleneck. And latency here will be key for perceivable performance change, not simply bandwidth. The wild part here is that even as an infant prototype tech it is already maxing out x4 PCI lanes in the bandwidth arena. DRAM which has operated in the nanosecond arena for quite a while now (15-25 nanoseconds) isn't put on top of the PCI bus for this very reason. It has its own special bus, linked to the CPU, so that that ultra low latency can do its thing. Xpoint's latency figures put it into a class that is somewhat slower than DRAM, but in the nanosecond class. That means that this stuff sitting on a PCI(e) bus will probably only show 10x-20x gains because PCI is the primary bottleneck. On the other hand tweaked into a new DRAM super-set that gain will get much closer to the 1000x figure. As storage latency approaches CPU clock cycle on gains of this magnitude we will have real world performance changes that will be much more perceivable than doubling CPU performance. Being in these forums though everyone seems focus on bandwidth. In real world applications if I am retrieving a 150 kilobyte file with 200-300 nanoseconds latency on the RAM bus in contrast with 2-20 microseconds on PCI I will have finished the total operation before the high bandwidth low latency connection even starts (even if we bound 40 PCI lanes to the NVme controller and have an unwieldy ability to move a massive file). Quit worrying about 12gbs channels and start focusing on getting this stuff closer to the CPU. 16x PCI e is already at 16 GB per second but binding channels won't reduce latency. 0 rtrski Aug 11, 2016, 6:17 AM " the four chips on the two daughterboards are the first 3D XPoint packages we have seen in the wild. The packages are unmarked, but the overall capacity of the PCIe 3.0 x8 card weighs in at 128 GB. We are unsure if there are more packages on the board, as our time with the prototype was short. If there were only four packages on the board, it would equate to 32 GB per package. Micron noted that 20nm 3D XPoint would feature a die density of 128 Gbit (16 GB) per die, so that implies that each of the four packages features a two-die stack." Um, I'd say its pretty obvious there are 8 packages there. The two riser cards have two each on top, and the patterns diagonally from them clearly indicate the other 2 mounted underneath. They must've had a trace width / layer count issue for the dev board to fan out all the connections hence the top/bottom staggering. 0 rtrski Aug 11, 2016, 6:21 AM ....or the boards were designed for 4 packages each but only 2 positions were populated and I'm seeing the landing pads for the 2 not placed. ;-) But that wouldn't equate to the die density statement from Micron. Hm.... 1 justasii Aug 11, 2016, 8:30 AM It seems to me at this point local computing hardware needs to get away from the memory/storage archetype and move to 100% memory with secondary external storage for archiving and low use storage. There seems very little separating RAM and NAND and I think this is the next step in faster more responsive computing. This would be a paradigm shift though. Industry momentum will likely keep this from happening for a long time. The idea and having 1 TB of storage located at the memory level is pretty interesting to me. I am sure there are issues I am not addressing while considering this, but at this point having a separate memory system makes so sense. Just load everything into solid sate storage. Instant boots? No caching delays? Yes sir, thanks. Because as far as I know, almost 100% waiting for computers has to do with memory/storage swaps and loading cache data to run programs. I could be wrong, I am not an expert. 0 MRFS Aug 11, 2016, 11:26 AM > a 200 GB QuantX SSD saturates the x4 bus at QD4 > The second chart is an identical test with an x8 connection. x4 saturates bus at 900 x8 saturates bus at 1800 = almost exactly linear scaling. Thus, x16 saturates bus at 3600?? Looks like lane count makes a BIG DIFFERENCE. I'd like to see the same comparison of sequential speeds: that will permit an empirical calculation of controller overhead vs. theoretical maximum bandwidth. 0 PaulAlcorn Aug 11, 2016, 12:15 PM Anonymous said: " the four chips on the two daughterboards are the first 3D XPoint packages we have seen in the wild.

Intel is getting serious about artificial intelligence, specifically as a driver of chip sales. On Tuesday, the company announced plans to acquire Nervana Systems, a deep learning company based in San Diego, Calif. Financial terms for the deal were not disclosed, but Recode reports the deal is valued at around $408 million, citing "a source with knowledge of the deal." "With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies," said Naveen Rao, CEO and cofounder of Nervana Systems, in a blog post. Artificial intelligence is not science fiction, said Diane Bryant, EVP and general manager of the data center group at Intel, in a blog post. Rather, she said, it is all around us, enabling speech recognition, image recognition, fraud detection, and self-driving cars. "Encompassing compute methods like advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world," said Bryant. At the heart of the industry's enthusiasm for AI is the massive amount of data available through online interaction, mobile devices, sensors, and various other inputs to train AI models. With enough data, AI can make good decisions, and it may be necessary to make sense of large data sets. "The ability to analyze and derive value from that data is one of the most exciting opportunities for us all," said Bryant. "Central to that opportunity is artificial intelligence." Intel's Diane Bryant with Nervana's cofounder Naveen Rao. (Image: Intel) Intel says it intends to use Nervana's technology to optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and to integrate it into industry-standard AI frameworks, and to improve the deep learning performance of Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors. The chipmaker aims to supply the hardware that powers the intensive computation behind AI software. It also has to move fast, because other technology companies are already developing silicon optimized for AI number crunching. Bryant says that more than 97% of the servers handling machine learning computation rely on Intel processors, but Intel's dominance may not last as other companies develop processors optimized for AI workloads. [Curious about machine learning? Read Google Open Sources Machine Learning Library TensorFlow.] At Google I/O in May, CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that Google has created an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) solely to handle deep learning calculations made with the Tensor Flow framework that Google released as an open source project last year. In April, NVIDIA unveiled its Tesla P100 GPU chip for deep learning computation. In December last year, Facebook open sourced the design for its Big Sur AI server, made with components from Quanta and NVIDIA. In February, MIT researchers showed off "Eyeriss," a chip design they claim can handle AI processing about 10 times faster than current GPUs. Overall, fewer than 10% of servers worldwide handled machine learning tasks last year, according to Bryant, but industry enthusiasm for the AI appears bound to drive more usage. During Google's Q3 2015 earnings call, Pichai described AI and its related disciplines as central to the company's future. Baidu, Facebook, and Microsoft, and perhaps even Apple (which last week acquired AI startup Turi) have shown similar interest in the technology. Intel has finally recognized that AI isn't a passing fad.  Thomas Claburn has been writing about business and technology since 1996, for publications such as New Architect, PC Computing, InformationWeek, Salon, Wired, and Ziff Davis Smart Business.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel buys AI start-up Nervana for £312 million By Sead Fadilpašić Shares Intel is buying machine learning start-up Nervana, and it's paying some serious money for it. According to multiple media sources, the 48-person start-up was acquired for a stunning $408 million (£312m). Nervana is an artificial intelligence company which is looking to integrate AI beyond the usual software – it wants to squeeze it into the chips themselves. And who better to team up with to achieve that goal than Intel – one of the biggest chipmakers in the world. But the deal isn't around consumer electronics – it's about chips in data centres. According to Intel vice president Jason Waxman, data centres and internet of things devices will operate such huge amounts of data, it will be virtually impossible for humans to use them. Beyond all of this is an interesting idea – Intel believes artificial intelligence, especially in IoT and data centres, will eclipse the move to cloud computing. “There's always a next wave,” Waxman said. “I firmly believe this is not only the next wave but something that will dwarf the last wave.” On the other hand, it seems as Nervana doesn't mind being part of Intel, either. “By selling to Intel”, he said, “we have access to technology we'd never dream about.” Photo credit: StockStudio / Shutterstock Load Comments GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Micron QuantX technology SSDs will use 3D XPoint non-volatile memory and are a completely separate set of products to Intel's Optane range. There will be fantastic performance advances on offer when these drives come to market, however the cost of 3D XPoint memory is about four to five times more expensive than NAND flash. In a blog post Micron crows about the performance of its upcoming QuantX technology drives, using 3D XPoint memory. It says that users can benefit from performance "over 10X better than the best NAND flash-based SSDs" when using a PCIe interface. The EE Times observed "prototype SSDs with Xpoint memory chips on a PCIe Gen 3 interface handling writes at less than 20 microseconds and reads and less than 10 ms" at the Flash Memory Summit, in Santa Clara, California. With access to four PCIe channels Micron QuantX drives could deliver up to 900,000 IOPS, or with eight lane PCIe connections up to 1.9 million IOPS. Turning to information about capacities, Micron plans to launch QuantX SSD products ranging from 200GB to 1.6TB. The first generation of drives will be aimed at data centre customers, arriving from approx Q2 2017 onwards. It isn't until 2019 that Micron forsees its 3D Xpoint based memory products providing 'break-out' revenue. Previously Intel has indicated that 3D Xpoint offers up to 10x the density of NAND so the tech will enable smaller, higher capacity storage devices. Micron revealed that 3D XPoint memory costs about half as much as DRAM but about four or five times as much as flash NAND. Due to this it is thought unlikely to replace NAND for prosumers, for now, but will replace DRAM for many enterprise applications. Meanwhile major storage and server vendors are clamouring to get 3D XPoint memory based products like Micron's QuantX technology range. Actual product pricing wasn't touched upon but it is thought that the expense of the new 3D Xpoint memory means that Micron will focus on enterprise, however Intel has plans for M.2 Optane drives for laptops and tablets. In other Micron news, the firm has introduced Mobile 3D NAND for next-generation smartphones. The first such products will be based upon the Universal Flash Storage (UFS) 2.1 standard and could offer up to 20 per cent better energy efficiency. All photos from The SSD Review.

Inability to factor costs correctly or taking the industry for a ride? Posted by badass - Wed 10 Aug 2016 12:15 shaithis That's a FAR cry from the “cheaper than NAND” line they were touting at the end of last year. Inability to factor costs correctly or taking the industry for a ride? Except they weren't. The line was “cheaper than DRAM” Posted by shaithis - Wed 10 Aug 2016 12:47 badass Except they weren't. The line was “cheaper than DRAM” How much faster is the 3D XPoint non-volatile memory? Intel and Micron claim it offers an astonishing speed of “up to 1,000 times faster than NAND”. Furthermore the new chips are ten times denser than conventional memory, thanks to the 3D structure and transistor-less design. The good news doesn't stop there as Intel and Micron scientists created the new chips to offer 1,000 times the endurance of NAND, lower power usage and to be more economical to produce. So, they did say that. Source Posted by 3dcandy - Wed 10 Aug 2016 12:54 I'm surprised at the cost to be honest…. but it should still be a good advance in tech Posted by sykobee - Wed 10 Aug 2016 14:04 The cost is the biggest downer here. Effectively DRAM pricing for Storage performance. You could get 200GB of this for the price of 100GB of DRAM - many would go for the DRAM. Sure, it's a factor of two cheaper than DRAM, and it's an order of magnitude lower latency than SSD (10x, not 1000x faster), but it's still 3 orders of magnitude higher latency than DRAM. Bandwidth wasn't mentioned, but over PCIe it's going to be far lower than DRAM too. But, every advance starts like this, and then costs come down, densities go up, and performance improves. In 5 years time this may be ready for prosumers!

Co-founded by Naveen Rao in 2014 and headquartered in San Diego, California, Nervana has a fully-optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning. The US-based chip giant isn’t actually saying how much it is paying, but a source with knowledge of the deal said it is valued at around $408 million, according to Recode, a technology news website that focuses on the business of Silicon Valley. “Today, I am excited to announce that Intel signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a recognised leader in deep learning,” Diane Bryant, Executive Vice President of Data Center Group at Intel said. “We will share more about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the amazing experiences it enables at our Intel Developer Forum next week,” Bryant said. “Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” she said. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” she added. “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible. We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio,” Bryant said. “We’ve always been a mission driven company. Even though we won’t be a startup any longer, our mission hasn’t changed. We are here to make a dent in the world of computation, Rao said. “With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing. We’ll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural,” he said. According to Rao, the semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world. Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realise our vision and create something truly special, Rao said. He said that the deal didn’t reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy. But by selling to Intel, we have access to technology we’d never dream about,” Rao was quoted as saying Recode. Intel is one of the world’s largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Intel Acquires AI Start-up Nervana Systems Posted: Aug 10 2016, 1:48am CDT | by IANS, in News | Latest Business News      Announcing a big foray into the world of artificial intelligence (AI), the chip giant Intel has acquired San Diego, California-based deep learning start-up Nervana Systems. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon Coming ahead of the Intel Developer Forum next week, the acquisition gives Intel a definitive head start towards advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. Although the financial details were not disclosed, according to a Re/Code report, the software giant is paying more than $400 million to buy Nervana led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao. "We will apply Nervana's software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks," Diane Bryant, Executive Vice President of Data Center Group at Intel, said in a statement on Wednesday. "Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel's AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors," she explained. Intel processors power nearly 97 percent of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads today. "Nervana's IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel's capabilities in the field of AI," Bryant added. The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference and the recently launched Intel Xeon Phi processor delivers the scalable performance needed for deep learning training. "While less than 10 percent of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest growing form of AI," the Intel executive said. "We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel's AI portfolio," she added. Nervana recently raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the US intelligence community's venture arm. According to Rao, the deal did not reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. "Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy but by selling to Intel we have access to technology we'd never dream about," Rao was quoted as saying.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 9, 2016 at 9:00PM Image credit: Intel.  A little while ago, respected technology website PC Watch revealed the existence of a future Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processor family code-named Coffee Lake. This processor family, PC Watch reported, would essentially be a fourth generation of processors built on the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology aimed at certain segments of the personal-computer market. Intel hasn't publicly commented about the reports, but a company executive may have accidentally revealed the existence of Coffee Lake at a recent investor conference. Here's what was said Intel's Brice Hill recently presented at an investor conference hosted by Pacific Crest. At the conference, an analyst asked Hill about the potential impact of the elongation of Intel's development cycle, from about two years to about three, on Intel's manufacturing lead over the rest of the industry, as well as the desirability of Intel's products to end customers. Hill had quite a lot to say, but here's the bit that's relevant to Coffee Lake (emphasis mine): "On product competitiveness, what you see with Intel currently is we're able to push the performance of our current generations of products. So for a short period of time, if we elongate the design cycle, we can develop a third or fourth generation of product that gives you a performance boost in the market that continues the customer expectation from a performance advancement perspective." Intel may be employing a new strategy with respect to process The main show-stopper with respect to Intel's 14-nanometer ramp-up was that it couldn't get manufacturing yields under control. Not only did this lead to an elevated cost structure for 14-nanometer products relative to their 22-nanometer predecessors, but it also led to some supply shortages, particularly for high-performance parts. Intel's problem is that, historically, once it begins transitioning to a new manufacturing technology, it has to transition practically all of its products -- from high-performance desktop chips all the way to low-power 2-in-1 processors -- to this new manufacturing technology fairly quickly. In the past, when Intel's process development went more smoothly, this didn't present much of an issue. Today, however, the reality is that Intel doesn't seem to be able to develop new manufacturing technologies and get them to high yield levels as quickly as it could previously. Intel's new strategy could be this: Move to new manufacturing technologies as quickly as possible in segments that can really benefit from them, while building new products on more mature technologies for market segments that don't benefit as much from such technology transitions. What such a strategy allows Intel to do is to keep a large portion of its product mix in more mature manufacturing technologies, minimizing the potential negative gross margin impact that would come from transitioning other products to a newer, lower-yielding manufacturing process. Once yields on the company's newest manufacturing process matures, Intel can then begin releasing new products based on that process into segments of the market that hadn't yet undergone the process transition without fear of gross-margin erosion.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Nervana blijft actief en blijft ook gevestigd in San Diego.  Nervana Systems lanceerde onder meer een cloudsysteem waarmee klanten op afstand gebruik konden maken van kunstmatige intelligentie. Het bedrijf werkt echter ook aan een speciale chip die zich puur richt op kunstmatige intelligentie. Die chip zou in 2017 op de markt moeten verschijnen. Intel zal de technologie van Nervana gebruiken om zich verder te richten op kunstmatige intelligentie en de producten die zich daar mee bezig houden te verbeteren, zo laat het bedrijf weten.  "We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks," Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel, said of the acquisition. "Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors." As for Nervana itself, the company will continue to operate out of its San Diego location, and doesn't expect staffing changes. "Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform, and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware," Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of the company, wrote today. "The combination of Nervana’s technology and expertise incorporated into Intel’s portfolio will take deep learning/AI solutions to the next level."

Nervana recently raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the US intelligence community’s venture arm. According to Rao, the deal did not reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy but by selling to Intel we have access to technology we’d never dream about,” Rao was quoted as saying.

View Latest Posts >>> Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia (Part III) By Preston James, Ph.D on August 9, 2016 A core edict of the Khazarian Mafia Top Command is to transform the American Masses into self-hating, self-defeating, mind-kontrolled dupes who can never understand what is being done to them by the KM. by  Preston James   The KM has an age-old inter-generational agenda, and it us necessary for the KM to maintain abject secrecy otherwise the masses will revolt with pitchforks: We now know for certain there is a method and an age-old inter-generational agenda behind the seeming madness and unimaginable evil of the KM’s Top Chieftains, the soulless criminal psychopaths that control the Khazarian Mafia and set USG policy. The KM agenda is specific: It is now known that the KM has a specific Agenda. That agenda is to establish the KM’s desired end state, a One-world Global NWO system governed by Lucifer. These Top KM Chieftains believe they will be regenerated to immortality upon the arrival of their descended master Lucifer. And the KM has a select set of methodologies deployed to attain this evil agenda: And it is now known that the KM has a set of select methodologies used over the last 1,000 years to attain their agenda which is now close to attainment. And these methodologies include sophisticated mind-kontrol, deployment of synthetic terror and manufactured wars, induced drug addiction slavery, Fiat debt slavery, and a general strategy of “divide and conquer” to create ongoing chaos. They would perhaps already have attained their unimaginably evil agenda but for recent blockages due to the alternative news of the Internet and a spontaneously emerging populism inside America and Europe because of it. In their quest to always improve their ability to spy on the masses, the Secret Shadow Government (SSG) which is a KM creation, set up the Internet, believing it would be the greatest spy tool yet devised. That turned out to be true, but there was a serious side-effect that the Top Chieftains of the KM never expected. That was the quick emergence of the alternative media on the Internet and the steady increase in its users who left their Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) to habitually use it to get the news and to start researching current events as well as historical events of the past. The KM countered this by setting up hundreds of misinformation websites. However, in order to gain any following at all they had to play the “limited hangout” game. They had to include a fair proportion of truth in their stories or no one would use their sites or be subject to any of their propaganda as “bad payloads”. A lot of these misinformation websites supported by KM Cutouts and proprietaries would put out about 70-80% good info with a periodic very bad misinforming payload. Glenn Beck has been fingered by some as a typical example, others identify Alex Jones too, but there are likely many others. It is known that both periodically do carry some good stories too. Top of the Pyramid kissing their god of the black sun Satan What ended up happening with many users was that they became so sophisticated in their processing and understanding of how the world really works that they were not fooled by this”limited hangout” strategy. Many of these alternative news website users have been able to ignore the bad payloads and select the truth nuggets and connect these dots from many different websites in their heads, and come up with composites of what is really happening that are fairly accurate. Plus, there are some alternative media websites like Veterans Today or Rense.com which are often the first to dump serious hidden facts and Intel out there for all to use as they wish. What is the specific end game for the Top Chieftains of the KM?:  These Select Few KM criminal psychopaths believe that as they seat Lucifer in their NWO temple in Jerusalem to be their ruling world master, they will personally be transformed into eternal gods, and will rule the universe forever with their master Lucifer. The sad fact is that this Khazarian Mafia is just the current expression of this secret sect of Luciferians, going back all the way to ancient Babylonia and beyond. It is the Order of the Snake, but has many other names and is ancient Baal worship driven by a set of root beliefs called Babylonian Talmudism, but it is also known as Luciferianism, Satanism, High Freemasonry, OTO, and many more. The big problem the KM’s top Chieftains now face is the fact that slowly but surely the masses are finding out about who they are specifically and what their evil agenda is. Should these KM Top Chieftains be surprised when Goyim find out about this and want them indicted, arrested, jailed and executed for a whole laundry list of unimaginably evil capital crimes including mass-murder, war crimes, terrorism and crimes against humanity, and before the KM can complete its notoriously anti-human, anti-Goyim Globalist NWO Agenda? _________ White Dragon Society There has been a startling recent development reported by Benjamin Fulford, former Editor of Forbes for Japan who is periodically approached by the White Dragon Society (WDS). The WDS is a secret, incredibly wealthy, powerful organization of Chinese businessmen likely associated with Chinese Freemasonry. Benjamin Fulford, former Forbes Editor for Japan, incredibly gifted intellectually, multilingual, with known deep Intel connections and important back-channel contacts inside Japan and China and highly respected in certain high political circles there Recently, according to Benjamin Fulford’s account, the official representative of the White Dragon Society set him straight and apparently advised him that the WDS was very concerned with the way the Khazarian Mafia was misusing their power to generate tyranny, oppression, poverty, disease, and mass death all over the world. This WDS official representative and spokesman advised Benjamin Fulford that the WDS was going to issuing a “deck of playing cards” for the KM Top Chieftains. A deck of playing cards like the deck that the Bush2 administration issued in the second Gulf War and that these cards were going to have massive rewards behind them, totaling about 40 million USD, paid in gold Bullion upon proof of capture. VT in no way would recommend such an action, nor would I. Nor has Fulford, who has simply reported what is happening. This is important news because it could turn out to be a major lane changing event for the KM; something they really had far too much hubris to ever anticipate. The KM Top Chieftains have been accustomed to always winning and having the skids greased by Lucifer using supernatural means. But what if their god Lucifer is a lesser god and plans to now throw them under the bus in order to attain his own private agenda that doesn’t include them? All the recent evidence now points to that and it looks like because of the Internet and the worldwide populism it is generating, the KM is being exposed more and more by the day. Yes, it looks like the KM will likely be sacrificed itself by Lucifer so he can fool the world by pretending he is the good guy, the Christ, the Messiah. Is such a transformation necessary to fool as many of the world’s masses as possible? If true and that’s the way it seems, soon the KM Top Chieftains and most of their cutouts are going to be thrown under the bus. If this WDS “deck of cards” action actually begins in earnest, it will signify two things have already occurred: First, it implies that the KM’s abject secrecy and near complete mind-kontrol systems so necessary for the maintaining world power and hegemony have been breached, and the truth about KM evil Globalist NWO Agenda is now beginning to be publicly proclaimed worldwide. In order to maintain maximum power and control the KM ‘s Top Chieftains must maintain abject secrecy. That is why most Intel, except for those exposed to wide ranging events (usually only the Intel Cowboys) have been kept so highly compartmented that most VT readers know far more than they do. Intel Cowboys (some are women too) have been leaking the highest, most closely guarded secrets for the last 25 years ever since the iron curtain fell and the cold war ended. And there have been major leaks of KM secret evil as a result of various highly connected individuals at the periphery of the KM have started leaking their dirty laundry and inner sanctum secrets. Second, it would mean that at least one powerful, wealthy major secret society with its home-base in mainland China resents all the destruction and death the KM is deploying on the world and is going to take serious steps to expose it and stop it. And it would suggest that this particular secret society the WDS in now putting their vast wealth behind their decision that the KM must be stopped soon before the KM destroys the world and mass-murders 90% of the Earth’s population. _________ More actual core belief patterns of the KM Top Chieftains The actual core belief patterns of the KM Top Chieftains are based on their deep Babylonian Talmudic (Luciferian/Satanic) values which they use to determine their Core Edicts by which they establish policies while sitting at the top of their pyramidal Establishment Hierarchy. The actual core belief patterns of the KM Top Chieftains is an age old secret of these inbred “bloodline” families that form the nexus of the Khazarians and old black nobility. It is allegedly all based on their common secret occult network which insiders call the “Order of the Snake”. Others have called it the Black Sun, the Reich of the Black Sun, the Great Dragon (the alien ET beast, Draco), the Serpent”, but they all represent the Order of the Snake and ancient Babylonian Talmudism, aka secret Baal worship. It has been reported that this occult network which covers most of the world, is nothing more than the deep secret of the worldwide Satanic Cult network that is centered in the USA, the UK and Europe that serves up little kids to pedophiles to abuse and more than rarely tortures and sacrifices them. Here is a secretly recorded, later leaked video clip from a High Freemason ritual in which the first part involved hired women to provide “special” entertainment. You can only guess what is not included in this video clip, former High Freemasons who have attended such special meetings have suggested that these events ended up getting pretty spicy with top floors of expensive hotels rented and prepaid high class hookers for all. _________ The UK is run by High Freemasonry top to bottom, the police, the courts, the government and this is a poorly kept secret. In America a lot of these institutions are run by smaller numbers of High Freemasons and OTO members, but this is a closely guarded secret. Some are openly members of the Satanic/Pedophile network that traffics in child sex victims over the whole western world and much of the rest of the world too. Hitler and his top Nazi command were deeply involved in the Reich of the Black Sun, believed by some researchers to be covert Satanism. Some researchers believe human sacrifice rituals were done in the basement pit of Wewelsberg Castle. And during a short time, it was reported that 17,000 political prisoners were sacrificed in a special building that had hydraulically operated guillotines. The only reference I could find was a UK story that documented 16,500 executions by guillotine, but no mention of the hydraulic guillotines. The Core Edicts of the KM Top Chieftains are oriented to managing American institutions and American culture in such a way to mind-kontrol and manipulate the American Masses and We The People become dirtied up with drugs and alcohol and self-defeating, shameful behaviors. But these destructive behaviors also appear to cause individuals to self-hate, self-abuse further, and can lead also individuals to become self-defeating enemies of themselves, their families and society. This of course makes the KM’s attainment of their evil Globalist NWO Agenda so much easier. _________ Conclusion In order for the KM to attain it Globalist NWO Agenda, the KM must attain its goals: – destruction of normal male female sex roles; – diversity, perversity and political correctness as the “new normal”; – loss of American borders, culture and language; – out of control medical costs and costs of living due to inflation built created and mandated by the private Federal Reserve System; – no more living wages for employment; – the destruction of the American family; – no more interest on saving and investments that will match the inflation caused by FRS FIAT “fake money”; – massive unemployment and no more job security; – the end of unions; – and massive taxation, massive debt slavery and usurious credit card loans; – corruption of the Judiciary and discarding of the US Constitution by the USG and the Judiciary at all levels; – proliferation of weird occult networks and sometimes secret promotion of strange blood practices to extend the life of the rich super-elites; – massive weapons and drug trafficking into American Urban centers by the CIA and the promotion of gangs and use of terror entrapment ops to gain more central power and taxpayer financing; – socially engineered massive addiction to legal and illegal drugs and alcohol to promote gangs, foment massive chaos, and to destroy the general morality and character of the American Masses; – a generally poor and completely irrelevant public education system secretly designed inside the beltway to dumb kids down and make them good KM mind-kontrolled debt-slaves; – to poison the food and water with GMOs and endocrine disruptors; – to over-vaccinate with toxic vaccines that often cause mini-strokes and autism spectrum disorders in alarmingly high rates in innocent children unable to give adequate consent for themselves with parents too dumbed-down to know better; and – to entrain the masses through super high tech psychotronic induction means, including orbital based Helium 3 powered scalar transmitters, use of cell phone systems and WI-FI, mass-mind-kontrol through TV “programming”, as well as certain secretly deployed ELF ground wave systems and the little understood Lilly waves which can be transmitted through the power grid. But all these KM curses being deployed against the American Masses have only been able to be deployed because they first got control of almost every single American institution, including those of the Federal and State governments, the Judiciary, the Congress, private business, the NGOs and private foundations and think-tanks, the Administration, the High Military Command, American Intel and a now largely militarized LE system absorbed by the new KM-created and -run Homeland Security (DHS). Unless Americans wake up soon and start standing against these KM monsters en masse at every level inside and outside the USG and even within the KM itself, America will be soon destroyed, depopulated by 90% and there will be no future for America’s young children at all. _______________ Related Posts: Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia (Part IV) Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia Top Command (Part II) Vladimir Putin: Who will protect young boys from pedophiles and rapists in Europe?

That doesn’t mean he didn’t say some things that could be construed as his intent to expose the bad guys – but pass the word. 🙂 Thanks. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  August 15, 2016 at 11:32 am I was told it was an excerpt from the script from his speech at Colombia University which was suppressed and never published in full. Also he gave several speeches on the abhorrence of secrecy and made references in at least one to this. And as you suggest if he didn’t really state this as is, Bobby often discussed this with his top staff at the Dept of Justice when he was US Attorney General. When I heard that I thought he was referring to the vast reach of the Sicilian Mafia (Cosa Nostra). Now looking back I think he was referring to a much bigger criminal syndicate with the Sicilian Mafia only a small part. The fact that JFK signed an order to print US Dollars once again suggests that he looked at the Banksters as the root problem of this large criminal conspiracy. jonnbrown  August 24, 2016 at 10:41 am 100% agreed Dr. James.

The vatican also worships baal (sun worship) and that’s why all the occult symbolism. The churches in the U.S. support them because they tell them they’re the chosen ones. They end up supporting baal worship. Lots of links here about it: nut@n.nu Log in to Reply jensingr  August 10, 2016 at 4:52 pm I would like to add a couple of things regarding the freemasons. Notice the black and white tiled floor in the video which can be seen in many movies, music videos, commercials, architecture and many of the castles where they live. When you start to notice their “symbols” you will see how much they have infiltrated all industries. The black and white symbolizes the good vs. bad, duality which Lucifer uses to pit one thing against another and hold us in the pattern. Another interesting point…… there is a HUGE “scottish rite freemasonry” temple in none other than San Bernadino where they made their sacrifice….. right off the 210 freeway, which btw emits one of the most negative frequencies I have ever felt.

By Sarmistha Acharya August 10, 2016 07:13 BST Intel announced it will acquire deep learning startup Nervana SystemsGetty Images Intel has said it is acquiring deep learning startup Nervana Systems as the world's largest chip maker turns its focus on expanding its artificial intelligence portfolio. The startup, founded in 2014, has a fully optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning. The company said it will continue to operate out of its San Diego headquarters. "With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing....... Nervana's AI expertise combined with Intel's capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realise our vision and create something truly special," said Nervana chief executive officer and co-founder Naveen Rao. Intel said it will apply Nervana's software expertise to optimise its Math Kernel Library. Besides, Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will help Intel advance its "AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of its Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors." While the term of the deal is yet to be disclosed, a source with knowledge of the matter told Recode the purchase price is around $408m (£312). Intel vice president Jason Waxman said the shift to AI could affect its move to cloud computing. He said machine learning is needed as the company moves from a world in which people control a couple of devices that connect to the internet to one in which billions of devices are connecting and talking to one another. Nervana has raised $25m in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel. "Raising money was not the problem. That was going to be relatively easy. But by selling to Intel we have access to technology we'd never dream about," Rao said. Intel said its processor powers more than 97% of the servers deployed to support machine learning workloads. Its Xeon processor belonging to the E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for the deep learning interface. The new Xeon Phi processor delivers performance that is required for deep learning training. "We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems' team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible," said Diane Bryant, Intel's executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group. "We will continue to invest in leading edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel's AI portfolio," she added.

Nervana, founded in 2014, operates a hosted platform for deep learning that’s geared towards solving “machine-learning problems,” the company says. The platform is optimized “from algorithms down to silicon,” and has been used for a wide range of tasks, including analyzing seismic data, studying plant genomes to find new hybrids and even searching for places to drill for oil. The most common use case however, is businesses looking to use Nervana’s cloud service to build and deploy applications that make use of deep learning, which is a branch of AI that’s used to uncover patterns in large pools of data, and perform voice and image recognition. More importantly, perhaps, Nervana is also said to be building a specialized processor, called an ASIC, that’s customized for deep learning. Intel didn’t disclose terms of the deal, but Re/Code reported that the figure is likely north of $400 million. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” said Diane Bryant, head of Intel’s Data Center Group, in a blog post. In addition, Bryant said Nervana’s expertise will help “advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep-learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors.” Intel adds AI “inside” its chips Computing has only just transitioned from mainframes and PCs to servers and cloud-based data center, but already it’s on the verge of a second transition, with the emergence of artificial intelligence technologies capable of injecting smarts into almost any object. Deep learning is at the core of this transition, responsible for new technological wonders such as self-driving cars and instant language translation on our phones. And now, chip makers like Intel are set to accelerate this transition by embedding deep learning software directly into the microprocessors that power everything from smartphones and connected cars to drones and much, much more. RELATED:  Microsoft says its speech recognition AI is a match for any human Intel, which has seen its PC market cash cow slowly but surely erode in the last few years, is desperate to be among the leaders of this brave new world. To date, most of its efforts in the AI space have focused on adapting its latest generation Xeon chips for use in AI and machine learning. Just last year it released a special version of that chip, called Xeon Phi, which came with more cores for parallel processing. With Nervana on board, Intel gains expertise on the software side that it can put to use right away. It also gains access to Nervana’s designs for specialized deep learning chips, so we can expect to see the development of these accelerate rapidly. Naveen Rao, who helped develop neural computer networks at Qualcomm Inc. before founding Nervana, said the company’s chip designs made it a natural fit for Intel. “Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special,” Rao said in a blog post announcing the acquisition. One of the chip’s key capabilities is said to be a much higher rate of data flow when compared with regular chips in use today. Rao told Fortune that the new chips are designed to mimic the parallel operation of neurons and synapses in the human brain in order to read and write data from storage, and share that data with other chips extremely rapidly. Nervana’s chips will be able to transfer data at speeds of 2.4 terabytes a second, with an ultra low latency of around five to ten times faster than current chips, Rao said.

With Nervana's suite of technology soon becoming part of Intel's portfolio, the chipmaker can now venture into creating even more stable and more powerful processors that run A.I. on board.  ( Intel ) Advertisement Deep learning startup Nervana has become Intel's latest acquisition target, in a deal that signals the microprocessor company's move deeper into the territory of artificial intelligence. While Intel has yet to release official figures, a source familiar with the acquisition says the agreement could be worth more than $400 million, Recode reports. The Next Revolution In Computing? Nervana is known for its advancement of A.I. through a combination of neuroscience, computer engineering and machine learning. The startup believes A.I. "will be the foundation of the next revolution in computing" as it rivals human performance — and Intel shares this belief. In fact, machine learning may prove to be even more revolutionary than cloud computing. Jason Waxman, VP for Intel, predicts people will soon be moving from devices that simply connect to the internet to devices that connect and talk with each other. Artificial Intelligence On A Chip One of Intel's challenges so far has been to bring A.I. on to its chips, in data centers and the mass market. With Nervana's suite of technology soon becoming part of Intel's portfolio, the chipmaker can now venture into creating more stable and more powerful processors that run A.I. on board. Some 97 percent of servers that currently support machine learning workloads, for example, is already powered by Intel processors. "The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference," notes Diane Bryant, EVP and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. On the other hand, the Xeon Phi processor offers the "scalable performance needed for deep learning training." In purchasing Nervana, Intel will be able to leverage Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise as it sharpens the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors' deep learning abilities even further. "Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts, including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform, and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware," says Naveen Rao, CEO and cofounder of Nervana. Nervana Is Pushing The Envelope Rao's team of 48 will be retained, becoming an integral part of Intel's Data Center Group, but it will continue to operate from its original headquarters in San Diego. Also worth noting is the fact that Nervana will hold on to its brand even after the acquisition. The startup is barely three years old, but investors have already been keen at lending support for the A.I. company. In 2015, the startup was able to pull up $25 million through venture funding. "We pushed the performance envelope in deep learning and will soon have a revolutionary new architecture to push it even further," Rao adds.

It is ideal for low power, dense computing applications thanks to the Intel® Xeon® D series processor and Intel® Ethernet multi-host controller (code name Red Rock Canyon) which provides dual 100G Ethernet interfaces and 100G switch. "The Artesyn SharpSwitch PCIE-9205 card uses Open vSwitch offload to ensure the maximum number of cores are available for payload processing in NFV applications," said Todd Wynia, platforms marketing vice president, Artesyn Embedded Technologies. "For example, in NFV applications, the SharpSwitch card can be used to provide high-speed ingress and egress while doing Open vSwitch offload, allowing a very high percentage of compute resources in the system to be used for application processing, such as baseband processing, IPSec termination or voice and video transcoding." Virtual Switch to Augment Hardware Solution In virtualized environments with dynamic workloads, virtual switches are required to forward packets internally and connect virtual machines to the outside world. In many cases, these virtual switches are implemented with Open vSwitch, emulating the function provided by physical switches. But virtualized switching comes at a cost. In certain configurations, Open vSwitch has been shown to require as much as half of the available processor cores for switching the traffic to and from the VMs running on a given server. By focusing on the minimal requirements for typical applications, and building on top of Intel® Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), Artesyn has designed a massively accelerated virtual switch to address these weaknesses. By using the SharpSwitch PCIE-9205 as an Open vSwitch accelerator, the vast majority of the available processor cycles in the system can be used for payload VMs. MaxCore™ Platform The SharpSwitch™ is optimized to work in Artesyn's MaxCore™ PCIe platforms which leverage off-the-shelf PCIe cards to create very low latency and low OpEx systems for applications such as vRAN, mini-CRAN, video transcode, VoLTE and security gateways.  Image SharpSwitch™ PCIE-9205 http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/5292 Company Logo http://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/1489 About Artesyn Embedded Technologies Artesyn Embedded Technologies is a global leader in the design and manufacture of highly reliable power conversion and embedded computing solutions for a wide range of industries including communications, computing, medical, military, aerospace and industrial.

 Intel buys artificial intelligence startup AFP Aug. 9, 2016, 10:10 PM 11 facebook linkedin twitter email print California-based computer chip colossus Intel looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding internet of things © Getty/AFP/File Justin Sullivan San Francisco (AFP) - US-based Intel announced a deal to buy an artificial intelligence startup as the computer chip colossus looks to broaden its role in data centers and the expanding internet of things. Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for Nervana Systems, but US media reports on Tuesday put the price at more than $350 million. "With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI (artificial intelligence) technologies," Nervana co-founder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. "We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing." Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialized in combining hardware and software to help machines think in ways similar to human brains, according to the companies. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to better handle "deep learning" in the internet cloud, Intel data center group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. "While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn't relegated to novels and movies," Bryant said. "AI is all around us."

Pictured are Intel’s Diane Bryant with Nervana co-founders Naveen Rao, Arjun Bansal, Amir Khosrowshaki and Intel vice president Jason Waxman Intel is buying San Diego's Nervana Systems. Pictured are Intel’s Diane Bryant with Nervana co-founders Naveen Rao, Arjun Bansal, Amir Khosrowshaki and Intel vice president Jason Waxman (Intel) Mike FreemanContact Reporter San Diego’s Nervana Systems, which has developed an artificial intelligence platform for analyzing massive amounts of data, has agreed to be acquired by Intel. The 48-employee company will remain in San Diego and operate under its own brand name, said co-founder and Chief Executive Naveen Rao. Founded in 2014 by computational neuro-scientists, Nervana raised more than $25 million from investors to design a neural network computing system that can learn on its own. The purchase price was not disclosed. But technology website Recode, founded by former Wall Street Journal tech journalists, reported that Intel will pay around $408 million for Nervana, citing sources familiar with the deal. The sale gives Nervana the resources, semiconductor expertise and customer access to flesh-out its artificial intelligence technology — which is made up of software and specialized computer chips, said Rao. “Now as part of Intel it is exciting to us because we have access to technology we simply couldn’t access before,” he said. Nervana has launched a cloud-based platform used for such things as pinpointing oil drilling sites from satellite photos, analyzing seed data to improve farming and combing financial reports to uncover bogus trading. Intel plans to blend Nervana into its data center business. The semiconductor giant makes chips that power most of the computer servers used in data centers. “Nervana has a fully optimized software and hardware stack for deep learning,” said Diane Bryant, executive vice president at Intel’s Data Center Group. “Their intellectual property and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence.” Jason Waxman, an Intel vice president, said computing is on the cusp of a transition to new architectures for analyzing big data. “We are moving to a world where the machines themselves are generating more data than we can keep up with,” Waxman said. “The idea behind artificial intelligence — with all the data given off by cars, planes, smart cities, health care and wearables — is how do you allow people to derive insight in a way that is manageable?” Today, Nervana’s cloud-based technology runs its artificial intelligence software — called Neon — on graphics processors from Nvidia. While the framework analyzes data fast, it could run algorithms even faster on its own silicon, said Rao. Nervana expects to have its own deep learning chips ready early next year. “We used the GPUs as a stop-gap,” Rao said. “Speed is super important in this space because training a neural network on existing hardware can take months. So speed is the true enabler here.” Nervana has competitors for its software platform — including Google’s TensorFlow and Microsoft’s Computational Network Toolkit. Rao said Nervana plans to continue to support other open source artificial intelligence software frameworks. “With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing,” he said. “We’ll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point when compute architectures became neural.” Investors in Nervana include DFJ Ventures, Data Collective, Allen & Co., AME Cloud Ventures, Playground Global, CME Group, Fuel Capital, Lux Capital and Omidyar Network. “The venture world doesn’t often get excited about a chip company these days, but Naveen and the Nervana founding team’s audacious plan to build a deep learning compute fabric that would take artificial intelligence to the next frontier had us captivated from day one,” said Steve Jurvetson, managing partner of DFJ, in a statement. “Cheers to the Nervana team.” Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 67°

Kent Tibbils, vice president of marketing at ASI, a Fremont, Calif.-based Intel system builder, cheered the acquisition as another example of "Intel's commitment to new technologies that leverage their core strengths."  "Although AI is still relatively new, Intel’s investment in this segment as well as their devotion to the health of the channel will ultimately help provide another path of opportunity for new products, new services and new solutions," he told CRN. "This isn’t to say that everyone will switch to AI-focused businesses models, but with Intel’s involvement there will be a market for the channel." [Related: CompuCom Brings Artificial Intelligence To Midmarket Data Centers With Breakthrough Cloud-Based Managed Service] Deep learning often requires the powerful and efficient parallel computing capabilities of GPUs – which Nvidia specializes in – to teach machines how to process text, voice and other types of data as part of artificial intelligence. However, instead of investing in GPUs, Intel seems to be taking a different approach to AI with its acquisition of San Diego-based Nervana Systems, which was named a “Cool Vendor” by Gartner this year for its novel semiconductors in neural networks. Intel did not disclose the price nor terms of the deal. Nervana Systems touts a full-stack hosted platform for deep learning, Nervana Cloud, which helps businesses develop and deploy high-accuracy deep learning systems. The company is also developing Nervana Engine, an application-specific integrated circuit for deep learning. “[Nervana Systems'] IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI,” said Diane Bryant, executive vice president of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel's Data Center Group. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors.” While Intel owns FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) that have specific function accelerators, including inference engines for deep learning, it can now flesh out its artificial learning capabilities with the addition of Nervana Cloud. "Intel’s strength has always been to take innovative ideas and products and commercialize them," said Stephen Monteros, vice president of business development and strategic initiatives at Sigmanet, an Ontario, Calif.-based Intel partner. "Intel for the most part is driven by a vision to develop large-scale commercially viable products, [and] they must feel this will help them get there." Intel’s deal for Nervana Systems follows Apple’s reported $200 million acquisition of artificial intelligence Seattle startup Turi Friday, as more vendors continue to invest in machine learning capabilities.

The Santa Clara company bought artificial intelligence firm Nervana. Photo: KIMIHIRO HOSHINO, AFP/Getty Images Business News Roundup, Aug. 10 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Intel buys AI startup Intel, which makes chips that run more than 90 percent of the world’s servers, will buy San Diego startup Nervana Systems to add software, a cloud service and forthcoming hardware in an attempt to better tune its products for artificial intelligence work. While Intel’s Xeon processors dominate in data centers, they’re not built for the unique workloads of artificial intelligence calculations, according to Gartner analyst Martin Reynolds. Adding Nervana’s products and expertise will help the Santa Clara company gain a foothold in a small but growing market and fend off would-be rivals such as Nvidia, if it can rapidly turn its acquisition into products. “The market isn’t that big yet,” he said. “But it’s potentially a huge opportunity.” Intel’s data center unit, its most profitable and fastest-growing business, needs to find products suited to running services such as voice and picture recognition. Such artificial intelligence work is expected to become a bigger portion of the activity of the servers powered by Intel’s chips. Nervana was founded in 2014. Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed. Earnings SolarCity posts big loss SolarCity’s loss swelled in the second quarter as it seeks approval from shareholders to be acquired by Tesla Motors. The net loss was $55.5 million (56 cents per share), compared with $22.4 million (23 cents) a year earlier, the San Mateo company said Tuesday. Excluding some items, the loss was $2.32, less than the $2.53 analysts had expected. Sales rose to $185.8 million from $102.8 million. The largest U.S. rooftop solar installer has trimmed its growth forecast after a strategic shift in October to focus on profitability, and its shares have slumped by more than half this year. While billionaire Elon Musk has touted the long-term synergies between Tesla’s electric cars powered by SolarCity systems, some investors have been skeptical about the benefits to Tesla. SolarCity’s board agreed last week to a reduced offer of $2.6 billion in Tesla shares, a little more than a month after Musk made a $2.8 billion unsolicited offer for the company founded by his cousins. Musk is chairman and the largest shareholder in both companies. SolarCity and Tesla have not yet set dates for shareholder votes on the acquisition, which they expect to complete in the fourth quarter. SunPower to cut jobs SunPower, the second-biggest U.S. solar manufacturer, posted its fourth straight quarterly loss and said it is cutting 15 percent of its workforce. The shares fell 6.6 percent. The net loss was $70 million (51 cents per share), the San Jose company said Tuesday. That compared with a profit of $6.5 million (4 cents) a year earlier, the last time the company reported net income. Excluding some items, SunPower’s loss of 22 cents compared with the 24-cent average loss expected by analysts. Sales rose to to $420.5 million from $381 million. The company will cut its workforce by 1,200, related to a decision to close its Philippine panel assembly facility and transfer the equipment to Mexico. Economy Productivity falls in quarter The productivity of American workers dropped in the April-June quarter, feeding into a 12-month decline in the economic output people are generating for each hour worked. The Labor Department says productivity fell at an annual rate of 0.5 percent in the second quarter, after a 0.6 percent drop during the first three months of the year. Productivity has dropped 0.4 percent from a year ago, as labor costs and the hours worked are rising faster than the output of workers’ goods and services. Productivity has been weak for the past five years, a thorny problem since productivity growth is the key factor supporting rising living standards and higher incomes. Courts Accounting firm battles Accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers is squaring off in a Miami courtroom with lawyers for a defunct mortgage company’s creditors and investors over a $5.5 billion lawsuit involving audits at a failed Alabama bank. A jury heard opening statements Tuesday in the lawsuit, which contends PricewaterhouseCoopers should have detected fraud at Colonial Bank of Montgomery, Ala. The fraud was orchestrated by top executives at shuttered Florida mortgage firm Taylor, Bean and Whitaker. Six of the mortgage firm’s executives and two bank employees were convicted in the fraud scheme. Colonial was shut down in 2009. The trial is expected to last about six weeks.

HOME TECHNOLOGY Neon Nervana Cloud Nervana Engine SOLUTIONS Healthcare Agriculture Finance Online Services Automotive Energy COMPANY Team Careers Culture Investors & Advisors PRESS Intel + Nervana News BLOG LEARN GET STARTED Intel + Nervana Today, we’re excited to announce the planned acquisition of Nervana by Intel*.  With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies.  Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform, and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware.  The combination of Nervana’s technology and expertise incorporated into Intel’s portfolio will take deep learning/AI solutions to the next level.  We will continue to operate out of our San Diego Headquarters and will retain our talent, brand, and start-up mentality. Nervana started with the idea that we can engineer better solutions for computation by bringing together computer engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning.  Amir Khosrowshahi and I brought this idea to Bruno Olshausen (Amir’s PhD advisor) before founding Nervana.  Bruno said (and I’m paraphrasing here), “Do it.  Do it now!  You might already be too late.”  This was the catalyst that pushed us over the edge to pursue the idea fully.  At this point we invited Arjun Bansal to join the founding team and Nervana was born.  Amir then sought advice from his cousin Ali Partovi, co-founder of Code.org and iLike and a well-connected angel investor.  Ali became our first investor and trusted advisor to the company.  He made introductions to his network and we pulled together a very high-caliber set of seed investors.  Soon after, Carey Kloss and Andrew Yang (close friends and ex coworkers of mine) joined Nervana to lead the hardware development efforts.  We’re proud to say that in just 2.5 years, we pushed the performance envelope in deep learning and will soon have a revolutionary new architecture to push it even further. We’ve always been a mission driven company.  Even though we won’t be a startup any longer, our mission hasn’t changed: we are here to make a dent in the world of computation.  With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing.  We’ll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural.  The semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world.  Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special. Having strong investors who believed in the company was key.  We were very fortunate to have board members Steve Jurvetson (DFJ) lead our Series A and Matt Ocko (DCVC) our Series A1.  Their inherent interest in innovation and deep technical knowledge was the force that made this company happen.  In addition, Playground Global, CME Ventures, Lux Capital, Allen & Co, AME Cloud Ventures, Fuel Capital, Omidyar Technology Ventures, SV Angel and our seed investors were great partners with which to build a company. Many thanks to Allen & Company LLC who acted as exclusive financial advisor to Nervana in this transaction. Sincerely, Naveen Rao CEO and Co-founder of Nervana     What our investors have to say: “The venture world doesn’t often get excited about a chip company these days but Naveen and the Nervana founding team’s audacious plan to build a deep learning compute fabric that would take AI to the next frontier had us captivated from day one. Cheers to the Nervana team on their incredible work so far and the incredible accomplishments that will be possible as part of the Intel team.” – Steve Jurvetson, Managing Partner, DFJ “It’s not that often in a VC career you get to work with teams you’re sure will be featured in documentaries about how major industries changed — Nervana’s talented and driven founders and employees are such a team. DCVC was privileged to back Nervana in its mission to make transformative AI capabilities as ubiquitous and seamless as Internet access.  We can’t wait to see their next set of breakthroughs, delivered at even greater speed, with Intel behind them.” – Matt Ocko, Managing Partner, Data Collective (DCVC) “Our strategic investment in Nervana Systems has been an exceptional experience for CME Group, leading our company to advance our understanding of deep learning. We’re pleased with the news of their acquisition since we view their technology as foundational in our industry and look forward to seeing what else they will achieve as they make it even more scalable.” – Rumi Morales, Executive Director, CME Ventures “In Nervana, we found a magical hardware and software team that together would empower developers to bring us tomorrow’s intelligent machines,” – Shahin Farshchi, Partner, Lux Capital “Nervana is a testament to the magic of best in class technical teams coming together with a shared vision. We look forward to seeing this talented team build the compute architecture powering the next generation of intelligent applications as part of Intel.” – Todor Tashev, Managing Partner, Omidyar Technology Ventures     See Intel’s blog announcement by Diane Bryant here.   *Transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions By Naveen Rao| 2016-10-24T17:50:29+00:00 Tuesday, August 9, 2016|General| Share This Story, Choose Your Platform!

Startup By Tom Brant August 9, 2016 05:50pm EST 10 Comments Intel is betting on a healthy data center business, driven by demand from artificial intelligence In a nod to the future of cloud computing, Intel today agreed to buy Nervana, a startup that makes hardware and software for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Nervana is relatively rare for a computing startup, in that it focuses on both the hardware and software required for deep learning—the framework of artificial intelligence. Founded in 2014, the San Diego company's products include Nervana Cloud, a complete system for customers who want to train their own deep learning models. There are, of course, competitors offering similar products, including established chipmakers like Qualcomm and newcomers like Movidius. But Nervana says its distinguishing factor is that it has optimized the silicon in its chips for AI tasks, resulting in training speeds that are ten times faster than conventional GPU-based systems and frameworks. //Related Articles Why Intel Needs to Keep an Eye on Nvidia That expertise will come in handy for Intel, which will face fierce competition from advanced GPU-based systems—like those offered by Nvidia—as it seeks to stake out its corner of the AI data center market. Intel's products of the future, according to CEO John Krzanich, will revolve around data centers and the cloud. Since artificial intelligence will take up a lot of the bandwidth of those two products, it's only natural that Intel would invest in AI. Intel has a lot riding on machine learning and the data centers and cloud computing that make its algorithms possible. The Nervana acquisition is one more sign that the era of Intel's coffers reliably filling up as a result of people upgrading their desktops and laptops at regular intervals is over.

 Intel just bought a small startup for $350 million Eugene Kim Aug. 9, 2016, 5:04 PM 7,980 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CEO Brian KrzanichReuters/Albert Gea Intel just bought a two-year old machine learning startup called Nervana Systems, a move aimed at expanding its data center business. Intel declined to share the financial details of the deal, but Recode reports it paid "at least $350 million," citing an anonymous source. That's a steep price for a 48-person company. But given Nervana's top notch technology and leadership team, led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao, it's a move that will likely help Intel bolster its already dominant position in the data center market. Intel has been desperately trying to shift its focus away from the shrinking PC chip business lately, and put a lot more emphasis on growing its data center and Internet of Things units. In particular, as more devices get connected to the internet, it will create a whole lot more data, which will have to be processed through data centers. Intel provides over 90% of the chips powering today's data centers and having Nervana's technology to make better sense out of the data will only boost its service offerings. "Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI," Diane Bryant, the head of Intel's data center business, wrote in a blog post. That's particularly important for Intel because its data center business has been slowing down, not showing the type of robust growth Wall Street has been expecting in recent quarters.  This is also one of the first big acquisitions Intel's made after bringing in Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala as its No. 2 guy. Renduchintala played up the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in a recent blog post explaining his move to Intel.

ElGato Ransomware Targets Androids, Locks SD Card Data and Steals SMS Messages GO Ransomware is still under development, no real threat Aug 9, 2016 21:15 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  The ElGato ransomware family, recently discovered by Intel McAfee researchers, targets Android devices. Specifically, it locks the user's device, encrypts their files, and even steals SMS messages when commanded. The ransomware operates based on a control panel from which the crooks send commands to infected devices. Intel McAfee researchers say that ElGato checks for new commands from the C&C server at regular intervals. These commands are sent to the ransomware in clear HTTP, without encryption. ElGato comes with an easy-to-use Web-based control panel Some of the commands supported include the ability to forward and delete all SMS messages, send a message from the infected device, encrypt the files on the SD card, or encrypt files from at a specific path. All encrypted files will feature the .enc file extension at the end. Additionally, the crook can also lock the user's screen and additionally order the ransomware to decrypt all previously encrypted files. This way, the ransomware serves as a decrypter after the user has paid the desired ransom. In its current version, Intel McAfee experts say ElGato does not show a ransom note, nor does it ask for money, but merely shows a picture of a lovable cat whenever it locks the user's screen. Hence the ransomware name of El Gato, which means "The Cat" in Spanish. ElGato is still under development Since all communications occurred via HTTP, researchers were able to track down ElGato's C&C server, where they were surprised to find the botnet control panel open to exterior connections, no password required. "This ransomware variant looks like a demo version used to commercialize malware kits for cybercriminals because the control server interface is not protected and includes in the code words such as 'MyDificultPassw,'" Intel McAfee security expert Fernando Ruiz noted. "McAfee Labs has informed the owners of the abused servers and has requested they take down the malicious service," he also added. The overall low complexity of this threat sustains Ruiz's statements, meaning this is an unfinished product, not yet ready for broad distribution. Crooks will need to improve its encryption routine, deploy HTTPS for the C&C server communications, and protect the botnet control panel with a login field.

Articles > Market Commentary > AMD’s Rally Should Continue Getting Stronger AMD’s Rally Should Continue Getting Stronger AMD (AMD) has been through lots of severe problems throughout the last few years as its revenue growth has followed a downward trajectory. However, the company has performed better than expected this year under the leadership of new CEO Lisa Su. The company’s launch of its new Polaris architecture has been very successful and it has been the primary reason behind AMD’s recent success. As a result, shares of AMD have shot up more than 300% in the last few months and there are many reasons why I think AMD’s rally may sustain a bit longer. In the past ten years, AMD’s peers like Intel and NVIDIA (NVDA) have enjoyed great success. Intel’s (INTC) yearly revenue has surged 43 percent and NVIDIA’s revenue has more than doubled in the reference time period. On the contrary, AMD has been a very weak performer in the meantime. However, conditions are changing substantially as AMD has realized that confronting NVIDIA as well as Intel head-on was pointless, as both the companies had better cash flows and greater R&D and marketing budgets. Therefore, AMD has strategized to place its focus on certain niche markets which its opponents had ignored. On the other hand, AMD’s impending Zen CPUs are projected to enhance its competitive position comparative to Intel. The first PC models should begin shipping toward the end of 2016, with substantial volume expected next year. It is highly likely that the server market may signify an even superior opportunity for the company, keeping in mind that Intel presently relishes a strong domination. At present, if anyone wants to use high-end VR devices, then it is mandatory to have a PC that comprises powerful GPU. And there are currently only two major companies that have designed graphics cards which are compatible with virtual reality. This provides prospect to evolve its graphics business significantly in the near future and beyond. The company’s Radeon RX 480 has perceived legitimately robust reviews since it was available for purchase in the market last month. RX 480 is capable of powering existing virtual reality headsets and is priced at just $199. This will certainly help the company to reap huge profit in the approaching quarters. Conclusion AMD has been a terrific performer this year and, as mentioned above, its rally can still continue. AMD’s looks like a completely different company under the leadership of new CEO and should continue taking strides in the right direction. Published on Aug 9, 2016 By Vinay Singh Copyrighted 2016.

Nervana, founded in 2014, specialized in software and hardware for deep learning, borrowing neuroscience concepts to give computers more intuitive – and easily programmed – ways to deal with data. The company launched its Nervana Cloud, a simplified way for businesses to develop and implement custom deep learning models using a language and library set it dubbed Neon. However, that was the first step on a path to the Nervana Engine, a dedicated chip – or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) – focused specifically on machine learning. Expected to launch in 2017, Nervana Engine will include high-speed memory and six bi-directional interconnects allowing multiple chips to be daisy-chained. Whereas many machine learning rigs have repurposed GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities, Nervana says its engine can dump unnecessary features – like caches required for graphics processing but not for deep learning – and use the saved space to fit more compute into the same size of chip. For Intel, it’s an opportunity to better shape its processors for a future in which computer learning takes an increasingly central role. That will begin with the chipmaker’s silicon for servers, which are used for tasks like image recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks,” Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group at Intel, said of the acquisition. “Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors.” As for Nervana itself, the company will continue to operate out of its San Diego location, and doesn’t expect staffing changes. “Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform, and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware,” Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of the company, wrote today. “The combination of Nervana’s technology and expertise incorporated into Intel’s portfolio will take deep learning/AI solutions to the next level.” While artificial intelligence has, for many, the smack of science fiction about it, technologies legitimately described as AI are already commonplace. Image processing in software like Apple’s Photos in macOS Sierra and Google’s cloud-based Photos both use machine learning to learn and identify faces and scenes, for instance, while autonomous cars are using similar technologies to take lessons learned on the road and extrapolate them into being better drivers.

The chip giant isn’t actually saying how much it is paying, but a source with knowledge of the deal said it is valued at around $408 million. That’s some serious cheddar for a 48-person startup. Intel vice president Jason Waxman told Recode that the shift to artificial intelligence could dwarf the move to cloud computing. Machine learning, he said, is needed as we move from a world in which people control a couple of devices that connect to the Internet to one in which billions of devices are connecting and talking to one another. “There is far more data being given off by these machines than people can possibly sift through,” Waxman said. Nervana’s approach has some direct appeal to a chipmaker like Intel in that the company has been working to bring machine learning all the way into the silicon, rather than simply making software that can run on top of anyone’s cluster of graphics chips. The company is led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao and has raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture arm. Rao said that the deal didn’t reflect any hurdles in getting more capital to stay independent. “Raising money was not the problem,” he said. “That was going to be relatively easy.” But by selling to Intel, he said, “we have access to technology we'd never dream about.” In data centers, Intel is operating from a position of strength as its chips dominate. That’s in contrast to the mobile world, where the company is investing big in internet-of-things efforts after having essentially missed out on the smartphone revolution. “There's always a next wave,” Waxman said, noting that corporate computing has already gone from mainframes to client-server and now on to cloud computing. “I firmly believe this is not only the next wave but something that will dwarf the last wave.” That said, he knows that people’s eyes start to roll whenever big companies talk about catching the next wave. Waxman admits that the hype got a little strong with artificial intelligence and deep learning, but says that reality has started to surpass the hype. “This is a real thing at Baidu; this is a real thing at Google,” he said. “They are using deep learning techniques. It is not just papers any more.” The sale of Nervana also represents the first big exit for Andy Rubin’s Playground Global, which was an investor. Other investors include Data Collective, DFJ, Lux Capital and Allen & Co. Steve Jurvetson, who lead the early investment in Nervana, said he was drawn to the unique background of the startup founders. “This is a group that’s not been walking the usual path,” he said. The investor is also incredibly bullish on deep learning, which he sees as transformative for the business world. “I think it’s the biggest advance since the scientific method itself,” he added. (Update: An earlier version of the story indicated the purchase price was more than $350 million, according to a source. Multiple investors told Recode the purchase price was significantly above that price, with one pegging it at $408 million.

Broad themes include: User-centered design Validated learning (build-measure-learn) Exceptional quality Disciplined execution Radical collaboration ...which help us execute against Mozilla's 2016 planning Top Line Guidance areas: Build for Quality Invite Participation Be Clear Compelling and Focused Grow our Influence Prototype the Future Ideas for speakers are solicited from Mozillians on an ongoing basis using this speaker submission form. Preference is given to practitioners i.e. those with hands-on experience in their particular subject area. The speaker(s) will present live from either our San Francisco or Mountain View office and be streamed to the rest of the offices via Air Mozilla and publicly archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance is 20-30 with remote attendees ranging from 100-200; follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Goal Our goal is to engineer individual connection points and create compelling opportunities beyond day-to-day work for office-based staff to come together in our spaces (in most cases) to share an experience and interact with the those they may not normally work with. Face-to-face chats among people with different skills might spark new ideas, lead to new solutions or at the least, increase workplace camaraderie. Our ultimate goal is to improve performance, innovation and overall engagement. Testimonials "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Thursday, September 1 @ Mozilla Portland - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC + Air Mozilla Location: Mozilla Portland + Air Mozilla Topic: Being Human in a Data-Filled World In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research. Wednesday, October 12 @ Mozilla Toronto - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC + Air Mozilla Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Do you struggle with brainstorming new ideas? Coming up with new solutions? Bringing fresh ideas to life and ultimately to market is not a well charted course. In July, our guest Tina Seelig will share a new model, the Invention Cycle, that taps into our innate capabilities of imagination and creativity to help us innovate better. Tina’s framework captures the attitudes and actions necessary to foster innovation and to bring breakthrough ideas to the world. We’ll learn: - Crisp definitions for imagination, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship - Clear roadmap for progressing from the seed of an idea through implementation - Concrete attitudes and actions needed to bring ideas to fruition We’ll also be joined by a group of mozillians(1) who recently spent a half day working with Tina; they'll share how these learnings have translated directly into their roles at mozilla. (1) David Bialer, David Bryant, Greg Jost, Jean Gong, Jet Villegas, Martin Best, Rosana Ardila, Tim Murray, Jen Bertsch and Rina Jensen Speaker: Tina Seelig is passionate about creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship. As Professor of the Practice in the department of Management Science and Engineering, faculty director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and a founding member of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) at Stanford's School of Engineering, she works with others who embrace the idea that entrepreneurs do much more than imaginable with much less than seems possible. After earning her Ph.D. from Stanford University Medical School in Neuroscience, Tina has worked as a management consultant, multimedia producer, and was the founder of a multimedia company. She’s also written 17 books and educational games, including The Epicurean Laboratory and Incredible Edible Science, published by Scientific American; and a series of card games, called Games for Your Brain, published by Chronicle Books. Her newest books, published by HarperCollins are What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 (2009), inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity (2012), and Insight Out (2015). She’s been honored to receive significant recognition of her work, including the Gordon Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the National Olympus Innovation Award, the SVForum Visionary Award, and several university teaching awards.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services. Kirsten holds a BS degree in Finance from USC and an MBA from J.L. Kellogg School of Management. Host: David Slater Questions: Submit questions for Kirsten during the event on IRC #AirMozilla.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla. Speaker: April Underwood is head of Platform at Slack, a messaging platform that has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of partners. There, she drives key growth initiatives and oversees platform products, partnerships, API integrations and developer relations. She previously worked on products for Travelocity, Apple, Google, Climate Corp (Weatherbill). Just before joining Slack, April led teams of Product Managers as Director of Product on Twitter’s fast-growing Advertising (Ads API, ads.twitter.com) and Data (Firehose, Gnip) products. She was also a PM for the Tweet Button and Twitter API, and built Twitter's Business Development team from the ground up to strike strategic partnerships with firms including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, EA, Salesforce and Adobe. And while she used to write code (and sometimes writes term sheets as an angel investor), her first love is building and leading product teams and working with engineers and designers to build and launch great products that people want to use.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups. As Director of Engineering at Facebook she led Facebook’s push on mobile infrastructure and quality, initiating major new investments in architecture and tooling and helped guide Facebook’s transition to “mobile first.” She launched new product initiatives in search, news feed, and photos. She also drove strategic engineering operational initiatives, including overhauling Facebook’s approach to technical recruiting. More on Jocelyn at her website.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mike is also a co-author of the Responsive.org manifesto and a leading contributor to the global self-management and future of work movement.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters.

Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance.

Now, Rao will be a key player in Intel’s attempt to catch up in one of the most promising new silicon markets to emerge since the smartphone. Intel revealed Tuesday that it is buying Nervana and its deep-learning hardware and software for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition marks a departure for Intel and comes at a crucial moment. The company became the world’s largest chip maker with a single-minded strategy to make its x86 microprocessors the standard for running a huge swath of applications, from solitaire to massive payroll systems. Nervana and other startups believe deep learning requires entirely new chip architectures that work more like the human brain—by processing millions of random bits of data to come up with an insight, rather than by running an algorithm created by a programmer. (You can see how Rao described this in detail at EmTech Digital in May.) So far, Intel is a bit player in this market, which could grow from less than a billion to $2.4 billion by 2024, according to the market research firm Tractica. The current market share leader is Nvidia, the leading maker of graphics processing chips used in game consoles and PCs. Since researchers discovered the chips’ aptitude for running neural networks, Nvidia has built software to help deep-learning experts use the chips—and it has developed aggressive sales and marketing programs to lock in a big lead. But although graphics chips are much more efficient at running deep-learning software than Intel’s conventional CPUs, chips specifically designed for the task should be even more efficient. Intel had largely ignored the market until this June, when it announced a version of its Xeon Phi co-processor that is well-suited for certain deep-learning jobs. To create a new family of chips specifically for deep learning could have taken years. "While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn’t relegated to novels and movies. AI is all around us," said Diane Bryant, executive vice president of Intel’s Data Center Group, in a blog post. Rao says that Nervana will complete development of its first chip, called the Nervana Engine, this year as originally planned, and make it available via the cloud to customers in early 2017. Nervana claims the chip can do as much neural processing as 200 microprocessors or 10 GPUs, in large part because it features a new memory technology that lets it process far more bits at the same time. Nervana's first chip is not being made by Intel, but later ones will be. Rao says Intel's leading chip fabrication technology and a new, high-speed disk drive technology coming to market this year will help Nervana's ideas to reach their full potential. With its vast marketing budget, Intel should also be able to put pressure on Nvidia to reduce prices. Intel also gets Rao, a long-time chip designer who went back to school in 2011 to get a PhD in computational neuroscience from Brown University, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then joined Qualcomm, where he led a research project to build a “biologically inspired artificial neural network.” This became Zeroth AI, a software platform to help companies use Qualcomm chips to build deep-learning systems. When Qualcomm declined to turn his research into an actual product, he cofounded Nervana in 2014. Rather than sell the chips, Rao’s strategy has been to use them to power a deep-learning cloud service, saving customers the hassle of developing their own neural networks. “We timed it well,” Rao said in the interview earlier this year. “We’ve been building something that not many people thought was a good idea a couple of years ago.” Learn more about deep learning at EmTech Digital 2017.

Chris Swan's Weblog About Commenting Speaking « Review – Dell PowerEdge T110 II Review – Gigabyte Brix GB-XM14-1037 » Review – Intel NUC DC53427HYE 05Feb14 I’ve been using a Lenovo X201 Tablet in a docking station as my main machine for about 3 years now. 8GB RAM hasn’t been enough for a while, which is why I got 16GB for my X230 laptop, and I’ve been having issues with the CPU running out of steam when using Skype and Google Hangouts. I first came across Intel’s Next Unit of Computing (NUC) at Intel’s Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco in 2012. At the time I was a little dismissive of it in comparison to the Raspberry Pi for applications like streaming media, where it’s just too expensive (and larger than it needs to be). I did however feel that it would be a good basis for a small, quiet and frugal desktop machine. Joe Baguley brought my attention to Alex Galbraith’s London VMUG presentation ‘Intel NUC Nanolab‘, which had me look at the NUC again. Alex also has a comparison table, and he concludes with the recommendation: As regards this latest batch of models, I personally still think the sweet spot is with the Intel Core i5-3427U DC53427HYE 2nd Gen model, which includes vPro for remote access, and will turbo to a handsome 2.8GHz Built in sound might have tipped me towards the newer i5-4250 model, but they’re not actually available, which is why I ended up getting an i5-3427 one (for £260 on eBay). The i5 version also had the gigabit ethernet and DisplayPort connectors that I wanted. Making it complete The NUC comes bare bones, so I popped in 16GB of RAM and a 480GB mSATA drive (both from Crucial). I moved a Windows 8 license over from an old Microserver, and jumped straight to 8.1 on install. A USB2 hub and a cheap USB sound adaptor from eBay finished things off (sadly my Dell 27″ monitor doesn’t seem to do sound over Displayport). Installation Windows 8.1 had no problem with drivers, and I got glorious 2560×1440 as soon as I plugged it in with DisplayPort. A visit to the Intel driver site got some more recent stuff for things like ACHI. Even the cheap USB sound card just worked :) Performance It’s subjectively very fast, though I might still be in the new machine honeymoon period. Sadly I can’t get Windows Experience Index numbers as WEI was ditched with the 8.1 release. Boot up speed is particularly good. Less subjectively it clocks a Geekbench of 4815, which beats my same generation i5-3320M powered laptop at 4065[1]. Some noise It’s quiet, but not quite silent. I would still notice the fan on the laptop, and I still notice the fan on the NUC. It’s nowhere near annoying or even distracting, but it’s there. I may have to splash out on the Akasa Newton V fanless case, which would also bring a couple of extra USB2 ports up front. Update (13 Mar 2013): So I didn’t last very long. I ordered the silent case from CCL  a few days after writing this, and I’ve been enjoying a silent working environment ever since. Power peril The NUC has received a bit of criticism for not having a mains cable for it’s power supply unit – it needs a C5 ‘cloverleaf’ (aka Mickey Mouse) lead. That wasn’t a problem, as it’s the sort of thing I do have lying around. The peril comes from a lack of battery backup. Having used laptops for the last few years I’ve survived the all too frequent cuts and brownouts in my area, so it’s a rude shock to be back on the unreliable mains grid (especially when plumbers decide to do safety tests that trip my residual current detector – apparently it’s ‘too sensitive’). I’m awaiting delivery of an IEC-C5 cable so I can run the NUC off my UPS. Conclusion I’m very happy with the NUC. It looks pretty on my desk, and offers up good performance without using loads of power and without making loads of noise. I may yet splash out on the silent case to get quiet PC nirvana. Apart from that I should be happy until I need something that can drive a 4K monitor (once they’ve sorted out all of the issues with driving those screens). Note [1] It’s a total mystery to me why a 35W CPU is beaten by a 17W CPU, but I’m left wishing that my laptop could use those watts better. Like this: Like Loading...

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Micron slaps QuantX label on 3D XPoint memory by Eric Born  11:21 AM on August 9, 2016 Intel and Micron's 3D XPoint memory technology has been drawing attention recently. The companies claim that this non-volatile memory (pronounced "3D cross-point") should provide significantly higher performance than NAND while being much more dense. In advance of its keynote speech later today at the Flash Memory Summit, Micron has released details about how 3D XPoint will appear on the market. We already know that Intel will sell the memory under the Optane branding, and has a line of solid-state disks on the way. Micron, on the other hand, revealed today that it will sell the memory under the brand Micron QuantX. Computerworld quotes Micron's vice president of storage solutions, Jon Carter, as saying that Micron and Intel have "completely separate" and distinct marketing plans. Furthermore, Carter indicated that its products will focus on data center applications, noting that while QuantX may appear in mobile and desktop products at some point, it won't be in the near future. More information should be available as the Flash Memory Summit continues, and we'll certainly know more as Intel and Micron get some products closer to market.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Asus' X99-A II motherboard reviewed Improving on perfection by Mark Nelson  11:42 AM on August 9, 2016 Broadwell-E is here, giving Intel's high-end desktop platform an impressive shot in the arm. This refresh bumped the top-end X-series part to ten cores—each now sporting Intel's Broadwell microarchitecture—all while fitting into the same LGA2011-v3 socket that we welcomed with Haswell-E. Part of Broadwell-E's appeal is the fact that the chip is a drop-in replacement for its Haswell-based predecessors. Existing X99 boards should require no more than a firmware update to work with the latest processors. That said, motherboard manufacturers are taking this opportunity to release refreshed X99 boards. This new breed has been spruced up with all the latest hotness in storage and peripheral connectivity that their predecessors lack. In particular, we're seeing support for standards like USB 3.1 Type-C, Thunderbolt, and U.2 ports on some boards. One example of this refresh wave is Asus' X99-A II, the Broadwell-E refresh to Asus' X99-A. That board won our coveted Editor's Choice award when it was the new thing on the market. Let's dig in to see if the sequel is as good as the original. Asus has kept the same monochromatic visual theme going with the X99-A II as we've seen from its previous X99 and Z170 boards. The company has made a few cosmetic tweaks compared to its first-generation X99 boards, though. Instead of heatsinks clad in matte black and white, Asus has gone with silver and white to match is current crop of Z170 "pro" boards. The printed circuit board itself is still completely black, however. The X99-A II makes full use of every square inch of board real estate. Alongside the huge LGA2011-v3 CPU socket, Asus' engineers managed to squeeze in the full allotment of eight DDR4 DIMM slots. This also lets Asus make use of all nine ATX mounting holes. If builders need to apply pressure to the board when it's mounted in a case, the X99-A II's PCB won't flex like some narrower ATX motherboards might. Flipping the board over reveals several clusters of surface-mounted components, a second Asus TPU chip, and a row of LEDs for the under-board lighting. The back of the board also clearly shows that all the heatsinks are held in place with screws. There's even a large backplate on the underside of the main VRM heatsink. This should ensure that the electrical components make adequate contact with the metal above. On the topic of voltage regulation, it's worth pointing out that Broadwell-E, like the previous Haswell-E, makes use of Intel's fully-integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) technology, although it's presumably a more advanced iteration than what we saw with Haswell. The motherboard-based VRM components are found underneath the two VRM heatsinks, the second of which is hidden underneath a large plastic shroud that extends all the way to the rear port cluster. This shroud is purely cosmetic, and it's secured with just three screws on the underside of the board. Removing it could improve airflow to that left VRM heatsink. It also gives the X99-A II a more blacked-out look. One difference compared to Asus' original X99-A is that the board is fitted with two CPU power connectors: one eight-pin EPS12V and one four-pin ATX12V. Both of these connectors need to be occupied for proper operation of the board. When we stop to consider the potential power draw when overclocking Intel's top-end ten core Broadwell-E part, this move certainly makes sense. This power-connector requirement caught me off guard as I opened the X99-A II's retail box. Thankfully, a quick trip to my box of cables, connectors, and miscellany rectified the situation with a handy Molex to four-pin ATX12V adapter, since my Cooler Master V750 is only fitted with a single eight-pin ATX12V connector.  Be sure to check your power supply, and your cables box, before opening your wallet for this motherboard.

By Jill Duffy Editors' Note: We first published this review in November 2014, and the Basis Peak remains one of the top-performing fitness trackers we've tested. In August 2016, Intel recalled the tracker for overheating issues known to cause discomfort, burning, or blistering on the skin. It is no longer available for purchase, and Intel is offering exisiting users a full refund for the tracker and any authorized accessories. As such, we have removed our original 4.5-star rating and no longer recommend this product. (The original review is below.) //Compare Similar Products Compare Misfit Flash   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Gear Fit   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Garmin Vivosmart   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Garmin Forerunner 15   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Wellograph   %displayPrice%%seller% see it The Basis Peak ($199) is the best fitness tracker you can buy on the market today. It looks like an ordinary watch, and a slightly sporty one at that. But the magic is in how it automatically detects when you're walking, running, sleeping, and bicycling to measure all those activities when you do them. And "automatically" is the operative word there. You never have to put it into sleep mode or running mode. It does that part for you. The Basis Peak also records your heart rate throughout, plus skin temperature, perspiration, how many calories you burned, and more. In the case of sleep, the Basis Peak breaks down your light, deep, and REM sleep cycles, as well as your restless and waking moments. The device, which is an updated version of the venerable Basis Carbon Steel Edition (that device is no longer being sold), will support some smartwatch functionality, namely incoming text messages and phone calls (although it won't be active at launch; the feature will be pushed to devices by the end of 2014, according to the company). For its effortless tracking, comfortable design, and excellent data collection, the Basis Peak is our new Editors' Choice for fitness activity trackers. Design and Compatibility The Basis Peak is a watch-style activity tracker available in two colors: matte black and white. It has a large, high-contrast LCD screen, which shows either dark text on a light background or vice versa depending on the light conditions around you. You won't find any buttons on this watch, as all the navigation happens via a touch screen. The housing is forged aluminum, topped with Gorilla Glass. Petite people will likely find Basis Peak too big. I have wide wrist bones, and it's a comfortable fit for me, but barely. Because the Basis Peak has an optical heart rate monitor (HRM) behind the watch face, it helps to wear it slightly higher on the arm than in the wrist bone divot, especially while working out. A silicone band feels more sporty and casual than business-like, but it's comfortable and has ridges that encourage some airflow to the skin. The straps come off, and the device is compatible with other standard watch bands, so you can change the sporty look to something different if you like. The Basis Peak has a waterproof rating of 5ATM, so you can take it in the pool, no problem. The battery lasts anywhere from two to five days, depending on use. View All 11 Photos in Gallery The watch ships with a cradle and charger, and one detail I'm happy to see is that the cradle and cord are separate. The cord is a standard micro USB-to-USB, making it easy to replace if you lose it. The cradle snaps into place courtesy of a simple magnet, without you having to remove the wristbands, which you had to do with the old Basis. These are the kinds of little improvements that make the new watch better, but not wildly different from the old one. Your options for syncing, however, have changed. The first Basis watch could sync via a computer when you connected the USB charger, but not so with the Peak. This activity tracker requires a mobile device, either iOS or Android, and can't sync with a computer. You can still access all the information the Basis Peak collects about you via the website, MyBasis.com, but getting that data to the Web requires a mobile phone or tablet. More about the mobile apps in a bit. Automation and Features As mentioned, the real selling point of Basis Peak is the automation. I can't tell you how many times I've put on some activity-tracking device, set out on a ride or run only to realize five minutes in that I forgot to turn on the special tracking feature. This never happens with the Basis Peak. When you run, it knows. When you ride your bicycle, it knows. When you walk, it knows. Fall asleep? Ditto. No other activity tracker works this way. Hop on your bicycle while wearing the Basis Peak, and within a few seconds of pedaling, you'll see a bicycle icon appear on screen. Peak shows your time in this activity, calorie burn, and other relevant stats. It just works, and it shows you it's working via the icons on the screen. That's unbeatable. Plenty of other activity trackers support a range of activities, but you have to put them into the right "mode" before you start. The Misfit Flash is one example. It's very inexpensive and works well, but its display is a cryptic dial that takes some time to learn how to read, so if you forget how to enable your special tracking mode, it's almost impossible to figure it out on the spot—like when you're already outside and suited up to hop on your bicycle or jump in the pool. A lot of activity trackers give you a stopwatch option for tracking any activity other than walking, but this is one feature notably missing from the Basis Peak. Not having a stopwatch is one reason the Peak is not the most evolved in terms of it being a sports watch or runner's watch. (On a forum recently, a company official said she can't rule out that there will never be a stopwatch feature pushed to the watch via a firmware update, but that there is no plan to add one at this time.) If you're just getting into running, I would recommend checking out the Garmin Forerunner 15, or anything else in the Forerunner series. The Forerunner 15 is something of an entry-level runner's watch, but it's great and also counts your daily steps. There are so many other runner's watches, too, from the TomTom Multi-Sport to Magellan's Echo, but most of them don't do general activity tracking (i.e., daily step count). It all depends on what you want to track. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

(Reuters/Ronen Zvulun) Share Written by Itika Sharma Punit August 09, 2016 Quartz india The world’s largest semiconductor maker faced a rather peculiar threat by a civic body in India’s Silicon Valley earlier this week. On Aug. 8, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)—Bengaluru’s administrative body responsible for civic and infrastructural assets—sent loaded garbage trucks to Intel’s local offices , threatening to dump trash at the premises unless the company paid its outstanding property tax, according to local media reports. ಇಂಟೆಲ್ ಕಚೇರಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಕಸ ಸುರಿಯಲು ಮುಂದಾದ ಬಿಬಿಎಂಪಿ https://t.co/BxujtDlkWT #Intel #Bengaluru #BBMP pic.twitter.com/FG4FKsdR79 — PublicTV (@publictvnews) August 8, 2016 The US-headquartered company owes BBMP Rs34 crore ($5.1 million) in property tax dues since 2009-10, Bangalore Mirror newspaper reported. According to BBMP, Intel has been paying taxes for non-air conditioned premises, while its building is centrally air-conditioned. The civic authority has been asking for its due for a couple of years now, but Intel has challenged the demand in court. The company refused to share details about its argument against BBMP. In July this year, Intel appealed its tax in the Karnataka high court. The court asked the company to deposit just 50% of the request sum with BBMP. That apparent compromise does not seem to have resolved the issue, however. “Today, we went to collect the tax and we came to know that they have obtained four more weeks’ time from the court to pay the money,” said BBMP joint commissioner Muniveerappa M, who went to Intel’s campus yesterday with the garbage trucks. The trucks were removed from the facility soon after. Twitter users could not resist from expressing their amusement over the innovative tax-recovery method used by Bengaluru authorities.

The Lenovo 510S is a highly affordable, reasonably thin and light laptop that’s available from just £450. With a smart, partially metal design and plenty of options for some powerful hardware, it’s a clear step up from the more entry-level alternatives. Potentially, it's the ideal choice for those seeking a good all-round laptop but who don’t require gaming performance or a DVD drive. This item is currently on sale at Currys, meaning you could save £70. Check out our Black Friday deals for more savings, and get a deal on the Lenovo Ideaoad 510S below: Buy Now: Save £70 on a 14-inch Lenovo Ideapad 510S at Currys for £549 Lenovo Ideapad 510S – Design and Features The Lenovo 500 series is available in 13in, 14in and 15in versions that are somewhat confusingly numbered 500S, 510S and 500 respectively. What’s more, it’s the 510S that's the cheapest entry-level option, with prices of the other two models starting at over £600. Also, S stands for 'Slim'. Confused? So were we. At this price it's somewhat surprising to see that the 510S is a well-made machine with some premium details such as a metal keyboard and screen surround and a backlit keyboard. The outside, meanwhile, is made of tough, pearlescent white plastic. It’s also available in a silver or a red exterior with black interior. Related: Best Laptops You Can Buy Right Now The overall vibe is one of minimalism, with little adorning the inside or outside, save the shiny, embossed Lenovo logo. This is a fairly thin and light laptop but, at 19.3mm thick and weighing from 1.7kg, it’s still a clear step up in bulk over your classic Ultrabook – the MacBook Air or Asus Zenbook, for example. However, with that extra size comes extra features. In terms of connections you get three USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, a headphone jack as well as a full-size HDMI output and an Ethernet network port. The latter two are particularly useful additions that mean you won’t need any adapters or dongles to get this machine hooked up to a network or monitor/projector – unlike most Ultrabooks. Inside you'll find a fairly typical selection of features for a thin and light laptop. Depending on how much you spend you’ll get an Intel Core i3-6100U, Core i5-6267U or Core i7-6567U with either a 128GB or 256GB Sata III SSD. The latter is one area where this laptop will clearly trail its more premium sibling the 710S, which includes a faster PCI Express-based SSD. Alongside those processors sit a range of Intel integrated graphics, with those same chips including Intel Graphics HD 520 or 550 graphics processors. That may not sound like much of a difference, but the 550 chip includes a small amount of dedicated graphics RAM that makes it surprisingly capable and thus opens up the potential for 3D gaming at low settings. That's not the case with the Ideapad 510S on here, however. Lenovo also states on its website that there’s a version of this laptop with AMD graphics, but no such options are on sale at the time of writing. Otherwise, the rest of the components are standard across the range. There's 8GB of RAM, 802.11ac W-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, stereo speakers, a webcam and a 14-inch 1,920 x 1,080 screen. The 510S benefits from an excellent keyboard that features large, well-spaced keys that are arranged in an ideal fashion – there's little in the way of bunched up or squashed keys as seen on some laptops. The "\" and "#" keys are slightly wedged in, but not to the extent that it affected my ability to type at speed. Touch-typists will appreciate the nicely defined key action, making it easy to determine when a key is pressed. Plus, the keyboard is backlit, so it’s simple to type accurately even in dark environments. The backlight can be turned off completely if you prefer – it will save a smidge of battery life – and there are two brightness levels. The touchpad isn’t quite so impressive, but still largely gets the job done. It’s a decent size and has accurate tracking alongside a click-anywhere, single-button action. However, the pad surface is metal rather than the etched glass of the best I’ve used, and as a result it just isn’t quite as smooth and effortless to glide across. Lenovo Ideapad 510S – Screen and Audio For a machine costing just £450, it’s great to see the screen on the 80TK002VUK version of the 510S uses IPS LCD technology. This ensures it benefits from far better viewing angles than cheaper TN panels, as well as more accurate colours and better black levels. This is evident the moment you fire up the machine: the screen looks crisp and colourful, with a real depth to blacks. It’s also good to see a matte anti-glare coating in use to keep reflections at bay. With a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 on a relatively small 14in screen, Lenovo has chosen to ship the 510S with the Windows scaling option set to 150% so that text and icons appear larger and more readable. However, you could just about get away with running it at native resolution if you have sharp eyesight – and if you do then it will mean that you end up with far more desktop space. Related: Best laptops for students When it comes to audio, the 510S offers a reasonable level of power and clarity from its speakers. They certainly aren't setting new records, but are a step up from the tinniest, weakest ones included on truly cheap laptops. Lenovo Ideapad 510S – Performance In general use this is a reasonably nippy machine, despite it being the cheapest option that we’re reviewing. It boots and loads programs quickly and has no problems with general desktop work. This is in contrast to machines that use Intel’s Core M chips, which can be overwhelmed even by fairly modest workloads. The upshot of a Core M, though, is ridiculously low power consumption and massively elevated battery life as a result. That said, if you want to get some serious work done then we'd advise upgrading to either the i5-6267U or 6567U versions. This is reflected in our Geebench 3 benchmark, where this chip scored 2,265 in the single-core test and 5,173 in the multi-core test. In comparison, the 6565U-equipped Lenovo Ideapad 710S scores 3,297 and 7,019 respectively. The i5 model is a £150 increase in price, though, so it's not to be sniffed at. Slightly muddying the performance waters is the SSD, since it actually has faster write performance than that of the 710S and as a result will be slightly quicker when transferring files to the laptop. However, it's read performance that matters for a general snappy feel, and while the 510S scores a perfectly solid 499MB/sec, the 710S hits 1,290MB/sec. 128GB isn't huge, and with a few programs and files on board you won't have much left. This is a problem if you don't store your files in the cloud. If you've already embraced the likes of Google Drive of OneDrive, then it shouldn't be such an issue. The faster CPU of that machine contributes to the overall snappier experience, and is reflected in the PCMark 8 score of 2,127 for the 510S and 2,865 for the 710S. Further cementing the point about this particular CPU option being a more entry-level choice is the 3DMark benchmark that indicates 3D gaming performance. In the Ice Storm test, the 510S scored 287 points while the 710S scored 1,319. Nonetheless, the picture is quite clear – this is a perfectly capable machine for day-to-day use, and the options are present if you want to go for the more powerful CPU. What’s more, this machine seriously impresses when it comes to battery life. The combination of fairly low-power components and a large chassis result in a laptop that lasted for more than 10 hours in our Powermark test. We set brightness to 40% and ran a loop of 10 minutes' browsing the web and 5 minutes of watching video and it managed 10hrs 12mins. That’s well up there with the longest-lasting laptops you can buy, and outperforms plenty of other thin and light devices. The 710S managed 8hrs 37mins in the same test. It’s likely that time will drop slightly with the more powerful CPU versions of this laptop, but not by much. Should I buy the Lenovo Ideapd 510S? This is a great laptop for those wanting a machine that’s reasonably thin and light but want a slightly larger screen and don’t want to compromise on key features such as a wired network connection and full-size HDMI port. At £450, this entry-level model is an excellent choice for those just wanting enough performance for general day-to-day computing, especially since it doesn’t compromise on the screen, keyboard, trackpad quality or battery life. If you want a more powerful machine, however, then the Core i7-6567U-equipped 80TK001BUK version is still a reasonable at £650. The 80TK001AUK model offers perhaps the best bang for buck with its still powerful Core i5-6267U processor and 256GB SSD coming in at £600. If you think £450 is a lot for a Core i3-powered laptop, bear in mind that many of the other models you'll find online do not have SSDs and instead have 1TB hard disks. These will feel substantially slower in day-to-day use so if you have the extra cash for a laptop with an SSD, it's worth it. Verdict A great all-rounder of a laptop that sits in an ideal middle-ground between cheaper larger models and more premium thin and light Ultrabooks.

They seem like such bargains, however my regular, unfortunate experience with them says otherwise. Although I've not touched this particular model, I have been burnt too often with them, hardware failures, poor build quality, and more worrying their increasingly forceful bloatware/malware trickery has lost them any trust I did have. I advise people and colleagues not to purchase Lenovo, although it does pain me considering they seem like good value. It's not worth it. I advise the same to anyone reading this. I'd be interested to hear whether the review attempted to uninstall any of the garbage Lenovo provided pre-installed. Ed August 10, 2016, 4:39 pm Hi MattMe. I hear what you're saying but in my experience it's of little to no good to judge a company as a whole in such a way. Most have good and bad products, particularly those that regularly venture into budget sectors - Apple seldom has the same sort of problems because it doesn't make cheap enough products, for instance. You only have to look at the fact that Lenovo now makes ThinkPads to see that it's perfectly capable of making excellent products. As regards the software, I didn't make any particular effort to uninstall the software - I'll have another look shortly - but if it's a major concern you could install a clean version of Windows. Also, there was the controversy about malware being preinstalled but I believe Lenovo has now resolved that. MattMe August 10, 2016, 5:01 pm Hi Ed, thanks for the response. Were you aware of the bloatware that even when uninstalled Lenovo would force-install from the BIOS? So you can do a completely fresh OS install and still end up with unwanted Lenovo software on your machine. Unacceptable. It's been nearly 2 years now, but I wasn't particularly impressed with the last bunch of ThinkPad laptops I bought to be honest. Cheap parts, terrible touchpads. Don't get me started on the Edge desktops. I'm sure they were using recycled hard disks in those. Almost unusable out the box. I wouldn't usually make a sweeping judgement across an entire business the size of Lenovo, however I feel I've had plenty of extremely bad experiences with them on so many different products it's hard not to. Ed August 10, 2016, 5:20 pm I must admit I didn't know they were doing that. However, it appears they've long since (well, a year) stopped the practice. Regardless, I'm not going to defend them anymore than to say this product is decent. Having reviewed dozens of laptops in my time it clearly sits comfortably in the top 25% for most of the day-to-day criteria that buyers look for. John C August 10, 2016, 11:17 pm 8/3 - Purchased a laptop from their website, 8/3 - They Charged my card, even though site states they will not charge for it until item ships, 8/15 - Expected to Ship on AUGUST 15th, 8/22 - Expected Arrive on AUGUST 22nd, 8/9 - I left a negative comment on their site about poor shipping process, 8/10 - They have moderated and REMOVED the negative comment. 8/10 - UPS shipping label has been created, but still not shipped. fearmhor18 August 14, 2016, 9:37 pm I agree with the touchpad verdict, very frustrating to get used to and finger can sometime stutter across the pad, otherwise i love the laptop, design, performance are very good and the weight does'nt bother me. i got the i7 spec and am happy for now. lenovo dont allow any sort of criticism on their website it seems however as they also removed my touchpad feedback. thanks for the review. Niklas August 25, 2016, 7:00 pm Have you tested if the screen is utilizing PWM for lowering the brightness? Anything else looks very nice with this device, but this is especially with lenovo often the deal breaker.

At the tail-end of 2015 we were impressed by the original Yoga 900, which combined Intel Core i processor power in a slender build to make for a decent, albeit pricey, laptop. With the introduction of the Yoga 900S, Lenovo has taken that design concept and wrapped it into a slimmer carbon fibre build, with slightly smaller 12.5-inch screen and fanless (and less powerful) Intel Core M processor. Perhaps confusingly, though, the 900S is slightly more expensive than its equivalent Yoga 900 brother. Is its considerable £1,099 price tag a step backwards, or is the 900S the hottest do-it-all laptop on the market? Lenovo Yoga 900S review: Design The Lenovo Yoga 900S is wonderfully slender and lightweight. It's a gram shy of a kilo and measures just 12.8mm at its thickest point. Thanks to that carbon fibre build it's the lightest laptop we've used for some time - the 350g it sheds compared to our go-to MacBook Air 13-inch might not sound like much, but it's highly apparent in day-to-day use, especially as we're so often out and about. Pocket-lint Key to the 900S's design is its 360-degree-capable "watchband hinge" - which means the device can be freely positioned in laptop, tablet, tent or stand positions (or anything in-between) - that looks like a stainless steel watch strap running the length of the join between keyboard and screen. It's fancy looking and made of a jaw-dropping 813 pieces, which is quite the engineering feat. Whereas the original Yoga 900 came in look-at-me champagne gold or orange exterior finishes, the 900S's silver or champagne options are a little more subtle. The silver finish of our review model means the hinge matches the exterior shell's finish, rather than standing out like an eye-catching piece of jewellery. It looks great and feels high quality. The presence of that hinge does beg the obvious question, though: do you really need a flip-around laptop design? Being able to position the 900S into its tablet position has its benefits, but it's not as slim as a standard tablet, while the tent and stand positions are fun but not something we've found ourselves using often. Pocket-lint The design also inherits some oddities. The massive lower bezel around the screen just looks, well, odd. And with Lenovo itself making slimmer-bezel devices - not to mention competitors like Dell with its near-edge-to-edge screens - the amount of black edges seems like a hangover of the design template rather than a necessity. It's not exactly unsightly, though. Lenovo Yoga 900S review: Connections There's a good array of connections from a device so thin, too. Two USB 3.0 ports - one of which doubles-up as the charger - accompany a USB Type-C port for a bit of aded future-proofing, plus the usual 3.5mm headphone jack. The only notable loss compared to the original Yoga 900 is the 900S's lack of an SD card slot. And, ok, there's still no HDMI output either. Pocket-lint A Microsoft Surface Pro 4 offers just one full-size USB port, so the Lenovo has the upper hand here. And while we like the potential of Type-C USB, devices such as the 12-inch MacBook that rely on it as the only port have got a little ahead of themselves. Lenovo Yoga 900S review: Typing & trackpad Open up and the 900S's internal construction is a little unusual too. The inner keyboard has a leather-like finish that is far nicer to rest wrists on that the typical soft-touch plastic that most laptops offer. The lip rolls off too, in a smooth finish, that ensures no "cutting" sensation on resting wrists. The keyboard arrangement is full-size, with some nifty shortcut keys across the F-keys top row. It's comfortable to type, with the reach and spacing feeling spot on. The keys are rather taut, though, with a limited press that feels a little lighter than what we're used to. That's worth it for a little less sound, though, as the 900S doesn't exhibit the same clickety clack of some keyboards. Pocket-lint Like several small laptops, the shift and backspace keys have been filed away and turned into nubs of their former selves (the right-hand one, in particular, is lost among the directional arrows; the left merges with the backslash key to retain full size - but we can't work out how to combine the two to make them function as only one). You'll get used to this style in the end, but we prefer the elongated keys. It's half-way there with the But at least you get a keyboard backlight to ensure typing in dim light is easy. Oh, and the keys' colour matches your colour finish - so silver in this instance, but champagne gold if that's the model you buy. As for the trackpad, we rather like the smooth sunken pad, which is surrounded by a chamfered silver edge. It's got a tactile quality that can cause a bit too much finger friction on occasion, but it's rarely a problem. We've found the responsiveness perfectly fine - which isn't something we found with the earlier Yoga 900 model. Lenovo Yoga 900S review: Display In this 12.5-inch form, the 900S takes a slight resolution cut compared to the original 900. But you won't exactly notice: its 2560 x 1440 pixel IPS LCD panel packs in plenty of pixels for a greater-than-HD resolution. It's as much detail as you'll need, with a density that's only a tiny bit behind, say, the MacBook Pro or Microsoft Surface. Pocket-lint But there are some issues. The 900S's screen is a touch reflective, which is among its biggest issues. As we mentioned before the epic lower bezel arrangement is also rather odd looking. It's as though this laptop could be smaller yet. We've not found the same over-sharpened appearance from this laptop as with the original 900, though, which is good news (it is a different panel, after all). In addition to the screen being used to look at things, it's also touch-sensitive and very responsive indeed. And with Lenovo's WriteIt software installed you can even scrawl on open pages, taking annotated screen grabs without the need for an additional stylus. An interesting little software feature, especially given the rise in 2-in-1 laptop replacements of late. Although this solution is nothing near to Microsoft's stylus-based solution with the Surface Pro. Lenovo Yoga 900S review: Performance & battery From the off it's clear the 900S isn't going to be as powerful as the original Yoga 900. That's down to Intel Core M. But the obvious benefit of Core M is that it's silent thanks to no fan, and therefore lower in terms of power consumption. And most users aren't going to notice a big difference. Pitch it against a more powerful system running a game on Steam and it will obviously be lower frame-rate and/or resolution on the Core M device. But that's not the exact target audience of this laptop. And we've been batch processing images via Photoshop quite happily. Again, not as fast as we can on a beefier setup, but that's to be expected. Pocket-lint The big issue, really, is that the Yoga 900, packing its Intel Core i7 processor and 8GB RAM, is actually cheaper than the 900S. That doesn't make loads of sense. It's a little bigger and heavier too, but there's an SD card port and the battery life roughly matches despite the more powerful innards. Speaking of which, the Yoga 900S lasts out surprisingly well. We've been testing a variety of 2-in-1 competitor devices lately - from Huawei MateBook and Acer Switch Alpha 12 to Microsoft Surface Pro - and their battery life is always under the 7-hour mark. Not so the 900S, which we've been getting around 7.5-hours of use from per charge, doing all those day-to-day normal tasks. Dim the screen just to watch video playback with airplane mode on and it'll last even longer. Verdict At first glance we thought we would prefer the Yoga 900S over its slightly larger and more powerful Yoga 900 brother. On one hand, we do: that sub-1kg weight and 12.5-inch form factor is great. On the other hand, we don't: it's less powerful, yet costs more. Which would make use lean towards the standard Yoga 900. Taken on its own merit, however, and it's easy to heap praise on the Yoga 900S. As laptop design goes, it's up there with the best. It's ultra-portable and practical, with ample battery life, silent operation and performance that, while it won't blow anyone away, is sufficient. The sticking point is the price and how it sits in among some equally strong competition, such as the Surface Pro 4.

Rohini Swamy  | Posted by Ashna Kumar  Follow @Rohini_Swamy   rohini.swamy@aajtak.com Bengaluru, August 9, 2016 | UPDATED 11:57 IST A +A - Intel defaulted tax payment between 2007 and 2008 to the tune of Rs 34 crores. Photo credit: Reuters Highlights 1 Intel company has defaulted on tax of Rs 34 crore. 2 The Mahanagar Palika moved High Court, who directed Intel to pay Rs 17 crore. 3 Intel has asked for four months to clear dues. Pay up your property taxes or face the stink! That is the warning that has been given by the Bruhar Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) to the IT giant Intel. This is part of the special drive to collect property tax due from big commercial complexes who default on paying taxes. GARBAGE ON DOOR When the employees of Intel reached their offices, they were shocked to see a line of garbage trucks filled with waste standing at their doorstep. The BBMP officials had blocked the gates of the IT major. The civic body has been cracking the whip on several tax defaulters and had moved the high court too. DEFAULTED ON PAYMENT OF RS 34 CRORE The BBMP said that the standing committee on taxation and finance had found that the company had defaulted tax payment between 2007 and 2008 to the tune of  Rs 34 crores. Intel did challenge this in court. Repeated notices to Intel were not taken seriously and finally the BBMP with the help of valid documentation managed to convince the court how Intel defaulted. The court directed the IT giant to cough up Rs 17 crores which is half the amount that the company owes as an interim measure by July 25. Since several warning were ignored, the BBMP decided to land with garbage trucks at Intel's doors forcing the company to make an assurance that they would pay it up soon. INTEL HAS FOUR MONTHS The Joint Commissioner of the Mahadevapura zone, BBMP Muniveerappa said that the company had been calculating its taxes on the basis that it was not an air conditioned office, but the reality was that it was centrally air conditioned. Further he said, 'Intel had assessed their building at Rs 2 per sqft for parking areas and Rs 4 per sqft for others areas but the BBMP has contested his stating that since the company was centrally air conditioned and so the calculations should have been made as Rs 4 per sqft for parking spaces and Rs 8 per sqft for others areas. Recently, the BBMP won a case against Manyata tech park and is on a major driver to collect the Rs 350 crores that is due in terms of property taxes from 73 commercial enterprises. The Chairperson of the BBMP standing Committee for Taxation and Finance, M Shivaraju said that they released a sample of 10 defaulters after conducting a survey. 'We will soon begin process of issuing notices and then when the notice period is over we will be taking steps like seizure and foreclosure until the money is deposited,' he said. Intel has moved court and have sought time of four weeks to pay their dues. Earlier too, BBMP had resorted to innovative measures as part of their drive against tax defaulters. In 2013, when Wipro defaulted paying Rs 19.28 crores to the civic body, the palike officials arrived with a team of hired drum-beaters who stood under the Wipro signboards and drummed away leaving the officials of Wipro red faced.   For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # Property tax# Bengaluru# Intel# BBMP# Wipro   Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2016 Living Media India Limited.

Nvidia says Intel cheated benchmarks Blackberry beats the vendors it trails, finishes Quadrooter patches Russian researchers working with an Intel supercomputer have put its Knights Landing hardware through its paces, and are pleased with what they've found. The boffins reckon the many-cored hot rod more than doubled their plasma simulation performance with nothing more than a simple recompile. Here's what they had to say at Arxiv: A straightforward rebuilding of the code yields a 2.43 x speedup compared to the previous Knights Corner generation. Further code optimization results in an additional 1.89 x speedup. The researchers explain that they chose a particular plasma simulation, “particle in cell” because it's a well-studied problem on many-core architectures. The tests ran on a node of the Endeavor supercomputer, which let the boffins run the code on Intel 14-core Haswell processors (Xeon E5-2697 v3 at 2.6 GHz with 36 MB cache), Knights Corner (Phi 7120 with 61 cores, 1.2 GHz, and 30.5 MB cache), and Knights Landing running in quadrant cluster mode (Phi 7250 with 68 cores, 1.4 GHz, and 16 GB MCDRAM). The researchers used their own plasma simulation code, called PICADOR, with help from Intel's Zakhar Matveev. For HPC-and-plasma-physics nerds, the config used for the benchmark was a frozen plasma problem in 40 x 40 x 40 grid with 50 particles per cell, over 1,000 time steps. This, they write, provides a good baseline because it can be solved on a single CPU. Apart from the headline results, the benchmark produced interesting side-results. For example, the performance boost maxed out when the code ran on eight processes, 34 OpenMP threads per process: “further increasing the number of processes results in performance degradation”. Overall, the paper says, Intel's Knights Landing was able to run suitably optimised PICADOR code at a not-too-shabby 100 gigaflops.

Ltd in Bellandur. Officials threaten to dump garbage inside if firm does not pay up Employees of multinational firm Intel Technology India Pvt. Ltd., who turned up at office on Monday morning, were welcomed by garbage-filled trucks with a foul smell emanating from them. As part of a special drive to collect property tax dues from big commercial properties across the city, officials from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) blocked the gates of the firm’s premises in Bellandur with four garbage-laden trucks. Sources said officials even threatened to dump the garbage inside if the firm did not pay up property tax dues to the civic body, a technique now employed by the civic body to coax big defaulters to pay up. Written undertaking “The standoff was resolved and the garbage trucks were taken back after Intel authorities gave a written undertaking that they would pay half of the dues claimed by BBMP, by August 28, as per an interim order of Karnataka High Court,” said Muniveerappa, Joint Commissioner, Mahadevapura zone, BBMP, who led the drive. The dispute dates back to 2009-2010, when BBMP and Intel Technology India Pvt. Ltd disagreed on the latter’s self-assessment over the tax amount. “Intel had assessed their building under Category 14 for industries, where property tax for parking space is Rs. 2 per sqft, and other areas as Rs. 4 per sqft. However, we have been contending that the premises come under the Central AC category, where property tax for parking space is Rs. 4 and other areas is Rs. 8 per sqft. We have now issued a tax demand notice for the difference that works up to Rs. 31 crore,” Muniveerappa explained. Karnataka High Court recently directed Intel authorities to deposit half of the dues demanded by BBMP, as an interim measure, for which Intel had sought some time, which was granted by the High Court, said BBMP officials.

The technology, also known as Intel Optane, promises to be more than 1000 times faster than NAND. Micron also announced it will market 3D XPoint as QuantX. Due to the price level Micron will only target its QuantX based products to data centers and enterprises. Micron’s Vice President, Storage Emerging Memory, Jon Carter stated during the currently held Flash Memory Summit that he believes Micron will make its first XPoint based revenues in the second half of 2017. By 2018 the technology should become more mainstream and by 2019 3D XPoint should see its breakthrough. Demand isn’t an issue, according to Carter, he stated that many companies are already demanding 3D XPoint based products. Intel who markets 3D XPoint products as Optane does believe it can bring the technology to consumer products. A recent roadmap shows the chip giant hopes to release the first Optane based SSDs together with its Kaby Lake CPU generation, at the end of 2016. Carter expects that Intel won’t be able to release the first Optane SSDs this year but in the first quarter of 2017. 3D XPoint is developed by Intel and Micron and the technology should combine the speed of RAM memory with the storage capacity of NAND memory. It should be 1000 times faster than NAND and today we learned it will be 4-5 times more expensive.   Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: 3d xpoint micron intel Micron 9100 MAX 2.4TB NVMe Enterprise SSD Review – The New Performance Champion Intel demonstrates Optane SSD achieving 2GB/s data transfer at IDF Shenzen Micron M510DC 480GB Enterprise SSD Review Micron M510DC SSD review coolcolors MyCE Resident Posted on: 10 Aug 16 23:28 Quote: promises to be more than 1000 times faster than NAND.

By 2018, I'll still be using an old-fashioned hard drive. I'm sure there will be plenty of other individuals using HDDs by then, too. IHMO, the best way to get people to adopt SSDs is to make them bigger (in terms of capacity), and cheaper. Also, making the SSDs last longer is another way to make them more desirable. Making them faster should be a much lower priority than it is, IMHO. 0 Agree vroom Administrator and Reviewer Posted on: 14 Aug 16 09:33 Prices have come down, i got my first Corsair 64GB back in 2011 (If i'm not mistaken) and back then it cost me +100 euros, now with that amount of I can get a 480-512GB SSD, and much faster, better firmware support, better warranty and also TRIM that works, plus the new OS can handle much better the new SSDs. I am afraid that it will take a long time before we see +4TB SSDs priced very close to mechanical drives, so if its 2018 that prices drop more I will be very happy, even more if could have an SSD that is 1TB and cost little mote than 100 euros. 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

The deal is, we're told, worth $350m. Chipzilla's server-grade processors, the Xeon and Xeon Phi, power a lot of the world's deep learning training, and it's the algorithms from Nervana it wants. Nervana has "fully-optimized software and hardware stack for deep learning" that will be used to make Intel's processors run more efficiently on its Math Kernel Library – a compilation of mathematical processing routines that are used to make calculations in science and engineering more efficient. The upstart is planning to produce, at a cost of $28m, a 28nm TSMC-fabbed chip in the first quarter of 2017 that has a tensor-based architecture, has no floating-point math unit, and performs machine-learning tasks in hardware. You can read loads more background on the technology over on our sister site, The Next Platform. "With this deal, we can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing. We'll look back in 10 years and see this time as the inflection point of when compute architectures became neural," said Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of Nervana. Rao says Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts, including: Nervana Neon, a Python-based software that describes deep learning models. Nervana Engine, a hardware integrated circuit coming in 2017. Nervana Cloud, a full-stack platform. AI is the latest trend for tech companies.

Intel did not disclose how much it is paying for Nervana Systems, but US media reports put the price at more than US$350 million. “With this acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies,” Nervana cofounder and chief executive Naveen Rao said in a blog post. “We can now shatter the old paradigm and move into a new regime of computing.” Founded two years ago in Southern California, Nervana has specialized in combining hardware and software to help machines process data in ways similar to human brains, the companies said. Intel plans to put Nervana expertise to work in Xeon and Xeon Phi chips to better handle “deep learning” in the Internet cloud, Intel data center group executive vice president Diane Bryant said in an online post. “While artificial intelligence is often equated with great science fiction, it isn’t relegated to novels and movies,” Bryant said. “AI is all around us,” he added. Separately, Apple Inc on Monday confirmed that it has bought US machine learning start-up Turi as Silicon Valley giants focus on a future rich with AI. Turi specializes in enabling developers to imbue software applications with programs so the apps respond to data more like the way people do. Apple declined to elaborate on the deal for Seattle-based Turi. Technology news Web site GeekWire cited people close to the acquisition as pegging the purchase price at US$200 million.

Advisor Insights Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Intel Acquires Artificial Intelligence Startup Nervana Systems (INTC) By Shiv Mehta, CFA | August 9, 2016 — 9:48 PM EDT Leading chip-maker, Intel Corp. (INTC), announced on Tuesday its acquisition of Nervana Systems. According to a source speaking to Recode, Intel may have paid around $408 million for the artificial intelligence startup. Nervana Systems is based in San Diego and was founded by Naveen Rao, a former neural networks developer at Qualcomm. The company has developed a cloud platform, which allows consumers to build computer models that can learn. It is currently developing chips for deep learning, and this could be the main reason behind Intel's interest in the startup. The company has already raised $25 million in venture funding and currently has a contract with the U.S. Intelligence’s venture arm – In-Q-tel. Motive of the deal Following the deal, Intel Corp. will be able to offer cloud service along with software and hardware and make its products compatible with artificial intelligence networks. Diane Bryant, executive vice president of Intel’s data center business, said in a blog, “We believe that bringing together the Intel engineers who create the Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors with the talented Nervana Systems’ team, we will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible.” She added, “We will continue to invest in leading-edge technologies that complement and enhance Intel’s AI portfolio.” Jason Waxman, Intel vice president, speaking to Recode, said that the shift to artificial intelligence could dwarf the move to cloud computing. (See also: Could Intel Exit the Data Security Business?) Another Deal in the Artificial Intelligence Space The deal announcement by Intel comes after Apple Inc (AAPL) announced it will be acquiring Seattle-based Turi Inc, which specializes in artificial intelligence. According to the VC research firm CB Insights, there have been 33 transactions in the artificial intelligence space since 2011, which includes buyers such as Yahoo, Alphabet, IBM Corp., Salesforce, and Twitter. On the other hand, PWC reports that there have been around 29 transactions in 2016 in this space, after accounting for smaller deals. This comes after 37 deals in 2015. Todson Page, PWC’s industry deals leaders, said, “We are on a very swift and increasing pace.” (See also: Inside Intel: A Look At The Mega Chipmaker.)

Prabha K S August 10, 2016 17:52 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares Qualcomm Ventures, Intel Capital and Brand Capital were called out as the most active investor in India from 2012 to the first half of 2016. [Representational image]Reuters The number of corporate venture capital (CVC) deals in India almost doubled to 13 for the April-June quarter compared to 7 CVC deals in the first quarter of the current fiscal. It also marks the highest number of deals for the last 18 quarters since 2012, according to a report by CB Insights. Even as non-corporate venture capital investments fell year-on-year during April-June quarter of the 2016-17 fiscal, investment activities of corporate venture arms for the first half (H1) of the current fiscal peaked over the last four years in India.

Spending-wise, CVC investments in start-ups in India stood at $171 million for the quarter ended June 2016, almost five times higher than the previous two quarters for which funding stood at $34 million. Qualcomm Ventures, Intel Capital and Brand Capital were seen as the most active investors in India from 2012-H1 2016. In contrast, venture capital (VC) funding in start-ups from non-corporate entities plunged both in terms of number of deals and volume. Deals fell sharply by 35 percent year-on-year during the first quarter of 2016, while the quarter witnessed an inflow of $337 million from VCs compared to $1.79 billion from the year-ago period, reported the Economic Times. At a global level, CVC activity witnessed a slump by 11 percent from 335 deals in January-March 2016 to 298 deals in the April-June quarter of the year. In line with this, total volume of funding and average deal size also declined. Globally, overall funding fell from $8 billion to $4.7 billion. Average deal size of CVC funding stood at $19 million, lower by 29.6 percent sequentially. Asia accounted for 17 percent of the total deals worldwide. The share of CVC deals out of total VC deals stood at 19 percent for the quarter. The number of new CVC investments have already crossed 50 percent of the total new CVC funding for 2015. While new CVCs for the entire 2015 came at 85, the number of new CVCs has already touched 53 during the first half of 2016.

Powerful Android Adware Makes Its Way Into the Google Play Store GO Apps are still available for download at the time of writing Aug 10, 2016 11:17 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Six apps from a developer named ValerySoftware have found their way into the official Google Play Store and have infected at least 3,000 users, based on their current download counts. The apps, discovered and reported this week by Intel McAfee security experts, are nothing more but hollow shells providing no functionality at all, except for the malicious features. Apps specialized in showing ads, downloading & installing other apps Advertised as all sorts of Minecraft mods, the apps are capable of collecting sensitive information from the phone, downloading Android apps from external sources or the Google Play Store. The malicious apps can also install the previously downloaded apps, uninstall them, and open or close applications on demand, based on commands received from a central command server. Additionally, the malicious app will use advertising SDKs to load and show ads from various vendors, silently tapping the ads behind the scenes. All apps ask users for administrator rights All of this is possible because the apps require administrator rights at installation time. Since the apps are installed from the Google Play Store, users are generally willing to grant them such powers, even if the underlying app is only a silly game mod and doesn't have a reason to require admin privileges. The reason for requiring admin-level access is to make it much harder to remove the apps after they were installed, something that most users providing feedback on the apps' Google Play pages have complained about. "I tried for mabye a month and still won't delete," wrote user Denise Travis. "I hate it and it won't work or delete," said Xavier Martinez. Apps have ties to a well-known cyber-criminal group from Europe Intel McAfee experts noticed that all apps were encrypted and obfuscated at many levels, which might explain why Google didn't detect their malicious behavior during the automated security tests it performs before approving the apps on the Play Store. For its part, Intel McAfee has noticed that the app uses domain names previously associated with other cyber-criminal activity, meaning the apps are part of a well-oiled cyber-crime syndicate.

Naveen Rao, CEO and co-founder of Nervana, said with the acquisition, Intel is formally committing to pushing the forefront of AI technologies.   “Nervana intends to continue all existing development efforts, including the Nervana Neon deep learning framework, Nervana deep learning platform and the Nervana Engine deep learning hardware,” he said. Although Nervana’s technology and expertise will be incorporated into Intel’s portfolio to take AI to the “next level”, Rao said Nervana will continue to operate out of its San Diego Headquarters and will retain its talent, brand and “startup mentality”. AI emerges as top trend for security and big firms News of the acquisition comes just a week after Apple announced it latest AI acquisition with the purchase of machine-leaning company Turi in a deal reportedly worth $200m. The shift to AI is emerging as a firm trend among companies such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Toyota and many others seeking to tailor-make and optimise services automatically, according to financial markets news site Seeking Alpha. AI is also increasingly becoming a focus of cyber security suppliers seeking to automate responses to lighten the load on security teams and enable organisations to respond to attacks at internet speed. Bryant said AI is central to the opportunity to derive value from the millions of terabytes of data generated by billions of smart, connected computing devices. “AI is all around us, from the commonplace such as talk-to-text, photo tagging and fraud detection to the cutting edge of precision medicine, injury prediction and autonomous cars,” she said. “Encompassing compute methods such as advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world.” Read more about artificial intelligence Socially aware general-purpose artificial intelligence in the form of a dog could be the ideal form factor to take over the world. The UK government has announced plans to allow driverless cars to be used on public roads from early next year. A computer program has made history by passing the artificial intelligence test set by computer science pioneer Alan Turing. Smart systems like IBM’s Watson, autonomous vehicles and a growing army of robots are quietly making more and more decisions every day. According to Bryant, Intel processors power more than 97% of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads, with the Intel Xeon processor E5 family being the most widely deployed processor for deep learning inference. “While less than 10% of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest growing form of AI,” she said. Bryant said Intel believes that by bringing together its engineers and the Nervan team, they will be able to advance the industry faster than would have otherwise been possible. She said further announcements around AI will be made at the Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco in August. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Intel is tsarting to see AI as the next big thing and it is buying in expertise. Nervana which has not been the same since its lead singer killed himself appears to have got itself involved with cutting edge AI reseach [are you sure that is the name Nervana? Ed]. Intel wrote in its bog that the buy out will help develop Intel’s artificial intelligence portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance of Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors. The company is led by former Qualcomm researcher Naveen Rao and has raised $25 million in venture funding and also has a contract to work with In-Q-tel, the U.S. intelligence community’s venture arm. It has not said how much it paid for the company but investors in Nervana include Global Playground, CME Ventures, Lux Capital, Allen & Co and AME Cloud Ventures so it looks like a large amount of money must have changed hands.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews PC Nvidia Titan X Pascal review Absolute power? By Richard Leadbetter Published 10/08/2016 With AMD's focus elsewhere in the graphics market, Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1080 has held an iron grip on the GPU top-end, offering a phenomenal level of performance, in exchange for a hefty price-premium. The new Titan X Pascal ups the ante still further: even more power, and an even higher price of entry. The bottom line is clear - the new Titan offers often staggering levels of performance, but we are looking at a 2x increase in price over GTX 1080 for a maximum boost of around 30-33 per cent in frame-rates. We can argue about the Titan line's value proposition, but it's a moot point - as a brand, it's Nvidia's equivalent to Intel's Extreme Edition processors and obviously, they wouldn't make them if they couldn't sell them. And of course, the Titan serves as a preview of sorts, a precursor for the more mainstream products to come. There was a time when the Maxwell-powered Titan X was similarly unattainable owing to its $999 ticket price. Then GTX 980 Ti came along, offering nigh-on identical frame-rates with a third of the price lopped off. And now, that same level of performance is available at just $380 in the form of GTX 1070, with a 100W power efficiency saving on top for good measure. In there here and now, Titan X Pascal sees Nvidia iterate on its previous strategy in terms of the make-up of its big chip. In many ways, the new Titan is essentially an upsized version of its existing GTX 1080, adding 50 per cent to everything in the core processor architecture. For example, memory bandwidth rises from 320GB/s to 480GB/s, with the interface expanding from 256 to 384 bits. Memory allocation itself rises from 8GB of GDDR5X to 12GB. ROPs are increased from 64 to 96. However, the CUDA core and texture unit count doesn't see quite as much of a linear jump - we go from 2560 to 3584 shaders in Titan X and from 160 to 224 texture units. It's now been confirmed that the fully enabled GP102 actually has 3840 shaders on the 12bn transistor die - 256 CUDA cores are disabled in order to get more workable chips from the production line. Nvidia Titan X Pascal specs Just a few months have passed since Nvidia unveiled GTX 1080 - its monstrous debut 16nm FinFET GPU king. Seeking to leverage its position, Titan X Pascal sees our first look at the consumer version of its big chip Pascal processor.. CUDA Cores: 3584 Base Clock: 1417MHz Boost Clock: 1531MHz Texture Units: 224 Texel Fill-Rate: 317.4 Gigatexels/sec Memory Clock: 10GHz Memory Bandwidth: 480GB/s ROPs: 96 L2 Cache Size: 3072KB TDP: 250W Transistors: 12 billion Die Size: 471mm2 Process: 16nm FinFet The price of admission for the Titan X Pascal is a colossal $1200 - twice the price of GTX 1080 and a 20 per cent hike over the Titan X Maxwell. We would expect to see an upcoming GTX 1080 Ti with similar performance occupying a much lower price-point when AMD returns to the fray. So at the shading level, there's about 25 per cent more computational power here, a combination of a 40 per cent increase in CUDA cores along with a pared back boost clock - Titan X Pascal's boost clock of 1531MHz is considerably behind GTX 1080's 1733MHz. Going into our tests, our concern was that we wouldn't get all of the expected increase to performance we would want from a Titan product, and that there may have been a compromise too many. Rich presents a video review of the Titan X Pascal, highlighting its generational leap over the last-gen behemoths, overclocking potential, plus its curious relationship with Nvidia's previous GPU king - the GTX 1080. One area where there are few surprises concerns the physical make-up of the card. The new Titan X Pascal takes the GTX 1080 Founders Edition's polygonal aesthetic and thermal solution and melds it with the distinctive black finish of the Maxwell Titan X. IO is also identical - three DisplayPorts, one HDMI 2.0 and a dual-link DVI output. The new offering has a 250W TDP, requiring one eight-pin and one six-pin power input, and of course, there are two SLI fingers for multi-card connectivity. Nvidia's GTX 1080 could get pretty toasty even before overclocking, so our second major concern centred on Titan X's thermals - how hot would this 12bn transistor behemoth get, and would this impact its overclocking potential? And in performance terms, rounding off the areas we really wanted to test, we wanted to see whether Nvidia had once again managed to deliver scalability across all resolutions. Some might say that running GTX 1080 or indeed this new GPU offering at 1080p resolutions may well be a monumental waste of GPU resources, but to that we say that there are many high refresh rate monitor owners that still can't run their games at a locked 120Hz. So full HD is where we'll begin our performance testing. Our benchmark suite at 1080p is designed to put speed first. Yes, we are indeed running at ultra settings in almost all cases, but super-sampling and multi-sampling anti-aliasing are disabled in favour of the best post-process solutions available - for the most part, this is SMAA. The results are intriguing, suggesting that perhaps finally, Nvidia has produced hardware that can outstrip the capabilities of its highly impressive software layer. 1080p is Titan X Pascal's weakest area. Frame-rate uplifts vs GTX 1080 are weaker than expected, though the card performs well against Titan X Maxwell and especially R9 Fury X. 1920x1080 (1080p) Titan X Pascal GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X Maxwell R9 Fury X Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 119.2 98.1 79.1 75.0 61.9 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 87.6 75.0 57.0 59.8 70.0 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 153.9 128.3 107.0 105.9 99.9 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 117.9 92.8 78.3 73.9 67.7 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 132.2 105.6 88.8 81.8 75.3 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 136.8 115.8 92.5 84.4 93.7 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 167.2 133.5 105.0 100.1 81.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 137.6 114.0 94.2 86.6 78.2 The lowest increases vs GTX 1080 actually come from two DX12 titles - Ashes of the Singularity and Hitman post just a 16.8 per cent and 18.1 per cent increase. Crysis 3 manages just a 20 per cent uptick, but the big surprise is Assassin's Creed Unity at 21.5 per cent. Typically this game will take any GPU and absorb its shading and bandwidth potential - it's the reason it's still in our benchmark line-up, as borne out by the GTX 1080 vs Titan X Maxwell differential of 30.8 per cent. The Division scales best at 28.2 per cent vs GTX 1080, followed by Rise of the Tomb Raider at 25.2 per cent. The delta vs AMD's R9 Fury X ranges from 25 per cent with Ashes of the Singularity to a gargantuan 105.9 per cent in Tomb Raider. Perhaps this offers a preview of the challenges to come - AMD's weaker driver is holding back some excellent hardware at this relatively low resolution. Compared to the original Maxwell-powered Titan X, its successor is holding up well with anything from a 45.3 per cent uplift in Ashes of the Singularity through a hugely impressive 67 per cent boost in Tomb Raider. Across the selection of titles, we have an aggregate 55 per cent improvement. So where are the bottlenecks then? Well, take a look at Far Cry Primal and Crysis 3 and you'll see 'throttle points' - only evident if you can study performance in context. Crysis 3 might be 20 per cent slower as an average, but this is not a consistent delta. You'll see Titan X Pascal shoot away of GTX 1080, then occasionally come crashing down in detail-intensive scenes. Clearly the hardware is not at fault - it's simply that the GPU is stalling owing to the lack of instructions from the CPU. And that's quite a state of affairs, bearing in mind we're running the Titan X Pascal with the Core i7 6700K overclocked to 4.6GHz. Nvidia's new GPU king will deliver a boost at full HD resolution, but bottlenecking isn't conducive to a smooth, consistent gameplay experience. For this reason, we need to push harder on resolution to show this GPU at its best. Titan X practically demands running at a higher resolution. For our money, 2560x1440 or its ultrawide 3840x1440 equivalent, are the best entry points for utilising this card. 2560x1440 (1440p) Titan X Pascal GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X Maxwell R9 Fury X Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 79.4 64.0 51.0 48.8 40.8 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 83.7 64.3 56.8 51.6 62.0 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 102.8 83.0 65.8 65.4 65.6 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 84.8 67.1 55.4 54.2 52.8 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 96.3 75.8 61.9 57.1 58.1 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 102.4 86.1 67.4 61.5 73.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 109.4 87.7 68.5 67.4 59.1 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 108.3 83.7 67.0 62.1 60.1 Moving onto 2560x1440, or qHD resolution, the new Titan X shows far more consistency in its performance uplift compared to its predecessor. Only two titles - Crysis 3 and The Division - show increases less than 60 per cent (57.2 and 56.5 respectively). Elsewhere, we're well up, with The Witcher in particular showing a huge 74.4 per cent boost. The gap only widens with comparisons to Fury X, where The Witcher 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider are 80.2 and 85.1 per cent faster and AC Unity sees a colossal 94.6 per cent boost. Titan X Pascal is much faster than AMD mainstays Ashes of the Singularity and Hitman, though the gap closes to 35 per cent and 39.1 per cent respectively. However, while the comparison with prior gen hardware are exceptional, the GTX 1080 is still putting up spirited resistance to Titan X Pascal's sheer brute force, with only Ashes of the Singularity and The Witcher 3 coming close to (or breaking) the 30 per cent increase in frame-rates we would expect from a big chip Nvidia product. The aggregate boost in performance from across all eight titles rises from 1080p's 22 per cent to 25.6 per cent. This is mostly in line with the specs boost we see on paper and highlights that while the last-gen Titan X was a beast, Nvidia really did an excellent job with the GTX 1080 in pushing what was possible from its debut 16nmFF Pascal processor. Bearing in mind the scalability in memory bandwidth offered by Titan X Pascal, we should see the performance differential push on with a much higher resolution. 4K offers a 2.25x boost to resolution over 1440p, so it should be the best test of Titan X's credentials on attainable, consumer-level display technology. Titan X Pascal shows the biggest boosts over all other 'uber cards' at 4K resolution. GTX 1080 works really well at this resolution - the new Titan can blow it out of the water on many titles. 3840x2160 (4K) Titan X Pascal GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X Maxwell R9 Fury X Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 43.1 32.9 25.4 25.6 24.3 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 63.7 53.6 43.1 40.9 46.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 50.0 39.6 31.5 31.3 31.5 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 49.6 38.5 31.0 30.7 31.1 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 49.6 38.5 31.0 30.7 31.1 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 54.7 42.4 33.5 33.5 34.3 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 62.1 49.0 38.5 36.2 41.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 63.2 47.5 37.3 34.0 36.4 Titan X Pascal continues its domination over the last-gen powerhouses at UHD, with a fantastic 65.6 per cent cumulative average in performance boost over its Maxwell predecessor, and a 61.2 per cent boost over the R9 Fury X. It's interesting to note that at 4K, the Fury X finally shows signs of truly succumbing in the challenging Hitman DX12 bench - it held its own fairly well at lower resolutions, but at 4K, the Titan X Pascal is 50.7 per cent faster. Also of interest is The Witcher 3, which really does like Nvidia's new offering - it's a mammoth 85.9 per cent faster than the last-gen Titan. The GTX 1080 continues to hold its own though: Titan X Pascal is faster, but across all eight titles, the uplift averages at 27.6 per cent. It's dragged down to a certain extent by a mystifyingly low resut in Ashes of the Singularity (in marked contrast to its 1440p showing). Generally speaking, it seems to be the case that Titan X Pascal offers a 27-30 per cent increase in 4K performance over GTX 1080, depending on the title. And we should expect some bigger boosts in select titles too - The Witcher 3 comes in 33 per cent faster. A couple of weeks ago, we put together a 4K 'let's play' video showing our attempts to run an overclocked GTX 1080 at UHD resolution, the aim being to lock at 60fps on challenging, modern games. By and large, with sensible compromises, we could hit 50-60fps in most titles, producing a superb experience overall. We're in the process of repeating this test with Titan X Pascal and the benchmark leap translates into palpable increases in the quality of the actual gameplay experience. The Witcher 3 proved troublesome to lock at 60fps on high settings with the overclocked GTX 1080. With Titan X Pascal, we're at ultra with only momentary drops below the desired frame-rate target. Put simply, it's beautiful. Curious to see how Titan X Pascal performance scales running the same gaming workloads across 1080p, 1440p and 4K? We were too, which is why we put together this analysis. One of our primary concerns with Titan X Pascal was the reduced boost clock compared to GTX 1080 - a straight 200MHz drop, based on Nvidia's spec. A 1.53GHz boost is still creditable, but the happy news is that in-game performance is typically higher. Where GTX 1080 tops out at 1866MHz, we noted Titan X at around 100-120MHz lower. And begs the question, to what extent can the big chip Pascal be overclocked? Typically we've found ourselves hitting a brick wall on the smaller processors at around 2050MHz. Well, GP102 can still be pushed well beyond its boost clock spec, and seems to hit similar limits at around 1950MHz. We achieved a rock-solid overclock by adding 140MHz to the core frequency, while the G5X memory scaled like a champ. Artefacting started to creep in at a mammoth +750MHz, so we dialled that down to +700MHz and didn't have to worry about it again. However, what's clear is that to get the most out of the overclock, you'll need to manually ramp up the fan - it seems that frequency throttling seems to kick in around 82-83 degrees Celsius. For our tests, I upped the fan to 65 per cent (beyond that it gets obtrusively loud), settled it on our Crysis 3 test scene (see below) for 30 minutes to ensure stability and topped out thermals, then ran the test suite. Generally speaking, you're looking at 11 to 16 per cent of additional performance here, but some titles are less impressed with the additional power, with Hitman DX12 posting a paltry 8.3 per cent increase in frame-rate. The peak 1950MHz clock drops back pretty quickly by 100-150MHz presumably owing to the temperature limit - so it is a shame that only Nvidia's cooler is available (a GP102-based GTX 1080 Ti with third party coolers should be very interesting). However, Nvidia's power efficiency continues to impress. Pushed to its limits, we noted a peak system power draw of just 434W from the wall while stock power consumption was effectively on par with the Radeon R9 Fury X. Even overclocked it's on par with a stock Radeon R9 390. This scene from Crysis 3 is easily repeatable and incurs a heavy, sustained load on the GPU - good for testing overclocks and heavy power draw. Titan X Pascal Titan X Pascal OC GTX 1080 GTX 1070 Titan X R9 Fury X R9 390 Peak System Power Draw 384W 434W 303W 263W 361W 385W 437W Nvidia Titan X Pascal - the Digital Foundry verdict Fast just got a whole lot faster. In terms of the generational leap, Nvidia has succeeded in providing a 60 per cent improvement in performance compared to its last-gen Titan, living up to the firm's claims. However, the differential with GTX 1080 isn't quite so clear-cut - Nvidia pushed the boat out with its GP104 flagship and it's punching a touch above its weight here. Mostly, it comes down to just a few percentage points though, and in the majority of use-case scenarios, Titan X Pascal delivers the palpably faster experience you would want, assuming you're not gaming at 1080p. There is a Witcher School and I've been It's not for the faint-hearted. 4K is where this product excels, and from a personal standpoint, I've been trying to find a good, desktop experience where those extra pixels really count. UHD displays in 23/27/28-inch range just don't cut the mustard - the pixel density is simply insane, and even trying out the 32-inch Asus PQ321Q produces a similar experience. However, a 40-inch Samsung KU6400 positioned as a desktop screen paired with the Titan X Pascal is handing in some epic results where 4K really shines. This is something we'll be returning to in more depth soon, but running the Witcher 3 on this set-up on ultra settings at 60Hz (HairWorks off though, naturally) offers the kind of generational leap over console that can't be ignored - 2x the frame-rate, 4x the resolution and massively improved quality settings. It's remarkable. Titan X Pascal is obviously expensive, and clearly aimed at the niche that can afford to double their cash outlay for 30 per cent more performance - but Nvidia carved out the market here and makes no secret that where there's a Titan, a Ti follows thereafter, sometimes just by a matter of months. So in this sense, this review almost acts as a preview of sorts for the inevitable GTX 1080 Ti that lurks around the corner. Based on GTX 980 Ti's emergence, we should expect it to launch in line with, or just prior, to AMD's new Vega 'uber card'. But right now, there is no Vega, and Nvidia has absolute domination of the GPU top-tier. If you want absolute power, be prepared to pay a hefty price for it.

This driver supports for all processor architectures. Ethernet standard IEEE 802.3 is followed. Overview on PCIe Bandwidth : PCIe is a serial expansion bus standard for connecting a processor to one or more peripheral devices. Currently PCIe 3.0 allows for 8Gbps per lane. So 16 lane PCIe can ideally provide 128Gbps. Fig1: PCIe Interface Bandwidth WEC13 PCIe Ethernet driver Architecture : WEC13 PCIe Ethernet driver consists of PCIe Controller Driver, PCIe Bus Driver and Ethernet(miniport) driver. Device Manager loads the PCIe Bus driver, PCIe Bus Driver do the bus enumeration and finds the devices on the bus. By reading the Vendor ID and Device ID of the Giga bit Ethernet module(GbE) loads the Ethernet(miniport) driver. Miniport Driver uses the NDIS Library API's for packet transmission as shown in below fig (2) Fig2: PCIe Ethernet Architecture As seen in the above fig(2) the board is connected through PCIe interface to GbE module. Whenever data comes to the module interrupt generated and NDIS API called which in turn calls the miniport Handlers to handle the interrupt. We have used Intel's 82574L GbE module, since PCIe is platform independent miniport driver can be used across any platforms. iWave has expertise on WEC7 and WEC2013 board support package development, including, support for RS232 Serial Console port, SDHC, USB 2.0 Host, USB2.0 device, Ethernet, 7" TFT LCD, Touch Screen support, SATA HDD port, HDMI port on NXP i.MX6 processors and also through PCIe interface many drivers has been developed like bluetooth, WIFI, Ethernet. WEC13 PCIe Ethernet driver can be ported to chip set from any vendor. Currently we have on Intel 82574L module. Advantages of PCIe Ethernet: 1.    Higher maximum bandwidth 2.    Platform Independent 3.    Less power consumption 4.    Lower I/O pin count 5.    Better performance-scaling 6.    More detailed error detection and reporting Applications: 1.    We developed WEC13 Ethernet driver for Intel 82574L GbE module with this expertise we can develop miniport driver to chip set from any vendor. 2.    The GbE module as secondary Ethernet will be an add on feature. 3.    Both normal Ethernet and PCIe card can be used simultaneously one of them can be used for debugging purpose. 4.    Since packet transmission is faster in Ethernet through PCIe, it can be used in time critical systems. 5.    By making use of PCIe switch many end point PCIe can be connected.

Intel said that because of the pervasive reach of cloud computing, and the decreasing cost of computing thanks to Moore’s Law and billions of connected devices generating millions of terabytes of data every single day, AI will be critical to managing this data. Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel’s Data Centre Group said that AI is no longer science fiction in movies and novels. “AI is all around us, from the commonplace (talk-to-text, photo tagging, fraud detection) to the cutting edge (precision medicine, injury prediction, autonomous cars). Key methods of expansion “Encompassing compute methods like advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world. “Machine learning, and its subset deep learning, are key methods for the expanding field of AI.” Bryant said that Intel processors power more than 97pc of servers deployed to support machine learning workloads today. “The Intel Xeon processor E5 family is the most widely-deployed processor for deep-learning inference and the recently launched Intel Xeon Phi processor delivers the scalable performance needed for deep-learning training. “While less than 10pc of servers worldwide were deployed in support of machine learning last year, the capabilities and insights it enables makes machine learning the fastest-growing form of AI.” Intel discovers the Shangri-La of AI? She said that Intel has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems. According to various reports, Intel is paying up to $408m for the 48-person company, which started up in 2014. “Nervana has a fully-optimised software and hardware stack for deep learning,” Bryant said. “Their IP and expertise in accelerating deep-learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI. “We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimise the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry-standard frameworks. Nervana’s engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep-learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors,” Bryant added.

In the photograph, a man walks past a logo of Intel during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, June 1, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Intel Corporation is expanding its focus on artificial intelligence. The Santa Clara, California, company announced Tuesday it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Nervana Systems, a deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) company. In a statement, Diane Bryant, general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, said Nervana’s “IP [intellectual property] and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel’s capabilities in the field of AI. We will apply Nervana’s software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks. Nervana’s Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel’s AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors.” Nervana is a startup headquartered in San Diego and began operations in 2014. In the words of co-founder and CEO Naveen Rao, the company “started with the idea that we can engineer better solutions for computation by bringing together computer engineering, neuroscience, and machine learning.” Related Stories Samsung Buys US Cloud Computing Firm Joyent Apple Doubles Down On Privacy Speaking about the rationale behind the acquisition by Intel, Rao said in a statement: “The semiconductor integrated circuit is one of humanity’s crowning achievements and Intel has the best semiconductor technology in the world.  Nervana’s AI expertise combined with Intel’s capabilities and huge market reach will allow us to realize our vision and create something truly special.” With the growth in mobile phone usage, personal computer sales have slowed, and the world’s largest chip maker, facing an existential crisis, has long been diversifying its product portfolio. Having started work on car security systems in 2011, it recently partnered with BMW and Mobileye for a self-driving car collaboration. The company also makes wearables such as smart earbuds and smartwatches — it issued a worldwide recall for the Basis smartwatches last week after the devices were found overheating and causing burns. The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which will need customary regulatory approvals. However, an unnamed source told Recode the deal was valued at about $400 million.

While Intel’s Xeon processors dominate in data centers, they’re not built for the unique workloads of artificial intelligence calculations, according to Gartner Inc. analyst Martin Reynolds. Adding Nervana’s products and expertise will help it gain a foothold in a small but growing market and fend off would-be rivals such as Nvidia Inc., if it can rapidly turn its acquisition into products. “The market isn’t that big yet,” he said. “But it’s potentially a huge opportunity.” Intel’s data center unit, its most-profitable and fastest-growing business, needs to find products suited to running emerging services such as voice and picture recognition. Such artificial intelligence work is expected to become a bigger portion of the activity of the servers powered by Intel’s chips.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel moves to achieve deep-learning Nervana with acquisition by Jeff Kampman  3:40 PM on August 9, 2016 Deep learning technology is one of the buzziest, fastest-growing fields in tech right now. We've long heard about the potential of the technology from Nvidia, who has positioned its GPUs as ideal platforms to power applications like self-driving cars and neural-network-powered image identification, to name just two potential applications for the tech. Today, Intel is trying to get a leg up in the game by purchasing Nervana Systems, a deep-learning hardware and software provider, for an undisclosed sum. Intel says it'll be using Nervana's software to refine its Math Kernel Library, and the company's hardware expertise will also be put to work in the development of Xeon and Xeon Phi chips. Nervana's hardware page says it's developed a deep-learning application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)  in an interposer package with 32GB of HBM on board. That ASIC also includes six bi-directional proprietary interconnect links that allow clusters of chips to be connected intra- or inter-server for extra speed. The company also makes an SDK called Neon for implementing deep-learning applications. In tandem, these products are meant to provide big speedups for the field. We'll probably hear much more about this acquisition at IDF next week.

Prove the urban myth that Microsoft copied code to create MS-DOS Did Microsoft use code from CP/M for MS-DOS? Find the command that prints Gary Kildall's name to win a prize. By Mary-Ann Russon August 9, 2016 18:24 BST Microsoft and IBM were at the birth of the personal computer in the 1980s, but some people want to prove that they ripped off Gary Kildall's code Ruben de Rijcke, Wikimedia Commons An IT consultant specialising in analysing software in order to determine whether code has been copied is offering a prize of $200,000 (£154,000) to anyone who can find a secret command in the MS-DOS operating system and conclusively prove that Microsoft copied code from a computing pioneer. Before personal computers became a common mass-market item for consumers, there was computer scientist Gary Kildall. He developed the first high-level programming language for microprocessors called PL/M in 1973, followed by a pioneering computer operating system known as Control Program for Microcomputers (CP/M), which enabled the Intel 8080 processors to control floppy drives. PL/M was picked up and marketed by Intel, but the firm had no interest in CP/M, so eventually Kildall started his own company with his wife, called Digital Research Inc (DRI) to market CP/M to hobbyists who liked to build their own personal computers. But then lots of manufacturers began to licence CP/M, turning it into a standard for personal computers, and Kildall then invented the concept of BIOS, which is a set of simple programs stored on the computer's hardware which enables CP/M to run and support different types of hardware, and by 1981, CP/M was running on 3,000 different computer models. The man who should have been Bill Gates Gary Kildall, a computer scientist who invented a large number of features of the personal computerWikimedia Commons In 1980, Bill Gates suggested that IBM approach DRI and purchase CP/M so that it could be used on the upcoming IBM PC, but the two companies failed to reach an agreement for various reasons, depending on who you ask. Gates was already working to develop the BASIC interpreter and other programs for the IBM PC, and IBM asked him if he could develop an operating system. In the end, Gates came up with an operating system called 86-DOS / QDOS that implemented Kildall's CP/M API and was shipped on IBM machines as PC DOS, and the rest is history. Kildall examined the code of PC DOS and concluded that it definitely did infringe on CP/M's copyright but, was told at the time, the intellectual property law on software was not clear enough for him to sue, so in the end it was PC DOS that made billions because it became essential for running most software, and PC DOS later became MS-DOS. Kildall basically got on with his life and went on to work on a number of exciting technologies including the first computer interface for video disks to allow automatic playback, as well as the file system and data structures for the first consumer CD-ROM. However, he remained resentful towards Bill Gates for losing the IBM deal and mentioned it in his unpublished memoir Computer Connections, which is in the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Both Microsoft and IBM have long stated that they definitely didn't do anything wrong, and some IBM executives deny Kildall's most pertinent tale – that he met and shook hands with IBM executives on a deal to ship CP/M during a fateful plane flight to Florida. Now you have a chance to prove Kildall was right all along Kildall was a wealthy man when he died in 1994 due to the other technologies he worked on, but some people in the IT industry still believe that he could have been telling the truth about almost gaining fame and fortune for introducing personal computing to the general masses. There is also a rumour floating around that there is a secret command located in MS-DOS that, if correctly initiated, will cause the operating system to print out a copyright notice in Kildall's name. Bob Zeidman – who courted controversy in 2012 when he used forensic software tools to analyse QDOS (because of a defunct contract consulting for Microsoft) and was unable to find any sign that Microsoft had copied code from Kildall – recently presented a new analysis on MS-DOS using previously unavailable source code that was provided by Microsoft to the Computer History Museum. According to IEEE Spectrum, Zeidman still cannot find any evidence that Microsoft copied any of the code from CP/M, to the extent that he is now challenging the internet to prove him wrong. He is offering a total of $200,000 in prize money – namely $100,000 to anyone who can use "accepted forensic techniques" to prove that the copying took place, and another $100,000 to anyone who is able to discover what the secret command is.

If its ultra-long name had not made it clear, the Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 is designed for Intel's i7 X99 CPUs. Rather than the white and black color theme of the X99 Taichi, the Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 features a more mainstream red and black aesthetic. While most X99-refresh motherboards feature a U.2 port for Intel's NVM drive, it seems that ASRock decided to add a second Ultra M.2 slot instead since most of the latest drives come in the M.2 form factor.     Interestingly enough, ASRock has decided to opt out of implementing LEDs on its Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7, which might add some points for users who do not care for them. Instead of aiming for the extreme top regarding price and features, ASRock has decided to focus on the mid-range price bracket with its refresh motherboards. Priced very competitively, the Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 is loaded with the latest in features and connectivity. Let's take a look at what ASRock is offering.     Specifications     The ASRock Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 has many high-end features including two Ultra (32Gb/s) M.2 ports, USB 3.1, Wireless AC, Sound Blaster Cinema 3, and many platform features such as USB 3.0 and SATA6Gb/s.     Pricing   The Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 is available from many large retailers for $253.99.

By Priyanka Mogul August 9, 2016 11:28 BST Miss Philippines Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach waves after being crowned Miss Universe at the 2015 Miss Universe Pageant in Las Vegas, NevadaReuters Islamic State (Isis) terrorists have called on jihadists to attack the Miss Universe competition being held in the Philippines in January 2017. The call for the terrorist attacks was made through their online networks and directed "everyone who can" to launch an attack on the global beauty pageant. According to SITE Intel Group, which reports on jihadist threats online, a Filipino jihadi telegram channel posted a video on how to make suicide belts. It suggested followers "create [the] bomb for Miss Universe". The call for jihadists addressed "brothers who love martyrdom". The annual beauty pageant is due to be held in the Philippines capital Manila in January 2017. A statement from SITE Intel Group said: "A pro-Islamic State telegram channel posted an explosive belt manufacturing video and a timed hand grenade manual, and suggested to 'create bomb for Miss Universe', referring to the beauty pageant to be held in the Philippines in January 2017." Although the online threats could not be verified, Isis has been expanding its presence in the Philippines and attempting to recruit more jihadist fighters from the country. In June 2016, the terrorist group released its first recruitment video for the Philippines and its neighbouring countries. The following month, Isis launched a newspaper to recruit fighters from south-east Asia. The Al-Fatihin newspaper is published in the Malay language and being distributed in southern Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and southern Thailand. Following its launch, Isis released a video declaring the Philippines its caliphate and calling for south-east Asian militants to travel there if they were unable to get to Syria. In the 20-minute video, jihadists from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines take turns speaking to the camera to pledge their support for Isis.

Time for a systems squeeze Blog Anyone who's read much of what I write for The Reg will know that I'm a believer in hybrid cloud – using the cloud for some elements of your world whilst retaining components on-premises too. But precisely which elements? We'll look at how you might decide what belongs where: on-premises, in the private cloud, or in the public cloud. On-premises doesn't really mean that Before we get going it's worth considering what we mean by our terminology. When I talk on-premises I don't, unless you're a big company that can afford suitably protected premises, mean servers and storage in your own office. To me an on-premises system is one that sits in a dedicated area (or at least private, single-client cabinets) in secure data centre to which your office has suitably fast connectivity and which is run by a professional outfit with the appropriate certifications (SOC, PCI-DSS, ISO27001 – the usual suspects). So for on-premises think “self-owned and private”. Private cloud versus on-premises While we're at it, let's also talk about what I mean by private cloud computing. Gartner defines it as: “a form of cloud computing that is used by only one organization, or that ensures that an organization is completely isolated from others”. The most common way I see this implemented is where you layer your own cloud-like installation in your on-premises (i.e. private data centre) installations. Imagine you have a pair of data centres and you build a ESXi/vCloud world that spans them (other virtualization platforms are available … but they're not as good) – that's the type of private cloud I'm used to. Our decision process is, then: what to host as stand-alone systems in the data centre; what to run on a virtual infrastructure in the data centre; and what to put in the cloud. On-premises We'll do this one first because it basically soaks up all the exceptions: my default position is seldom to host something as a stand-alone entity for a number of reasons – the cost of making it resilient, the space it takes, the power it drinks and the relative maintenance effort compared to the alternatives. The usual candidate is unusual platforms. If your architecture choice involves a pile of SPARC-based enterprise servers, or a big IBM Power8 setup, it's a real no-brainer: you need to go out and buy the kit. While you should, as part of the decision process during the design phase, consider proprietary kit against (say) an Intel-based virtualized platform, you shouldn't be obsessed with trying to shoehorn the setup into Intel/ESXi/Hyper-V just because that's what your virtual platform runs on. Yes, you have to be cautious about doing something out of the ordinary because of the potential support skills gap, but if the cost of dealing with another platform is overshadowed by the benefit you get from it, don't shy away from that decision. The other one I've discussed recently with friends and colleagues who run infrastructures is the “I have a socking big transactional database server and it needs to be physical” concept. If I'm being honest, though, I remain to be convinced in most cases that this is true. Yes, you have a box at each site with eight quad-core CPUs, four dual-port Gigabit Ethernet LAN cards, and a pair of Fibre Channel HBAs connecting the storage. But would it really be a big leap of faith to migrate this to a hypervisor-based solution on similar hardware, which perhaps has some advantages (hypervisor-level de-duplicated virtual machine snapshots, with correspondingly simple live backups, for example)? In most cases I've seen this would be enough. I do have a tendency to run backup servers as stand-alone machines in an on-prem setup, though. Two sites, a big box at each, dual 10Gbit/s LAN connections, dedicated backup traffic VLANs in the physical and virtual switches, high-speed backup media that preferably replicates itself between locations. If your virtual environment craps itself, you're in trouble if your backup server was a VM sitting on it. Private cloud One clue as to what I'd put in a private cloud came earlier when I mentioned that your data centre has to have “suitably fast connectivity” to your users. Unless you have very fast connectivity between the office and your chosen public cloud installation, you're likely to want to put things like file servers on the private cloud setups in your data centres. They don't need ridiculous amounts of processing power but they do need some sensible connectivity for the users not to moan, particularly if you're shoving big presentations, documents and spreadsheets around the place. Yes, you can (and should) look to use WAN optimisers to improve the performance between your private world and the public cloud, but raw speed is useful for high-data-flow situations. The other category of system I'd put in the private cloud is systems whose security you really care about. If you're doing highly confidential legal work for a client, the chances are that you feel a lot safer with it in your secure data centre than in a cloud installation. Are you justified in feeling this? Well, yes and no. No, because with modest knowledge and a healthy dose of caution you can configure your public cloud services' networking and firewalling pretty much as securely as a private cloud setup. But yes, because you still have the potential for some numpty to set their management password to passw0rd and make the management interface of the thing insecure. In a public cloud setup you don't get low-level access to log files at the hypervisor level: this means that if a client comes to you and accuses you of allowing their proprietary data to be accessed illicitly in the cloud, you often can't prove that this hasn't happened. And the client confidentiality world is one where you're guilty until proven innocent. Public cloud The public cloud is my first consideration for pretty much everything else. This doesn't mean that I'd necessarily use it for anything else – just that I'd consider it first. I may decide, having weighed it up, that a particular application does in fact live better in the private cloud – but I'd consider public cloud first. There are some apps that I do find tend to gravitate to the cloud. Email's an obvious one (let someone like Microsoft look after it rather than giving me a pile of loud kit and temperamental software, thanks very much), as is web hosting (a decent ISP's hosting centre probably has better DDoS protection than I can achieve on my much thinner Internet connection). Pretty much anything that's internet-facing by design (content filtering, web sites, FTP sites, etc.) often lives more happily in the cloud than on-premises, unless there's a need for fast connectivity from the web-facing DMZ to a back-end system inside the firewall (a concept one would try to avoid anyway for the obvious security reasons). I'm also a bit of a fan of using the cloud for data archiving at the moment, too; if the confidentiality aspects discussed in the previous section can be happily mitigated it's a cheap way to store your data archives and with modern storage virtualization appliances it's simple too. As for other apps: consider each on its merits. Obviously you need to be a bit holistic and look across the portfolio (there's no point putting two apps that need to be tightly coupled in different environments) but be methodical and understand the pros and cons of each location for each app. Summing up In short, then: If it really doesn't fit a virtual environment in either the public or private cloud, don't be frightened to implement it in a physical, on-premises form – but don't forget the overhead of supporting and maintaining a heterogeneous setup. If it doesn't fall into the above but it has to be electronically close to the users, private cloud is Plan A. If it doesn't fall into either of the above then public cloud is Plan A. But don't forget that setups differ: think about each app and don't disregard the alternatives if they do turn out to be favourable in one or more specific situations.

TIP, which was launched by Facebook along with Intel and Nokia, is an engineering-focused initiative aimed at developing innovative new technologies and approaches to building and deploying telecommunications network infrastructure in developing countries and remote locations of developed countries. Federated Wireless will help TIP incorporate shared spectrum into its model. As of the end of 2015, more than 4 billion people were still not connected to the Internet, and 10 percent of the world's population was living outside the range of cellular connectivity. Despite the widespread global adoption of mobile phones over the last 20 years, the cellular infrastructure required to support basic connectivity and more advanced capabilities like broadband is still unavailable or unaffordable in many parts of the world. TIP is aimed at solving that by building an active open source community around WAN access technology development. The TIP open source material is expected to accelerate the implementation, deployment and operation of wireless connectivity by telecommunications operators, entrepreneurs, manufacturers and researchers. “TIP is addressing some of the most pressing technology industry needs to rapidly connect the unconnected and underserved populations,” said Andrew Kurtzman, Executive Director of TIP. “Federated Wireless will join a dynamic membership that is working, towards augmenting the development of powerful new technologies and approaches that will pave the way for better connectivity and richer services.” “TIP is a revolutionary and disruptive way to close the connectivity gap for rural communities and the developing world,” said Sarosh Vesuna, SVP, Corporate Development and Strategic Alliances. “Federated Wireless, through its development efforts, has been working on finding ways to simplify and thus make affordable access to communications and content on the Internet, making our involvement in TIP a logical step towards achieving our shared goals.” TIP’s approximately 200 members include operators, infrastructure providers, system integrators and other technology companies. Its founding members are Facebook, Nokia, Intel, Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom. Federated Wireless plans to contribute to TIP’s Core and Management Projects group, improving wireless network efficiency and flexibility while reducing expenses and operating costs. More information about Federated Wireless, including the company’s recent filings to the FCC, can be found at www.federatedwireless.com. Federated Wireless is a subsidiary of Allied Minds (ALM).

The patched patch fixes a kernel panic caused by conflicts with a Windows 10 Anniversary Update on Intel Skylake Virtualization Technology machines. Microsoft's update sent some machines with Avast newly and already installed into blue screen of death spirals from 2 August, but most users were unaffected. Avast quality assurance director Petr Chytil says a driver configuration caused the unforeseen crash. "While the majority of our users didn’t have a problem, certain HW configurations didn't mix well with the update," Chytil says. "To be specific, when the Windows 10 Anniversary Update was combined with our aswvmm.sys driver on an Intel CPU from the Skylake family with Intel VT enabled in the BIOS, the update resulted in a blue screen of death. "This occurred during upgrades to the Windows 10 Anniversary edition from previous versions of Windows, and during clean installations of Avast Antivirus on systems already running the Anniversary Update." He thanked users for reporting the blue screen of death crashes on its forums helping to speed remediation efforts. The final patches were issued on 5 August. i got the bsod bc of updating avast wow — [muffled]™ (@snowyue7) August 5, 2016 Blue screen of death crashes are a favourite pastime of antivirus engines.

Huang August 10th, 2016 @gthuang @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints They are the few, the proud, the tech companies that have gone public this year. Acacia Communications is one of them. The Maynard, MA-based networking company (NASDAQ: ACIA) raised $103.5 million in its IPO in May. That remains the Boston area’s only tech IPO of 2016. Meanwhile, San Francisco-based software firm Twilio went public in June, raising $150 million. And Redwood City, CA-based Talend, a data-integration software company, had a $95 million IPO last month, as did Seattle-based Impinj, a radio-frequency identification tech company, which raised $67 million. Acacia’s first quarterly report as a public company is expected Thursday. So it seems natural to ask whether the firm has much in common with other recent-IPO companies. “We are a different kind of animal,” says Murugesan Shanmugaraj, Acacia’s president and CEO. “We are more like Intel.” He’s talking about the fact that Acacia delivers hardware—specifically, optical networking modules that help wireless carriers and cloud infrastructure providers run data communications over long distances and between data centers. (The comparison also has to do with delivering silicon-based products, but we’ll get to that in a minute.) Acacia is also different from most newly public tech firms in that it has been profitable for the last two years (what a concept). The company reported profits of $13.5 million and $40.5 million in 2014 and 2015, respectively, on revenues of $146.2 million and $239 million. Acacia’s stock is currently trading at around $69 a share, which is triple its IPO price of $23. The company had 228 employees as of the end of the first quarter. Shanmugaraj In a recent interview, Shanmugaraj couldn’t comment on Acacia’s latest financial performance, citing the company’s SEC-mandated quiet period, but he shed light on some lessons learned from 30 years in the telecom industry, as well as his company’s strategy in optical communications—and why it’s important to the broader tech world. Acacia was founded in 2009 by Benny Mikkelsen, Christian Rasmussen, and Mehrdad Givehchi. The trio of engineers collectively had experience from Bell Labs (previously owned by Alcatel-Lucent), Mintera, and Sycamore Networks. Shanmugaraj joined Acacia in early 2010. He says he first met the founders over an espresso at the firm’s offices, in a building once occupied by Digital Equipment Corporation. Shanmugaraj, who goes by “Raj,” provided a business spark. He was coming from Alcatel-Lucent, where he had been vice president of business development in the optical networking division. Before that, he was CEO of Astral Point Communications, which was bought by Alcatel in 2002. Shanmugaraj bonded with the Acacia founders over their experiences in telecom—and their vision for the new company. Acacia saw an opportunity to “siliconize” optical communication systems—meaning bring the benefits of the silicon chips at the heart of computers and electronic devices to the field of photonics. The idea was to make optical interconnect equipment (such as line cards and circuit boards) faster, smaller, more energy-efficient, and easier to build. The applications could be in everything from big telecom providers’ networks—think Verizon and AT&T—to Web infrastructure companies like Amazon and Google and their ever-growing data centers. Silicon photonics has been a hot research area since the early 2000s. But it took many years for technical hurdles to be cleared and for the commercial market to develop. “Optical networking is a difficult space. It’s quite lumpy and there are lots of big players, but we did a lot of right things,” Shanmugaraj says. “We built credibility right away. That’s hard to build, and easy to destroy.” Still, he says, “we knew this was going to be a bit of a slog.” Shanmugaraj and his team had lived through the telecom crash of 2001-2002. “We saw the goods and the bads,” he says. “We learned … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Gregory T.

Posted on August 10, 2016 By Drew Robb Tweet When it comes to enterprise SSD, there's nothing simple. Oh, for simpler times. When enterprise flash started to gain ground in the storage world around seven years ago, the available format was the solid state drive (SSD). It was neatly manufactured to fit into the disk slot of a storage array. But since those blissful bucolic beginnings, complexity has reigned. As well as SSDs, we now have so many labels for flash-based storage. This includes PCIe-based flash, custom flash modules (CFM), NVMe-based SSDs, server-based flash, storage-attached flash, network-attached flash, memory channel-attached flash, SAS SSDs¸ SATA SSDs, Fibre Channel (FC) SSDs, and even Data Center SSDs – and then there are all flash arrays (AFA) and hybrid flash arrays (HFA). And of course there are the many types of flash itself to further complicate matters. “Flash is permeating the enterprise through several different deployment architectures that include both server- and network-based approaches,” said IDC analyst Eric Burgener. “Flash deployments at scale will allow enterprises to reap not only performance benefits of flash but secondary economic benefits such as fewer devices to meet storage performance requirements, reduced energy and floor space consumption, fewer servers needed to drive storage performance and lower software licensing costs.” Each analyst and company, however, seems to define things slightly differently or favor one form factor over another. So what is the best enterprise SSD format? Greg Schulz, an analyst with StorageIO Group, explained that part of the confusion may be due to a subtle shift in the definition of SSD from solid state drive to solid state device, in some cases. Some people hold firmly to the drive definition, while others favor the looser device concept. Sticking with SSDs as solid state drives for now, the plus of that architecture is that it fits snuggly into time-honored storage array designs, and can take advantage of existing controller architectures. This simplifies the design and manufacturing process. However, this approach can bottleneck the performance potential of flash. The other main approach is to bring the flash closer to the compute as in CFMs, though there are several ways to do this as covered in the complex terminology outlined above. The CFM typically has its own controllers and is built on some kind of card to slot into a motherboard, for example. The goals are to maximum the performance and eliminate the bottlenecks that may exist in other enterprise SSD designs. “Location matters, so you want to get as many solid state resources as close to your applications as possible,” said Schulz. “But to keep it cost effective, you may need to leverage SATA, and SAS SSD drives to satisfy your need for capacity.” Market Leadership and Innovation The many labels in circulation can make it difficult to determine who is the market leader in SSD. Jim Handy, General Director at Objective Analysis, outlined which vendors he reckoned were the leaders in some of the major categories. He said Western Digital’s HGST leads SAS SSD unit shipments, and probably also PCIe SSD (courtesy of its acquisition of SanDisk, FusionIO and Virident). Intel, though, is out on front on Data Center SSDs, though there definition is a little vague. While these leadership positions relate to the mainstream enterprise SSD marketplace, even this breakdown is being upended by rapid change and technological innovation. “There are a few budget providers who supply the bulk of the SSDs used in hyperscale applications, since hyperscale companies tend to be fixated on cost,” said Handy. He added that the market used to be broken down into two camps: PCIe and SAS for high speed at a high price, and SATA for better economy at a slower speed. Today PCIe flash is still more expensive than SATA, but this will be changing soon with the ramp of PCIe m.2 SSDs.  When it does, the rationale to use SATA will weaken, and over time PCIe will become the dominant interface for flash in computing, Handy said. Keeping with Tradition That said, innovation is also enhancing the performance of traditional SSD-based architectures. “The computing community is coming to the realization that a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) interface and an HDD software I/O stack is not a good way to manage flash, since it slows down flash’s performance,” said Handy.  “NVMe has been devised to handle the interface, and various software products and standards help to move past the bottlenecks in the software stack.” EMC, for one, uses standard form factor 2.5" SAS SSDs for its XtremIO flash platform.  “We do not have plans to pursue custom form factors in the future as we do not see an inherent advantage in them and prefer to benefit from a wide supplier base (similar to why EMC did not vertically integrate and make its own HDDs),”said Tamir Segal, Senior Manager, Product Marketing Core Technology Division of EMC. “The SSD form factor also has advantages in hot-swap serviceability and the ability to leverage common drive shelf hardware with other EMC products.” But EMC isn’t putting all of its eggs in one SSD basket. Other EMC products such as VMAX All Flash and Unity utilize different forms of SSD’s, but all are based on commodity SSD technologies available from the big manufacturers in this market. So what about PCIe? “PCI-E based flash will probably remain a niche product for caching purposes only,” said Segal. “But it’s the software that truly adds value.” Most vendors, in fact, tout the advantages of their own particular software architecture as the best enterprise SSD approach. Chris Tsilipounidakis, Manager of Product Marketing at Tegile, said his company combines a hardware and software design that optimizes highly randomized workloads by isolating metadata and logs into their own containers. Its metadata acceleration technique isolates and aggregates metadata away from user and application data onto dedicated logical flash devices with optimized I/O paths. This boosts performance as I/O is no longer gated by interspersing data with metadata. This also provides inline deduplication without a performance impact as the dedupe table also resides on dedicated logical flash devices. No Flash in the Pan Just about every vendor makes a convincing pitch for its particular flash architecture. But whatever the SSD format, the best advice is to test any flash storage product in your own environment to see how it does with your own applications and workloads. As for the debate over where exactly to put flash, Handy sees SSDs as belonging in the server, inside the storage array and being used in various configurations and form factors for some time to come. “Users are getting more savvy and are looking to put inexpensive SSDs into most of their systems as a way to reduce the need to go with more costly options: sharing a database across a number of servers, increasing the DRAM memory to the most a server can handle, or buying a new SAN,” said Handy. That’s why he brings attention to the fact that the largest growth market for SSDs is applications that don’t yet use them. While it may appear that everyone has turned to flash, the reality is that it is far from the case. Certainly, the market is booming, but there is plenty of room for growth. IDC estimates enterprise all solid state spending will exceed $1.6 billion this year, up from $0.3 billion in 2012. With the price coming down by more than fivefold in the last four years, IDC expects SSD growth to continue to grow steeply in all its many configurations, form factors and architectures. Indeed, there are many new areas of potential deployment still to open up. “To date, flash has not been used in secondary storage environments like backup, archiving, DR and content repositories – outside of limited use to cache metadata and indexes,” said Burgener.

(High Impact Photography/Getty Images/iStockphoto) BY Jeffery Tobias Halter DAILY NEWS CONTRIBUTOR Wednesday, August 10, 2016, 4:14 PM Last month, San Diego-based tech company Qualcomm agreed to pay a total of $19 million to settle a federal class action lawsuit in a gender discrimination settlement. In May, KPMG's Gender Discrimination Lawsuit expanded to over 1,000 employees. While terms and a settlement have not been reached, the amount of the class is currently at $400 million. In March, the district court denied Microsoft's motion to dismiss their gender discrimination case. These are real people, real companies and real money. The real question is, how, in 2016 can this still be happening? My sad, sudden realization: It’s time to dump Trump As it has just settled, let's examine the Qualcomm settlement. The case, which involved approximately 3,300 women, states that women at Qualcomm make less than men and were promoted less frequently than "the men who work beside them." Also at issue was the treatment of working mothers. The women said various policies, including 24-hour responsiveness and a culture that rewarded working late, basically penalized them for having caregiving responsibilities. The majority of gender discrimination cases are founded on three issues. Hiring 5 reasons to re-examine the use of the label ‘alcoholic’ Many organizations have very subjective HR processes. Your selection process, your performance management process, your succession planning process and your compensation strategy are all subject to bias and favoritism. People tend to hire, promote and reward people like themselves. Pay Inequity Many organizations fail to demonstrate transparency of their numbers because they know (or don't want to know), what the facts are. If you don't believe me, the solution to these two issues is very simple: Run the report and look at the data. Democratic Party platform includes $15 minimum wage Every CEO in the country can ask for a report and know in five minutes if there is gender inequity in their company. Unfortunately, most never ask the question. I am often asked to prove if gender inequity exists and I'll tell you I can't. Because I don't have access to your numbers. If a company has nothing to hide then let them go public with their information. During the past year, many large Silicon Valley firms publically stated that they are seeking to ensure gender and minority pay parity and are revisiting their policies and procedures to attract and retain greater diversity in their workforce. Just prior to Equal Pay Day in April 2016, Facebook and Microsoft announced that they have eliminated the gender pay gap — joining Google, Intel and Apple, who made similar announcements in recent months. Letitia James calls for fixing city's gender pay gap In June, as part of the United State of Women Summit, the White House introduced a new Equal Pay Pledge for private sector companies to share their commitment to equal pay — 28 companies signed on immediately, many of which were already taking steps on their own. To date, dozens have signed the pledge including, Accenture, Amazon, American Airlines, Cisco, Deloitte, Dow Chemical, Johnson & Johnson and PepsiCo. Additional businesses are encouraged to sign the pledge here. Fixing the pay gap with money is a step in the right direction — but offers a band-aid fix to a systemic problem that goes beyond wages. Culture The third issue is more daunting. Simply put, men and women are having different experiences in a company. If you don't believe me, just ask the women who work for your company in a genuine and sincere manner about the experiences they have every day — and then listen. What you will hear most of the time are not stories of overt sexism. What you will hear are stories of small, micro-bias that’s present in every workplace situation for women. For most women it's death by a thousand cuts. Recently, I did work for a group of women in a major R&D company. These 60 women (all with PhDs in biology and chemistry) were on a daily basis talked down to, talked over and asked to take notes and get coffee. What is also important to note is that women do not want to talk about this. Women want to be treated equitably and fairly. They wanted to be known and respected for the work they do and the contribution they make to the organization's goals and bottom-line. Nothing more, nothing less. How can companies demonstrate transparency? 1. Show the world your talent numbers. Publish openly your company's, recruitment, advancement and retention numbers. Are women being moved up at the same rate of men. If not, ask yourself the question why not? What are the root causes holding women back and are we addressing them? 2. Show the world your compensation numbers. No, you don't have to publish the actual dollar amunts. But show an index of where pay equity/inequity is. 3. Talk to women and find out the "genuine experience” they are having. This will take some digging because women do not want to tell you. If you seek to genuinely understand, the answers will surprise you. To be pragmatic, you can either choose to ask the questions now and address your company's gender inequity issues, or wait until you are ordered to. It's 2016 and the time to eliminate gender inequity is now. Transparency and root cause analysis are two of the major ways that Silicon Valley, and every company, can demonstrate real commitment to advancing women and diversity. Not only is it the right thing to do, it's what great companies choose to do. Jeffery Tobias Halter is a corporate gender strategist. The country's leading expert on engaging men to advance women, Jeffery is the President of YWomen, a strategic consulting company. The former Director of Diversity Strategy of the Coca-Cola Company, Jeffery has worked with leading companies including McDonald's, Deloitte, Publicis Groupe, GE and more.

Follow TechnoBuffalo It’s been a while since Microsoft announced any new Surface hardware, but the company is apparently cooking up a few exciting new products. A report from WindowsCentral offers a few details on the upcoming Surface Book 2 and the company’s rumored all-in-one PC. The upgraded Surface Book will reportedly feature a redesigned fulcrum hinge to remove that weird gap between the display and keyboard when the laptop is closed. It’s also expected to pack Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processor, which will apparently launch later this year. We could see the Surface Book 2 unveiled as soon as this fall. As for the Surface AIO, Microsoft is allegedly testing three different size options: a 21-inch Full HD display, a 24-inch 4K display and a 27-inch 4K display. However, it’s unclear if the company will offer all three options or just one. WindowsCentral notes that the design is “elegant” and you’ll want to show it off in your living room. The report also briefly mentions the Surface Pro 5. It’s unclear if the fifth-generation device will actually launch this year, and if it does it could be a pretty minor refresh. That might include a Kaby Lake processor and a few other internal upgrades, but not much else.

A project called Deep Drive was created in the form of an alliance between car companies, software companies, and prestigious universities from the USA. The partnership is described as a rare moment of cooperation between automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Ford. The automakers have joined forces with technology companies like Samsung, Qualcomm, Panasonic, and Nvidia to empower students at Berkeley and Princeton, among others, to develop artificial intelligence technology for driverless vehicles. Google and Amazon are also involved, as are Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, and many others. The project is called Deep Drive, and it focuses on creating source code that will be used by autonomous cars to navigate day-to-day traffic situations. Evidently, the researchers must also think of ways to teach the system how to react in an emergency, as well as in inclement weather. The latest idea published by one of the teams involved is to use GTA V as a test environment. While the successful video game is not open source, it does allow the creation of mods, which can be utilized for various productions, including a self-driving car. The idea behind using GTA V for testing autonomous vehicles was to gain access to a virtual environment that simulates real life and its complex traffic situations. In the case of this game, the researchers focused on creating an artificial intelligence system that will allow the prototype to drive itself in urban areas at speeds above 25 mph. Humans can do this without significant effort, but existing technologies for self-driving cars oblige the driver to be ready to take the wheel at a moment’s notice, because the systems are not as advanced as artificial intelligence through direct learning, and a deep convolutional neural network could allow them. Thus, Deep Drive has created the first self-driving car for GTA V. Here’s a video of it below.

Beltline, in Grand Rapids. (Shandra Martinez | MLive) Print Email Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com By Shandra Martinez | smartinez@mlive.com The Grand Rapids Press on August 10, 2016 at 10:36 AM, updated August 10, 2016 at 1:52 PM comments GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Restaurateur Johnny Brann Jr is gaining such a reputation for his appetite for the latest high-tech features that he often gets calls to try new products from companies around the world. But it's an inquiry close to home that he is particularly excited to share with customers. His restaurant, Kitchen 67: An American Bistro, is the first in the Midwest to try out new wireless charging technology developed by Grand Rapids-based Gill Electronics. "Customers are going crazy over them," Brann said. "It's different and better. We like to have things that no one else has." The next generation of technology compliments the Michigan bistro's menu that boast the "best sandwich in America," making it one of a handful of restaurants in the country to offer customers wireless tabletop charging for phones and tablets. "Your guide to Grand Rapids Restaurant Week August 2016" State-of-the-art resonant TesLink wireless charging stations were recently installed by Grand Rapids-based Gill Electronics at the restaurant, at 1977 E. Beltline, near the Knapp's Corner Meijer store. "We wanted to have a West Michigan staple to see the real world application," said Larry Leete, head of Gill Electronics' sales, marketing and commercialization. The wireless chargers have applications in airport terminals, hotels, vehicles and other uses, and within the past several months have entered the hospitality and restaurant marketplace. The devices, installed underneath the restaurant's seven booth tables, let customers set their phones or tablets anywhere on the table, for instant charging while dining. The technology replaces the e-Coupled wireless power system developed by Amway subsidiary, Fulton Innovation, initially installed when Kitchen 67 opened five years ago. At the time, the Grand Rapids restaurant was the first in the country with a full-scale rollout of integrated wireless charging. Gills' technology is different from the Qi wireless system used by Fulton's products. The firm co-founded the AirFuel Alliance and co-developed the specification for this wireless power standard. Unlike Qi, TesLink has the capacity to charge up to three phones at one time. It can also power up laptops that carry the new Intel Skylake chip with "resonant capabilities." The technology creates a zone, rather than a spot. It also doesn't require tables to be retrofitted. A pad -- about the size of a thick iPad - is mounted underneath the table using screws, and takes about 15 minutes to install. Restaurateur Johnny Brann, Jr, (left) sits at a Kitchen 67 table with Larry Leete, head of the Gill Electronics' sales, marketing and commercialization.Shandra Martinez | MLive.com   The technology uses a frequency of 6.78 meghrz, a range that is between AM and FM radio waves. Last year, Gill became the first company to receive Federal Communications Commission certification for resonant wireless charging. "The through-surface system is tuned to penetrate solid surfaces so we can use the table as the charging surface without having to bore holes into them," Leete said. "This tuning needs distance between the receiver and transmitter to be effective. So, unlike charging pads where you can put the phone with a receiver directly on the transmitter, this system turns a commodity (a table) into something unexpected." Gill is testing the wireless charger at locations across the Midwest. A charging station sells for $206 at gill-electronics.com and the company is in talks to bring it to stores. Spun out of Gill Industries in 2013, the electronics firm quickly became a top global manufacturer of resonant wireless power technology, and is part of Alliance for Wireless Power, or A4WP. Gill acquired the resonant technology through the purchase of a Florida company in 2008. After developing and enhancing the technology, it was sold in 2011 to Qualcomm, a company that is embedding the technology into phones. The firm's 25 employees, who are mostly engineers, work out of a Grand Rapids office at 725 Bond St. They designed the charging stations, which are manufactured in China and Taiwan. Gill has been looking for ways to embed the technology into infrastructure. "We've been quickly bringing it to the market," Leete said. "We are the only ones doing this." People think of California as the driver of wireless charging technology, but it has been centered and developed in Grand Rapids, Leete said. Reaching out to Brann was an obvious choice because he is "the guy who knows technology." The third-generation restaurateur opened his 4,600-square-foot restaurant in 2011 after working with Apple and Verizon to create an innovative hub where good food and new technology intersect. Kitchen 67 is one of only three restaurants in the world with customizable High-Res LED ceiling tiles, usually used for concert backdrops, which allow for the changing of the dining room color scheme. Customers can also play with tabletop iPads, a wall-mounted iTunes DJ system that functions as a digital jukebox and a video conferencing table. Brann is always looking for the latest technology to share with his customers. "It's about reinventing your restaurant every day for the customer," he said. His approach to the business was highlighted recently in Inc. Magazine. In the column, Brann spoke about how Kitchen 67 often draws people from competitors who want to check out how the restaurant streamlines technology into the dining experience. "What's nice is that we get calls, from as far as Japan, asking us to try certain things," he told the national publication. "Technology partners are comfortable with us being the first to do something because we have the experience and background." The restaurant is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and until 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Sunday hours are 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. TesLink Overview from Gill Electronics on Vimeo.

Apple's 40-year legacy began with this 'Eureka' moment 0 Tech Culture by Jessica Dolcourt August 10, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jdolcourt Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works A lot's happened in 40 years. Back in 1976, co-founder Steve Wozniak built Apple's first-ever computer, the Apple I, after showing it off to a ragtag group of geeky misfits. Fast forward to 2016: Apple sold its billionth iPhone. That's an enormous achievement for a company that's become both status symbol and everyday icon. In the four decades since the Apple I, co-founder Steve Job has passed away, Wozniak has moved on to other pursuits, and Apple bumps along with the ups and downs of the consumer tech space it helped to so solidly forge. And to think, all that grew from the seed of this first "Eureka" moment. Enlarge Image The black-and-white photo from 1976 shows Steve Jobs (right) with co-founder Steve Wozniak. In the foreground Steve Jobs gives a talk in January 2010.Photo by James Martin/CNET This story that follows originally posted September 8, 2015. You may know Steve Wozniak as the nerdy sidekick behind Apple's late co-founder and charismatic leader, Steve Jobs. But without "Woz," there would be no Apple. And without the Homebrew Computer Club of Silicon Valley, introverted Woz may never have been motivated to show off, or even build, the very first Apple computer, the Apple I. Attending that first Homebrew meeting was, Wozniak remembers, "a 'Eureka' moment for me". It was a moment that would help change the technology landscape forever. The Homebrew club was a casual gathering of hobbyists, like Wozniak, who were interested in building their own computers. Its enthusiastic members traded the hardware, software and the ideas necessary to help kickstart today's billion-dollar PC industry and put a computer in virtually every home. In 1975, when Homebrew formed, computers of the era filled half a room and you had to be part of a university, military or think tank to use one for a few hours at a time. It was a meeting that grabbed my attention for life. Steve Wozniak Having a computer for your own, anytime-use, was a radical thought and technological challenge. Like now, a personal computer then meant extraordinary freedom: of information, of higher mathematical power (the "computing" part), of exchanging ideas. Computers then weren't just nerdy; they were also a political emblem that, for some, echoed the protests of 1960s and 70s social liberation movements. A year before Homebrew formed, a book called "Computer Lib" envisioned personal computers as emblems of social freedom, proclaiming "Computer power to the people!" Woz's interest may or may not have been more technical, but he was well aware that the idea of a personal computer could change the world. "I intended to blow [Homebrew members] away with how so few and affordable chips could make a computer," Woz said in an email to CNET. "I figured that all these people who spoke about changing society [through communication and education] would build their own for $300." Here, Wozniak geeks out about his first machines, what made him join the club, and why he'll never forget his first Homebrew meeting. Question: You attended the Homebrew Computer Club's very first meeting on March 5, 1975. What drew you to the club? Frankly, it was a stroke of luck for me. I didn't know what the club was really about. I was not aware of the Altair 8800 at all [the first personal computer, which sold to hobbyists in a kit]. I was not into the general microprocessors that made such machines possible. I had played with early microprocessor data sheets (4004 from Intel), and it was too limited to lead to a useful computer, but I had not kept up with microprocessors after that. My friend Allen Baum knew that I had built a home terminal with a keyboard and using my own TV to dial up and access the ARPAnet when there were only about six universities on it. That night the full image of the Apple I popped in my head and I knew that I'd have my own useful computer. Steve Wozniak Allen called and told me about a club that was into video terminals and the like. I figured that I'd take mine and be some sort of star there. I was also not aware that there had been another TV Terminal project in this hobby community, by Don Lancaster, and featured in Popular Electronics. But my design was very good. At the club the talk was about the Altair 8800, using the 8800 microprocessor. I felt shy and out of place, not knowing that this was the driving sentiment of these hobbyists. Nonetheless, it was a meeting that grabbed my attention for life. It was a Eureka moment for me. Since early college I had wanted my own computer, but it had to include a programming language, which meant at least 4K of memory and human input and output to type in programs, even if on punched cards. I had built a processor five years before this, of my own design, with switches to enter zeros and ones individually. This was what the Altair was. My machine had 256 bytes of solid state RAM (chips). It was the heart of a computer but not a really useful or usable one. The Altair was this stage of processor, basically right off the Intel data sheet. That's why it had static RAM, which was prohibitively costly for 4K bytes. But it was expandable in normal computer fashion. You could add a card of chips that would talk to a teletype, which cost as much as a car or two, for input and output. Basically, I'd been past this stage since high school. But these club attendees had tremendous interest in this 'starting' point machine. 12 PC greats come out for Homebrew Computer Club reunion (pictures) At the club meeting, a data sheet for the 8008 processor was passed out. I took this data sheet home and was shocked to find that the microprocessor had gotten to the point of being a complete processor of the type I'd designed over and over in high school. That night the full image of the Apple I popped in my head, and I knew that I'd have my own useful computer, [for] basically no money. I'd just add a microprocessor to my terminal, which had the human input and output. I'll never forget that first night. The Apple I was your baby, your pet project. What did it mean to you to have built this computer in a time when micro-computers were strictly a hobbyist activity? I'd been at the 'build-it-yourself' processor stage of the hobbyists for a long time. But I worked at HP [Hewlett-Packard] on calculators. Our calculators had a custom processor. When you turned the calculator on it began running a program that looked at what keys you pressed. That led me to the idea that my computer would start up running a small program that let you type data in, saving the entire front panel of switches and lights, which my Cream Soda computer (five years prior) had sported. This was the "voila" step. I wanted a computer as normal and human to use as a typewriter or calculator. I [passed] out my design, hardware and software, for free without any copyright or company intent. Steve Wozniak Once I had my design built and working, I brought it to the club. I was shy, but communicated with my technical projects, just like many "makers" do. I intended to blow them away with how so few and affordable chips could make a computer that could run a programming language without a lot of other expense or surplus connections. I even passed out my design, hardware and software, for free without any copyright or company intent. I figured that all these people who spoke about changing society (communication, education, importance of geeks) would build their own for $300 cost. Few took me up on that, maybe only one. The formula for the personal computer was out to anyone looking over my shoulder. Others would have hit on it eventually, but I was first in this sense of an affordable useful computer that worked for normal people. Every computer before this one had a front panel with switches and lights. Every computer after this one had a keyboard and video display. Steve Jobs was in another state and wasn't even aware of this computer until he came into town and I took him to the club to see what it was all about. What do you think the Homebrew Computer Club's legacy is today -- that is, what should the current generation know about the club? The Homebrew Computer Club represents that well-intentioned hobbyists and makers can truly change the world of technology. None of us had resources, like money. We were people who knew about computers and wanted our own, but we had no money saved. Our ideas meant a lot to us, but not to profit-driven companies. Today the Homebrew Computer Club is an inspiration to a lot of young people that their projects can kick off great markets when established businesses disdain them as hobbyists and tinkerers.

However, things may change later this year when Apple launches its 2016 MacBook Pro series. Detailing the alleged new features of the new laptops, a report casually mentions that some models will pack high-end Polaris graphics cards, which have been built to offer gamers cheap access to VR, at least on desktops. DON’T MISS: This has to be the prettiest poster ever designed on an iPad That said, it’s not clear what type of AMD Polaris graphics card will be found in the new MacBook Pro. “Apple is using one of AMD’s ‘Polaris graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook,” Bloomberg noted in a new report. The “high-performance graphics chip” from AMD will equip only one version of the upcoming MacBook Pro, the report says, suggesting that Apple will stick to its policy of only using more powerful graphics cards in some of its MacBook Pros. It’s unclear what company will provide the processor for the new MacBook, with Intel being Apple’s choice for previous models. Bloomberg did not only focus on the chips and graphics cards of the upcoming MacBook Pro. According to the report, Apple is preparing the most significant overhaul to the laptop line in over four years. The 2016 MacBook Pro should be thinner than existing models, but they won’t be tapered like the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook. Even so, they will have a smaller footprint and the case will have shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is slightly wider, and a secondary, likely OLED-based screen will replace the function key row on the keyboard. The new touchscreen is supposed to offer users fast access to context-aware shortcuts. Depending on the app on the screen, the secondary display will show shortcuts that fit the task at hand, such as media playing controls or shortcuts to some of the most frequent actions inside an app, like copy and paste. The new design also includes USB-C ports, and Apple may launch the MacBook Pros in iPhone colors, including gray, gold and silver. A fingerprint sensor will also be found on the new MacBook Pros, and will likely borrow the Touch ID features on the iPhone. Users will be able to unlock the laptop with their fingerprints and authenticate Apple Pay purchases online. The new computers have been in “advanced testing” inside Apple since earlier this year, and should be unveiled during a press event later this year — but not the iPhone keynote that’s reportedly scheduled for September 7th.

However, things may change later this year when Apple launches its 2016 MacBook Pro series. Detailing the alleged new features of the new laptops, a report casually mentions that some models will pack high-end Polaris graphics cards, which have been built to offer gamers cheap access to VR, at least on desktops. DON’T MISS: This has to be the prettiest poster ever designed on an iPad That said, it’s not clear what type of AMD Polaris graphics card will be found in the new MacBook Pro. “Apple is using one of AMD’s ‘Polaris graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook,” Bloomberg noted in a new report. The “high-performance graphics chip” from AMD will equip only one version of the upcoming MacBook Pro, the report says, suggesting that Apple will stick to its policy of only using more powerful graphics cards in some of its MacBook Pros. It’s unclear what company will provide the processor for the new MacBook, with Intel being Apple’s choice for previous models. Bloomberg did not only focus on the chips and graphics cards of the upcoming MacBook Pro. According to the report, Apple is preparing the most significant overhaul to the laptop line in over four years. The 2016 MacBook Pro should be thinner than existing models, but they won’t be tapered like the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook. Even so, they will have a smaller footprint and the case will have shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is slightly wider, and a secondary, likely OLED-based screen will replace the function key row on the keyboard. The new touchscreen is supposed to offer users fast access to context-aware shortcuts. Depending on the app on the screen, the secondary display will show shortcuts that fit the task at hand, such as media playing controls or shortcuts to some of the most frequent actions inside an app, like copy and paste. The new design also includes USB-C ports, and Apple may launch the MacBook Pros in iPhone colors, including gray, gold and silver. A fingerprint sensor will also be found on the new MacBook Pros, and will likely borrow the Touch ID features on the iPhone. Users will be able to unlock the laptop with their fingerprints and authenticate Apple Pay purchases online.

TITAN Software delivers leading performance and ultra-low latencies by tightly integrating NVMe SSDs with Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) Network Interface Cards (NICs) and efficient use of x86 server capabilities. The software delivers key capabilities such as accelerated application response times, efficient storage resource sharing, tiering, scalability, connectivity to existing SANs, and operational efficiencies that enable IT managers to dynamically provision NAND flash memory locally or remotely, and with centralized management. Advanced capabilities include storage caching, cluster management, and NIC support up to 100 Gbps speeds. The management software included within TITAN is a scalable REST API and GUI tools that enable IT managers to easily deploy and manage large clusters of NVMf storage. Presentations of TITAN software begin today at Flash Memory Summit 2016, in Mangstor's Booth #601, Santa Clara Convention Center, Santa Clara, California. FMS concludes on Thursday, August 11th. TITAN software provides a single web-based management interface for managing entire clusters of NVMf storage arrays. Centralized management enables easier and faster storage system configurability in the datacenter and the ability to manage these systems in a more reliable manner. The software supports multiple fabric options, including Mellanox RoCE (Ethernet) and Infiniband, as well as emerging RDMA fabrics such as Intel OmniPath. "Accelerated application response times are the big advantage of NVMf arrays as they deliver Read and Write latencies comparable with internal PCIe SSDs," said Ashwin Kamath, SVP Engineering for Mangstor Inc. "TITAN delivers sustained performance of millions of IOPS, with latencies under 200µs, and an order of magnitude better than typical FC or iSCSI interfaces -- in fact, on the NX6320 2U supported platform, TITAN has been measured at up to 10x higher bandwidth and one-tenth the latency when compared to iSCSI and FC-based AFAs." NVMf arrays based on TITAN software scales to petabytes of capacity and hundreds of GB/s as arrays are added with virtually no increase in latency. As more capacity or performance is needed, arrays can simply be added as required. Latency is consistently low, similar with local SSD access times at low IOPS levels due to the optimized RDMA network, and remains low up to millions of IOPS. NVMf storage arrays are an ideal solution for data-intensive storage, latency-sensitive applications and real-time analytics and the first available storage array solution for the newly released NVMf specification. TITAN is now available for OEM customers and storage provider partners worldwide. The NX-Series Storage Arrays are available through Mangstor's worldwide sales channel of distributors, resellers, system integrators and manufacturing representatives. Product information is available at www.mangstor.com. Sales and pricing information is available at sales@mangstor.com. All trademarks, registered trademarks, and/or service marks, indicated or otherwise, are the property of their respective owners. About Mangstor Inc.

PrintCommentRecommend (-) By Christine Benz | 08-10-16 | 06:00 AM | Email Article On the hunt for a dividend-paying mutual fund or ETF? To help identify the right one for you, Morningstar's director of global ETF research Ben Johnson suggests separating the universe into two camps: growers and yielders. About the Author Christine Benz is Morningstar's director of personal finance and author of 30-Minute Money Solutions: A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your Finances and the Morningstar Guide to Mutual Funds: 5-Star Strategies for Success. Follow Christine on Twitter: @christine_benz. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists Dividend-growth-focused funds (the "growers") don't have the lushest yields around; in most cases their dividend yields are below that of the S&P 500. Paying out at least some yield keeps such companies' managements disciplined and accountable; not overshooting on the yield front allows them to reinvest in their businesses.  Vanguard Dividend Growth , which recently announced its closure to new investors, has long been one of Morningstar's favorites among the "growers"; this article details some of Morningstar analysts' other favorites of that ilk. "Yielders," meanwhile, prioritize dividend yield; they can be especially good choices for retirees who are seeking current income from their investments. Higher-yielding stocks frequently operate in more mature businesses where paying out profits rather than reinvesting them is the more prudent avenue for shareholders. Such high-yielding stocks have historically clustered in the financials, energy, utilities, and industrial sectors, to name a few. But many technology firms have begun paying out or have increased their dividends in recent years; these days, it's not unusual to see the likes of  Microsoft and Intel in dividend-focused fund portfolios.  As compelling as investing for yield is, investors on the hunt for high-yielding equities should bear in mind a few important considerations. First, any equities--even high-quality companies with above-average dividend yields--are subject to much higher volatility than bonds and therefore shouldn't be used to completely supplant fixed-income investments. Yield-rich equities will often lose less than the broad market during downturns, but they'll still incur losses. Additionally, high-yielding stocks may well get knocked down a peg or two when bond interest rates jump up, as bonds present a more compelling alternative at such times. Finally, it's worth noting that dividend strategies won't typically be the most tax-efficient around. If you're holding them in a taxable account, you'll have to pay taxes on those dividends as you receive them; some yield-focused mutual funds also dabble in securities such as convertibles and REITs, the income from which is taxed at investors' ordinary income tax rates. (Since 2003, qualified dividends have been taxed at the same rate as long-term capital gains, currently 15% for most investors.) Those caveats aside, here's a closer look at Morningstar analysts' favorite higher-yielding stock funds and ETFs. Premium users can click  here to see a screen I ran to unearth traditional yield-focused mutual funds; note that some otherwise-solid yield-focused funds, such as  American Century Equity Income , didn't clear my modest, 2.5% yield hurdle, an indication of just how far dividend yields have fallen. Actively Managed Options  Allianz NFJ Dividend Value Category: Large Value  Analyst Rating: Silver 30-Day SEC Yield: 3.17% This fund combines dividends and attention to valuation: Analyst Leo Acheson notes that its price/projected earnings ratio is among the lowest of any large-cap value fund's. That strong value bias has crimped results recently; 2015 was a particularly weak campaign as stakes in retailers like  Macy's  and Wal-Mart Stores  weighed on results. Nonetheless, the fund's process has stood the test of time; Acheson notes that it has outpaced its peers and the Russell 1000 Value Index since its 2000 inception. The fund is available without a load or transaction fee on brokerage platforms such as Schwab's.  Vanguard Equity-Income Category: Large Value Analyst Rating: Silver 30-Day SEC Yield: 2.73% In the current era of incredible shrinking yields, this fund has an important advantage relative to other yield-focused equity funds: its ultralow expense ratio of just 0.26% for the Investor share class and 0.17% for the Admiral shares. That's a crucial benefit because a fund's expense ratio is deducted first from its yield and secondarily from any gains it makes; a lower expense ratio means a manager doesn't have to take outsized risks to deliver higher yields than competing funds. Wellington Management runs roughly two thirds of the portfolio, while Vanguard's in-house quantitative equity group manages the remainder. In contrast with the aforementioned Allianz fund, Vanguard Equity-Income has enjoyed soaring performance; those who believe in reversion to the mean (and every sober-minded investor should) will want to keep their near-term return expectations in check.  Index Funds/ETFs  Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF   Category: Large Value Analyst Rating: N/A 30-Day SEC Yield: 3.10% When it comes to yield-focused ETFs and index funds, Morningstar's director of global ETF research Ben Johnson describes this fund is "as good as they get." Available as either an exchange-traded fund  or traditional index mutual fund  with a slightly higher (but still ultralow) expense ratio, it tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. That benchmark encompasses higher-yielding stocks weighted by market capitalization, a construction method that gives the fund a greater focus on consumer-defensive stocks and an underweighting in financials names relative to other large-value vehicles. Like Vanguard Equity-Income, this fund's near-term results have been very strong, so investors would do well to approach it with realistic near-term return expectations.  Return to Discuss Securities mentioned in this article Ticker Price($) Change(%) Morningstar Rating Morningstar Analyst Report With Morningstar Analyst reports you can get our expert Buy/Sell opinions on over 3,900 Stock and Funds Christine Benz has a position in the following securities mentioned above: WMT WMT Find out about Morningstar's editorial policies.

Let's not forget the fact that you can buy M2 drives that will be cheaper too by the time and not limited by the SATA 3 interface. In 2020 you could combine two M2 drives in RAID and you'll get real performance for the OS.

Well you seem to forget that 3d xpoint will go after the server/enterprise market at first and not consumers. At that market ssds go even for 1-2$/gb right now so you can imagine how 5 times that will cost. Personally i believe the starting price will be between nand and ram prices or about 3-4$/gb     eddieobscurant View Public Profile Find all posts by eddieobscurant   (#15) Clawedge Maha Guru     Videocard: Intel HD 4600 Processor: Intel 4790s Mainboard: MSI H81M-PRO-VH Memory: 16GB HyperX Soundcard: Onboard PSU: Silverstone SFX ST45SF 08-12-2016, 11:16 | posts: 1,838 | Location: Earth 4 times the price, i would rather buy 4 ssds based on nand, than 1 xpoint drive.

For consumers, this will mean that a smartphone or tablet could rely on a larger battery because 3D NAND stacks data storage cells vertically instead of spreading them out horizontally like “planar” storage devices currently used in smartphones, tablets, and flash drives. In addition, 3D NAND technology will increase the storage capacity of these devices. Keep in mind that flat NAND storage will eventually run out of physical space. Thus, like humans, 3D NAND builds vertically to increase the “population” of memory cells, essentially packing more inhabitants within the same physical space as 2D NAND. Related: HP and SanDisk’s ‘Storage-Class Memory’ set to take on Micron and Intel’s 3D XPoint memory tech With the current NAND, manufacturers are cramming memory cells (houses) side by side on a single die (neighborhood). Eventually, companies will hit a wall in regard to how small these memory cells can get. That’s where the idea came about to begin stacking memory cells like a skyscraper. The further up they go, the larger the storage capacity. Just imagine a stack of floors with numerous offices on each one. With 3D NAND, there are numerous layers, and vertical “pillars” that intersect with each layer. A memory cell is created at each intersection of a layer and pillar, with each pillar supporting 32 memory cells vertically (there’s a 32-layer limit). These memory cells, which can be enlarged to increase capacity, don’t touch each other, limiting interference. To make this even more mind-boggling, each memory die contains more than four billion pillars. According to Micron, its new 3D NAND memory die is up to 30 percent smaller than the typical flat NAND die providing the same capacity. It measues just 60.217mm2, the industry’s smallest 3D NAND chip thus far. This technology can also be used in low-power LPDDR4X memory modules to provide up to 20 percent more energy efficiency than LPDDR4 memory. Micron said that its new 3D NAND for mobile is its first memory device using the Universal Flash Storage 2.1 standard that was published in March. It’s essentially a standard that defines a Universal Flash Storage electrical system and a Universal Flash Storage memory device, optimized for high performance and low power consumption. “As mobile devices bypass personal computers as consumers’ primary computing device, user behaviors heavily impact the device’s mobile memory and storage requirements,” the company said. “Micron’s mobile 3D NAND addresses these concerns, enabling an unparalleled user experience that includes seamless high-definition video streaming, higher bandwidth gameplay, faster boot-up times, camera performance, and file loading.” Due to the nature of 3D NAND, the subject has been a hot topic as of late. That’s because 3D NAND combines the capacity of a storage device with the speed of a memory module, eliminating the information bottleneck between the processor and storage device. That’s really exciting, and will likely provide developers and manufacturers the opportunity to create new experiences that just aren’t possible with today’s 2D NAND technology. Micron said that it is now providing samples of its new 3D NAND mobile technology to partners and mobile customers. The chips are expected to become “widely available” by the end of 2016.

Assistive and smart technologies can lead to a whole new world of creative possibilities and greater understanding of consumers If we want to create better, more personal experiences, it’s clear that AI technology must play a chief role in the research and design of brand experiences. Photograph: I Glory/Alamy Supported by About this content Anthony Baker tech director at R/GA London Wednesday 10 August 2016 03.00 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 10 August 2016 03.02 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have huge potential to drive a new generation of creative brand experiences. They are at the forefront of a powerful shift that will bring brands closer to consumer expectations, passions and emotions. Assistive and smart technologies are catching up and we’re already facing a new world of possibilities. AI and ML can be applied in many ways. The use of machine learning to power business decisions and product recommendations is becoming widespread. We experience it when we buy on Amazon, watch television on Netflix, hail an Uber or tag friends on Facebook. There are more creative experiments out there such as “The Next Rembrandt app”, “machine music composition” and “TV show script generation” that use ML to create new art (with mixed results). While AI is poised to transform our industries and technologies, just like electricity did in the mid-twentieth century, AI has the potential to change art, creativity and the way brands and agencies create the next generation of experiences. It’s easy to hear all the buzz and think of AI and ML as new or recent developments, but they have a long history. AI has been researched since the dawn of computing but in the past few years it has become more powerful, flexible and accessible. This is down to heavy investment from companies like Intel, Google, Apple and Facebook, leading to faster, cheaper hardware with better algorithms. The key to a successful machine-assisted experience is data. Converting big data into useful data is a difficult challenge. This is where agencies and brands have a huge opportunity. Netflix has been successful in making sense of consumer data, to the point that it now knows which shows and casts will become hits, before they have even been filmed. One big issue is that most of the data being captured isn’t smart. Often, it doesn’t reflect consumer interests and takes a lot of analysis (and sometimes plain guesswork) to come up with insights that drive strategy and creativity. Traditional web and mobile analytics don’t work as expected in a hyper-connected world. Demographics, page views, page clicks and hashtags are falling short in their exposure of true consumer learnings. Lifestyle, sentiment and engagement are the key elements to go after. Spotify has done this in innovative ways, marrying user habits like playlist creation with crowd-sourced behaviours to create personalised playlist suggestions. Brands want to understand how people feel about their services, products and content. So far, though, it seems we only have a partial view of consumers, not the full picture we aspire to. This is exactly where a new wave of interfaces will move the industry forward, away from a straight broadcast out with frivolous two-way interactions towards a more natural dialogue between brands and people. With the rise of new interfaces and interactions such as 1:1 messaging, voice-enabled services and natural language processing, we have a chance to reach a deeper understanding of consumers. Combine this with the constant growth of connected devices, and the opportunity to capture smart data from consumer interactions becomes huge. Data is the fuel of AI. According to Internet Live Stats, there are roughly 3.5 billion people with access to the internet, generating exponential amounts of data. And IDC believes we ll be creating 44 zettabytes of data worldwide by 2020. This data will become increasingly smarter, thanks to two main factors. First, more connected devices means we’ll need a more holistic view of consumer lifestyles. And second, the rise of messaging and conversational platforms such as WeChat, Line, Slack and Facebook will provide a stream of dialogue-based data. This will result in a new wave of smart data, empowering our industry to understand people on a whole new level. AI lets us understand complex interactions such as voice, text dialogues, pictures and videos in a more personalised way. Now we can classify interactions from consumers, and smart solutions can understand what a person is saying. When we recognise the intention and the sentiment of a human interaction, we can react to it accordingly. Is that person happy or frustrated about the service? Was the content delightful or bland? This is the kind of qualitative understanding that we can’t get through page views or clicks. Jay Zasa, also of R/GA, wrote a great piece, recently, about the challenge of creating meaningful bots and conversational services. Most importantly, machines can learn much quicker than humans. They constantly develop and improve over time, testing response, intent and sentiment to enhance the service on offer. They can solve the scalability problem, which has blocked truly personalised services for so long. Why would you go to a website and waste time searching for something if you could have a smart, machine-assisted personal service giving you what you need at the right time and place, on the right device or channel? After all, the ultimate goal is to create the simplest, most meaningful experience for consumers. Machines are not about to take over the world and lead the creative sphere, but if we want to create better, simpler, more personal experiences, it’s clear that AI technology must play a chief role in the research and design of brand experiences. AI could become the ultimate creative tool for brands and agencies, helping them build richer experiences with lasting value. There’s a unique element of creativity in all of us that machines are unlikely to replicate (at least for the time being). However, the landscape is moving towards a smarter, hyper-connected, ongoing dialogue between people and brands. Things are evolving fast and our industry can’t afford to hesitate. We need to use cognitive technology in new ways to boldly break the mould, creating experiences that aren’t one-off executions. Instead, they’ll be constantly improving and growing the brand-consumer relationship.

By Cho Mu-Hyun | August 10, 2016 -- 06:15 GMT (23:15 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Huawei will launch its 2-in-1 PC MateBook in South Korea starting Thursday, the company announced at a launch event in Seoul. The Matebook was unveiled at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. The launch of the first notebook by the Chinese company firms its focus on the South Korean telecom equipment and mobile phone market. Huawei previously launched its Y6 budget smartphone and sold telecom equipment in South Korea, but had never launched any flagship products in the market until now. The Matebook, a competitor to Microsoft's Surface brand, is powered by Intel's sixth-generation M series processor, and packs 4GB to 8GB of RAM and 128GB to 256GB of storage, depending if it's a M3 or M5 model. It weighs 640 grams and is 6.9 millimetres thick. Huawei will initially sell the notebook online though 11th Street, T-Mon, and SSG.com. The M3 will retail for 889,000 won, while the M5 will sell at a recommended retail price of 1.299 million won, relatively cheaper than competing models by Samsung, LG, and Microsoft. In April, Samsung launched its 2-in-1 Notebook 9 Spin in South Korea. Huawei, however, has yet to make a splash in the local consumer market, despite being one of the biggest provider of telecom equipment to local mobile carrier LG Uplus. In smarpthones, South Korea is dominated by homegrown conglomerate Samsung. Despite being small, South Korea serves as a good test bed for IT firms due to its high internet and wireless penetration rate. Huawei recently filed a lawsuit against the South Korea tech giant for patent violation in both the United States and China. Samsung filed a counter suit in July.

We all need some kind of consistent digital identity (think virtual ID “card”) that can identify and authenticate us not only to all our devices, but to all our online services, commerce and banking accounts, and essentially anywhere where we need to digitally, or even physically, verify who we are. Actually solving that problem, it turns out, is pretty hard. For one, any kind of digital identity solution needs to be platform and device independent. Sure, it’s fine to be able to swipe into your phone with a fingerprint reader, but most people own more than just a smartphone, for example and, in many cases, they run different on different platforms. Plus, merely logging into the device doesn’t transfer your credentials to all the password-protected websites you use, services you log into, etc. Sure, there’s been some useful improvement in this area over the last few years, but we’re still a long way from the nirvana of what I like to call a portable digital identity. Think of a portable digital identity as something akin to a digital passport that could not only identify you to known locations, but unknown situations as well. Want to be able to get immediate access to your Spotify account while using grandma’s PC? As long as she has internet access, no problem. One of the most obvious benefits of this type of digital ID would be the eventual abolition (at least, in theory!) of passwords. We all know how horrendously broken the concept is and the amount of money, time and effort wasted—not to mention the incredible amount of frustration they regularly generate—is now measured in extraordinarily large numbers, both for individuals and companies. Recently, there have been a number of important steps made toward achieving more universal digital identities. Key among them is the work done by industry organization the FIDO Alliance, whose members include Microsoft, Google, Intel, Qualcomm and Samsung, among many others, but noticeably lacks Apple. Last fall, the organization submitted their FIDO 2.0 Web APIs to the W3C internet standards body as part of an effort to allow digital identity and authentication credentials to be passed from device to device and device to website. Essentially, this will enable people to leverage technologies like biometrics—using fingerprints, face recognition, iris scanning (like on Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 7), and more—to not only identify you to the local device, but to other devices as well. Even better, it will enable apps, websites and other services to seamlessly recognize you via that same identity verification. Once it’s widely adopted, this could be the ultimate “friction-removing” technology. These Web APIs should be able to dramatically change how quickly and easily we use web services, make online transactions, and much more, all while dramatically decreasing the potential for fraud and identity theft. The Fido 2.0 Web APIs should be able to dramatically change how quickly and easily we use web services, make online transactions, and much more, all while dramatically decreasing the potential for fraud and identity theft. Microsoft provided an early version of support for these standards in the enhanced version of Windows Hello that’s built into the new Anniversary Update of Windows 10. In fact, Microsoft is supporting what they call the Windows Hello Companion Device Framework to allow external devices, such as wearables or other Bluetooth-equipped devices with biometric sensors, to enable biometric security not only to devices that don’t have it, but to extend that level of verification to any sites or services which support FIDO 2.0. Of course, the security questions about how this all works and how effective it will really be in the real world have been debated quite a bit. While it’s impossible to say that it’s hack-proof, the good news is that the entire effort has been built with worst-case scenarios in mind. The technology used to enable the security can be very complex, but there are a few basic concepts worth mentioning. To start, all these efforts begin with a hardware root of trust on any end user device, such as a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), or some other kind of digital security chip, that is physically isolated from the main processor and OS. Leveraging virtualization or similar software isolation technologies, the information used to identify and verify you is encrypted and kept separate from main memory, making it extremely difficult to get access to. In fact, in most situations, it would require physically tapping into the device, which greatly reduces the risk threat in most situations. Plus, that identifying information isn’t directly passed along, but instead is only used to start the process of verification. The net result is that highly personal biometric information is not only extremely hard to acquire, but can’t be used to directly tap into an account in the same way that a stolen password potentially can. Even with all these efforts, we’re several steps away from a truly standardized, universal digital identity, but it’s clear that we’re much closer to the goal than even just a year ago. By later 2016 or early 2017, the W3C is likely to approve the FIDO 2.0 Web APIs and that’s bound to create some strong momentum around these extremely important standards. Your portable digital identity is nearly here. Bob O’Donnell is the founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC a technology consulting and market research firm.

I am a owner of a Samsung Chronos 7 (NP780Z5E) notebook with a switchable graphics of Intel HD400 and AMD Radeon HD 8770M graphics card. My previous update on the video drivers were AMD Catalyst 15.11.1 beta driver from November 2015. In the Catalyst program, it says my card is actually a R9 M200x series card, which I probably think it's the same card as I game with no problems with this driver. So I've been playing games with it fine during the past months and I'm looking to update it. I went to download the "Autodetect Utility" program from AMD and it says I should download "Crimson 16.7.3" update for my Windows 8.1 64bit. I went ahead and tried to install it, but there's always an error as the display driver fails to install. After trying to install it 2 times with errors, I decided to revert back to the "Catalyst 15.11.1 Beta" drivers. My thoughts are that it probably has something to do with my switchable graphics option that wouldn't allow the Crimson driver to install. Does anyone know of a good driver that I can download from Guru3D that isn't Crimson 16.7.3, but also new than my driver from November 2015 that works on my laptop?

By Mariel Peralta Aug 9, 2016 | 3:36 AM The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to finally release in 2017. Fans cannot wait to try the device and see how it fairs with the upcoming iPad Pro 2. The tablet was supposed to be released last June, but Microsoft had it delayed since they are waiting for Intel's new Kaby Lake processors. The chips won't be released until the end of 2016 and that is why the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has over 6 months of delay. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date, News The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 follows its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4, which was launched in October 2015. Vine Report added that the hybrid tablet was delayed to sync with the release of Windows 10's newest update called Redstone 2. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit While other tech companies like Apple and Samsung follow an annual release schedule, Microsoft isn't really as consistent. The company's launch date cycles are dependent on the progress of their devices. Fans and critics already expect that Microsoft won't follow a schedule and a forecast is difficult to make. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Specs, Price The Surface Pro 5 is reported to have a 4K Ultra HD screen and a USB Type-C port, according to Tech Times. The Bitbag added that the device may also house a 32GB RAM and a 1 TB SSD storage. Apple Counters with iPad Pro 2 The Bitbag reported that Apple will be countering the Surface Pro 5 with their upcoming iPad Pro 2. The device will also launch in 2017 and will come with the new A10x processor. The outlet cited some sources online; specifically, a Chinese supplier that revealed that iPad Pro 2 will ship with an iOS 10. The iPad Pro 2 will no longer have a headphone jack, which is rumored to be the same for the iPhone 7, Mirror reported. Additionally, the tablet will have a 64GB version that will come with an Apple Stylus Pencil and a Smart Keyboard. Do you think the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and the Apple iPad Pro 2 will go head to head among tablet users and critics? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

McAfee has its headquarters for its operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in Cork and numbers employed at the Irish base increased from 338 to 344 last year In February 2011, Intel agreed to buy McAfee's global operation for $7.68bn (€5.6bn) in cash in an effort to boost its security offerings. The directors state that the firm's gross margin decreased from 6pc to 3.5pc as McAfee's compensation arrangements were aligned with Intel transfer pricing policies. In a shake-up of the structure of the firm, the company's parent, McAfee European Holdings Ltd, transferred its holding in the company to a fellow group company, Intel Shannon Ltd. The figures show that McAfee Ireland recorded a gain of €5.7m arising from a disposal of McAfee (Bejing) Security Software Co Ltd to a connected firm. The firm's spend on R&D during last year totalled €5.37m compared to €9.97m in 2014. The profit last year takes account of foreign exchange losses of €2.13m. McAfee - which established its Irish operations in 2004 - provides a series of security solutions include anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-spam and intrusion prevention. The profits last year resulted in the firm having accumulated profits of €69.8m with shareholder funds standing at €71.6m. The company's cost of sales increased from €272.6m to €349m, while its administrative expenses fell from €122m to €100m. The accounts show that the company's operating profits decreased by 35pc from €25m to €16m. The firm's interest receivable last year increased going from €184,166 to €674,198. The profit was recorded after a non-cash depreciation charge of €741,194. An analysis of the company's turnover shows that €247m was generated in EU countries with €219m in Non-EU countries. The figures show that the numbers employed by the firm last year increased from 338 to 344 with 119 engaged in sales and marketing; 125 in technical support with the numbers in administration at 100. Staff costs last year reduced from €26.4m to €13.4m as a result of the company restructure. After paying corporation tax of €696,733, the firm recorded post tax profits of €21.89m. Remuneration for directors reduced from €728,951 to €252,075.

PDT August 09, 2016 A new housing development is being built in an area called South Hillsboro (Photo: Nina Mehlhaf) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HILLSBORO, Ore. -- Hillsboro is on track to replace Gresham as Oregon's fourth largest city, as it broke ground Tuesday on a historic new housing development. It's the biggest one in Oregon history, enough for an extra 20,000 people to live. The area is being called South Hillsboro, and it borders Tualatin-Valley Highway, Southwest 209th Avenue and Rosedale Road. Map of South Hillsboro   (Photo: Nina Mehlhaf) The old farm land was bought 10 years ago by developers ready for this project but hit a financial stall after recession. Now the 1,400 acres are going to be turned into 8,000 homes. It'll take 20 years to finish, but they'll go neighborhood by neighborhood. "This is almost unbelievable, it's been so long," said Mayor Jerry Willey. The reason why? Getting the economy going again to sustain the $450 million investment to build out sewer and water lines, roads and new schools. "I think, just like the region, Hillsboro has a severe housing shortage so if we want people to live, work and play in the same place, we've got to be able to provide housing to do that," said Willey. "We want to enable people, if they want to ride their bike to Intel, or SolarWorld or Genentech or Nike, they'll be able to do that, so that's going to be the benefit." Early renderings show the big ideas. A mile-long greenspace of storm ponds, 15 miles of trails, 286 acres of parks, with clusters of housing of all types: duplexes, townhouses, apartments, affordable homes all the way up to million dollar estates. They're hoping for a 2018 Street of Dreams. Some neighborhoods within the project will have a community swimming pool and recreation center. Map of South Hillsboro   (Photo: Nina Mehlhaf) "To have an opportunity to develop on this scale, is unprecedented in this market because it's a land-constrained market," said Jesse Lovrien, Vice President of Operations for Newland Communities, the same company that built Vancouver's Fisher's Landing development. They are building out the streets and infrastructure for home lots that builders will then purchase to build the homes. Portland is bursting at the seams. But with so much industry in Washington County, instead of those workers driving out to Hillsboro, the development gives them a chance to live there. "I have really mixed feelings," Deanna Strauss said. Strauss, along with about 10 others on her street, have sold their properties to these builders for big bucks. Their houses will be torn down to make way for this new South Hillsboro community. "I think it is sad to see things fill up with homes, but I understand when you bring the Intels and the large corporations, people want to live here and work here and they have to live somewhere and you have to be realistic," Strauss said. This project will also mean an expansion of transit lines and bike lanes. The first new homes will go up for sale in the Reed's Crossing neighborhood within South Hillsboro in 2018.

Intel is ramping up its efforts in the small but fast-growing artificial intelligence space with the acquisition of 48-person startup Nervana Systems, which has been developing software and hardware technologies for machine learning. Intel officials announced the chip maker's plans to acquire the San Diego, Calif.-based company Aug. 9, a week before their Intel Developer Forum (IDF) kicks off next week in San Francisco. No financial details were released, though news site Recode cited anonymous sources who put the price tag at more than $350 million. The acquisition strengthens Intel's position in an artificial intelligence (AI) space that is expected to expand rapidly in the coming years as the internet of things (IoT) grows, with company officials predicting more than 50 billion smart, connected devices worldwide by 2020 and continuing to increase after that. Intel's Xeon processors run more than 90 percent of the servers in data centers globally, but the company is now looking to become a larger player in the areas of AI and machine learning. It's a market that a broad array of tech vendors are making hard pushes into. That includes GPU maker Nvidia, which has made AI a central part of its future strategy, and other chip companies, such as IBM and its Power and OpenPower efforts and ARM and its range of chip-making partners. AI technology already is in use today, from fraud detection and photo tagging to self-driving cars and precision medicine, according to Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group. "Encompassing compute methods like advanced data analytics, computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning, artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and how people engage with the world," Bryant wrote in a post on the company blog. "Machine learning, and its subset deep learning, are key methods for the expanding field of AI." Nervana already has a software and hardware stack that is fully optimized for deep learning, and the company's "IP and expertise in accelerating deep learning algorithms will expand Intel's capabilities in the field of AI," she wrote. "We will apply Nervana's software expertise to further optimize the Intel Math Kernel Library and its integration into industry standard frameworks," Bryant wrote. "Nervana's Engine and silicon expertise will advance Intel's AI portfolio and enhance the deep learning performance and TCO of our Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi processors." Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy, said the acquisition of Nervana is an important move in a market that he said represents a crucial inflection point in the tech industry. "It moves them in the right direction," Moorhead told eWEEK. "I'm a lot more comfortable in their future in AI and machine learning, but there's a lot of execution that needs to be done." There essentially are two key parts of machine learning: training (where neural networks are taught such things as object identification) and inference (where they use this training to recognize and process unknown inputs). Neural networks used for training are large, and most training is done on Nvidia GPUs. The inference networks are smaller, and most of that work is done on CPUs from Intel. The chip maker wants to be a larger player in both areas, and the Nervana acquisition—combined with its Xeon, Xeon Phi and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips—gives them the chance to make that push, Moorhead said. "That's a benefit of being a big company," he said. "You can make these massive investments."

The model also sports dual-band concurrent 802.11ac WiFi, support for IP voice, and an option for MoCA 2.0, a platform for speedy home networking that’s optimized to run on in-home coax networks.   While that ensures that Humax’s product is interoperable with D3.1-based network gear, certification also clears the product for retail sale. MSOs typically require CableLabs certification for modems they lease to high-speed Internet subs.   Per the most updated list of CableLabs-certified products, a D3.1 chipset/reference design from Intel Corp. was also certified in wave 117. Several products with Broadcom silicon have already been certified for DOCSIS 3.1.   Other modem makers that have cleared the D3.1 hurdle include Arris (for a model tagged for retail distribution), along with Askey, CastleNet, Netgear, Sagemcom, Technicolor, and Ubee Interactive.   "With its improved spectral efficiency, DOCSIS 3.1 technology is helping MSOs meet the growing speeds demanded by end users including 1 Gbps and beyond. We're delighted to have obtained DOCSIS 3.1 certification for the HG3310 and are offering it for sale worldwide,” Frank Romeo, SVP of business development at Humax Americas, said in a statement.   Humax and other vendors are getting certified amid the early phases of MSO D3.1 deployments.   Among recent examples, WideOpenWest plans to launch D3.1-based gigabit services in five markets by the end of 2016. Comcast, which is leaning on Technicolor models in the early phases of its D3.1 rollout, has consumer trials underway in Atlanta and Nashville underway, with plans to expand its DOCSIS 3.1 footprint to Chicago, Detroit and Miami later this year.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Could Microsoft’s rumoured Surface all-in-one PC have a 3D camera? 2 by Surur  @mspoweruser Aug 9, 2016 at 19:49 GMT4 months ago Microsoft is reportedly working on an all-in-one device under the Surface brand for  Q3 2016 with some rumours that the device will be announced soon. The rumour states: The Surface AIO PC is apparently an alternative for Microsoft’s second-generation Surface Book, which will be delayed to the first half of 2017 instead of the original schedule set in the second half of 2016 due to delayed shipments of Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs, said the sources. Of course All In One PCs have never been very popular in the Windows world, unlike Apple’s PCs, since Windows users do not tend to see their computers as a form of high-end furniture. To capture the same kind of high-end and high spending buyers on the Windows end the Surface AIO may need some kind of gimmick. On the Surface it is the detachable keyboard and Windows Hello camera, and we suspect on the All in One side it may be a 3D camera similar to HP’s Sprout AIO PC. Microsoft Research has shown cheap stereo infra-red cameras and infra-red lights (similar to the Iris scanner in the Lumia 950) plus a reflective pad called Floodlight can produce some very sophisticated data which can replace a touch pad, stylus and finger tracking in 3D. See this demoed in the 2013 video below: With Microsoft intent to move beyond the mouse and keyboard paradigm for computing, we think it is very likely Microsoft’s All In One will be more than a screen with built-in PC.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Review: Asus’ $700 Zenbook Flip isn’t quite worthy of the laptop it replaces Trackpad woes and a lesser screen ruin one of the best midrange laptops. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 9, 2016 8:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 24 Andrew Cunningham Asus Zenbook Flip UX360CA. Andrew Cunningham Asus Zenbook Flip UX360CA. Andrew Cunningham The 360 degree hinge is similar to the one that first appeared in Lenovo's Yoga series. Andrew Cunningham One of these screens is more reflective than the others. Zenbook Flip on the left, UX305C on the right. Andrew Cunningham The lid is still decent-looking brushed metal. Andrew Cunningham Right side, Zenbook Flip on the top and UX305C on the bottom. Headphones, micro HDMI, USB Type-C, USB Type-A, and power. Andrew Cunningham Left side. USB Type-A, card reader, volume rocker, and power button. Andrew Cunningham The keyboard is still good. Andrew Cunningham But the trackpad, despite meeting Microsoft's Precision Touchpad requirements, is problematic because the base of the laptop flexes so much. Asus’ ZenBook UX305C was almost a perfect midrange laptop, at least by my estimation. The cheaper models were missing extras like touchscreens or backlit keyboards and they weren’t as fast as Dell’s XPS 13 or the MacBook Pro, but they offered enough speed for most people and Asus got a lot of stuff right: $700 for a 1080p IPS screen, a sturdy build, a decent keyboard and trackpad, and a respectable 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. There are better laptops and there are cheaper laptops but that one sat right at the intersection of both. Asus’ follow-up to the UX305C is a slightly different riff on the same idea. The Zenbook Flip UX360CA (hereafter Zenbook Flip or just Flip) still uses Intel’s Skylake Core M processors, still includes 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, still uses a 1080p screen, is still really thin, and still starts at $700. But it’s got a Lenovo Yoga-style 360-degree hinge and a standard touchscreen, turning what was once a basic laptop into a basic laptop that can pretend to be a tablet. A lot of what I liked about the old Zenbook design is still here, but a few things have been improved and, sadly, a few things have gotten worse. Look and feel: That flippin’ hinge Specs at a glance: Asus Zenbook Flip UX360CA Screen 1920×1080 at 13.3" (166 PPI) OS Windows 10 x64 CPU 900MHz dual-core Intel Core m3-6Y30 (Turbo up to 2.2GHz) RAM 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 (non-upgradeable) GPU Intel HD 515 (integrated) HDD 256GB or 512GB SATA III solid-state drive Networking 867Mbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.1 Ports 2x USB 3.0 Type-A, 1x USB 3.0 Type-C, micro HDMI, SD card reader, headphones Size 12.71" × 8.66" × 0.54" (322.8 mm × 220 mm × 13.7 mm) Weight 2.86 lbs (1.3 kg) Battery 54Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $699.00 Price as reviewed $799.00 Other perks Webcam The Zenbook Flip looks a lot like the old Zenbook at first glance: same burgundy-ish metal body, same multitouch trackpad and chiclet keyboard, same 13.3-inch screen surrounded by a large bezel. Look closer, and you’ll notice the differences. The laptop is slightly thicker throughout, probably to make room for the larger hinge mechanism. One pleasant side effect is that the bottom of the lid no longer rests on your desk when the laptop is open, risking possible damage both to the laptop itself and to whatever surface it’s sitting on. All four rubber feet are making contact with the table at all times, which also makes the laptop more stable while typing. The port layout has been changed, too. The UX305 had three full-size USB 3.0 Type-A ports, a full-size SD card reader, a micro HDMI port, and a headphone jack. The Zenbook Flip has two USB Type-A ports, a full-size SD card reader, a micro HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a single USB Type-C port. The power button and a volume rocker also migrate to the side of the laptop to make them easier to reach when you're using it as a tablet or convertible. As Type-C ports go, this one is sadly underutilized. It can’t charge the laptop—Asus ships the Flip with a power brick identical to the one that came with the UX305—nor can it support DisplayPort or other output via the USB Alternate Mode spec. This means that 60Hz 4K external display support over a single cable isn’t possible (the HDMI 1.4 spec can push 4K but not at 60Hz). I like USB Type-C and I’m glad to see it creeping into more products, and this early into the Type-A-to-Type-C transition I can understand and even approve of Asus’ decision to include a couple of Type-A ports. I just wish that the Type-C port in the Flip was doing everything we know a Type-C port can do. Adding a touchscreen to the laptop has a couple of side effects. The old non-touch Zenbooks had a matte LCD screen, something that is becoming increasingly rare as more laptops pick up touchscreens and glass coatings. The glass on the Zenbook Flip is much more reflective, and it doesn’t appear to be mitigated by any sort of anti-glare coating like the ones Apple uses on its MacBooks and MacBook Pros. There’s also a small air gap between the glass and the LCD panel underneath, which makes the contrast look lower and the colors less vibrant than they were on the older Zenbooks. The air gap and the high reflectivity make it difficult to see the screen outdoors. It’s an IPS display with great viewing angles and it still looks better than the vast majority of the display panels you’ll find on most $500-and-below laptops, but it’s still a small step in the wrong direction. If you want to be able to use the laptop as a big tablet—either in “tent” mode with the base of the laptop as a kickstand or with the screen folded all the way against the base, both of which will prompt a switch into Windows 10’s tablet mode and disable the keyboard and trackpad—the Yoga-style 360-degree hinge is stable and works well. The touchscreen works fine, and I didn’t have any problem with responsiveness or accuracy. It doesn’t get in the way if you just want to use the Flip as a regular laptop. Especially since Windows 10 re-prioritized the desktop and de-emphasized touch, I don’t see touch as an essential feature in a Windows laptop, but it’s here if you want it and it doesn’t add anything to the price. The keyboard is still just as good as it was in past Zenbooks. Key spacing and travel are good, and the matte plastic keys feel nice to type on. The lack of a backlight continues to be its only shortcoming relative to the keyboards that Apple, Dell, and HP use in their nicer laptops. And the speakers mostly sound pretty good, though their positioning on the bottom of the laptop is awkward—you'll block them with your legs if the computer is on your laptop, though they otherwise sound fine. The main disappointment is the trackpad. The pad itself is OK—in fact, it’s one of Microsoft’s Precision Touchpads, which means that finger tracking is accurate and it fully supports all of Windows 10’s useful multi-touch window management gestures. The problem is the amount of flex in the palmrest, which bends based on downward pressure from your palms and, if you’re actually using the laptop on your laptop, upward pressure from your legs. The quest for thinner laptops means that they have less space to move than they used to. Companies like Synaptics and Apple have circumvented this in some of their products by introducing pressure-sensitive trackpads that don’t actually move (Apple’s is a good facsimile of a clickable trackpad; Synaptics’ not so much). But most PCs just use trackpads that don’t need as much space to move around in. In a sturdier laptop like HP’s EliteBook Folio G1, this isn’t a problem. But the Zenbook Flip flexes around enough that the trackpad can get moved into the “clicked” position by accident. Sometimes this means that clicks happen when you’re just trying to type. Sometimes this means that single clicks become double clicks or hold clicks. I got excited when I heard the Zenbook Flip would have a Precision Touchpad, but the way that touchpad has been implemented makes it annoying to use. There are no problems if you're using the laptop on a flat surface, and after a few days of using it you can make small adjustments to the way you sit and the way you rest your hands on the laptop to minimize the number of accidental clicks. But at its worst it makes the laptop infuriating to use and it’s really too bad that Asus didn’t catch this before bringing the Zenbook Flip to market. I have asked Asus if this is a problem unique to our review unit, but as of this writing I haven't heard back.

 Now it's Detroit's turn to rescue Silicon Valley Matthew DeBord Aug. 9, 2016, 2:29 PM 6,650 facebook linkedin twitter email print GM CEO Mary Barra and the Chevrolet Bolt EV. General Motors Five years ago, when the US auto industry was just beginning to recover from the Great Recession, there was widespread speculation that the old model of the car business was broken, and that only the new economy could come to the rescue. And with good reason. The US auto market had cratered, plunging from a peak of over 17 million to a devastated 10 million in yearly sales. General Motors and Chrysler had been bailed out by the federal government and gone bankrupt. Ford saw its stock price fall to less than $2 a share. Gas had spiked to over $4 a gallon in some parts of the country. Credit, the lifeblood of the car business, had been wiped out. Meanwhile, Apple was on a path to become the world's most valuable company. Facebook was taking over the media landscape. And Tesla, after suffering a brush with financial death in 2009, looked like the most innovative company on four wheels. Silicon Valley, and California in general, was suddenly filled with new and futuristic ideas about transportation, from Google driverless cars to numerous electric-car startups. Detroit, by contrast, was lurching toward the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history — it would come in 2013 — and its great automakers looked to be crippled dinosaurs, completely out of step with the times. The US auto industry was a problem to be solved, and Silicon Valley specialized in solutions. A doomed industry? "The automobile industry is in the middle of a fundamental transformation," wrote former Intel CEO Andy Grove in The Wall Street Journal in 2009. "There is a lot of information available on how companies have dealt with major changes in their business environments, but little is known about the transformation of entire industries." "History shows that most companies do not deal well with transformation," he continued. "One reason has to do with senior managers. They usually 'don't get it.' They have a difficult time accepting that the future will be vastly different from the present because they rose to power in the old business environment. They excelled in the old environment and didn't acquire skills necessary to operate in the new." Ford CEO Mark Fields. Reuters/Phil McCarten Fast forward to 2016 and the senior mangers in Detroit whom Grove worried about have deepened their engagement with Silicon Valley and the technology industry to an unprecedented degree. GM already had a venture-capital arm before it invested $500 million in Lyft and bought Cruise Automation for its innovative self-driving tech. Ford had such a solid connection with Microsoft that outgoing CEO Alan Mulally was discussed as a successor to Steve Ballmer. The company also put $182 million into software startup Pivotal earlier this year. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has teamed up with Google to create driverless minivans. And all the automakers have a Silicon Valley presence, which enables them to scout emerging technologies and act on them quickly. An auto-sales boom in the US, which started in 2013 and set a record in 2016 with 17.5 million new cars and trucks delivered, has fueled Detroit's engagement. Another factor is the broad realization among the carmakers' executive teams that this is their opportunity to disrupt themselves and profit from the experience. Cheap gas, an improving employment picture, and ample credit means that Detroit is selling pickups and SUVs and raking in cash. The game plan is to take some of those winnings and send them in search of rapid innovations that Motown can't create on its own. GM bought Cruise Automation in 2016. GM Not-so-smooth sailing At the same time, Silicon Valley has started to encounter some investor turbulence. Startups with hefty valuations don't see IPOs as a way to pay back their investors. That leaves getting acquired as an option, but a level of saturation with social networking and apps might have set in. The Detroit automakers aren't in the market for messaging apps, but they are looking for technologies that can future-proof them, or advance the process of making cars smarter. In conversations with people in the auto industry, there's a sense that the tech sector has begun to figure out that Motown has money and wants to spend it. The signals from the top are also strong. "We're going to disrupt ourselves, and we are disrupting ourselves, so we're not trying to preserve a model of yesterday," GM CEO Mary Barra said in a BI Interview in 2015. "And when you think of the assets the company has — the scale, the control of the vehicle platform, the ability with embedded connectivity, the knowledge we have of just every aspect of the vehicle and how we're putting it together now — I think there's a lot of plus signs, and we can lead." That attitude was echoed by Ford CEO Mark Fields, whom Business Insider also interviewed. "It's a very exciting time at Ford because we are transitioning from an auto company to an auto and a mobility company," he said. "Mobility for us, at the very simplest level, is to allow people to live, play, and work where they want. How do we help enable them to get around to do that? And there's a lot of talk around technology companies disrupting the auto industry. Our approach is very simple: We're disrupting ourselves." Birds of a feather So how did this reversal come about? Even if Detroit isn't really in a position to rescue Silicon Valley — Silicon Valley doesn't really need to be rescued — then why is the dinosaur now so enthusiastic about participating in its own disruption? Simple: Detroit was the Silicon Valley of the early 20th century, a hotbed of entrepreneurship and fascinated with the most high-tech contraption of the time: the automobile. True, over the decades the culture of the auto industry has become stratified and bureaucratic, but despite that, the car itself has been steadily improved. Detroit has never backed off from technology, and the engineers and executives who have chosen to work for Ford or GM are still excited about new stuff. When they look at Silicon Valley, they see a place ruled by engineers, a contemporary version of Detroit's own origin story. And that's why Silicon Valley and Detroit's newfound mutual admiration could be the beginning of a long and beautiful friendship that stretches from the Bay Area to the banks of the Detroit River.
