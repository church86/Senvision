Intel didn’t share any performance figures, instead basing its statements on a SysMark benchmark. Given that Kaby Lake wasn’t necessarily faster than the outgoing Skylake, Intel needs to offer a tangible boost in overall performance from Cannonlake for it to be a viable upgrade from Kaby Lake (or even Skylake). Cannonlake SKUs will make their debut in the latter half of 2017, and with AMD all set to unveil Ryzen later this year, Intel’s upcoming products will face scrutiny the likes of which we haven’t seen for over a decade. The slide deck referencing the performance increase is titled,  “Advancing Moore’s Law on 14 nm,” showing that Cannonlake will also be based on a 14nm node. That said, it is likely Intel will rely on higher clocks to boost the performance from Kaby Lake, and as such it isn’t too outlandish to assume the higher-end processors in the eighth-generation family will be able to hit 5GHz either out of the box or via overclocks.

The firm promised that in a few months, there would also be a 'Pro' line that was Intel-powered, and on February 8, 2013, the Surface Pro was born. Indeed, the device just turned four years old this week, so it seemed time to take a look back at what was, and how the device has held up. Early days The original Surface Pro only came in two configurations, both with a third-generation Ivy Bridge Core i5-3317U processor, 4GB RAM, and a 10.6-inch 1080p 16:9 LCD. The only difference between the two models was that one came with 64GB of storage and the other with 128GB. As with the Surface RT, it offered a full-size USB Type-A port, and a kickstand that only popped open to one position. While the device clearly had potential, it wasn't without a number of setbacks. Ivy Bridge wasn't power-efficient, and Intel's fourth-generation Haswell chips weren't out yet. The original Surface Pro only got about four hours of battery life, and that's if you're lucky. It also came in a very awkward form factor. Remember, this was to be the tablet that could replace your laptop, but the 10.6-inch display made it simply too small to be a laptop. And at over half an inch thick and a full two pounds, it wasn't comfortable to use as a tablet either. Personally, I never found the Type Cover or Touch Cover very pleasant to use. The keyboard was too small, and the keys didn't have any space in between them. None of these drawbacks kept me from using the Surface Pro as my main PC for months after it came out. I played games, wrote articles, and even developed software on it, and I loved every minute of it. Back in 2013, it felt really cool when I had to show someone a document and I could just pull off the keyboard and hand that person my Surface. And as I mentioned above, the performance was fantastic for such a device. I never had any real problems with it, such as issues that you might have heard about with more modern devices, such as the Pro 4 and Book. The Surface Pro was a typical first-generation device. There was quite a bit of obvious potential, but there were also some real setbacks. Later days Only about seven months later, the Surface Pro was replaced by, you guessed it, the Surface Pro 2, which came alongside the Surface 2, Type Cover 2, and Touch Cover 2. The main improvements in the new Type and Touch Covers were backlighting, but the Surface Pro 2 had some important improvements. The big one was an Intel fourth-generation Haswell Core i5-4300U processor. This allowed for much better battery life, making it more feasible for use as both a tablet and a laptop. It also allowed for more configuration options, with either 4GB or 8GB RAM, and up to 512GB of storage, solving another key problem with the first generation. That pretty much sums up the changes in the Pro 2. It didn't fix one of the biggest problems with Surface Pro, which was the size and weight. Microsoft did come up with a solution for the battery life problem on the original model, though. The Power Cover was a Type Cover that added additional battery life. Announced in September 2013, it wouldn't launch until the following March. It was a bit pricey at $199, and it added even more weight to an already heavy device that's supposed to be meant for portability. That brings us to May 2014, when the Surface Pro 3 was launched. This is generally looked upon as when Surface came into maturity. It still had the same Haswell Core i5 chip as its predecessor, but also offered i3 and i7 options. Most importantly, though, it was thinner, lighter, and bigger than the ones that came before it. The display was now 12 inches, but with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Rather than half an inch thick, it was 0.36 inches thin, and came in at 1.76 pounds. I'm actually typing this on a Surface Pro 3 right now. Today's model of Microsoft's line of tablets is the Surface Pro 4, and it was announced in October 2015. A bit thinner than the Pro 3, it still maintains the same form factor, although it has a higher resolution display, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage options, and Intel sixth-generation Skylake processors. For me, though, the most important improvement was the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover. Finally, the keys were 'islanded', meaning that there was space between them. Modern day So how has a first-generation Surface Pro stood the test of time? Quite well, actually. I still use mine frequently as a test machine for Windows Insider Preview builds. I've wiped the hard drive on it and reinstalled Windows 8, 8.1, 10, and once, Ubuntu Linux. In four years, the Surface Pro has never failed me. Interestingly, the device's age marks a milestone for it, as it's no longer considered to be a 'modern PC', by Microsoft's standards. When the company called on OEMs to make modern PCs at WinHEC, it said that more there are 600 million PCs in use that are over four years old, and now the Surface Pro is one of them. This is a fascinating development because the Surface Pro was one of the first 2-in-1 devices on the market, and it goes to show that that's not enough to make a PC 'modern'. It would seem like newer Windows 10 features such as Windows Hello are necessary now. And let's face it, no one would buy a Surface Pro given the devices that are on the market today. Today's detachable Windows devices are thinner, lighter, have much better battery life, and just more pleasant to use. However, while you can say what you want about it, there's no doubt that it was the beginning of something special. Microsoft stuck to its vision and eventually ended up making something great.

But the order caused confusion at the nation’s airports, including for green-card holders and dual citizens. Trump said that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which unanimously decided not to reinstate Trump’s travel ban, has had its rulings overturned by the Supreme Court “at a record number.” Not true. Trump wrongly said that Hillary Clinton “gave” Russia 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. Clinton was one of nine votes approving the deal. She alone couldn’t have stopped the deal, which involved 20 percent of U.S. production capacity, not stocks, and the uranium can’t go to Russia without export licenses. The president claimed his November victory was “the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.” It wasn’t. Three presidents since Reagan captured a larger share of electoral votes than Trump did, including Republican George H.W. Bush. Trump said “jobs have already started to surge” since his election, citing investments by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Intel. But the investments, much of which were in the works before the election, were largely market driven. Contrary to the president’s claim that “nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates,” there was plenty of press coverage in October when it was revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared several questions with the Clinton campaign during the primary election. Trump said he thought the media had “a lower approval rate than Congress.” No — the public’s approval of Congress is lower than its trust in the media. Trump took questions from the media after announcing his new pick for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, dean of the Florida International University College of Law and a former U.S. attorney. ‘Perfect’ Executive Order Rollout? Trump described his administration as “a fine-tuned machine,” and in particular praised its implementation of his anti-terrorism executive order, which has been largely blocked by the courts. “The rollout was perfect,” Trump said. Of course, that is his opinion. But there are some facts that suggest it was less than perfect. The order included a 90-day travel ban on citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries. It was signed on Jan. 27, and caused confusion and sparked protests at international airports. For example, the order did not say — and the administration failed to immediately clarify — whether lawful permanent residents of the U.S., known as green-card holders, would be barred from reentering the U.S., if they are citizens of the seven banned countries. On Jan. 28, CNN reported that green-card holders from the affected seven countries would need a waiver to enter the country, citing unnamed administration sources. A day later, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement confirming that green-card holders would be allowed into the U.S. on a case-by-case basis. Three days later, the administration issued an update on Feb. 1 declaring green-card holders would not need a waiver. “They no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident they won’t need it anymore,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a Feb. 1 briefing. It also was unclear how the order affected dual citizens. For example, that caused confusion for dual-citizen Canadians who held citizenship in one of the banned countries. The Toronto Star reported that the Trump administration informed Canada late on Jan. 28 that dual citizenship holders traveling from Canada would not be affected by the order. “The word from National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, relayed to the media by Canada’s Washington embassy, ended a day of confusion and turmoil over a vaguely worded Trump policy that had appeared to ensnare tens of thousands of Canadian citizens and abandon 150 years of border tradition,” the Star wrote. On Feb. 3, a week after Trump signed the order, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a definitive statement “to clarify the classes of aliens affected by the 90-day temporary pause on travel.” It also now provides an FAQ page that answers more than two dozen questions about the order. Trump and other administration officials sought to downplay the impact of the temporary travel ban. The president tweeted on Jan. 30 that “only 109 out of 350,000 were detained and held for questioning.” But, as we wrote, the order affected tens of thousands of people. The State Department has estimated that about 60,000 visa holders were affected by the travel ban, and the United Nations estimated that about 20,000 refugees would be affected by the 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. Not a Record on Reversals Trump also wrongly said that the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which unanimously decided on Feb. 9 not to reinstate Trump’s travel ban, has had its rulings overturned by the Supreme Court “at a record number.” Trump: In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is — that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further. In 2015, the most recent year for available data, the 9th Circuit did have a reversal rate of 80 percent, but the 11th Circuit had a reversal rate of 100 percent. And the year before that, the 9th Circuit had a reversal rate of 63 percent, when four other circuits had 100 percent of their rulings overturned. And over a longer period of time, between 1999 and 2008, the 9th Circuit, at 80 percent, had the second highest reversal rate, according to a 2010 report from the American Bar Association. The highest rate, 83.3 percent, belonged to the Federal Circuit. The ABA wrote that the “common perception” that the 9th Circuit is the “rogue circuit” is not true. The ABA noted that the Supreme Court overturns most circuit court decisions that it reviews, but reviews less than 1 percent of all circuit court rulings. Uranium Overreach Trump repeated his misleading claim that Hillary Clinton “gave” Russia one-fifth of all U.S. uranium. Trump: You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia. He’s wrong on several counts. The deal Clinton had a role in approving gave Russia ownership of 20 percent of U.S. production capacity — not existing stocks of uranium. Furthermore, Clinton alone could not have stopped the deal; only the president could have done that with a finding that national security would be endangered. Lastly, none of the uranium goes to Russia. That would require export licenses. Trump was referring to Clinton’s role in the 2010 purchase by Russia’s nuclear agency of Uranium One, a Toronto-based company with mining operations in Kazakhstan, Tanzania and the United States, where the company’s operations amount to about 20 percent of annual U.S. production capacity. The fact is — as we reported nearly two years ago — Clinton had no veto power to stop that deal. She was one of nine voting members on the foreign investments committee that unanimously approved it, a panel that also includes the secretaries of the treasury, defense, homeland security, commerce and energy, the attorney general, and representatives from two White House offices — the United States Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. (Separately, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission needed to approve (and did approve) the transfer of two uranium recovery licenses as part of the sale.) Only the president could have stopped the sale, and only if at least one member of the foreign investment committee had objected. And even then, the president cannot prohibit a transaction without finding “credible evidence” that the “foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security,” according to the federal regulation that governs such matters. Finally, Russia may own the mines, but the uranium coming out of them stays in the U.S. As the Nuclear Regulatory Commission noted when it approved the sale, “no uranium produced at either facility may be exported.” Trump made the same claim in slightly different words three times during his news conference. It’s a replay of a bogus accusation he made during last year’s campaign, when it was debunked by us and other independent fact-checking sites. But constant repetition doesn’t make a false statement true. No Electoral Bragging Rights Trump claimed that “we got 306” electoral votes “because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.” Actually, Trump finished with 304 electoral votes, since two members of the Texas Electoral College did not cast their votes for Trump even though he won the state. Also, as we’ve written before, Trump’s Electoral College victory margin ranks 46th out of 58 presidential elections, based on Trump’s share of the 538 electoral votes. Trump received 56.5 percent of the electoral vote. Since President Reagan’s victories in 1980 and 1984, three presidents have captured a larger share of the electoral vote than Trump did in 2016. President George H.W. Bush won 79.18 percent in 1988; President Bill Clinton won 68.77 percent in 1992 and 70.45 percent in 1996, and President Barack Obama won 67.84 percent in 2008 and 61.71 percent in 2012. Later in the press conference, a reporter pointed out that Obama and other presidents since Reagan had received more electoral votes than Trump did. The president clarified that he was talking about just Republicans, but he’s wrong about that too, as the reporter pointed out. “I was given that information, I don’t know,” Trump responded. “I was just given it. We had a very, very big margin.” Trump’s Jobs Record Trump claimed that “jobs have already started to surge” since his election, citing investments by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Intel in new U.S. plants. But much of the U.S. expansion was in the works before Trump was elected, and the investments were largely market driven. While many corporate leaders — including at those companies mentioned by Trump — have praised the president’s plan to cut regulations and corporate taxes, it is too early to tell how those changes have or will affect the job market overall. Let’s deal with some of the specific claims one at a time. Trump: Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. As we wrote when Trump boasted in a tweet two days prior to his inauguration that jobs at Ford and other companies are coming back to the U.S. “because of me,” Trump is giving himself too much credit with Ford. Ford announced on Jan. 3 that it was cancelling its plan to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, and that it planned to invest $4.5 billion over the next five years to ramp up production of electric cars, including an investment of $700 million at its plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, to manufacture two of them. The decision not to build the plant in Mexico, where Ford had planned to build the next generation Ford Focus, was scrapped because “we’ve seen decreasing demand here in North America for small cars, and we simply don’t need the capacity anymore,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said on Fox Business News. Instead, he said, Ford will build the Focus in an existing facility in Mexico. As for the investment in electric vehicles, Fields said in announcing the plan that it was a reaction to the reality that “the era of electric vehicles is dawning,” adding that he expected to see production of electric cars exceed traditional gas-powered ones in the next 15 years. Host Neil Cavuto asked if any of the decisions were based on Trump’s criticisms during the campaign. “Well, we’re doing this based on what’s right for our business,” Fields said. Fields added that Ford is anticipating “more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under Trump,” and he said the company welcomes some of the “pro-growth policies” such as regulation and business tax changes that Trump talked about during the campaign. Fields said Ford’s announcement was a “vote of confidence” that the president will deliver on these things. Fields noted that the 700 new jobs were in addition to the 28,000 the company has added over the last five years. The company also has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants over the same period. “Would you have done this [the moves announced] if Donald Trump were not elected president?” Cavuto asked. “Yes, absolutely,” Fields said. Trump: Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced on Jan. 8 a $1 billion investment in plants in Michigan and Ohio, and the addition of 2,000 new American jobs. The company said the investment was part of an ongoing “commitment to strengthening its U.S. manufacturing base,” which has included commitments to invest more than $9.6 billion in its U.S. manufacturing facilities, and the creation of 25,000 new jobs to date, since 2009. In comments the day after the announcement, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told reporters the announced investments were in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump or his policy ideas, USA Today reported. Rather, he said, “It has been part of the discussion going back to 2015″ negotiations with the United Auto Workers. Trump: Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Trump has a stronger case with this example, though the history is a bit complex. While Intel’s CEO credited Trump’s pro-business platform for the recent announcement of a $7 billion investment in a new factory in Arizona that will make semiconductor chips — which he said will result in 10,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state — this is actually the second announcement for the facility. Back in 2011, Intel announced a $5 billion investment in the same facility, which Obama touted in an early 2012 visit to Arizona. Intel began building the shell of that facility several years ago, but the project was left uncompleted because of a lack of “general demand for the product,” a company spokesman told CNN Money. “We’re making this investment now to meet demand that we now expect,” Intel spokesman William Moss said. “That said, we certainly join other companies in supporting the administration’s pro business and pro investment goals.” That praise was echoed by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in an announcement at the White House on Feb. 8 that the project would be moving forward. He credited Trump’s pro-business platform as the impetus to move forward. Krzanich was asked if there was “something that President Trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now.” Said Krzanich: “It’s really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.” In the bigger picture, Trump claimed that he “inherited a mess” with “jobs pouring out of the country” when he took office. But as we noted in our Jan. 20 story “What Trump Inherits,” the economy added nearly 2.2 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office. It has gained jobs for 75 straight months – the longest streak on record. The number of job openings also has continued to hold at near record levels for the last two years. And the unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is well below the historical norm. We won’t know how Trump is doing on jobs until the Bureau of Labor Statistics comes out with its monthly figures for February, and it may take many more months or even years, to fully evaluate Trump’s impact on jobs. No Question on Debate Coverage Trump said that “nobody mentions that Hillary [Clinton] received the questions to the debates.” As we have written before, there was plenty of press coverage when it was revealed that former CNN contributor Donna Brazile shared questions with Clinton’s campaign during the primary election. Trump: Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Perhaps no one mentions it now because the election was over three months ago. But there was plenty of press coverage back in October when emails allegedly obtained from the account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, revealed that former CNN contributor Brazile shared several town hall and primary debate questions with members of Clinton’s campaign. According to the emails, Brazile sent multiple questions to the Clinton campaign before a CNN town hall in mid-March last year, and she sent at least one question to Clinton’s campaign prior to a Democratic debate earlier that month. Politico and others reported that the hacked emails showed that Brazile sent a town hall question about the death penalty in an email on March 12, 2016, to Clinton’s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, with the subject line, “From time to time, I get the questions in advance.” Politico also reported that an additional email showed that Brazile forwarded the campaign other town hall questions — one about unions and another about income inequality. Clinton was asked the question about unions, and Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked about income inequality in the town hall. There were also multiple news reports that another email showed that Brazile tipped off the Clinton campaign to a potential question the day before a Democratic debate between Clinton and Sanders on March 6 in Flint, Michigan. In that email, Brazile tells Podesta and Palmieri that “one of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash” who will ask “what if anything will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.” CNN, which was among those that reported on the emails, accepted the resignation of Brazile, the acting DNC chair, on Oct. 14, three days after the first press reports on the controversy. However, there is no evidence that Clinton herself directly received any questions. And though the alleged Clinton campaign emails that WikiLeaks published did not contain classified information, the organization has made classified information public before. For example, in 2010, WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of classified documents pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that it had obtained from Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman and former Army intelligence officer. Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other counts in August 2013 and sentenced to 35 years in prison. But she is scheduled to be released on May 17, after then-President Obama commuted her sentence in mid-January. Media Approval Trump also stumbled over the facts when he taunted the reporters questioning him by saying, “People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know.” No, that’s not right. It’s true that Americans’ trust in the mass media “to report the news fully, accurately and fairly” had dropped to its lowest level since the Gallup organization began asking the question in 1972, as of Gallup’s most recent annual report on the subject last September. And Trump would have been correct to say that trust in the media is even lower than approval of himself. According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating stood at 41 percent, as of the week ending Feb. 12, while the public’s trust in the media was down to 32 percent. But even fewer people say they approve of the way Congress is doing its job. As of January, only 19 percent said they approve, while 76 percent disapproved, according to Gallup. — Robert Farley, D’Angelo Gore, Brooks Jackson, Eugene Kiely, Ilana Nathans and Lori Robertson Categories: The Wire Locations: National People: Donald Trump Issues: Electoral College, immigration, jobs, and uranium author: FactCheck.org Previous story Trump Spins Flynn Facts Ask FactCheck Q: Did President Trump’s immigration executive order help capture a leader of ISIS?

After years of practically being neglected, the Cupertino-based giant’s all-in-one desktop series needs a significant update to remain competitive, especially with the emergence of powerful rivals such as the Surface Studio. If rumors are any indication, however, it appears that 2017 is finally going to be the year when Apple makes the iMac relevant again. Rumors about the 2017 iMac have been emerging from the rumor mill for a while now, with numerous speculations pointing to the rollout of a powerful all-in-one desktop that is capable of providing the market’s most formidable players with ample competition. With the release of the iMac 2017, Apple appears to be aiming for dominance in the desktop stage as well. [Image by Pixabay] The release date of the device itself has not been announced by Apple, but rumors are high that the all-in-one would be unveiled sometime during Spring 2017. A PC Advisor report has stated that the 2017 iMac would most likely be released around March 2017. This would allow Apple to enter the market just as Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors are being rolled out. After all, Intel has just announced the chips’ S-series desktop processors back in January. The chips in the iMac 2017 are all but confirmed to be Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. The powerful chips have long been rumored for Apple’s all-in-one, especially after a very prolific gaffe from Best Buy back in October last year listed a Kaby Lake Core i7 iMac with Retina 5K display, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB Fusion Drive. While the Best Buy ad might simply be an innocent mistake on the part of the U.S. retailer, the specs in the listing do line up with the most persistent rumors about the device. Considering that the iMac 2017 is set to be Apple’s flagship device in the all-in-one market, there is a good chance that the Cupertino-based tech giant would be equipping its iconic desktop computer with the best internals currently available in the market. A MacWorld report has stated that expectations are high for the iMac 2017 to be equipped with high-end chips, such as Intel’s 7th-generation Core i7-7700K processor. [Image by Pixabay] The Core i7-7700K chip is pretty special, mainly due to the processor’s ability to overclock. Under normal use, the powerful chip is capable of running at 4.2GHz, but once overclocked, the i7-7700K is capable of performing at an astounding 4.8GHz. Such speed would definitely make the iMac 2017 more than capable of running any heavy applications that users could throw at it. If any, the Kaby Lake processor would definitely make the iMac 2017 more robust than the Surface Studio, which still runs with a Skylake Core i7-6820HQ chip. With the iMac 2017 most likely packing a formidable processor, the all-in-one would practically be approaching Mac Pro performance levels. With rumors about a successor to the Mac Pro being very scarce, speculations are now high that Apple might very well retire the Mac Pro desktop unit and simply release a top-tier iMac Pro. Considering that listing that was mistakenly released by Best Buy last year, these speculations are not that far-fetched. After all, a Kaby Lake Core i7 all-in-one with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive definitely places the iMac 2017 up there with the best in the desktop business. Apple has not really been focusing on its desktop and laptop business during the last few years, with the Cupertino-based tech giant gearing their efforts more on the mobile business. In a lot of ways, the tech giant’s gambit has paid off, with the iPhone and the iPad being the most iconic devices in their respective categories. If the release of the redesigned 2016 MacBook Pro is any indication, however, it appears that Apple is once more exploring the other areas of its computing business. With the release of the iMac 2017, the Cupertino-based tech giant might very well be one of the most dominant players in the desktop market this year.

Smith, Editor | February 13, 2017 12:30 pm MORE Razer is the latest company to take a dive into Intel's new Kaby Lake processors. The company just announced that the 14-inch Razer Blade will be upgraded to include a 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor with 16GB of RAM, while retaining the VR-ready Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of VRAM. Starting today, the new laptop will be available starting at $1,899. MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops Although a new processor is always good news, Razer didn't stop there. The Blade is also swapping out its 1920 x 1080 display for a 4K touch panel (3840 x 2160) -- a first for this line of laptops. The screen upgrade will help put the Blade on a par with the Alienware 13's eye-catching OLED panel. And despite the new additions, the Blade will retain its svelte 4.1-pound, 13.6 x 9.3 x 0.7-inch frame, making it one of the lightest gaming laptops on the market.  Like its 1080p counterpart, the 4K iteration will be available with either 256, 512 or 1TB of PCI-e SSD storage. The system will also offer a Thunderbolt port and the customizable RGB backlit keyboard. I'm definitely eager to get this new Blade in for review to see how it stacks up to the competition as soon as it becomes available.  Which GPU is Right For You Best VR Headsets The Best PC Games to Play Right Now Add a comment Email Firstname Name Comment Back to top Find a Review All Categories Laptops Tablets Accessories All Subcategories Business Desktop Replacement Gaming Multimedia Student Brand ASUS Acer Alienware Aorus Apple CTL Corp.

Chrome is still the fastest of the fast on Windows 7, but Opera's giving it a run for its money. As for Internet Explorer, in a word: Ugh. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Networking | February 17, 2017 -- 00:21 GMT (16:21 PST) | Topic: Networking Windows 7 is still a sight more popular than Windows 10. By Federal Digital Analytics Program (DAP)'s count, Windows 7 has a serious lead over Windows 10 -- 25.2 percent to 17.4 percent. So, Windows 7's web browser speeds matter a lot. Here's what the benchmarks tell us. Chrome is number one, but Opera is giving it competition. Firefox lags behind and IE, oh dear, IE is just terrible. sjvn First, though, in terms of popularity, DAP makes it clear Chrome is the most popular web browser of them all. Internet Explorer (IE), which once ruled the browser roost, dropped behind Chrome for good in 2016. Microsoft: Conflicting data laws could cost tech companies billions Microsoft: Conflicting data laws could cost tech companies billions Microsoft simultaneously releases new Windows 10 'Redstone' PC and phone test builds Windows 10 telemetry secrets: Where, when, and why Microsoft collects your data But does Chrome have the performance chops to justify its popularity? Let's find out. To put Windows 7's web browsers to the test I put them through their paces on the latest shipping edition of Windows 7 SP 1 Ultimate. This ran on my Windows 7 test PC, a Gateway DX4710. This older PC is powered by a 2.5-GHz Intel Core 2 Quad processor and has 6GB of RAM and an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (GMA) 3100 for graphics. It's hooked to the internet via a Gigabit Ethernet switch, which, in turn, is connected to a 100Mbps (Megabit per second) cable internet connection. On this system, I benchmarked Internet Explorer (IE) 11, Chrome 56, Firefox 51, and Opera 43. I no longer test Safari because Apple doesn't release major Safari updates for Windows anymore. The 2012 version of Safari, 5.1.7, with some security patches is still available, but it's too dated to use. For each round of testings, I ran freshly installed vanilla web browsers after rebooting the system. Then, I ran the following benchmarks. JetStream 1.1: This JavaScript benchmark builds on the foundation of the obsolete SunSpider. It combines several JavaScript benchmarks to report a single score that balances them using geometric mean. JetStream includes benchmarks from the SunSpider 1.0.2 and Octane 2 JavaScript benchmark suites. This test suite also includes benchmarks from the LLVM compiler open-source project, compiled to JavaScript using Emscripten 1.13. It also includes a benchmark based on the Apache Harmony open-source project's HashMap and a port of the CDx real-time Java benchmark, hand-translated to JavaScript. On this benchmark, larger scores are better. Chrome, as it so often has in previous tests, won with a score of 85.26. Second place was a surprise: Opera. Opera has been declining in popularity for years. It now claims less than 2 percent of the desktop browser market. Still, Opera has respectable turn of speed with 81.93. Firefox took third with 76.44. IE came in dead last with 64.47. Kraken 1.1: This benchmark, which is descended from SunSpider, also measures JavaScript performance. To this basic JavaScript testing, it added typical use case scenarios. Mozilla, Firefox's parent organization, created Kraken. With this benchmark, the lower the score, the better the result. Here, Chrome came in first once more with with a score of 2,267.6 milliseconds (ms). Opera came in second with a score of 2,585.9ms. Firefox was close on its heels with 2,850.4ms. IE was a distant last with 5,094.4ms. Octane 2.0: Google's JavaScript benchmark also includes scenario testing for today's interactive web applications. Octane is not Chrome-specific. For example, it tests how fast Microsoft's TypeScript compiles itself. On this benchmark, the higher the score, the better. And, the winner was ... Opera! This time it won with 14,863 points. Second went to Chrome with 14,426. Close behind it came Firefox with 14,157 points. Far, far in the back IE limped to the end with a score of 7,778. WebXPRT is today's most comprehensive browser benchmark. It uses scenarios created to mirror every day tasks. It contains six HTML5- and JavaScript-based workloads: Photo Enhancement, Organize Album, Stock Option Pricing, Local Notes, Sales Graphs, and Explore DNA Sequencing. Here, the higher the score, the better the browser. On this test, Chrome took gold with 187 points. Firefox got the silver with a score of 183. Opera held on to the bronze with 161. And, once more, IE was in the back of the pack with 150 points. HTML5 Test: Finally, I checked to see how well each browser complies with the HTML5 web standard. This "test" isn't a benchmark. It just shows how close each browser comes to being in sync with the HTML5 standard. A perfect score, which no one got, would have been 550. If your web browser has trouble with today's web standard, it doesn't matter how fast it is. Opera re-emerged to take first with 526 points. Chrome came in second with 519, while Firefox was in third with 471? IE? You guessed it. At the bottom of the pile with 302. The lesson is clear. Chrome deserves its popularity. That said, Opera is worth considering. As for Firefox, well it's OK, it's not great, but it's OK. If you're using IE, on the other hand, stop. Just stop. It's simply second-rate compared to the others. When I looked at Windows 10 and IE, I wondered if Microsoft was just giving up on it. On Windows 7, I don't have that question. IE has become abandonware. Related Stories: What's 2017's fastest Windows 10 web browser?

Trump also defended Michael Flynn, the national security advisor whose resignation he demanded and received this week, saying Flynn “wasn’t wrong” for holding pre-inauguration phone calls with the Russian ambassador about US sanctions policy. Instead, Trump accused members of the US intelligence community of breaking the law by leaking information about the calls. The new president, in the midst of a turbulent week of back-and-forth accusations about contacts with Russia and his battle with the intelligence community, addressed the concerns during an extraordinary White House press conference. Asked whether he or anyone on his staff had engaged in contacts with Russia prior to the election, Trump proclaimed: “No. Nobody that I know of.” “I have nothing to do with Russia,” Trump said. “The whole Russia thing is a ruse.” It was a full-throated denunciation of a bombshell report by the New York Times which said that intercepted calls and phone records show Trump aides were in repeated contact with Russian intelligence officials well before the US elections. “They weren’t in Russia. They never made a phone call to Russia. They never received a phone call. It’s all fake news,” Trump said. Trump stressed that the story centered instead on inappropriate action by US intelligence agencies, as he stepped up his earlier yesterday attacks in which he vowed to catch “low-life leakers” of potentially classified information that led to the ouster of his national security advisor. “The leaks are real. The news is fake,” he declared. Billionaire’s review? “Those are criminal leaks” by people angry about Democrat Hillary Clinton’s loss, he later told reporters. “I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.” The latest salvoes came amid reports that Trump plans to name New York billionaire Stephen Feinberg to lead a sweeping review of US intelligence agencies, raising fears of a bid to curtail their independence. Trump decried Flynn’s treatment at a news conference Wednesday despite having fired the retired general for deceiving Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. Earlier, he pointed the finger at the National Security Agency, which conducts electronic surveillance, and the FBI, which handles counter-intelligence probes, as possible sources of the leaks.   But the drumbeat of revelations has infuriated Democrats and alarmed Republican leaders, wary of Trump’s overtures toward Russia.    “It is a cloud over the White House,” Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican hawk who has called for in-depth investigations, said Wednesday. Trump’s repeated attacks on the intelligence community alarmed Democrats. “That news conference was a 1 hour, 17 minute argument for why this Congress needs to start taking its oversight role much more seriously,” House Democrat Mark Takano tweeted. Trump’s stance on leaks has flipped since last year’s presidential campaign when he dismissed as a “joke” charges that Russia was behind damaging leaks of hacked Clinton campaign emails. “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said at a news conference in Florida last July. By January, US intelligence had concluded that those leaks were part of a wider campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin to try to tilt the election in Trump’s favor. Moscow denies any involvement. Mutual distrust A sense of mutual distrust has now pervaded the president’s relationship with the intelligence community. As president-elect, Trump ruffled feathers by giving short shrift to his daily intelligence briefings, and outraged the CIA director by likening the intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany after the leak of a dossier that made unsubstantiated claims that Russia held compromising information on Trump. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that US intelligence officials have withheld from Trump sensitive information on sources and methods because of concerns it could be leaked or compromised. Trump called the report “disgraceful” and baseless. The Times said the planned intelligence review by Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management who has no national security experience, was seen as a way of injecting a Trump loyalist into the intelligence community. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has moved gingerly on Russia, sending top officials to Europe to reassure Nato allies while making its opening official contacts with the Russians. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Bonn, and said Washington is prepared to work with Russia “when we can find practical areas of cooperation.” In Brussels, Defense Secretary James Mattis said the Pentagon was not ready “right now” for military cooperation with Moscow “but our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground or a way forward.” Putin, meanwhile, called for Russian intelligence agencies to bolster their cooperation with the Americans in the fight against terrorism. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung’s history tainted by run-ins with the law (VIDEO) Former navy admiral rejects Trump offer to be national security advisor S.

The firm is seeking to make up for a hug write-down in its U.S. nuclear unit. | BLOOMBERG Business / Corporate | FOCUS Toshiba memory-chip unit is alluring target but not an easy sell by Pavel Alpeyev and Ian King Bloomberg Feb 17, 2017 Article history Online: Feb 17, 2017 Last Modified: Feb 17, 2017 PRINT SHARE Toshiba Corp., seeking to make up for a huge write-down in its nuclear-equipment unit, finally took the drastic step of putting its crown jewel — its chip business — up for sale. Finding a buyer might prove to be even more difficult. The Tokyo-based conglomerate had been entertaining offers for a minor stake in the flash-memory operations, until it booked a $6.3 billion write-down in its nuclear unit this week. President Satoshi Tsunakawa said he’s now open to selling a majority share or even the entire division to repair the company’s balance sheet. The search for a buyer is likely to last beyond Toshiba’s earlier March 31 deadline for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said. For competitors SK Hynix Inc., Western Digital Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., buying Toshiba’s business would represent a rare opportunity to close the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics Co. Demand for flash, or NAND, memory is still robust because it’s the main storage in the more than 1 billion smartphones sold every year, and it’s increasingly being used in data centers to house the flood of data created as computing shifts to the cloud. “Toshiba finally recognized the reality that whoever is going to invest in the NAND business is going to want a majority of it,” said Zuhair Khan, an analyst at Jefferies in Tokyo. Any prospective buyer of Toshiba’s chip business would have to clear a number of hurdles, including being able to pony up as much as $14 billion, antitrust considerations and the Japanese government’s reluctance to lose a key technology. The government is closely watching developments at Toshiba and considers flash-memory a technology that is “extremely important” to the nation’s growth strategy, a top official said this week. It’s a familiar line in a country that over the past few decades has seen its dominant position in semiconductors and flat panels pass to South Korean and Taiwanese rivals. Toshiba, Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and NEC Corp. took away the market for computer memory from Intel Corp., International Business Machines Corp., and other U.S. companies in the late 1970s. That memory-chip business then became the foundation of Samsung’s rise to become a global electronics giant in the 1980s and 1990s, when it successfully mimicked its neighbor’s concentration on improving production and eventually overtook competitors. While Taiwanese latecomers struggled in memory, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. pioneered chip outsourcing and put pressure on the nonmemory businesses of Japanese companies, which heavily focused on the needs of the groups that owned them and were late to look for a broader customer base. Toshiba is the only Japanese manufacturer left that’s kept pace in the expensive race to build and maintain leading-edge chip-production facilities. With factories costing more than $5 billion to build and equip, market share is important in providing the volume of orders for the commodity chips that allow companies to get a return on their investment. About a third of the $30 billion market for flash-memory chips is served by Samsung’s factories, close to the same amount as its next two rivals combined, giving it a huge advantage in costs and scale. Toshiba is second with about 20 percent, followed by its manufacturing partner Western Digital. Micron and Hynix have about 10 percent each. Historically, Samsung has ignored opportunities to acquire and focused on building its own plants. The company’s already-dominant share in the market would also likely rule out the South Korean giant as a potential buyer. Hynix, on the other hand, would be an eager buyer with deep enough pockets for the deal, according to Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. It has already offered to pay at least 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) for a smaller stake, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this month. “Hynix may really want Toshiba bad, because a wealthy Chinese company buying it would cause even a bigger headache,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. “The marriage would make Hynix even bigger than the industry leader Samsung in NAND chips.” China has said it’s prepared to spend more than $100 billion building a domestic semiconductor industry that will give it the ability to serve its home market, the world’s largest. The country has seen several attempts to acquire U.S. assets rebuffed on regulatory concerns, but it remains determined to acquire expertise. Currently China doesn’t have locally owned plants capable of producing chips based on the most advanced manufacturing, a skill set that’s just as important as designing the circuitry. Toshiba’s initial offer of only partial stakes of the chip unit may have been motivated by concern about losing control. Yet control is most likely what its rivals are interested in as they consider whether to make an approach. The cost of maintaining plants that otherwise would quickly become obsolete is the first demand on most chipmakers’ balance sheets. Without that or guaranteed supply at a low price from Toshiba, they’re just propping up a rival that can hurt them. Micron has been building scale through joint ventures and a string of acquisitions of the assets of rivals who have struggled to keep up with the spending requirements. In 2013 the U.S. company paid $2.4 billion to buy Japanese computer-memory maker Elpida. Those acquisitions have come at a cost. Micron had about $10 billion of debt compared with cash and investments of $4.3 billion at the end of its most recent quarter. Chief Financial Officer Ernie Maddock told investors at a recent meeting that the company’s priority was on paying down that debt load. Micron would also be a tough choice for Toshiba. While acquisitive, the U.S. company has typically waited until targets have run out of money and been desperate to sell. It’s also shown a willingness to walk away at the last moment if it doesn’t get what it wants, such as in 2002, when it ended negotiations to acquire Hynix Semiconductor. Unlike Micron, Western Digital is already a partner with Toshiba through partial joint-venture ownership of some of the Japanese company’s chip facilities, acquired via its purchase of SanDisk Corp. last year. That $12 billion transaction, aimed at bringing in chips that are the future of storage technology, left Western Digital saddled with $13.3 billion of debt. It had $5.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the end of its most recent quarter.

U.2 PCIe A4E is targeted for the data center and server storage markets and supports the NVMe protocol, featuring Silicon Motion’s SM2260 controller with advanced Micron 3D NAND MLC. MemxPro also launches M.2 PCIe A4E 2280 to meet the needs for power users, tech enthusiasts and gamers. The SSD market has been growing rapidly and SATA III products have become a primary storage option. The theoretical maximum speed of SATA III is 6Gb/s. MemxPro actively develops a new generation of PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD with 4 lanes and a theoretical maximum speed of 32Gb/s. Supported by PCI Express, the high-speed serial computer expansion bus, it allows many times faster potential bandwidth than SATA 6Gb/s. MemxPro U.2 PCIe SSD series incorporates advanced 3D MLC flash, which boosts storage performance and endurance. 3D NAND technology stacks flash cells vertically and this dramatically increases density. As 3D NAND flash expands the number of bits per square millimeter, their wafer capacity and bit output also increases. So far, 2D planar flash technology using a 1x nanometer miniature process is as close to its practical scaling and reliability as is currently permitted. The manufacturing of 3D NAND can take place in the same factory by simply adding a few additional steps to the laying process, and it reduces the cost per gigabyte and enhances endurance and reliability. MemxPro U.2 PCIe A4E is available in capacities of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB with up to 1,454MB/s sequential read and 969MB/s sequential write. It can perform up to 86,500 random read IOPS and 155,500 random write IOPS. Another product series, M.2 PCIe A4 is compliant with the M.2 (NGFF) standard of 22mm wide by 80mm long. Its small footprint permits flexible deployment for embedded applications where space is limited. U.2 PCIe A4E and M.2 PCIe A4E are in mass production and have samples for customer testing. In the near future, PCIe NVMe will evolve to be the next-generation SSD interface for network-ready IoT and industrial storage applications.

PC prices will continue to go up due to shortage of components Higher chip prices and a shortage of memory and SSDs are among the culprits driving up PC prices Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 17 February, 2017 08:32 0 - - - - print email PC prices are going up due to a shortage of a number of components, and the situation isn't expected to change in the coming quarters. A shortage of DRAM, SSDs, batteries, and LCDs have conspired to drive up PC prices, Gianfranco Lanci, corporate president and chief operating officer at Lenovo, said during an earnings call on Thursday. The cost of purchasing these components is going up, which is triggering PC prices to also rise, said Lanci, a PC industry veteran. The shortage of components like memory will continue, Lanci said. As component supplies shrink, PC prices will rise, said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner. Moreover, PC makers are raising prices to squeeze more profits out of the shrinking PC market, Kitagawa said. The PC buyer profile is also changing, with gamers and millennials willing to spend more money on PCs. That's changing the mix of laptops, desktops, and 2-in-1s being shipped by PC makers, who are focused on selling higher-priced products that can deliver better margins. But low-cost PCs won't go away, Kitagawa said. There will always be cheap laptops available, though those markets aren't growing and not attractive to PC makers. Basic configurations of PCs remain affordable, but some PC makers are limiting customization, forcing users to buy additional components in certain configurations. Take Dell's XPS 13, which is priced at US$799.99 with 128GB of storage, 4GB of memory, and a Kaby Lake Core i3 chip. Upgrading hurts the wallet. A base Core i3 model cannot be configured to 256GB of storage, but for that, you'd need a faster Core i5 chip and 8GB of memory, which drives the price of the PC up to $1099.99. A 512GB SSD is available only with XPS 13 models with a Core i7 chip and touch screens that have a resolution of 3200 x 1800. That drags up the price to $1749.99. A chart shown at an Intel investor conference last week showed PC selling prices reaching its highest since 2011, when a decline in PC shipments started. Intel is also selling chips at higher prices, which is adding to PC costs. Intel PC chip prices went up by 7 percent in 2016, but the company also sold more Core i7 chips as sales of gaming and VR systems increased. Analyst firm TrendForce predicted SSD prices would go up in the first quarter of this year, continuing a trend from the previous quarters. SSD adoption, as a replacement for hard drives, is growing, but the supply of NAND flash has tightened, which is driving up prices. The price of DRAM is also going up because of shortages. Memory is a boom-or-bust market and extremely volatile with prices falling drastically when DRAM floods the market. PC DRAM prices went up by 30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter, TrendForce said in a statement this week. TrendForce is predicting that DRAM prices may increase by up to 40 percent in the first quarter, due to undersupply. The news isn't any better looking forward. "Rising prices are expected for the second quarter as well," said Avril Wu, research director of DRAMeXchange, which is a part of TrendForce and tracks component pricing. Lenovo's Lanci also expected the memory shortage and price rises to continue for the coming quarter.

However, if your system can cope with serious tweaking and overclocking, the stability and speed potential on offer can deliver noticeable performance boosts. Would you buy this? Yes 1 No 0 Price $ 245.00 (AUD) When you look at RAM it’s easy to think that the big, beefy modules with the fancy heat-spreaders are are going to make your computer fly along. If you’re a competitive overclocker then this is probably the case and this review isn’t for you. Corsair’s Dominator Platinum memory is its top-end product and uses chips that have been highly-screened (binned) for speed and stability. That’s why competitive overclockers like them but it’s also why users who require stability from long, high-performance computing tasks will also have their heads turned. It’s a bit like buying a Workstation PC for much more money than a regular PC with the same specs – you’re paying for expensive certifications and guarantees that the parts are less-likely to fail. In similar regards, Corsair’s Dominator Platinum brand gives high-end users similar reassurance. But is it overkill for everyone else? Performance We tested the Dominator kit against Corsair’s own premium Vengeance LPX kit which costs $100 less. We ran tests on our Z170X Gigabyte Designare-based Test Rig and again when switching in an Asus Strix Z270F Gaming motherboard with an i7-7700K CPU. On both boards we set the memory timings to XMP (for this kit that automatically adjusts settings to 14-16-16-35 at 1.35V). On the Designare Z170 we ran PC Mark and 3D Mark with our Skylake i7-6700K processor running at a stock 4GHz and again when automatically overclocked to 4.6GHz. On the Strix we ran the PC Mark Creative 3.0 test with our Intel 7th Generation Kaby Lake i7-7700K CPU at default settings and with automatic overclocking settings turned on. In PC Mark on the Designare Z170 the Vengeance scored 4,040 at stock and 4,355 overclocked. Switching to the Dominator kit these scores jumped to 4,047 and 4,364. That’s a 0.2% increase. For hardened overclockers that might justify the price on its own but in day-to-day use the difference is imperceptible. In 3D Mark the Vengeance scored 5590 and 5688. The Dominator kit scored 5601 and 5707 – less than a 0.3% boost which reflects a 1fps increase. Yay. At this point our Z170 board became poorly sick and so we switched over to the Strix Z270 with the Kaby Lake processor and ran the Creative 3.0 tests. RAM tends to show its worth best when performing picture and video editing and this test relies heavily on that. Read more: ​Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-2400 RAM review The Vengeance scored 5853 to the Dominator’s 5902 – a 0.8% increase. But what does that mean? When you dig through the results there’s virtually no difference in the photo editing and website tests. However, in video editing we saw a slightly larger difference – the Dominator kit completed the task 3% faster. If you regularly edit or render video that could be the starting point to turn your head. But that’s not where the story ends. Overclocking The Strix has a simplistic overclocking system which can be confusing to decipher. What we do know is that when we tried to use it to overclock with the Vengeance kit, the basic-level, stated 9% system boost saw the whole system run slower than before. Every ‘faster’ setting insta-crashed the PC and it wouldn’t boot. However, when we added the Dominator kit and set the system to top-end “media machine” settings (with a 17% system boost) it did boot and even ran the Creative 3.0 benchmark, stably. We note too that the kit’s temperature was only slightly warm when running this test thanks to the cooling prowess of the elaborate-yet-solid heat spreaders. It scored 6163 this time which is 5% more than the Vengeance’s score and over 4% more than the stock-speed Dominator run. The whole benchmark took 67 seconds less than the Vengeance run. More importantly, the video editing was 12% faster and the photo editing was 10% faster. Read more: ​Gigabyte Z170X Designare motherboard review In 3D Mark Time Spy we obtained a score of 5760 – a greater-than-1% boost over the Vengeance kit but still only worth 1fps. It’s also worth noting that the benchmark crashed the first time we ran it which could indicate some stability issues with the graphics card in this significantly-tweaked system. Conclusion For most people Corsair’s Dominator Platinum kit is complete overkill with a general performance boost that will be imperceptible in most applications and they’d therefore be better off sticking with the Vengeance kit. However, to hardened media manipulators and competitive overclockers who intend to significantly ramp up their computer’s settings and who have partner components that will stand the strain – whether using automatic or manual overclocking – there will be a perceptible practical boost both in rendering times and benchmark results.

A shortage of DRAM, SSDs, batteries, and LCDs have conspired to drive up PC prices, Gianfranco Lanci, corporate president and chief operating officer at Lenovo, said during an earnings call on Thursday. The cost of purchasing these components is going up, which is triggering PC prices to also rise, said Lanci, a PC industry veteran. The shortage of components like memory will continue, Lanci said. As component supplies shrink, PC prices will rise, said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner. Moreover, PC makers are raising prices to squeeze more profits out of the shrinking PC market, Kitagawa said. The PC buyer profile is also changing, with gamers and millennials willing to spend more money on PCs. That's changing the mix of laptops, desktops, and 2-in-1s being shipped by PC makers, who are focused on selling higher-priced products that can deliver better margins. But low-cost PCs won't go away, Kitagawa said. There will always be cheap laptops available, though those markets aren't growing and not attractive to PC makers. Basic configurations of PCs remain affordable, but some PC makers are limiting customization, forcing users to buy additional components in certain configurations. Take Dell's XPS 13, which is priced at US$799.99 with 128GB of storage, 4GB of memory, and a Kaby Lake Core i3 chip. Upgrading hurts the wallet. A base Core i3 model cannot be configured to 256GB of storage, but for that, you'd need a faster Core i5 chip and 8GB of memory, which drives the price of the PC up to $1099.99. A 512GB SSD is available only with XPS 13 models with a Core i7 chip and touch screens that have a resolution of 3200 x 1800. That drags up the price to $1749.99. A chart shown at an Intel investor conference last week showed PC selling prices reaching its highest since 2011, when a decline in PC shipments started. Intel is also selling chips at higher prices, which is adding to PC costs. Intel PC chip prices went up by 7 percent in 2016, but the company also sold more Core i7 chips as sales of gaming and VR systems increased. Analyst firm TrendForce predicted SSD prices would go up in the first quarter of this year, continuing a trend from the previous quarters. SSD adoption, as a replacement for hard drives, is growing, but the supply of NAND flash has tightened, which is driving up prices. The price of DRAM is also going up because of shortages. Memory is a boom-or-bust market and extremely volatile with prices falling drastically when DRAM floods the market. PC DRAM prices went up by 30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter, TrendForce said in a statement this week. TrendForce is predicting that DRAM prices may increase by up to 40 percent in the first quarter, due to undersupply. The news isn't any better looking forward. "Rising prices are expected for the second quarter as well," said Avril Wu, research director of DRAMeXchange, which is a part of TrendForce and tracks component pricing. Lenovo's Lanci also expected the memory shortage and price rises to continue for the coming quarter.

In light of the rise of emerging technologies, partners that can add unique layers of value are gaining greater prominence. Whether vertical or technology specific, forward-thinking partners now realise that staying vanilla seldom brings success, as customers place a premium on niche experts. Yet in parallel to the changing role of the partner, new influencers of IT are emerging across the business, with 72 per cent of IT buying decisions now made outside of the IT department. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with Telstra, discussed the changing dynamics of the channel in 2017, outlining how partners can specialise in a digital world, while attracting a new breed of buyer.

A Lot Of The OpenGL Shader Cache Code Has Landed In Mesa Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 17 February 2017 at 12:00 AM EST. 1 Comment Timothy Arceri, who is now working for Valve (on the open-source AMD driver stack after leaving Collabora), has landed significant portions of his work built upon others for providing an on-disk shader cache within Mesa. Within the past few hours, Arceri has landed a number of the GLSL shader cache patches into mainline Mesa. This is work dating back years and originating with Intel Linux developers for allowing OpenGL GLSL shaders to be cached on-disk for speeding up load times and improving the performance for games that load shaders on the fly. This shader cache support has become much more pressing in the past year or two with more demanding games arriving for Linux, such as Shadow of Mordor being a good example. While the core shader work has landed, as of writing this article, none of the driver-specific work has landed for actually enabling the shader cache functionality like in i965 or RadeonSI. But given this work now landing, the rest shouldn't be too far behind. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(Photo: Saul Loeb, AFP/Getty Images) 14111 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 34 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that he had directed newly installed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate alleged leaks of classified information, citing recent published accounts of his private telephone calls with world leaders as well as the public airing of sensitive deliberations that led to the firing of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump’s disclosure, in the midst of a meandering and combative White House news conference, immediately revived concerns previously voiced by Democratic lawmakers that Sessions could not assert his independence as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Shumer, D-N.Y.,  has called on Sessions to recuse himself from the ongoing investigation into contacts between Trump associates and Russian government officials, while California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee’s ranking Democrat, on Thursday asked that Sessions limit contacts between the White House and the Justice Department. “We ask that you comply with longstanding Justice Department policy, limiting communications between the White House and Justice Department, particularly with respect to criminal or civil enforcement matters,’’ Feinstein said in a letter to the attorney general that was co-signed by the other Democratic Judiciary panel members. “We ask that you circulate a memorandum to the heads of department components, the United States attorneys offices, and the White House that makes clear the policy the Department of Justice will implement.’’ Read more: Trump says political opponents are behind intelligence leaks about Russia Democrats press for Trump-Russia probes on all fronts Democrats not sold on Trump's answers, claims in news conference The Justice Department declined to comment Thursday on Trump's remarks and the president's contacts with the new attorney general. "I actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks,'' Trump said Thursday. "These are criminal leaks.'' Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have bombarded Justice with calls for inquiries into alleged disclosures of classified information, primarily related to the ongoing federal inquiry into communications between Trump associates and Russian government officials during the past year. Earlier this week, aspects of that inquiry splashed into the public domain when it was revealed that acting Attorney General Sally Yates last month alerted the White House counsel that, contrary to public denials by top Trump administration officials, intercepted pre-inaugural communications between Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the U.S. included discussions of Russian sanctions imposed by the Obama administration. Yates' warning came shortly after FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his discussions with the ambassador. In that interview, Flynn's responses were described Thursday by a U.S. official familiar with the matter as nuanced and not entirely forthcoming. Making false statements to the FBI is a felony, but the official — who is not authorized to publicly discuss the matter — said Flynn's statements did not appear to rise to the level of warranting criminal charges. The Washington Post reported Thursday that Flynn denied discussing sanctions in the FBI interview. Trump, meanwhile, claimed that he did not direct Flynn to raise the issue of sanctions in the call with the ambassador. But he went on to say that he found nothing wrong with the former national security adviser's actions. "Mike was doing his job,'' Trump said Thursday. He said Flynn was dismissed for misleading Vice President Pence about his discussions with the ambassador. At least for now, the person who likely will have the last word on Flynn's possible legal exposure and the course of the ongoing Russian inquiry is Sessions. And an aide to the former Alabama senator said the attorney general is unaware of any information that would prompt his recusal from overseeing the ongoing investigation.

(Photo: Mario Tama, Getty Images) 1579 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump said he will issue a new executive order next week to revive his temporary shutdown of the U.S. refugee program and ban against admitting immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. The Jan. 27 order has been blocked by federal judges. During his press conference Thursday, Trump said he disagreed with rulings from two courts that have kept his order from being enforced since Feb. 3. But rather than continuing that legal fight, Trump said he will issue a new order that would survive legal scrutiny. “The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad (judicial) decision,” Trump said. The Department of Justice confirmed that strategy in a brief it filed Thursday, saying it would not seek another appeal from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals due to the president’s upcoming order. Trump’s executive order temporarily barred citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and Syrian citizens indefinitely. The order caused widespread chaos as people from those countries were detained at U.S. airports or prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights around the world. READ MORE: Trump immigration raids show greater focus on non-criminals Analysis: Trump's press conference was a spectacle for the ages Fact check: Here's what Trump got wrong at news conference In the days that followed, federal judges from Massachusetts to New York to Hawaii issued emergency stays prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security from implementing the order in their states. Then, on Feb. 3, District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a nationwide temporary restraining order, arguing that Trump’s ban likely violated the due process rights of citizens from the seven countries who had become legal permanent residents of the U.S. or had entered the country on valid visas. Trump bashed that ruling, calling Robart a “so-called judge.” The next stop was the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel issued a unanimous ruling on Feb. 9 upholding Robart’s order. Trump also lashed out at those judges — two appointed by Democratic presidents, one by a Republican — accusing them of being politically motivated. Trump said the temporary ban is necessary to give his intelligence agencies time to improve the screening process for foreigners trying to enter the country from terror-prone countries. He wants to institute “extreme vetting” procedures and said federal law gives him the power to suspend immigration from specific countries because it’s in the national security interests of the U.S. Attorneys representing Washington state and Minnesota, which filed the lawsuit against Trump’s ban, conceded that presidents have broad powers to enforce immigration, but argued that Trump overstepped his authority. They said Trump’s order unfairly targeted people based on their religion as a result of his repeated promises to institute a “Muslim ban.” And they said foreigners legally allowed to be in the U.S. were not given an opportunity to challenge their right to enter the country. One possible solution for Trump is to reissue a new order that only bars travel for people from those seven countries who have never entered the U.S. previously.

Finding a buyer might prove to be even more difficult. The Tokyo-based conglomerate had been entertaining offers for a minor stake in the flash-memory operations, until it booked a $6.3 billion writedown in its nuclear unit this week. President Satoshi Tsunakawa said he’s now open to selling a majority share or even the entire division to repair the company’s balance sheet. The search for a buyer is likely to last beyond Toshiba’s earlier March 31 deadline for the deal, a person familiar with the matter said. For competitors SK Hynix Inc., Western Digital Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., buying Toshiba’s business would represent a rare opportunity to close the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics Co. Demand for flash, or NAND, memory is still robust because it’s the main storage in the more than one billion smartphones sold every year, and it’s increasingly being used in data centers to house the flood of data created as computing shifts to the cloud. “Toshiba finally recognized the reality that whoever is going to invest in the NAND business is going to want a majority of it,” said Zuhair Khan, an analyst at Jefferies in Tokyo. Any prospective buyer of Toshiba’s chip business would have to clear a number of hurdles, including being able to pony up as much as $14 billion, antitrust considerations and the Japanese government’s reluctance to lose a key technology. The government is closely watching developments at Toshiba and considers flash-memory a technology that is “ extremely important” to the nation’s growth strategy, a top official said this week. It’s a familiar line in a country that over the past few decades has seen its dominant position in semiconductors and flat panels pass to South Korean and Taiwanese rivals. Toshiba, Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and NEC Corp. took away the market for computer memory from Intel Corp., International Business Machines Corp., and other U.S. companies in the late 1970s. That memory-chip business then became the foundation of Samsung’s rise to become a global electronics giant in the 1980s and 1990s, when it successfully mimicked its neighbor’s concentration on improving production and eventually overtook competitors. While Taiwanese latecomers struggled in memory, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. pioneered chip outsourcing and put pressure on the non-memory businesses of Japanese companies, which heavily focused on the needs of the groups that owned them and were late to look for a broader customer base. Toshiba is the only Japanese manufacturer left that’s kept pace in the expensive race to build and maintain leading-edge chip-production facilities. With factories costing more than $5 billion to build and equip, market share is important in providing the volume of orders for the commodity chips that allow companies to get a return on their investment. About a third of the $30 billion market for flash-memory chips is served by Samsung’s factories, close to the same amount as its next two rivals combined, giving it a huge advantage in costs and scale. Toshiba is second with about 20 percent, followed by its manufacturing partner Western Digital. Micron and Hynix have about 10 percent each. Historically, Samsung has ignored opportunities to acquire and focused on building its own plants. The company’s already-dominant share in the market would also likely rule out the South Korean giant as a potential buyer. Hynix, on the other hand, would be an eager buyer with deep enough pockets for the deal, according to Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities Co. It has already offered to pay at least 2 trillion won ($1.8 billion) for a smaller stake, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said earlier this month. “Hynix may really want Toshiba bad, because a wealthy Chinese company buying it would cause even a bigger headache,” said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co. “The marriage would make Hynix even bigger than the industry leader Samsung in NAND chips.” China has said it’s prepared to spend more than $100 billion building a domestic semiconductor industry that will give it the ability to serve its home market, the world’s largest. The country has seen several attempts to acquire U.S. assets rebuffed on regulatory concerns, but it remains determined to acquire expertise. Currently China doesn’t have locally owned plants capable of producing chips based on the most advanced manufacturing, a skill set that’s just as important as designing the circuitry. Toshiba’s initial offer of only partial stakes of the chip unit may have been motivated by concern about losing control. Yet control is most likely what its rivals are interested in as they consider whether to make an approach. The cost of maintaining plants that otherwise would quickly become obsolete is the first demand on most chipmakers’ balance sheets. Without that or guaranteed supply at a low price from Toshiba, they’re just propping up a rival that can hurt them. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Micron has been building scale through joint ventures and a string of acquisitions of the assets of rivals who’ve struggled to keep up with the spending requirements. In 2013 the U.S. company paid $2.4 billion to buy Japanese computer-memory maker Elpida. Those acquisitions have come at a cost. Micron had about $10 billion of debt compared with cash and investments of $4.3 billion at the end of its most recent quarter. Chief Financial Officer Ernie Maddock told investors at a recent meeting that the company’s priority was on paying down that debt load. Micron would also be a tough choice for Toshiba. While acquisitive, the U.S. company has typically waited until targets have run out of money and been desperate to sell. It’s also shown a willingness to walk away at the last moment if it doesn’t get what it wants, such as in 2002, when it ended negotiations to acquire Hynix Semiconductor. Unlike Micron, Western Digital is already a partner with Toshiba through partial joint-venture ownership of some of the Japanese company’s chip facilities, acquired via its purchase of SanDisk Corp. last year. That $12 billion transaction, aimed at bringing in chips that are the future of storage technology, left Western Digital saddled with $13.3 billion of debt. It had $5.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents at the end of its most recent quarter. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

When HP released the updated version of the 13-inch Spectre x360 at the end of 2016, many sources were quick in calling it the best Windows 10 device of the year. iTech Post was just one of the sources who called the HP hybrid the best laptop of the year. “If you’re in the market for the best laptop of 2016, HP has something special for you. The HP Spectre x360 is probably the most complete and well-rounded laptop that you can get this year. Not only is it a fully functional hybrid laptop, it also comes with competitive specs.” The review praised the small bezel around the 1080p screen. It didn’t consider the 1080p screen problematic, but some potential buyers did. A 1080p screen on a 13-inch laptop was groundbreaking in 2012, but many others have Quad HD or higher resolution screens. But last week, HP unveiled the 4K version of the Spectre x360. Not only did they increase the screen resolution, but they also now offer pen support. Has the Microsoft Surface Book met its challenge? [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] HP has released a definite alternative to the higher-end Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. In fact, it will probably compete with the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 since it has Intel’s latest i7 Core Kaby Lake processor. It also has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. The $1599 price tag is pretty reasonable for what you get. Like many other new laptops that have the new i7 Core Kaby Lake processor, the x360 has the “coil whine” problem with the fan noise, but it is not as prevalent as it is on the new XPS 13 or Lenovo Yoga 910. The whistling is faint, but the fan, which sounds like static, can get pretty loud. However, it’s something that’s only noticeable in a very quiet environment. HP has never been known for making beautiful screens, but this has changed. Instead of using cheap PenTile technology, which many say really reduces resolution, the screen on the x360 is almost as high quality as you can get. Images are vivid and colorful, and the viewing angles are very wide. However, the colors are not as accurate as they are on the MacBook Pro or Dell XPS 13. The contrast ratio is good, but not excellent. The Spectre x360 can fold back into a tablet. [Image by Daryl Deino] Everything else on the new x360 is almost perfect. The keyboard is the best that has ever been put on a laptop device as the keys feel solid and have a decent amount of travel. The Bang & Olufsen speakers match the excellent speakers on the MacBook Pro in that they provide bass and depth. The whole device, made of machine aluminum, feels absolutely solid. Due to the fact that the Spectre x360 has a 4K screen, you don’t get as much battery life as you would on the MacBook Pro or even the new Dell XPS 13. Power users can expect to get about five hours of use, and the average user will certainly get six. Minimizing the brightness adds more life, but then the beautiful screen becomes less vivid. HP includes an N-Trig pen that is better and more accurate than the N-Trig pen included with the Surface Pro or Surface Book. Putting the device in tablet mode feels a little strange since it is a widescreen device. It would have been great if HP made a 3:2 ratio device, but the 16:9 screen is better for watching movies or putting two screens next to each other in order to multitask. Once you get your hands on HP’s new laptop hybrid (which does get pretty hot at times), it will be hard to take them off. HP has proven they can make reasonably priced laptops that compete with the best.

Samsung Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, executive editor at The Verge and editor at large of Recode. About a year ago, I wrote a column suggesting what the major tech companies should try and accomplish in 2016. For Google, I said: “It would be pretty great if Chromebooks could, out of the box, run all Android apps — provided that, unlike on the recent Pixel C tablet, the Android apps were able to adapt better to a bigger screen.” I’m happy to report that the first Chromebook designed from the ground up to run Android apps out of the box has arrived, albeit a little past the end of 2016. It goes on sale this week for $450. It’s called the Samsung Chromebook Plus, and it runs on an ARM processor, the same type of processor that powers the vast majority of smartphones and tablets. It was designed in close cooperation with Google. Alas, in my tests of the Plus over the last few days, I found the Android execution frustrating. Google Play The Android app feature is still in beta, not all apps work, and too many of those that do run seem like awkwardly blown-up phone apps, not software that’s tailored for the Chromebook's 12-inch screen. And there are other issues. Of course, the Plus, which has a touchscreen and comes with a stylus, is still a Chromebook. That means it runs the Chrome OS along with Android apps. And, purely as a Chromebook, it’s very nice. Chrome OS, which is basically a browser that runs everything, including web apps, does fine on this model and its ARM processor. But if you’re looking for a laptop-style, bigger-screen version of your favorite Android phone, I can’t recommend the Plus now. Optimizing a large number of Android apps for the Chromebook is “going to be a long process, to be honest,” one Google official conceded, noting the beta label on the Google Play Store for the Chromebook. Samsung A second, very similar, new Samsung Chromebook, the Pro, is due out in April. The only significant difference between the two is that the Pro runs on a low-end Intel processor and costs $100 more. I tested it briefly, and found it to be even buggier in its current, very pre-release state. I won’t say much about the otherwise identical hardware on these two Samsung machines, since I think it’s the Google-driven Android / Chrome OS combo software that’s their key claim to fame. Their screens are vivid, sharp and responsive. As on many laptops, you can rotate the screen around so that the relatively thin, light, 2.4-pound laptop becomes a relatively heavy, thick tablet. The stylus fits nicely in a slot and works well for things like screen capture, taking handwritten notes and annotating images. The overall design isn’t especially sexy or sleek. The keyboard lacks a backlight, and the touchpad is a tad small. In my tests, battery life was just shy of eight hours, even with heavy web and app use and streaming a full-length movie. For a better understanding of the hardware (as well as his own take on the software), I recommend my colleague Dieter Bohn’s reviews of the Plus and the Pro. Android writ large. Um, no. Compared to running apps on a smartphone, or, more aptly, an iPad, the app experience on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is distinctly subpar. There are likely several reasons for this. Even though this laptop uses the same processor family most Android devices use, the apps are running atop Chrome OS. Google deserves credit for making this work at all, but it’s still a bit laggy and buggy. For instance, in one case I ran into, two Android apps on the Plus were open but unusable, because they kept blinking and jumping in front and in back of each other rapidly. This happened while I was on the phone with a Google exec who worked on the project. He said it was a known bug that will be patched this week. And there are other bugs. In my tests, Android apps just crashed or froze multiple times a day on the Plus. Even a hugely popular app like Facebook only loaded into part of the screen with an endless spinning circle in a blank right rail. And Google’s own Gmail crashed when I was attaching a photo to a message. Samsung But there’s a larger, more fundamental problem: Android apps, including Google’s own, are almost never designed to look right and run right on a large screen — even a standard-sized tablet, let alone a laptop. There are two elements to this. One is visual: Many Android apps look like blown-up phone apps. Some, like Google News & Weather and Google Docs, don’t seem to resize for the bigger screen, so they present a relatively narrow column of text swimming in unnaturally large borders. Others, like Facebook Messenger, stretch the text horizontally to fill the space, in a weird way that makes the type tiny. The other is functional: Most Android apps I downloaded to the Plus didn’t use the larger screens to add helpful extra panels or other UI elements, but still had the narrow, cramped UI of a phone screen. This is in stark contrast to the way iOS apps behave on larger iPad screens versus iPhone screens. For instance, on the iPad, Facebook Messenger has two panels — one for contacts and one for conversations. It doesn’t look like the single-column version on iPhones and Android phones — and on the Plus. That’s because Apple has long given developers the tools and the encouragement to do dual (or “universal”) versions of their apps, and its app store installs the bigger-screen versions on iPads. Samsung Google says it is working hard to do this, but it has been saying that for years. The company says it’s optimizing its own apps for the Chromebook and urging third parties to do the same. But, judging from the 20 or so well-known Android apps I tested, this process is just starting. The company conceded it had done special work to make several of its most popular Android apps, such as Gmail and Google Calendar, look and work well. But it also said that it believes most Chromebook users will still use many productivity apps like these in the browser. Another issue: In tablet mode, apps are always full screen. You can’t create the multi-app views or even narrow sidebar views of apps that you can on an iPad or a Windows tablet. Google says this will be possible in a future release. Bottom line If you buy the Chromebook Plus and intend to use it mainly as a Chromebook, I expect you’ll have a good experience. But if you plan to rely heavily on Android apps, you’re basically buying into the start of a journey, replete with odd-looking presentations of familiar apps, bugs and crashes. You can certainly go along with Google and Samsung on this journey, but I can’t recommend that for a mainstream Android lover who just wants things to work right.

Chris Leckness10/01/2010 Is your data safe? With so many people using smart phones now, it’s only a matter of time before evil deeds begin to unravel. We trust our smart phones with so much private, sensitive info about our lives. We have all our friends and families contact data in there, many have their credit cards and passwords stuffed into notes and applications, banking apps legitimately transmitting your financial data. It’s really scary how much we can stand to share with the wrong folks if a malicious app mines our data. It might not be anything too serious right now, but an article on arstechnica paints a scary picture. Advertisement The results of a study conducted by researchers from Duke University, Penn State University, and Intel Labs have revealed that a significant number of popular Android applications transmit private user data to advertising networks without explicitly asking or informing the user. This is quite shocking and scary to say the least. It brings back memories of an app earlier this year that was sending users cell numbers to a server in China. That might have been a big misunderstanding, but I’d be willing to be that a ton of developers would love to mine data from smartphones for their gain. The MMO gaming industry is full of scams trying to get into your game accounts to sell off your in game goods. Imagine what the marketing data from 1000’s of teens and young adults phones would fetch in the right market. This type of thing, harmless or not, is what makes Apple’s and soon enough, Microsoft’s closed OS more attractive. We complain about how Apple evaluates and scrutinizes each app submitted, but preventing something like this makes me feel better about the process. Would Apple’s reviewers actually catch something like this? I would hope so, but I suppose that some could make it through. With Android becoming more popular each day, thanks in part to Motorola and Verizon’s brilliant marketing, it becomes more of a target to hackers and viruses. So, according to arstechnica, these researchers developed an app called TaintDroid and proceeded to test 30 popular free Android apps. They found that half of the apps were sending private data to ad servers. This info included GPS data and phone numbers. They also reported that some of them were reporting as frequent as every 30 seconds. Imagine what that does to you phone’s battery. How can you protect yourself from these types of applications? Well, it’s not as simple as saying yes or no. I guess Google requires the developers to let the user know during installation that the app wants to use your location data, etc. The problem is, sometimes this request doesn’t seem out of line for the type app you are installing. I’ve never seen an app pop up a confirmation box that says, “AppX wants to share your phone number and GPS location with advertisers. Is this ok?”. I guess the best advice to protect yourself is to be careful. Don’t install apps from companies you do not trust. If an app that you know has zero reason to use your location info asks for permission to use it, run away. If you suddenly start experiencing less than average battery performance, evaluate the recent app additions and do some homework online. Maybe something you installed is sending data. I am sure more on this will come out soon since arstechnica says that these results are being presented next week at the Usenix OSDI conference. Update: Looks like Engadget has some new info regarding this report, including the list of apps and a corporate mumbo jumbo response from Google on the matter. Advertisement 12 Responses 10/01/2010 Rob C Reply You would think a site that complains about the mis-reporting of the nonexistance of Windows slates would not conflate open source software with a (relatively) open ecosystem and market, versus a closed and tightly controlled ecosystem and market. Android is an open source operating system. The applications you’re complaining about ARE NOT open source software. If they were, one could inspect the source code & readily identify the privacy issues that concern you. One could even remive the offending bits and redistribute the new version. The open-ness you complain about really is nothing new (Windows is open in that sense, as well as Mac OS, as well as any web 2.0 app or any web site whose privacy statement you don’t read) and has NOTHING to do with open source software. Please, don’t perpetuate this musunderstanding. 10/01/2010 shauns Reply Honestly, this has nothing at all to do with open source. It happens on all mobile operating systems. It doesn’t matter whether you use Android, iOS, WP7 or anything else. Applications can and do collect and share data, on any OS. Sure, other than Google, Apple CAN prevent apps from doing this. But they don’t. Apple has even been collecting location data without the users’ knowledge (!) for years – long before they inroduced iAds. Apple may be quick to reject apps they don’t like, but their AppStore is equally full of “spy” apps. The best solution would be informing the user which data is collected and who it is sent to. Android (as opposed to other systems) at least shows what kinds of data an app CAN collect, but there should be a way to find out whether the data is sent to advertisers. 10/01/2010 Rob C Reply Q: Security Holes: Is this the cost of an open source Mobile OS? A: No 10/01/2010 Chris Leckness Reply Ok, maybe the title should have been: Security Holes: Is this the cost of an open ecosystem Regardless of what the title is, the facts still remain that transmission of user data without consent is no good. Shauns – Could you point me in the direction of a report that shows that some iPhone apps transmit data without the users knowledge? I am not saying that there are not apps that can and will, but I am fairly sure that no iPhone app is sitting their dormant pings your details out every 30 seconds or so since Apple won’t allow apps to run in the background. (not 100% sure how permissions are in iOS 4.x though) 10/01/2010 Rob C Reply No, not maybe. In fact, why haven’t you changed the title? It’s a factual error as a result of a writer being uninformedvin his own field, noy a matter of opinion. The type of thing you expect to seebin your local paper, not what purports to be a tech blog. It reminds me of an article I read in Byte during its dying days that referred to “IDE (integrated development enviromment) drives”. 10/01/2010 Mike Reply The title of this, as others have said, is ill conceived and reactionary. Having said that, I would like to see Google close such capabilities down. It would be nice if android (or any systems) had an easy to use logger that showed exactly which applications were transmitting and how much they were transmitting. It could also provide some specific areas of memory for storage of sensitive data and log what applications are accessing that and when. Something akin to a firewall which not only showed the information but allowed the blocking of such activity both for net transmission and for access to this restricted memory area. It would be a nice addition. 10/02/2010 Rob C Reply Since you’re such a stickler for the journalistic method and demand sources, Chris – wouldn’t want to get anything wrong or essentially rephrase what someone else said and slap a random headline on it – how about the study reference in this article from July: http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/research/6941.html Please note that this article makes no mention of open source nature of Android (because it’s irrelevant) and concludea that Google and Android provide better controls for how code accesses private data, which is important because the issue typically isn’t malevolent developers (are you really concerned about Evernote selling yor data to the mafia? Then perhaps you shouldn’t be using their service at all, because its very purpose is to store your personal and sensitive data on their servers.) Back to your headline and article: the study you originally referenced looked at Android. It didn’t look at Iphone apps and give them a clean bill of health. You drew your own conclusion based on speculation, essentially resatated it as fact, then put an inaccurate headline on it to not only drive your speculation home as fact, but to incorrectly drag the open source/closed source debate into it. Google open source software security and Windows vulnerabilities; educate yourself a little. Quoting from _More iPhone than Android apps can access sensitive user information_: The App Genome Project has scanned almost 300,000 applications and fully mapped close to 100,000 in order to understand how applications are interacting with personal data on phones and identify prominent security threats. So far, findings suggest that Android applications tap into sensitive data, such as contact lists, less often than comparable applications for the iPhone. … While more free Android applications (47 percent) include third-party code than comparable iPhone applications (23 percent), Lookout says that the permission model of the iPhone platform makes it easier for such code to cause applications to access sensitive data. 10/02/2010 Dale Lane Reply It’s been said in the comments already, but while the headline remains unchanged it’s worth another comment – the existence of spyware and malware for a platform has nothing to do with the platform being open source.

We like it so much, we even made it one of our top picks for both 2016 and 2015. This year, though, Dell is changing things up a bit with an all-new model: The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1. Yes, Dell has turned the XPS 13 into a hybrid laptop-tablet thanks to a new 360-degree-hinged display. The PC maker also lopped off some of the XPS 13’s already slim chassis and added a new webcam to the mix. The XPS 13 2-in-1 does have a few quirks, namely the odd placement of the aforementioned webcam and a slower processor than the standard XPS 13. But overall, the XPS 13 2-in-1 ($1,299 as tested) is a solid offering that’s nearly as good as its stablemate. View photos The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 has a stylish palm rest and wonderful keyboard.More Cutting the fat Dell’s original XPS 13 is an attractive, well-built machine. So it’s nice to see that the PC maker didn’t alter much of that system’s DNA when it came time to build the XPS 13 2-in-1. The laptop’s aluminum lid features an understated Dell logo, while its carbon fiber palm rest gives the system a unique look and feel that’s durable, but smooth to the touch. At 12 x 7.8 x 0.54 inches, the XPS 13 2-in-1 is slightly slimmer than the standard XPS 13, which measures 12 x 9.3 x 0.6 inches. Both laptops weigh 2.7 pounds. The XPS 13 2-in-1 360-degree touchscreen folds smoothly, but is sturdy enough to prevent any unnecessary play when in laptop mode. Like its predecessor, XPS 13 2-in-1’s gorgeous InfinityEdge display sports ultra-thin bezels that makes it feel like you’re holding nothing more than a screen when using the system in tablet mode. View photos Dell made a thin laptop even thinner with the XPS 13 2-in-1.More I use a MacBook Air 13-inch (starting at $999) as my daily driver and the size difference between it and the XPS 13 2-in-1 is quite noticeable. The XPS isn’t just shorter and slimmer than Apple’s (AAPL) offering; it weighs less, too. It’s not as if the Air weighs a ton, either. But every ounce counts when you’ve got a bag that’s already overflowing with pens, unopened bills and random deodorant sticks — don’t ask — like mine. That said, the MacBook comes with a more powerful processor, so if you’re looking for a system with more oomph, you’ll probably go with the Air. The closest competitor Apple offers to the XPS 13 2-in-1 is the standard 12-inch MacBook (starting at $1,299), which is narrower, thinner and lighter than the Dell. However, the XPS can also be used as a tablet, which is more useful than saving a few extra tenths of an inch. A tablet with no edges The XPS 2-in-1’s 13-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 display is absolutely gorgeous, though not as sharp as the optional 3,200 x 1,800 panel. Still, movies looked clear and colors were radiant. The notebook’s screen is also exceptionally bright, making it easy to view if you ever happen to use it out in the midday sun. Using the XPS 13 2-in-1 as a tablet is a bit odd at first, though. The slate is pretty wide in portrait mode, which makes holding it feel a bit uncomfortable when you’re not resting it on your lap or a table. I did, however, like flipping the display over and using the keyboard as a stand to watch movies while making dinner. View photos The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is a bit large for a tablet, but its screen certainly is gorgeous.More Read More There’s one annoying thing about XPS 13 2-in-1’s design: its webcam placement. See, like the original XPS 13, the 2-in-1’s webcam is situated along the laptop’s bottom bezel, just below the screen. But rather than placing it off-center as Dell did with the regular XPS, the company centered the camera. That’s great and all, but you still end up giving the person you’re video chatting with a nice view of your chin and nostrils. You can certainly fix that by using the 2-in-1 in tent mode, but you shouldn’t have to do that at all. So-so power Here’s the thing about the XPS 13 2-in-1. In order to make it slim and lightweight enough to use as a tablet, Dell eliminated the laptop’s internal fans. And to ensure that the system didn’t have a meltdown without its fans, the company swapped out the standard XPS 13’s Intel processor for a power-sipping Intel chip that produces less heat. The problem? That CPU is also less powerful than the one found in the regular XPS. While Dell markets the XPS 13 2-in-1 as running on an Intel Core i7 chip, it’s not the beefy Core i7 you’re probably hoping it is. Instead, it’s a Core i7 7Y75, which is an updated and rebranded version of Intel’s old Core M chips. View photos The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 doesn’t have as powerful a processor as the standard XPS 13.More Why does that matter? Because the XPS 13 2-in-1’s processor isn’t nearly as powerful as the CPU found in the standard 13. That doesn’t mean the 2-in-1 is underpowered in any way. On the contrary; with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive, the XPS 13 2-in-1 is more than powerful enough for your average someone who simply wants to surf the web with 20 browser tabs open, stream Spotify and talk to coworkers on Slack. But if you want to do things like photo editing and gaming, the XPS 13 2-in-1 will have trouble keeping up. Should you get it? Dell already won me over with the original XPS 13, so I was hesitant when I originally fired up the XPS 2-in-1. But being able to use the system as a slate is certainly welcome. Still, I’d gladly sacrifice that 360-degree hinge for a more capable processor. If you’re the kind of person who wants to do basic web browsing and doesn’t expect to do any kind of heavy photo editing or the like, the XPS 13 2-in-1 is an excellent choice. If you’re looking for more power, though, stick with the standard XPS 13.

A highly functioning data center has several requirements, including high performance, availability, scalability, manageability, power (EMAILWIRE.COM, February 17, 2017 ) Factors such as proliferation of cloud computing, advantages of SSDs over HDDs, increase in the number of data centers, and rising big data applications are driving the growth of the solid state drives market. ♦Get Informative PDF Brochure: http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownload.asp?id=75076578 SATA interface is expected to lead the solid state drives during the forecast period SATA is expected to account for the highest share of the solid state drives market during the forecast period. The old desktop PCs support only the SATA interface for upgrading to SSDs from HDDs, which is expected to drive the growth of the market for SSDs with SATA interface. Further, lower pricing of SATA than that of SAS and PCIe interfaces is also contributing to the growth of this market. The market for SSDs with PCIe interface is expected to grow at the highest CAGR between 2016 and 2022 The market for SSDs with PCIe interface is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the advantages of PCIe, which include high speed, enhanced performance scaling, and detailed error detection & reporting. Thus, the demand for SSDs with PCIe interface is expected to increase from the client as well as enterprise end users. APAC is expected to witness a rapid growth during the forecast period The SSDs market in APAC is expected to grow at the highest CAGR between 2016 and 2022. This growth can be attributed to the high IT infrastructure expenditures in countries such as China, South Korea, India, and Taiwan. In addition, the expanding customer base of companies in APAC that provide SSDs and growth in the consumer electronics (such as notebooks/laptops, tablets, and desktop PCs) market are contributing to the growth of the SSDs market in this region. The key players involved in the development of solid state drives include Intel Corp. (U.S.), Micron Technology, Inc. (U.S.), Samsung Electronics (South Korea), SanDisk Corp. (U.S.), Toshiba Corp. (Japan), Lite-On Technology Corp. (Taiwan), Microsemi Corp. (U.S.), Seagate Technology plc (Ireland.), Hitachi Global Storage Technology (HGST) Inc. (U.S.), and Kingston Technology Corp. (U.S.).

Art Books Film Music TV Joseph Sohm / Shutterstock, Inc Daily Engagement: Call the House Oversight Committee to Demand Investigation into Michael Flynn Jason Chaffetz, so dogged in his pursuit of Hillary Clinton's email server, seems to mysteriously have lost his bite. He needs... encouragement. Politics | By Moze Halperin | February 14, 2017 Daily Engagement is a new, brief, daily feature on Flavorwire. It’s aimed at helping people feel somewhat less helpless and hopeless (or at least in control of their helplessness and hopelessness) in the midst of a political news cycle that’s been doling out daily affronts to human decency. Every day, we’ll post one easy thing that people can do to continue to resist the current state of politics under the Trump administration, focusing on the creative ways (we are a culture website after all) that citizens are finding to resist. Michael Flynn’s resignation could be a revelatory moment regarding the innumerable rumors of ties to Russia within the Trump administration. Beginning prior to the election and recurring consistently since, the rumors have run the gamut from collusion to urination. Some of them have been credible, and others hysterically dumb — we won’t know whether they’re true, or just a fantastical fallacy liberals (like me) want to believe to discredit a terrible administration, unless they’re investigated. And some Republicans — particularly Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz — are making it damn hard to investigate any of them, even with mounting evidence of a lot of investigation-worthy shit. Concern certainly seems valid: Donald Trump apparently was told two weeks ago that Flynn withheld information from Vice President Mike Pence. It was largely the withholding of information that led to Flynn’s resignation. And as Ryan Lizza writes in the New Yorker, Flynn’s explanation of the omission as a “whoopsie” — wherein he forgot to mention that he’d discussed Obama administration sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak due to a “rush” of everything going on in the transition period — raises new questions, the most important of which is: is it possible that Flynn also forgot to mention, perhaps, that his boss asked him to raise that subject? “Did Trump instruct Flynn to discuss a potential easing of sanctions with Russia? Did Flynn update Trump on his calls with the Russian Ambassador? Did Trump know that Flynn lied to Pence about those contacts?” Lizza asks. These seem like things to…investigate. On the Intercept, Robert Mackey writes, “Looking back at one of Trump’s own tweets, which he posted on December 30 — the day after Flynn secretly urged Russia not to respond to the Obama administration’s new sanctions — makes it hard not to wonder if he knew about his aide’s effort to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to delay.” The tweet in question praises Putin’s decision: “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart!” As Mackey points out, the news that acting attorney general Sally Yates (yeah, the one Trump fired) had already informed the White House about Flynn’s omission could also indicate that Trump was “feigning surprise … when he was asked about reports that his aide had talked about sanctions.” More reasons, surely, to investigate. The Republicans haven’t all been actively inactive in the wake of this news. Today, one Republican Senator — Roy Blunt, of Missouri — has, per CNN, called f0r an “exhaustive investigation into Trump-Russia connections” in the wake of Flynn’s resignation. The Senator said on a program on St. Louis’ KTRS radio: I think everybody needs that investigation to happen…And the Senate Intelligence Committee, again that I serve on, has been given the principle responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned. Meanwhile, as the Washington Post reports, congressional Democrats are suggesting the formation of a separate committee to press for investigations of the Trump administration, with a key goal being “to increase political pressure on Republicans to take more investigative action.” Which brings me back to the point of this post. Beyond rare cases like Blunt (and Senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham, who’re apparently also beginning inquiries through the Armed Services Committee), most Republicans remain defiantly apathetic about the new findings. (Largely, it would seem, because so many of them have already entrenched themselves in Trumpism for their own political gain, contorting their already deeply-flexible alleged morals into greasy political pretzels.) This is particularly true in the House of Representatives. Speaker Paul Ryan said, “I’ll leave it to the administration to describe the circumstances surrounding what brought to this point.” As another Post article emphasizes, the great absurdity is that Paul Ryan then stated there needs to be more information before an investigation would be launched — despite the fact that the very point of the investigation would be to gather said information. While the Senate seems to be on track to begin investigations, it’s a bit more iffy in the House. Which brings us back to Chaffetz. As chairman of the House’s central investigative committee, the House Oversight Committee, Chaffetz was known during the election for backing all kinds of probes into Clinton’s emails. Surely, then, such a fearless watchdog will be all over this issue? Nope. The Congressman has said he won’t pursue further investigation into Flynn’s potential ties to Russia. (He is investigating Sid the Science Kid, though, so fear not!) The aforementioned Post piece points out that after the release of  the “pussy grabbing” tape, Chaffetz said of Donald Trump, “I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president.” But then Chaffetz said he’d vote for him anyway — and has apparently since committed himself to defending the Trump administration. Here’s his statement to reporters on his decision not to investigate Flynn: I think that situation has taken care of itself. I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue…I think he did the right thing stepping down. Soon after, he made his first remotely challenging gesture, asking Trump for information about Mar-A-Lago security, following the president’s very public handling of a North Korean ballistic missile test on Saturday in the dining room of his private club. The request could be seen as a response to criticism he’s already received about his stance on Flynn. If criticism has, indeed, made him flinch at all, we can at least hope a lot more pestering will make a difference. So, if this is a concern for you, one thing to do today — and tomorrow, etc. — is to call the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and demand that Chaffetz reconsider an investigation. (I’ve seen quite a few people posting on social media about doing this, as well.) Their number is (202) 225-5074. When I tried calling, the number was busy, so: another option is, if you happen to be a constituent of a district overseen by any Representative on that committee — and there are many — try calling, and if that doesn’t work, emailing, their individual offices to ask them to press Chaffetz on an investigation. Here’s a list of the committee’s members. Though Senate is, as mentioned, seeming more active right now, it wouldn’t hurt to further encourage your Senators to support the burgeoning investigative movements therein. 5calls has a script you can use for a concise and effective call on the matter.   Daily Engagement    Donald Trump    Jason Chaffetz    Michael Flynn SHARE TWEET EMAIL Recent Posts Watch Amy Poehler and Will Ferrell as Two Concerned Parents — Who Start an Underground Casino BBC Bowie Documentary ‘David Bowie: The Last Five Years’ Has Been Purchased by HBO How the Gloriously Goofy ‘Great Wall’ Both Embraces and Subverts the “White Savior” Narrative The Sweetest Debut: Clare Mackintosh on Commuting, Paris, and Writers’ Fashion Subscribe To Our Newsletter Subscribe To Our Newsletter Art Books Film Music TV About Contact Advertise Careers Terms Privacy Art Books Film Music TV About Advertise Careers Contact Terms Privacy @2016 Flavorpill Media.

Twitter Facebook Posits to be posited for ‘approximate computing’ at Multicore World Conference to be held in Wellington from February 20 to 22 Stuart Corner (Computerworld New Zealand) 17 February, 2017 14:42 - - - - print email Comments The Multicore World 2017 conference to be held in Wellington from February 20 to 22 promises some pretty heady presentations on cutting edge technologies. How about posits, approximate computing, quantum information, exascale computing? The conference is organised by Open Parallel Ltd (New Zealand) and sponsored by MBIE, Catalyst IT, NZRise and Oracle Labs. Conference organiser and Open Parallel CEO, Nicolas Erdody, says: “The assemblage of big brains around multicore computing and parallel programming will pose questions and answers as the world moves towards exascale computing in the next decade.” He says being part of such discussions can position New Zealand technologists, entrepreneurs and scientists at the intersection of two massive global markets that will benefit the country’s future growth: decision-making (estimated in $2 trillion) and food and agriculture (estimated in $5 trillion). Among the presentations will be one from Prof Michelle Simmons, an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow and director at the Centre for Quantum Computation & Communication Technology, at the University of New South Wales. She will describe “the emerging field of quantum information, a response to the fact that device miniaturisation will soon reach the atomic limit, set by the discreteness of matter, leading to intensified research in alternative approaches for creating logic devices of the future.” As for posits and approximate computing, all will be revealed by Dr John Gustafson, former director of Intel Labs and now visiting professor at the National University of Singapore. He will "reveal a new data type called posit that provide a better solution for approximate computing.” If you can’t make Multicore World and are curious to know more. Check out this presentation given at the Stanford EE Computer Systems Colloquium on 1 February, Beyond Floating Point: Next-Generation Computer Arithmetic. The abstract explains: “A new data type called a ‘posit’ is designed for direct drop-in replacement for IEEE Standard 754 floats. Unlike unum arithmetic, posits do not require interval-type mathematics or variable size operands, and they round if an answer is inexact, much the way floats do. However, they provide compelling advantages over floats, including simpler hardware implementation that scales from as few as two-bit operands to thousands of bits.” If you are intrigued rather than bamboozled by that, a video of the talk is available.

But, a day has passed and some new information popped up. The AMD Ryzen launch date is firm and steady on March 2nd, likely 3PM CEST. Lock that date in your agenda. The new information was posted earlier today at sweclockers and does confirm the signals we've been hearing for a while now. Obviously there's an AMD Capsaicin event February the 28th. We do expect to see full product announcements that day and then on the 2nd the review embargoes will be lifted, not just for Ryzen but also for the board partners that will be selling motherboards. At the same day AMD will be launching the X370 and B350 chipsets based motherboards first. Processors wise you'll see three 8-core parts launched with availability on March the 2nd. Some webshops have however listed the 28th, so there remains to be a little confusion there. Motherboards wise a lot has surfaced online already, including details on the flagship Crosshair VI Hero and Prime X370 motherboards. Processors then: You will have noticed that the naming has been changed to Series 3 5 and 7 and no longer is it R3, R5 and R7. I do like that subtle simplified change. ALL models will be unlocked, AMD made that bold claim themselves in early January. The X models thus simply are better binned ones with less restrictions on likely voltage. AMD Ryzen 7 1800X - 499 USD AMD Ryzen R7 1800X is the flagship processor and it has has 8 cores with 16 threads and is assumed to get a Boost frequency of 4.00 GHz. The boost frequencies are not confirmed, but the indications we have seen the past few weeks would state a 4.0 GHz Turbo and 3.6 GHz base clock. No further data was revealed. Now keep in mind (if the perf is close) a similar 8-core Intel CPU would cost you about 1,200 euros, the cost for the flagship Ryzen R7 1800X processor would be 599.99 euros. These are unlocked (multiplier) processors.  AMD Ryzen 7 1700X - 389 USD The next AMD Ryzen in line is the R7 1700X, this one would again get 8 cores and 16 threads but this time at a Turbo frequency of 3.80 GHz, so yes this is pretty much the same processor, just with a lower base at 3.4 GHz and Turbo frequency. AMD Ryzen 7 1700 - 319 USD Then there is the AMD R7 Ryzen 1700, this would be a top-end CPU for gamers and yes, again you'll receive an 8 core and 16 threads processor. This time at a Turbo frequency of 3.70 GHz, the most notable being that it is the only model that indicates a TDP, which is set as 65W whereas the other two would be 95 Watt parts. The base clock frequency would be 3.0 GHz. Other models have been spotted. I personally do not think the processors listed below aside from the three aforementioned ones will launch anytime soon. Again the above three processors (we think) will launch first. All these processors would fit Socket AM4 and thus you can use the same motherboard.

Typically reviewers get 3 to 7 days with samples, mainly for the sole reason this prevents massive leaks prior to release. We will be receiving a kit obviously, but that's as much as I am allowed to share information wise. fantaskarsef Ancient Guru Posts: 6347 Joined: 2014-07-21 #5393651 Posted on: 02/16/2017 10:05 AM Yes, it's about time we see some real benches under "home" circumstances e.g. HH's testbench.

Kaarme Master Guru Posts: 489 Joined: 2013-03-10 #5393657 Posted on: 02/16/2017 10:21 AM I'd find it strange if the 4c and 6c models were to be released much later. I mean, if you look at GPUs, AMD released the entry/mainstream models a year earlier compared to the enthusiast models (Vega no sooner than this May, apparently). What kind of decision making is the company doing if they do the exact opposite with CPUs? They should release all models as soon as possible. While those 8c/16t prices are good (if the IPC is there), they aren't absolutely speaking cheap components (the cheapest costs well over 300 dollars/euros), so they won't attract the masses all over the world.

That is true. Intel does not need new CPUs, they'll just update pricing. And even if intel sold some chips at loss, they still have income from others. To grab the moment is to release everything.

If the r1700 would be the ideal choice because if you could overclock it close to the r1700x and the 1800x speeds or beyond. Just like the Fx 8320 vs the 8350 and the 8350 vs the Fx 9xxx series of CPUs. To me only time will tell.

Do you mean in the next 3 months? 6??? I would really like to know this, in case you have some info about it. I already asked this before but i´m only interested in the six core parts because the 8 cores parts are too expensive for my taste. Thanks in advance. Hilbert Hagedoorn Administrator Posts: 27640 Joined: 2000-02-22 #5393688 Posted on: 02/16/2017 12:48 PM I do not have a sound answer to that, but I expect only 8-core parts to launch and in a later stage 6 cores. Perhaps my hunch is wrong though, but honestly I do not see 4 and 6 core parts launch short term. Logic dictates further launches close to events, e.g. maybe computex in 3 months but that is pure speculation from my side. Once Ryzen launches in a week or two, perhaps these questions can be answered as there will be a briefing from AMD.

I´m gonna wait for your review or more solid info about this because i want to build a new rig and i´m not going to wait 3 more months for the six core parts, no matter how good they are... Also i can´t believe that AMD is gonna be stupid enough to only release high end Ryzen cpus that 80 or 90% or the market aren´t going to buy!... nz3777 Maha Guru Posts: 1480 Joined: 2014-01-21 #5393695 Posted on: 02/16/2017 01:08 PM Good I cant wait to check out the review, I am interested in the 1700 model. 4 pages 1 2 3 4 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

As the name implies it is based upon a 360mm radiator (Xt45) with embedded into is two DC-LT pumps and no less then six fans. That makes it a cooling tower really. These fans are three on each side and have been plced into a push pull design. The radiator has been fabbed out of copper with on the outside an aluminum shell. An optional silent adapter can be used to make this setup whisper quiet.  The core component of the Eiswand is the external 360mm full-copper radiator, which is equipped with six Eiswind fans. This means the system’s cooling power is very high, enough for any combination of CPU and GPU. Copper offers double the heat capacity of the aluminium often used in cheap systems. The six Eiswind fans are built to operate in Push&Pull configuration, to guarantee optimal radiator ventilation. The illuminated reservoir sits directly on the external radiator. There, the fill level can easily be checked through the large viewing window, and the fill port on the upper surface makes it easy to fill the loop. The elegant, likewise illuminated bottom of the Eiswand contains two DC-LT silent pumps, which are also used in several of Alphacool’s other systems. For example, they are used in the Alphacool Eisbaer, often praised for its low noise level. The pumps’ capacity is so high that even if one of them fails, there is no noticeable loss of cooling power. One pump is strong enough to keep a simple cooling loop going. This guarantees top-level security for your whole system. The included XP3 cooler is among the strongest coolers on the market and is compatible with all Intel and AMD sockets. Of course, the set also includes all the other necessary parts, such as a 3m-long hose, corresponding connectors, and the required coolant. A silent adapter also allows for nearly noiseless operation. The adapter severely restricts the pumps and fans, but only diminishes the cooling power slightly. The Alphacool Eiswand gives you an all-around carefree package for your system. Technical Details 1x 360mm XT45 full-copper radiator 6x Eiswind fans 1100/700 RPM 1x XP3 CPU cooler 1x external power supply 1x 4-pin molex extension 4x Anti-kink springs 4x straight connectors 1x Silent Adapter 7.5V 2x Quick-release connectors 2x 1L Celvin Catcher coolant You can purchase this set for just under 349 euro, more info here.
