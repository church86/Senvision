As usual, you'll find a handful of us running around the Taipei show floors next week, where we'll be getting our hands dirty with the latest PC products and components. Last year was relatively fruitful thanks to the VR explosion. Several PC brands rolled out high-end GPUs or affordable ones capable of running VR. Even Intel surprised its hardcore users with its first-ever 10-core desktop CPU. ASUS topped it all off with Zenbo -- an adorable $600 home robot that went on sale in Taiwan earlier this year.

For one, Microsoft already stole some of Computex's thunder with its own events earlier this month, so we're not expecting anything major from it next week. Intriguingly, HTC Vive has no official presence at Computex this year, which means less VR love for us. Still, based on recent leaks and launches, we've got at least a rough idea of what to expect. There's no doubt that we'll still be seeing new PCs from the likes of ASUS, MSI, Dell, Acer and more at Computex. In fact, Acer simply went ahead and announced its new laptops and tablet earlier this week, which is certainly one way to beat the competition. Since Intel's high-performance 7th gen Core chips are relatively fresh, chances are most of the new mainstream and high-end machines being unveiled next week will still be based on those. The same is true with GPUs, especially with the GTX 1050 Ti featured on the Acer Nitro 5 being pitched as a "premium" entry-level choice for discrete laptop graphics. We'll probably also see some entry-level devices running Windows 10 S. Some were already announced at Build, but this should be our first chance to get serious hands-on time with a few. As for mobile, it's really up to ASUS. It's unclear whether we can expect new ZenFones or a new ZenWatch. Though, if you recall, the depth-sensing ZenFone AR announced back at CES has yet to hit the market, so maybe we'll finally get an update about it on Monday? On a related note: Qualcomm will be doing its own thing outside of Computex this time. And sadly, it doesn't seem like we'll be hearing any announcements. After all, Qualcomm probably needs to save some surprises for MWC Shanghai next month. On the CPU side, there were rumors of an Intel "Core i9" a couple of weeks ago, followed by some new specs popping up in the SiSoft Sandra database. This is likely another 10-core CPU following last year's Core i7 Extreme Edition. But Intel's not alone. AMD will also be hosting a press conference, which will likely shed more light on its upcoming 16-core Threadripper CPU due this summer. And who knows, maybe we'll get some new GPUs too? If you're looking for something that's more suitable for the masses don't worry. Intel will probably tease, if not announce, its 8th generation Core chip (Coffee Lake) that's due in the second half of this year. We're hoping the same goes for NVIDIA's event on the same day: less on supercomputers and more on consumer GPUs. Alright, let's talk robots for bit. It's been a year since the ASUS Zenbo debuted, and so far it's only been available in Taiwan in very limited quantities. There's hope the company will be announcing new markets or at least a larger local rollout for the home robot. Failing that, ASUS is still expected to share some updates and interesting use cases for its home products. And hey, some new accessories for Zenbo would be fun, too. It also wouldn't be a surprise if ASUS wants in on the home assistant market -- just imagine a Zenbo, but much smaller and with no wheels or face. None of these nuggets will distract us from HTC's glaring absence this year at Computex. Then again, there's no stopping other exhibitors from bringing their own VR wares. And ZOTAC is hosting the world's first VR eSports tournament -- featuring ZOTAC's VR GO backpack PC and HTC Vive -- at Computex on June 3rd. That will no doubt get a lot of attention since it'll be open to the public (This editor has already rescheduled his return flight just check it out). We'll also be keeping an eye out for the funkiest PC mods on the show floor, and we may even swing by G.SKILL's overclocking tournament to see what it's all about.

Credit: Brooke Crothers) With the new Surface Pro, Microsoft made a good thing better. At the top, let's point out that it isn’t called the Surface Pro 5 -- it’s just the “new Surface Pro.” And while it looks like the Surface Pro 4, I spent some hands-on time with new device at a Microsoft Store in Los Angeles and it's very different. The most salient change is inside. The new Surface Pro packs Intel’s latest 7th Gen Core processors, besting the 6th Gen Core processors in the Surface Pro 4. Intel’s newest chips deliver better performance – particularly when handling video – and longer battery life. Generally, every new generation of Intel processors boast a host of improvements (albeit, often small improvements) that software developers don’t always take advantage of right away. So some performance improvements are seen later rather than sooner. MICROSOFT ANNOUNCES XBOX GAME PASS STARTING JUNE 1 Microsoft says the new Surface Pro delivers “50% more battery life and 50% more performance than Surface Pro 4,” according to Microsoft's description of the features. The new Surface Pro with Windows 10 Pro, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and an Intel Core m3 processor is $799. With 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a Core i5 chip, it’s $1,299. The Surface Pro Signature Type Cover keyboard/cover is sold separately for $159.99. Keyboard still key The new Surface Pro Type Cover keyboard is still sold separately. I’ve always thought it peculiar that Microsoft doesn’t sell the Surface Pro standard with the detachable keyboard because it’s such an integral part of the device: pull out the Pro’s kickstand and the keyboard turns the Surface tablet into a laptop (after all, the Surface Pro by itself is merely a tablet). And close the keyboard on top of the display and it serves as a protective shield. The new Surface model comes with Alcantara keyboards in different colors: platinum, cobalt blue and burgundy. Alcantara is the material surrounding the keys and the trackpad. It's a soft, suede-like material typically found on luxury cars. It shows up on steering wheels and door panels, among other things. MICROSOFT SCRAMBLES TO FIX WORST WINDOWS ISSUE IN 'RECENT MEMORY' To me, the Alcantara keyboards look like carpeting, which is not a compliment. It's also susceptible to stains, though Microsoft says it’s a “durable, stain-resistant material… designed to last and easily wipe clean.” But it’s still an amazing keyboard to type on -- in fact, it's one of the best keyboards on any laptop today. It's easy on the fingers. But wait, there's more The new Surface Pro has a new hinge that allows you to place the Surface Pro in so-called “Studio Mode” -- almost perfectly flat.  There are additional features, including a new stylus. Sold separately for $99, it has tilt support, 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and requires much less activation force than previous pens.  There is a built-in option for 4G/LTE, coming later this year, which marks a first for the Surface Pro. This is a great option to have and more Windows laptops should offer this. Final thoughts I owned the very first Surface Pro in 2013 and have owned a succession of Surface Pros after that. There’s a reason it’s a popular convertible device: it’s incredibly easy to switch between tablet and laptop mode and Microsoft probably does a better job than anyone at striking a good balance between those two modes. The rated 13.5 hours of battery life will please Surface fans and that alone might be a reason to upgrade (with the better performance, to boot). And you won't lose battery life by opening and closing the device (via the keyboard), a problem on previous iterations of the Surface Pro.  The new Surface Pro is available June 15.     Advertisement Trending in Tech Tech Q&A: Card skimmers, government internet credits, watching kids' phones and more SpaceX launches 1st recycled supply ship London attack: Facebook activates safety check feature 5 ways to test your computer's security Toyota Motor Corp. to make "flying car" Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

Seán Usher is pictured as Intel celebrates the success of its 2016 Matching Grant programme.View More Images ICONIC Stillorgan GAA Club, Kilmacud Crokes, has scored a major funding boost thanks to the hard-working staff of Intel. The tech giant recently celebrated the success of its 2016 Matching Grant initiative that rewarded 124 community organisations and schools from across Ireland with a total of €502,378. Some 31 organisations from the Dublin area were part of the scheme and will receive funding of more than €130,000. The Intel Involved Matching Grant Programme encourages employees to engage in outreach and volunteerism in their communities by giving their time and talent to qualified non–profit organisations and schools. For every hour that is volunteered by an Intel employee at a school or qualified non–profit organisation, a donation or “match” of $10 (US) is paid from the Intel Foundation. In 2016 Intel employees volunteered just over 54,000 hours that were eligible to be matched through this initiative, resulting in a pay out of €502,378 ($547,215) for 124 recipient organisations spread across 20 different counties in Ireland. Employees were recognised for these efforts at a special event held at the Intel campus in Leixlip which was attended by the Mayor of Kildare Ivan Keatley along with representatives from each of the recipient organisations. Among the 124 organisations that were part of the Matching Grant initiative were charities such as Irish Dogs for the Disabled, the Parkinson’s Association of Ireland and the Society of the Vincent De Paul. A variety of sporting clubs including the Kilmacud Crokes were also in the running for a funding boost. It has been a busy few weeks for the Southside club with recent wins including that of the Intermediate Footballers who beat Round Towers Lusk in their Championship game. It’s also coming up to that time of the year when the club hosts the much-loved Mini All-Ireland tournaments in the month of June. Online entry is now open and available on the club’s website at www.KilmacudCrokes.com. Numbers participating at some age groups will be capped and entries will be accepted on a first come/first served basis. Meanwhile, the Kilmacud Crokes Ladies Football Quiz Night will take place on Friday, May 26 at 8pm in the club house. The quiz will be followed by a few drinks and a bit of music and craic among friends. Teams of four to five adults (over 16 years of age) are €10 a head to attend. There will also be a raffle of superb prizes on the night.     Read 648 Email Print Related Articles 26 May 2017Local councillor welcomes works on Stillorgan’s gritty laneways 25 May 2017GAA club tunes up for big fundraiser 21 May 2017New sports facility to be shared by clubs Latest Gallery Out & About Northside Read the digital editions of the Dublin People Northside East, Northside West & Southside here Previous Story Guide dogs exhibition opens at the airport 27 May 2017A SPECIAL photographic exhibition has opened at Dublin Airport celebrating 40 years of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.

Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has acquired 11 AI start-ups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc., Facebook Inc., and Intel Corp., respectively. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a start-up that specializes in working with unstructured data. Ford Motor The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co. invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. Start-ups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and start-up communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps, said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare start-up Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors recommendations. For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies, said Forward CEO Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate. AI companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, CEO of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the firm in 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc. and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” he said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. A company with a specialised mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,” Mr. Gundotra said.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation's Upcoming Low-Cost Chip Looks Great Details of Intel's next-generation low-cost Atom-based PC chips just leaked, and it looks like the company has put together something nice. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 27, 2017 at 10:15AM For a while, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) didn't take the low end of the personal-computer market all that seriously. For years, it offered products for this market in the form of either badly cut-down versions of its Core processor family, or aging Atom processors that simply delivered subpar computing experiences. However, 2013 marked an inflection point for the company's efforts in this space, with the launch of its redesigned Atom-based platforms for low-cost personal computers, known as Bay Trail. Bay Trail delivered a substantial improvement in performance, power consumption, and features relative to the older Atom products. Image source: Intel. The Bay Trail-based chips were also much more power-efficient and cost-effective than the highly cut-down Core-based chips for low-cost notebooks, which enabled more attractive form factors as well as cost reductions. Since the launch of the Bay Trail-based low-cost personal computer parts in 2013, Intel has regularly launched new products for this market, pushing up performance, features, efficiency, and integration. Thanks to a new leak from FanlessTech on social media (via AnandTech Forums), we now have details about the company's next-generation low-cost personal computer platform, code-named Gemini Lake. A better Apollo Lake Intel's latest low-cost personal-computer processor platform is called Apollo Lake. It is manufactured on the company's 14nm technology and utilizes the company's latest Atom processor core (code-named Goldmont) as well as the same graphics, media, and display subsystem found in the company's higher-end sixth-generation Core processor family (though scaled down to fit the power and cost constraints of a platform intended for low-cost computers). Per FanlessTech, Gemini Lake will use the same Gen9 graphics engine used in Apollo Lake, but it will have support for HDMI 2.0 output (Apollo Lake appears to only support the older HDMI 1.4 standard). More interestingly, FanlessTech says that it will include what Intel calls a "Goldmont Plus" CPU core (Apollo Lake has vanilla Goldmont cores), much more level 2 cache memory (four megabytes, twice what Apollo Lake has), and integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity (Apollo Lake has no wireless connectivity integrated). In other words, it looks like Intel is planning a rather meaningful improvement to its low-cost personal-computer products. Business implications Intel's customers -- that is, the personal-computer makers -- want to be able to refresh their product lines each year, so it's important that Intel be ready with new processors to power those new systems. Beyond its customers' desire to refresh their products, Intel generally benefits when it integrates more features and functionality into its chips. Indeed, if FanlessTech is correct that Gemini Lake integrates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, then this means two things. Firstly, system vendors building computers around the Gemini Lake platform will no longer need to buy separate Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chips. This means fewer components to buy and integrate for the system vendors, leading to lower costs and potential form-factor improvements. Secondly, since Intel is offering a feature of value to its customers, it may be able to boost its asking prices for the chips. In the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth chip example, if the chip previously cost a system vendor $5, then Intel might raise its chip price by, say, $2.50. That price increase would mean revenue and profit increases for Intel, while at the same time saving its customers money -- a "win-win" proposition for all involved. And, finally, with Microsoft more aggressively pushing Windows on the ARM architecture, Intel rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has been rather vocal about trying to push its ARM-based Snapdragon chips into thin-and-light notebook computers. "We have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the data center," Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on an April investor call. "Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter of this year." One of Qualcomm's key advantages is that its chips integrate connectivity technology with the applications processor. The more such technologies that Intel can integrate into its future chips, the better prepared it will be to defend itself against Qualcomm (and other potential ARM-based chip vendors) in the notebook personal-computer market.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Family fight: Microsoft’s Surface Pro… Family fight: Microsoft’s Surface Pro battles the Microsoft Surface Laptop By Mark Coppock — Updated May 27, 2017 8:49 am Subscribe Share Alexander Kalogianni/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Microsoft just released the new Surface Pro, a minor but nifty revision of the popular Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro joins the new Surface Laptop as the youngest member of the Microsoft Surface family, and in some ways, these two machines are as similar as they are different. As a Windows 10 2-in-1, the Surface Pro — which officially drops Microsoft’s numbering scheme — aims to provide additional flexibility, whereas the Surface Laptop wants to be the ultimate notebook for traditionalists. Inside, the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop bear a striking resemblance to one another, especially given both have adopted new color schemes and matching accessories. They’re also similarly equipped in the hardware department, when it comes to processing power, RAM, and storage. It’s as if Microsoft engineered two different species from the same genetic material. But which machine is right for you? Below, we pitted the two directly against one another in an effort to suss out the details. Specifications by-the-numbers Surface Laptop Surface Pro (2017) Dimensions 12.13 x 8.79 x .57 (in) 11.50 x 7.9 x 0.33 (in) Weight 2.76 pounds 1.69 – 1.73 pounds Processor 7th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 7th-generation Intel Core m3, i5, or i7 RAM 4G, 8GB, or 16GB 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB Display 13.5-inch PixelSense display 12.3-in PixelSense display Resolution 2,256 × 1,504 2,736 x 1,824 Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB SSD Networking 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, optional LTE Ports USB Type-A 3.0, mini-DisplayPort, Surface Connect port, 3.5mm headset USB Type-A, mini-DisplayPort, Surface Connect Port, 3.5mm headset jack, microSDXC card reader Webcam 720p HD with infrared camera for Windows Hello support 5.0MP 1080p front-facing camera with infrared camera for Windows Hello support, 8.0MP 1080p rear-facing autofocus camera Operating System Windows 10 S, upgradeable to Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Battery Up to 14.5 hours Up to 13.5 hours Price $999+ $799+ Availability Available June 15 Available June 15 Review Hands-on Hands-on Similar designs, different materials Microsoft has done a masterful job in creating a design aesthetic for the Surface line that maintains the brand’s identity but isn’t simply cookie cutter. The Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are obviously of the same family, but each looks and feels like it should for the kind of machine it is. They’re both solidly build with the usual Surface quality and attention to detail, and they both incorporate a splash of color with Alcantara fabric surrounding the keyboard. Of course, they’re also completely different machines. The Surface Laptop is — as the name implies — a traditional clamshell notebook without any kind of convertibility. The Surface Pro, on the other hand, is a tablet that turns into a notebook-style machine when the Type Cover keyboard is snapped on. In fact, Microsoft stopped calling the Surface Pro a “tablet that can replace your notebook” and just refers to it generically as a “laptop.” Tricky. In terms of specifics, the Surface Laptop is machined from a chunk of aluminum, eschewing the magnesium alloy used on other Surface devices. It’s very thin for a notebook at 0.57 inches, and light at 2.76 pounds, making it thinner and lighter than Apple’s MacBook Pro 13. The Surface Laptop is a wedge design, meaning that it tapers from its thickest point at the rear down to very thin at the front, which results in a more comfortable typing angle. It also incorporates the aforementioned Alcantara fabric on the keyboard deck that comes in four colors — platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold — and the optional Surface Pen comes in the same color scheme. Notably, the Surface Laptop carries the same color scheme throughout its chassis and is, therefore, a very colorful machine as well. The Surface Pro is made from the company’s usual magnesium alloy, and it’s very similar to the previous generations, only with slightly rounded edges. It’s a touch thinner and lighter, at 0.33 inches and a maximum of 1.73 pounds, but not by much, demonstrating that Microsoft found a comfortable mix of design and materials and then stuck with it. Attach the new keyboard and the combination weighs in at 2.41 pounds, which is similar to the Surface Laptop when fully assembled. Speaking of, the new Signature Type Covers are slightly improved over the previous models and are covered in Alcantara fabric in platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, or black. The Surface Pen can be color matched as well, but isn’t included with the tablet — or rather, laptop — this time around. The Surface Pro itself is the same magnesium silver as past Surface devices, and thus features a more muted design overall. It’s hard to pick a winner between these two machines. They’re both similarly thin and light when all of the required accessories are taken into account, and they’re both well-built and very attractive machines. You can’t even fault one over the other in terms of notebook versus 2-in-1 because either form factor can be right or wrong depending on a given user’s requirements. Winner: Tie Great display vs. even better display If there’s one thing Microsoft got right with the Surface line, it’s its choice in displays. First, it switched to the 3:2 aspect ratio with the Surface Pro 3, which is taller than the common 16:9 widescreen ratio and better for productivity. There’s some letterboxing when watching video, but you get to see more of your documents. Second, Microsoft uses high-resolution and high-quality displays that are sharp, offer excellent contrast with deep blacks, and provide solid color support. No matter which Surface you buy, you’re guaranteed to get one of the best displays around. The display on the Surface Laptop is a 13.5-inch PixelSense panel with 2,256 x 1,504 resolution, or 201PPI. It features Corning Gorilla Glass for scratch and shatter resistance, and it supports 10-point multitouch and the Surface Pen. A 720p HD webcam sits above the display where it belongs, and an infrared camera provides Windows Hello support via facial recognition. The Surface Pro sports a 12.3-inch PixelSense display with 2,736 x 1,824 resolution, or 267PPI — making it one of the sharpest “laptop” displays around. It’s also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass, and offers 10-point multitouch and Surface Pen support. The Surface Pro’s active digitizer has been enhanced with a hardware accelerator and quadruples the pressure sensitivity at 4,096 levels, and so it’s the best-performing and most accurate of all the Surface devices for drawing and handwriting on the screen. A 5-megapixel, 1080p HD webcam is on front, with Windows Hello support via infrared camera and facial recognition, and there’s an 8-megapixel camera with autofocus and 1080p video support on the back. Again, it’s difficult to pick a winner here. These are excellent displays with high resolutions — albeit, neither are 4K UHD — and the same 3:2 aspect ratio. They both support touch and pen input, although both make far more sense on the detachable Surface Pro. You really can’t go wrong with either. We’re going to give the nod here to the Surface Pro, however, given its higher sharpness and its superior pen specifications. Plus, it’s simply a more natural device for Windows Inking. Winner: Surface Pro Very similar for typing and touching Microsoft’s most recent Type Covers have always provided a solid typing experience, with some points taken away for providing a slightly less stable experience when the keyboard is magnetically attached at an angle. Microsoft has used a similar keyboard design on the Surface Laptop, and of course, the use of Alcantara fabric across the board means that the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are going to feel very similar when in use. Both keyboards offer 1.5-millimeter travel, and a similar feel. The touchpads are also similar, with Microsoft Precision Touchpad support, multitouch capability, and a glass surface. The Surface Laptop’s touchpad appears to be a bit larger, however, and that counts for something. It’s becoming a theme in this comparison, but again, picking a winner is difficult. If you went back and forth between the two machines, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in the typing and touchpad experience. However, the Type Cover does bounce around a little when typing, and isn’t as spacious, so we think the Surface Laptop edges out the Surface Pro here. Winner: Surface Laptop Almost identical hardware The Surface Laptop utilizes Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, with the former offering Intel HD 620 graphics and the latter bumping up to Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics. UP to 16GB of RAM can be configured, and up to a 1TB PCIe SSD can be selected (eventually, but just 512GB for now). All of that makes the Surface Laptop competitive on paper with other thin-and-light notebooks. The Surface Pro offers a wider range of processors, including the low-power Intel Core m3, Core i5, and Core i7. Notably, the Core m3 and Core i5 models are fanless, meaning they’ll be completely silent in operation but could theoretically slow down more quickly when they heat up. The Core i7 also promises quieter fans than previous generations. The Surface Pro can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and up to a 1TB PCIe SSD, and it also offers Intel Iris Plus 640 graphics with the Core i7 option. Obviously, it’s reasonable to expect these peers to perform similarly. The big difference is the availability of a less powerful Core m3 chip in the Pro, which is not available in the Laptop. Winner: Tie Both are limited to the past when it comes to plugging in Microsoft has taken a curious position regarding the increasingly ubiquitous USB Type-C connection. While most manufacturers are moving steadily in the direction of this futuristic connectivity, Microsoft believes that the USB Type-C connection is basically too confusing for its customers. We tend to think that’s a bit silly, and that it’s a real shame that Microsoft left off a port that would provide some additional longevity. That said, the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro both offer similarly limited connectivity. Both have a single USB 3.0 Type-A port, a mini-DisplayPort, the Surface Connect port, and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. The Surface Pro, however, includes a Type Cover connector and microSD card reader. We’re disappointed with the connectivity of both machines. However, the Surface Pro can at least more easily transfer some images from a camera given its microSD card reader, and so we’ll grudgingly give that machine the win in this category. Winner: Surface Pro The laptop lasts longer than the 2-in-1 As mentioned above, both the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are thin and light machines for their respective categories. And, when you attach the Type Cover to the Surface Pro, the two machines become even more alike in terms of tossing in a backpack and carrying around. The Surface Laptop is a larger machine because of its larger display, but there’s remarkably little difference between the two machines otherwise. The same can be said for battery life, where Microsoft has made some promising strides. On paper, at least, and depending on the configuration, Microsoft is promising 14.5 hours of battery life with the Surface Laptop and 13.5 hours with the Surface Pro. That gives the Laptop a small victory here. Winner: Surface Laptop Pricing and availability The Surface Laptop was introduced at Microsoft’s recent education-oriented event, which was odd considering that it’s not at all an inexpensive machine. Microsoft anticipates that it will be popular among college students who might otherwise gravitate toward a MacBook, but otherwise, it’s not going to make its way into many classrooms. It starts at $999 with a Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD, and jumps all the way up to $2,199 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The Surface Laptop comes standard with the limited Windows 10 S, which only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store. That’s not going to be popular with many buyers of this class of machine, and it makes us wonder exactly what Microsoft is planning. It’s easy enough to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, however, and that’s free until the end of 2017 when the upgrade will cost $49. The Surface Pro is priced similarly to the Surface Pro 4, though the as-yet-unpriced new Surface Pen is no longer included. Pricing starts at $799 for a Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, and jumps all the way up to $2,699 for a Core i7, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It is, therefore, a real mix in terms of pricing, offering decent pricing at the low end but then heading straight for the stratosphere when more attractively configured. Keep in mind that the Signature Type Cover runs $160, meaning that a fully-equipped, entry-level Surface Pro will cost around $960, plus whatever price Microsoft attaches to the new Surface Pen. Winner: Tie Conclusion It might not seem fair to pit these two against each other. They’re aimed at different markets with very different use cases. Yet they’re very similar machines, and we bet many are wondering if it makes sense to leap to the Surface Pro’s 2-in-1 design, or stick with the more traditional Laptop. Our comparison tilts slightly in favor of the Surface Pro. It has a better display, a wider range of configuration options, and a more versatile package. In exchange, it’s not quite as enjoyable to use as a laptop, and drops an hour of quoted battery life. Weighing the pros and cons can be difficult, a choice must be made — and the Pro is the one we’d buy.

The reverse engineering experts at TechInsights have been doing just that, and they recently published their initial findings. With some of the first high-resolution die photographs of 3D XPoint, TechInsights has provided precise measurements of the die size and memory density. The 128Gb 3D XPoint die is 206.5 mm2, much larger than is typical for modern NAND flash or DRAM but comparable to Intel's 128Gb 20nm planar MLC NAND. A large total die size is typical for Intel and Micron, as they have historically not catered to the mobile market with their NAND flash while competitors like Samsung and Toshiba have strived to ensure their flash will physically fit in devices like smartphones. (That trend is changing with the introduction this year of 64-layer 3D NAND where Intel and Micron are producing both a larger 512Gb TLC part and a smaller 256Gb TLC part.) The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is using memory of similar density to the Intel SSD DC P3700 that it is displacing as the flagship of Intel's SSD product line. When comparing similar chips, die size is a strong predictor of manufacturing cost, but 3D XPoint memory is quite different from NAND flash memory, both older planar NAND or newer 3D NAND. Still, there's some value in noting that the P4800X is arriving with a price tag about 25% higher than the P3700 initially carried. This suggests that the manufacturing process for 3D XPoint is either more expensive than planar NAND or that 3D XPoint yields are not mature enough, but a lot of the markup can also be explained by the lack of high-performance competition for Optane SSDs. TechInsights calculates that 91.4% of the 3D XPoint die area is occupied by the memory array itself. This is a much higher figure than for NAND flash, where the record is 84.9% for Intel/Micron 3D NAND with its "CMOS under the array" design that puts a large portion of the peripheral circuitry underneath the memory array instead of alongside. Samsung's current 48-layer 3D V-NAND manages an array efficiency of just 70%, and 3D NAND from Toshiba and SK Hynix has been comparable. This means that once Intel gets around to increasing they layer count in future generations of 3D XPoint memory, they should be able to get much closer to the ideal capacity scaling than 3D NAND memory can currently achieve. The analysis from TechInsights confirms that 3D XPoint memory is manufactured using a 20nm process, with the same pitch in both the bitline and wordline directions of the memory array. The DRAM market is only just moving beyond this milestone, so comparing the density of 3D XPoint to current DRAM highlights the fundamental capacity advantage 3D XPoint enjoys: around 4.5 times higher density compared to typical 20nm DRAM, and about 3.3 times higher than the most advanced 1Xnm DDR4 on the market. This gap is likely to widen with future generations of 3D XPoint. The materials and construction of an individual 3D XPoint memory cell have not been fully analyzed, but it appears to be a phase change memory element with a doped chalcogenide selector switch. The 3D XPoint memory array is constructed between the fourth and fifth metal interconnect layers above the silicon die.

POST A COMMENT 22 Comments View All Comments wumpus - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Interesting article. I wonder if the emphasis on comparing 3dxpoint to MLC/TLC flash was techinsight's idea or anandtech's. From the original propaganda coming from Intel, I expected a memory that would barge in between DRAM and Flash, forcing DRAM to act more like a cache (presumably something like HBM connected to the CPU) and in turn caching slower, denser, and cheaper Flash (TLC or denser). This also appears to be what Intel thought with the shipping Optane, although that is pretty much moot after the introduction of pseudo-SLC 3d flash (no real caching needed, although it might make a good dram replacement in SSDs). And of course the big questions remain: can Intel get the latency below milliseconds and get the endurance enough to use <1ms latency? Reply vladx - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link It's only the first generation, I think Intel's hype numbers were for much later when the technology finally matures. Reply melgross - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Seriously, I'm always surprised when tech types are disappointed in new technology. As it is, this provides a NJ get of major advantages, and it's just first generation. When did NAND first come out, 20 years ago? I still have a NAND card from my old Agfa minilab that cost US $250 and has 4MB storage (it was used to store settings in the machine.) Give this a few years. I mean, the first usable SSD was just 16GB. The ones we saw back then as really usable were, by todays standards for SSD, very slow, and cost $3,600 for a 32GB drive. Reply dwrivers - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Take a look at the Optane drive review from a few weeks ago and you'll see that latency is <10uS with 5-9s <100uS. The endurance is listed as 30 drive-writes per day. Looks like the technology is delivering something new and exciting that fits between DRAM and NAND Flash. http://www.anandtech.com/show/11209/intel-optane-s... Reply hahmed330 - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Optane will probably never replace DRAM unless ridiculously drastic improvements are made since DRAM pretty much have a legendary endurance that optane probably could never match. As a caching scratch board it can make sense, but it's usefulness is quite limited especially for your average Joe. Reply IntelUser2000 - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link You don't need it to completely replace DRAM. If the technology comes near to what they promised, then it can significantly reduce the need for DRAM. Right now the policy is to put much as possible into DRAM to mask slow speed of storage. When the storage is much faster, then it'll be different. But final goal for these devices won't be realized for 10-15 years. You need to overhaul the computer system from top to bottom. It's something that has been stable for 70 years, so, you are talking about mentality changes of the people involved in the low level computer architecture. Revolution, comes as a stage. Never instant. Now the days of easy scaling is at an end, that'll be true even in semiconductors where traditionally newer device always offered better in every category. Reply melgross - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link Intel has never claimed that optane will completely replace RAM. You're setting up a straw argument that was never made, and then knocking it down Reply BMNify - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link not really, as commercial Everspin Mram at 90nm is faster and can even now fit above the lower Dram for speed, then.. its also got a lot more nm room to grow and is already near infinite write Non-volatility Reply boeush - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link So they only need to stack 8 layers of this to leave the most advanced 3D NAND in the dust density/capacity-wise, without even stepping fien to a smaller process node. The only issue then would be cost per die - something that might well be resolved through higher volumes and better yields... I can see this completely replacing NAND within the next 10 years or so... Reply Kristian Vättö - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link 3D XPoint doesn't scale nearly as well as 3D NAND when it comes to layers. Cross-point arrays are built layer by layer, whereas 3D NAND has a vertical channel i.e. all layers are processed at once. PCM is also not that scalable when it comes to lithography because it too suffers from cell-to-cell interference.

This Powerful Lobbyist Is At The Heart Of Mike Flynn’s Foreign Entanglements SHARE TWEET PIN-IT Facebook By Allegra Kirkland Published May 26, 2017 6:00 am Views Ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn has kept out of sight as the federal investigation into his foreign ties ramps up. He’s eschewed public appearances and communicated almost exclusively through his team of lawyers since he was forced out of the Trump administration in February. Flynn’s former lobbying client, however, is speaking out about their relationship. In a speech Monday before the 36th Annual Conference on U.S.-Turkey Relations, Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim Alptekin directly addressed the $530,000 he paid to Flynn’s consulting firm in the heat of the 2016 election. He denied there was anything untoward about their work. “As many of you have read in the media, I hired the Flynn Intel Group in 2016 before the election with a mandate to help me understand where the Turkish-American relationship is and where it’s going and what the obstacles to the relationship are,” Alptekin told the room, according to news reports. The speech was delivered in the presidential ballroom of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.—a stone’s throw from the White House. According to the New York Times, Alptekin, who frequently tweets favorable stories about the Trump administration, has been swept up in Flynn’s legal troubles, as federal investigators have issued subpoenas for Alptekin’s records, research, contracts, bank records and other communications related to his work with Flynn Intel Group. There is no indication that Alptekin himself is a target of investigation. He told ABC News in an interview this week that he “cannot comment” on whether he he’s been questioned or subpoenaed by U.S. authorities. The exact nature of the work Flynn did for Alptekin is key to unraveling the complex web of foreign entanglements that brought the onetime national security adviser under both federal and congressional scrutiny. Since the failed coup attempt against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last July, the powerful businessman has been leading the effort to rehabilitate the image of Turkey and its increasingly authoritarian leader in the U.S. “In the United States his name definitely did come up, amid the circle of people who kind of keep an eye on these things,” Scheherazade Rehman, professor of international business at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs, said of Alptekin. “Clearly it’s a totally legitimate operation in terms of following all the lobbying rules that we have, but the lobbying is pretty intense. They’ve stepped it up. There’s no question that after the coup, they have seriously stepped it up.” Erdogan has cracked down on dissent, jailing journalists and protesters en masse, since the move to oust him from power. Most recently, he eked out a victory in an April referendum that granted him vast constitutional powers. Though President Donald Trump congratulated Erdogan on that win, international monitors reported that the voting was rife with fraud. Representatives for Alptekin agreed Thursday to pass along emailed questions, but TPM did not receive a response. A host of Washington, D.C.-based groups and individuals associated with Alptekin, who appears to be a significant power player in the capital, also declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Alptekin had worked on Capitol Hill as a congressional fellow in 2003, and he currently serves as chairman of the Turkey-US Business Council and representative for Turkey on the board of the U.S.-based Nowruz Commission, a nonprofit public diplomacy organization. He has significant  business interests in the international real estate and defense industries through his companies EA Property Development, EA Aerospace and ATH Defense and Security Solutions. As Politico reported, Alptekin has also worked closely with Ukraine-born businessman Dmitri “David” Zaikan to coordinate Turkish lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., and both men have negotiated business deals with Vladimir Putin’s government (The two men denied knowing each other). Alptekin has criticized Russia’s recent imposition on the borders of other sovereign nations, however, accusing the Kremlin of “trying to adopt a political stance imitating the Soviet Union.” What brought Alptekin to Flynn was his role in yet another business: Inovo BV, a Dutch-based company Alptekin owns. In August, one month after Turkey’s failed coup, Inovo BV hired Flynn Intel Group to perform research and disseminate negative information about Fetullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who Erdogan believes orchestrated the effort to unseat him from the Pennsylvania compound where Gulen lives in exile. As part of its work with Inovo BV, Flynn Intel Group registered as a domestic lobbying entity and Flynn reportedly met with senior Turkish government officials about bypassing the U.S. extradition process to forcibly transport Gulen to Turkey—all while serving as a senior campaign adviser to Trump and sitting in on classified national security briefings. Flynn also published a fiery op-ed in The Hill on Election Day condemning the United States for harboring a “radical cleric” like Gulen, which tipped the Justice Department off to the potentially troubling nature of his lobbying. After Flynn left office for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and others about his contacts with Russian officials, he retroactively registered with DOJ as a foreign agent for his work for Alptekin. According to the Wall Street Journal, federal investigators are now looking into whether Flynn’s sizable contract “played any role in his decisions as the president’s adviser,” including his reported move to block a U.S. military operation against ISIS that Turkey opposed. Flynn and Alptekin have characterized their work together quite differently. Alptekin told ABC News this week that he has “never represented the government of Turkey” and that reports implying “that I was in any way representing the government are simply not true.” By contrast, Flynn’s filings under the Foreign Agents Registration Act say that his work for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey.” Alptekin seems well aware of the powerful weight lobbyists carry in Washington, telling the Centre for Policy and Research on Turkey last year that working with think tanks and “engaging in lobbying activities” was key to gaining influence in American politics. With or without Flynn, he seems intent on continuing his crusade to extradite Gulen—who he insisted the United States must “stop tolerating” in his Monday speech at the Trump International Hotel—and to burnish the reputation of Erdogan, who he has heavily praised, on Capitol Hill. Rahman, the Turkish GW professor, predicts Alptekin will have an easier time of achieving his goals under Trump than he did under Barack Obama. Trump’s decision not to address human rights during a speech in Saudi Arabia this week and his warm outreach to strongman leaders sends a “green light” to politicians like Erdogan, she said, as well as a simple message: “You have us as allies; manage your own house.” ABOUT THE AUTHOR Allegra Kirkland Follow @allegrakirkland Allegra Kirkland is a New York-based reporter for Talking Points Memo.

Intel’s trial platform can support multi-gigabit over the air speeds and addresses key aspects of 5G including multi-carrier, multi-device operations, advanced scheduling, 4×4 and 8×8 arrays, and broad RF support up in high-capacity millimeter wave frequencies. There’s also an iteration of the trial platform geared toward automotive use cases including very fast transmission of in-vehicle LIDAR, camera and other sensor information directly to the data center, as well as machine learning functionality and V2X connectivity. Intel’s Kenneth Stewart, and Intel Fellow and chief wireless technologist for the Platform Engineering Group, wrote in a blog post, “The growing capabilities of Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platforms are bringing to life key experiences that will be made a reality through 5G.” In conjunction with Finnish vendor Nokia, Intel has established innovation labs in Espoo, Finland, and Murray Hill, New Jersey; the facilities combine the trial platform with Nokia’s portfolio of network gear. Areas of research cover 5G, NB-IoT, data center and software platforms. Underlying 5G tech being jointly developed includes massive MIMO, small cells, network slicing, software-defined virtual RAN, and edge and cloud computing,” according to the companies. “The networks of tomorrow must be powerful, agile, flexible and built upon open standards and virtualized infrastructure technology for delivery of intelligent edge services in the 5G era,” Intel VP Sandra Rivera said in a statement, adding that the labs will enable “us to take another critical step accelerate commercial 5G deployments.” Ericsson is working with an Intel gateway based on the 5G trial platform to support an advanced, smart home demonstration at the Indianapolis 500 race this weekend. Along with carrier Verizon, Intel and Ericsson are showcasing the entertainment value of 5G by streaming virtual reality and 360-degree, 4K video that corresponds with the famous race. The user experience involves using a headset, which provides a 4K, 360-degree view of the track that supplemented with virtual reality elements. Other use cases touted by the companies include crystal-clear security camera feeds that can be tapped through the cloud, other VR and AR interactions, and providing a platform for internet of things devices and services.   Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Posts Related Posts 5G Ericsson Intel Nokia About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

At its Worldwide Developer Conference -- which confers between June 5-9 -- Apple is expected to announce a broad refresh of its MacBook line, including the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook, Rhoda Alexander, an analyst at market researcher IHS Markit, told Fox News. Alexander’s projection comports with a recent Bloomberg report, which says that Apple plans to update its MacBooks at the June conference. Catching up to Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Dell The updates are expected to bring the MacBook line up to speed with Windows laptops by adopting Intel’s newest 7th Generation “Kaby Lake” processor, which can deliver better performance while extending battery life. Apple, which redesigned its MacBook Pro laptop last October, use Intel's Skylake processor. The 12-inch MacBook, which was updated in spring 2016, also uses the Skylake processor, known in the marketplace as a sixth generation processor. Meanwhile, many of the newest laptop models from HP, Dell and Microsoft have adopted Intel’s latest 7th Generation Core processor. Microsoft recently announced the Surface Laptop – which will go on sale June 15 – with Intel’s 7th Gen processor. Microsoft claims that its first laptop can deliver “up to 14.5 hours video playback” on battery. The updated 13-inch MacBook Pro will use a new low-power version of Intel’s latest chip while the 15-inch model will get an updated quad-core processor, designated "Kaby Lake H," according to Alexander. The 2-pound, 12-inch MacBook will get an ultra-low-power version of the Kaby Lake chip, Alexander added. Apple could not be reached for comment for this story. Pricing is expected to remain largley the same with past models. The 12-inch MacBook starts at $1,299, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro (non-Touch-Bar) starts at $1,499 and the 15-incher at $2,399. Retailers typically discount outgoing models when a refresh happens.  Wither MacBook Air? It is “unclear” if the venerable MacBook Air will see an update in June, Alexander said. Bloomberg said that Apple “has…considered updating the aging 13-inch MacBook Air” but offered no clarity beyond that. Despite its old design, the MacBook Air, whcih starts at $999, has remained popular with consumers. iPad could also see updates It’s possible that Apple also update its iPads along with the MacBooks, Alexander said. The 10.5 inch iPad “is in production now [and] there's a new 12.9 inch model coming as well,” she said on Wednesday, revising an earlier forecast that saw the iPad updates coming later this year. If accurate, the 10.5-inch model would be the first iPad with that screen size. Currently, the iPad is offered in 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch sizes.

The Razer Blade Stealth is a tiny laptop with 12.5-inch screen that measures a mere 13.1mm in thickness. The Stealth has been recently upgraded from Intel Skylake to Kaby Lake and the battery has seen an increase in capacity from  45Wh to 53.6Wh, however these are minor changes to the previous model. When we reviewed the Razer Blade we were impressed by the combination of Core i7 7700HQ CPU and GTX 1060 graphics, and also found it illuminating to connect an external Razer Core graphics unit with GTX 1080 graphics card. The Razer Blade Stealth is a completely different kettle of fish as it uses a dual core Core i7 7500U with a mere 15W TDP while the screen is powered by Intel HD 620 graphics and we were keen to see whether those Intel graphics were any good. Watch the video via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p60 HERE   Specification: Processor: Intel Core i7-7500U Dual-Core (2.7GHz/3.5GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 16 GB System Memory Dual-channel onboard memory LPDDR3-1866MHz (Fixed) SSD: 256GB Samsung PM961 PCIe M.2 Display: 12.5″ IGZO 16:9 aspect ratio, with LED backlight, capacitive multi-touch, up to 170° wide viewing angles Keyboard: Anti-ghosting keyboard with per-key lighting powered by Razer Chroma Wi-Fi: Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth 4.1) Ports: Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) USB 3.0 port x2 (SuperSpeed) HDMI 2.0a video and audio output 3.5 mm headphone/microphone combo port Other features: Built-in 2Megapixel webcam Built-in stereo speakers Array microphone Dolby Digital Plus Home Theatre Edition 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI) Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) security chip embedded Razer Synapse enabled with programmable keyboard, track pad, back lighting, and fan control Power Adapter: Compact 45W Battery: Built-in 53.6Wh rechargeable lithium-ion polymer Size: 13.1mm (Height) x 321mm (Width) x 206mm (Depth) Weight: 1.29kg OS: 10 Home 64-bit Windows When you look at the Razer Blade Stealth you find your attention is drawn to the fabulous aluminium chassis and gorgeous screen. We hit a snag in this area as we were sent a US version of Stealth with a QHD resolution IGZO (Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide) panel. In the UK we don’t get that particular option and instead are obliged to purchase a Stealth with 4K panel. While the QHD IGZO panel looks superb it ‘only’ has a pixel density of 234ppi and supports 70 percent Adobe RGB gamut, whereas the 4K sports 352ppi and 100 percent Adobe RGB. Technically the 4K has a huge amount going in its favour but that snag of which we spoke is that we haven’t seen the 4K panel in action and can only talk about the non-UK QHD panel. As we discuss in our video, whichever screen resolution you buy, there is no doubt you will have to scale the display to have a chance of reading any text on the 12.5-inch screen. 150 percent is a good starting point for QHD and you will probably have to go even further with the 4K panel. Inside the Stealth you will find the design and layout are very similar to the larger Razer Blade, which really should come as no surprise. The SSD is an M.2 item and the RAM chips are soldered on board. While it is possible to remove the bottom cover and look inside the Stealth there really isn’t much point, in much the same way you are best advised not to remove the rear cover of your TV. Testing Using the Razer Stealth with internal graphics is a lovely experience, provided you don’t stress the graphics. Watching movies, playing music and surfing the web all work fantastically well while games are a non-starter. Well, we assume you can play Candy Crush (although we didn’t try) but proper games set at 1080p run below 10fps. In the case of Ashes of the Singularity the game simply refused to start. That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise and really was only used to set a baseline for testing with the Core unit. We did two sets of test runs with the Core and a PNY GTX 1070 graphics card. The first set was outputting to the laptop display at 1080p while the second used an external display, also at 1080p, connected via DisplayPort. The two sets of figures were essentially identical, which was interesting as we had seen a significant difference when we tested the Razer Blade with Core and GTX 1080. Regardless of whether you use the laptop screen or an external display, the Razer Stealth with Core is now capable of playing games. Rise of the Tomb Raider at 75fps and Gears of War 4 at 50fps both look good but you can be sure there will be minimum frame rate moments that dip to 30fps. The point here is that the dual core Core i7 is a decent little processor while the Intel HD 620 graphics are completely of their depth so adding the Core with GTX 1070 isn’t quite as daft as it first might seem. Cooling Performance. The CPU runs hot inside Razer Stealth. It was interesting to see that it ran hottest when we connected the Core to an external display, almost as though the CPU was running to the absolute max, attempting to keep up with the massive graphics card. We always expected the dual core Core i7 would struggle to keep up with GTX 1070 but even so, we did not expect it to run this hot. Acoustics performance. You can hear the Stealth working away however it is not intrusively loud. When you consider the slender nature of the chassis and look at the CPU temperatures the only conclusion you can draw is that it is quiet because the cooler is not working hard enough. While we appreciate a laptop that is lovely and quiet, even under load, it feels as though Razer has gone too far and needs to step up the fan curve. Closing Thoughts. Razer Blade Stealth is a lovely piece of hardware and the overwhelming impressions are small, thin, light, aluminium and that bright screen with its massive pixel count. Its tiny size and light weight make it highly portable and the ideal note taker for people such as, well, your correspondent. It causes me pain the Razer Blade will not be in my bag on the way to Computex in place of the Lenovo ThinkPad you saw in the video but the idea of shelling out £1,400 or £1,800 for the privilege of buying a Razer Blade Stealth would be even more painful. The major limitation with the Stealth, apart from its tiny size (which means you need to type with care) are those Intel HD 620 graphics. The graphics are perfectly good for viewing movies and photos but lack the grunt to play games or do more serious work such as editing videos. There are plenty of people who are happy to pay a premium for a laptop that is thin and light and Razer Blade Stealth scores well in that regard, however you have to wonder how many prospective customers will simply buy an iPad or Microsoft Surface Pro 4 instead. It would help Razer’s cause if the Blade Stealth had a lid that could fold all the way back to make it the equivalent of a tablet. After all, the screen on our US model already had the touch function included so this would seem like a relatively simple feat of engineering. 512GB SSD and 4K panel £1399.99 1TB SSD and 4K panel £1799.99 Pros: Gorgeous aluminium chassis is amazingly slender. The QHD IGZO panel in our sample looked superb. Battery life is sufficient for 7 hours solid work. Dual core Intel Core i7 is surprisingly capable. Cons: CPU temperature is rather high. This laptop should be convertible. Intel HD 620 graphics are fairly feeble. Adding Razer Core and GTX 1070 is interesting but not all that practical.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Attention: Read this before you buy a new PC! Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:35 Don Reba says: They are slightly modified Xeon cores, but you’re right that they are not really comparable. The Phi runs its own OS, it’s not just a chip. We evaluated them for the LHCb compute farm, but they turned out to be far from price-competitive compared to GPUs.

Intel isn’t “lazy”, the problem is that CPU development isn’t magic. The only straightforward thing is using smaller processes for better efficiency, everything else is either a tradeoff or expensive or a genuine innovation. It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming. Of course, it’ll be great for the multi-threaded successor to Dwarf Fortress that I keep hoping somebody makes. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 10:34 Dinger says: I certainly remember the miserable Pentium 4 years, and I also remember the rapid growth that led up to it: the 1990s opened with the 80486 at 33 MHz and ended with Coppermine PIIIs and AMD Firebirds breaking the GHz barrier. So, yeah, the nineties were a decade that saw a 30-fold increase in desktop clockspeeds. The “Megahertz Race” also set the table for the disastrous Pentium 4 era, where Intel ran headfirst into a wall of power and thermal issues, and everything stalled out under 4 GHz. Now, ten years after P4 finally died, we’re getting 16 cores running just under 4 GHz. In short, no, I don’t agree. The Core 2 was an enormous step forward, certainly, but the P4 doldrums before it were largely due to the time it takes for design and administrative inertia to change radically the way chips are designed. Now the doldrums are that the new possibilities offered by hardware don’t make a compelling case for businesses to shorten their hardware replacement cycles.

If this years CPU is only 5% better than last years, with no new bells or whistles, then why bother to upgrade? What this recent crop of AMD processors will hopefully do is prompt Intel to drop their prices somewhat to compete.

This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none. Combined with the aggressive roadmap that AMD has laid out for die shrinkage and general processor improvement and Intel has been scrambling. You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself. Unless Intel pulls a series of rabbits out of their hat AMD is going to seriously cut into their marketshare over the next 5 years. Especially if Apple goes with Raven Ridge for the new Macbook Pro.

I am skeptical. More seriously, is anyone considering an upgrade, and why? I’ve been a cheapskate for so long that the only things which really excite me are the high-value inexpensive things like that Raven Ridge APU. I’ve had a couple of A8 series APUs which were firmly in the “better than nothing” category, but did great with old games. Now I’ve got an i5 3550 that a family member gave me, which is stubbornly holding on at the very bottom of the highest tier in Tom’s Hardware’s hierarchy, so I think Threa will have to drip somewhere else. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:42 Lukasz says: I’m building new system.

A really fast customized car or motorcycle isn’t that useful either, but that’s hardly the point, I think. Shiny new stuff is fun. Where I have been glad I waited is when I had a vague idea of what I wanted and what I could afford pay for it, and just watched for deals. That’s how I ended up with a GTX 1060 3gb for just over 160 USD, and I’m happy as a clam with that card. The hierarchy on Tom’s Hardware for GPUs which I linked to is also helpful, because (even if it’s oversimplified) it shows how silly it would be to drop two or three hundred bucks just to go up one tier for almost no noticeable gains. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:12 snv says: Well, link to xkcd.com but it is my guess that we can thank VR for the restart of the hardware spiral.

Not because I have any particular love for them or dislike of Intel, but just because it’d be better for the market if they did. In my heart of hearts, I hope that they do something as game changing as when they invented x64 and somehow their new advantage is parlayed into an avalanche-like shift to Linux in PC gaming. Not because I’m a Linux evangelist, mind you, but just because Windows 10 is an abomination we only put up with for compatibility reasons.

Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 16:21 milonz says: Ryzen line of products could be a good deal for the professionnal market, in virtualization (ESXi, Xen, KVM) or rendering farms (3dsmax, Maya, etc). Not as a pure performance product (the Xeons rule) but as the best performance / value / power efficiency match. With virtualization or 3D, you really don’t care about a single box performance, but about how many boxes you can cram in a datacenter, for a defined budget. AMD has yet to resolve the compatibility problems the Ryzen have on ESXi, but it already seems that Ryzen CPUs are already a good performance / value investment in the rendering farms field. For the enthusiast gamer market, things are a little bit tricky … 10 years ago, 2 cores were enough, because multi-threading a game is a complex job. Now, every single game which comes out is 4-way optimized, it took the gaming industry nearly 10 years ! Multi-threading means separating the game logic between multiple threads, which are run in parallel. You can for exemple separate the main thread, the sound thread, the ai thread, the physics thread. But there’s no point in separating the main thread, because it is a sequential process, not parallel by nature. It cannot be separated, it is considered as “atomic”. The Ryzen many-cores line of products future could be determined by how many threads the gaming industry will adapt to in the not so distant future, and what usages they’ll find to them. More threads would maybe mean more AI or more physics, which are for now quite rudimentary. Or a completely new usage for the threads, like machine learning, which could enhance the player’s experience greatly. In any case, AMD Ryzen could drive Intel’s CPUs prices down, which is a great thing, for the professionnal and the gaming market. The worst case in any market is when a single company has a monopoly, and for many years, Intel had a real monopoly on CPUs =/ Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement More Intel Gemini Lake chip details leaked (Apollo Lake successor) 05/26/2017 at 9:32 AM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Intel is expected to launch a new line of low-cost, low-power Celeron and Pentium chips later this year. Code-named Gemini Lake, the processors are the follow-up to the Apollo Lake chips currently found in entry-level notebooks, desktops, and 2-in-1 tablets. While Intel hasn’t said much about the upcoming Gemini Lake chips yet, a leaked product roadmap from last year suggested they’d launch by the end of 2017. Now @FanlessTech has a few more details. Gemini Lake mobile chips are said to have a 6 watt TDP, while the desktop versions will be 10 watt chips. That’s pretty much the same as you find with Intel’s Apollo Lake processors, although it differs a little from the roadmap (which, to be fair, leaked 9 months ago, meaning there’s plenty of time for things to have changed). Likewise, the new chips will come in dual and quad-core variants (just like Apollo Lake), and feature Intel Gen9 graphics (like Apollo Lake) with support for up to 18 execution units (like… you get the idea). The similarities aren’t surprising, since Gemini Lake chips are built on the same 14nm, 64-bit Goldmont architecture as Apollo Lake processors, although Intel will apparently use the name “Goldmont Plus” for the new chips. There do seem to be at least a few updates though: According to FanlessTech (which is usually a pretty reliable source for leaks of this nature), the new chips will feature native support for HDMI 2.0. Apollo Lake tops out at HDMI 1.4b and DisplayPort 1.2. Gemini Lake chips will also feature 4MB of cache, while Apollo Lake chips have just 2MB and FanlessTech says the processors support DDR4 memory and feature integrated WiFi and Bluetooth. It’s unclear what kind of performance and/or efficiency improvements we should expect from the upcoming Gemini Lake chips, but it’s worth noting that this entire line of processors is designed for entry-level devices and won’t offer the same level of performance you get from Core M or Core i processors. Looking ahead even further, Intel’s follow-up to Gemini Lake is expected to launch in 2018. Codenamed “Mercury Lake,” the next-next-gen chips will be the first products in this series manufactured on a 10nm process.

A great x86 processor for the Ultra-Low Power demands, remember the Z8700/Z8750 ? Runs Win10 Light, but acceptably efficient on something as portable as the GPD Win. None of the newer Apollo/Gemini Lake chips (Celeron/Pentium) can do that.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Zotac lines up a gaming desktop, graphics cards… Zotac lines up a gaming desktop, graphics cards, and mini PCs for Computex By Kevin Parrish — May 25, 2017 6:19 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Zotac is cramming Nvidia's powerful GeForce GTX 1080 Ti chip into a small graphics card for PC gamers with compatible, compact systems. Like clockwork, device makers are beginning to roll out their lineups for the upcoming Computex show, including Zotac. The company will have on display a huge load of devices spanning a new gaming desktop, graphics cards, miniature PCs, and more. However, PC gamers might be tickled green by the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Mini announcement alone, which crams Nvidia’s latest GPU into an 8.3-inch add-in card. Let’s dive in. MEK Gaming PC For starters, Zotac is introducing a new brand called Zotac Gaming. Shown above, the first product launched under this umbrella is the upcoming MEK Gaming PC, a Mini ITX desktop packing a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor and a low-profile CPU cooler. The details regarding this desktop are scarce, but we know it will be powered by Zotac’s GeForce GTX 1080 Mini graphics card when it finally hits the market. GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Mini And here it is. Following Zotac’s recent GTX 1080 Mini graphics card launch, the company plans to sell a Mini version of the GTX 1080 Ti card as well. It will be offered in two versions: one “vanilla” model packing two cooling fans, and one ArcticStorm model with a full-card water block. Zotac says this is the world’s smallest and one of the lightest water-blocked graphics card to date. As for other details, Zotac wouldn’t budge. However, both cards will require two 8-pin power connectors, and measure a mere 8.3 inches long (210.8mm). The ArcticStorm model will even include Zotac’s Spectra illumination system. External VGA Box In addition to the new PC and graphics cards, Zotac will showcase a new external enclosure built to beef up your PC’s graphics capability without breaking it open. Connecting via a Thunderbolt 3 port, this enclosure supports graphics cards up to nine inches long, and up to the GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. It will include five USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A ports too, one of which is capable of charging mobile devices. VR GO This is Zotac’s backpack PC for tether-free virtual reality experiences. Zotac updated this wearable unit with a seventh-generation Intel Core processor, but currently we don’t have any other information regarding the overall VR GO refresh. The previous model had a sixth-generation Core i7-6700T processor backed by a GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. The outputs are likely unchanged, providing three HDMI 2.0 ports, two DisplayPort 1.3 connections, and six USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A ports. Pico PI225 / PI335 Moving away from the mainstream PC gaming products, we have Zotac’s portfolio of miniature PCs. As shown above, the Pico PI225 will be the company’s thinnest Zbox device yet, packing a fanless passive-cooled design and support for a 4K resolution. Zotac says the device is card-sized, meaning it should blend in at any location in the home or office. The larger PI335 will also passively cooled and capable of powering a 4K display. Magnus EN1050K Zotac’s Magnus-branded miniature PCs are built for PC gaming. They’re bigger than the Pico units and capable of playing host to “Mini” graphics cards built by Zotac. In the case of this model, it will include the GeForce GTX 1050 Mini graphics card, a seventh-generation Intel Core processor, or one of the new Ryzen processors from AMD. The Intel-based version will support Intel’s new Optane memory products, which are currently served up as 16GB and 32GB cache sticks for speeding up hard drive access. Magnus EK71070 / EK51060 Staying with the Magnus family, this duo will sport “Mini” graphics cards built by Zotac, too. Based on the product names, the EK71070 will feature a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor and a GeForce GTX 1070 Mini graphics card. Meanwhile, the EK51060 will have an Intel Core i5 processor and a GeForce GTX 1060 Mini card. Both will support Intel’s Optane memory devices. Magnus ER51070 / ER51060 As for these two units, they’re similar to the Magnus EK models listed above in their overall design. However, these Magnus ER versions are powered by AMD’s 65-watt Ryzen processors instead of Intel Core CPUs. Yet despite the processor switch, these two models will rely on “Mini” versions of the GTX 1070 and GTX 1060 graphics cards, respectively, instead of AMD’s own Radeon RX 500 Series of discrete graphics chips. MI553 / MA551 Zotac says its “M” series of miniature PCs is getting a whole new design starting with these two units. The letter after the “M” in the name provides a clue as to what’s inside. Thus, the MI553 will have a seventh-generation Intel Core processor supporting Optane-branded cache sticks. Meanwhile, the MA551 will rely on one of AMD’s new 65-watt Ryzen processors. Both will include a Thunderbolt 3 port. External Storage Box Finally, Zotac will have an external storage box on display in addition to its external graphics enclosure. Connecting to a PC via a Thunderbolt 3 port, this storage box will consist of one PCI Express x16 slot for add-on storage cards, and four USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-A ports. For example, during the show, this external storage device will be packed with Zotac’s Sonix 480GB NVMe PCI Express solid state drive. We expect to hear more about the detailed specifications, prices, and release dates during or sometime shortly after the Computex tech convention. The show will take place in Taipei between May 30 and June 3.

Also see: Best Deals General buying advice Solid-state storage is standard-issue for storing data in tablets and smartphones, where it's relied upon for its tiny size and rugged nature. Those same virtues can be handy in desktop PCs and especially laptops too, but it’s the speed of an SSD (solid-state drive) compared to a traditional hard drive which is the biggest reason to upgrade to one. Instead of a fragile magnetic disk whirring at 90 or 120 times every second, SSDs store binary data on shock-resistant silicon chips. Some people use the word ‘memory' when they mean storage, but the lines are blurred with NAND flash technology, which is essentially non-volatile memory. In other words, RAM that keeps its memory even after you switch off the power. Besides being physically robust, silent, and smaller and lighter than any hard-disk drive, the big incentive to go flash remains sheer data-hurtling performance. The bits can be read and written hundreds and thousands of times faster from electronic flash memory then conventional hard-disk drives. This speed factor is about so much more than go-faster bragging rights though. Old-school desktop PC users may still battle over who has the fastest processor or the hottest graphics card, but SSD performance is more about the overall user experience – applications launch almost instantly, web pages spawn faster, and files copy in a fraction of the time. Put simply, and regardless of whether your processor has an Intel or AMD logo, the whole computer responds so much faster to your clicks. The main drawback in the past has been the steep price of entry to the premier-class storage club. (See all storage reviews.) Best value storage It's taken six years or more, but we are now at the state where the SSD is a truly affordable component for any computer user. And if your wallet won't even stretch to £100, just juggle your byte budget instead and get a 256- or 500GB SSD for £75 or less. Performance has swelled over the years – not just in the drag-race test of copying big files, but crucially with the way that small files are handled. And also in the way that a drive maintains itself, forever pruning and sweeping up the garbage of deleted files in the background. Much of the background housekeeping of a modern PC operating system is with the incessant background reading and writing of very small files of 4 kilobytes or smaller. It's the random access to these that can choke old disks that need to physically move a pickup head across spinning platters. We have reached a point where just about any SSD you put into a computer to replace a hard disk will transform your experience. But for those seeking the very best performance, there's still a case for finding the fastest rather than just choosing the cheapest. And that fastest metric is now more about small-file transfers, which we can measure by the number of input and output operations capable in one second – otherwise known as IOPS. The best SATA-based flash drives are returning peak figures around 100,000 IOPS, made possible by the way that data streams can be paralleled together, a major asset of flash over hard disks. Buying an SSD for your computer Performance – in terms of the speed with which data can be read and written – has now effectively plateaued among the best SSDs. It's not that flash memory has reached its limit, far from it, but the Serial ATA interface between the flash and your computer is now an increasingly narrowing bottleneck. Pioneered by Apple and now finally trickling into the Windows world are solid-state drives that put SATA in the wastebasket, flash storage drives that hook more directly into the PC's native PCI Express bus. But Apple Macs take a proprietary version of these cards that are not available to buy or upgrade; and Windows PCs that are now available with the necessary M.2 PCIe attachments are just starting to go mainstream in 2017. With that said, they're still expensive, alongside the motherboards which actually support M.2. So for the moment, if you're building or upgrading a PC, chances are you'll be turning to the old tried-and-tested Serial ATA Revision 3.0 interface; often called SATA III. This bus has a 6Gb/s (750MB/s) nominal speed, but circa-550 MB/s real-world ceiling. Despite current SATA SSDs' shortcomings and converging performance specs we have tested the essential speed, both in large-file sequential transfers and small-file random access, as differences do exist between brands and models. Our selection covers the highest-performing SATA SSDs today, as well as some cheaper models that juggle the value factor rather than best-in-class performance figures. There are various technologies SSD manufacturers choose to utilise, from multi-level cell (MLC), to the cheaper triple-level cell flash (TLC) architectures. You might even come across the rare and more expensive single-level cell (SLC) drive. The differences between the cell technologies boil down to the amount of bits (data) that a single cell (within the SSD) can handle. TLC handles three, MLC, two and SLC one. The greater the number of bits per cell, the increased likelihood of failure, inconsistencies and most importantly performance. However, as this is a general sweeping statement, manufacturers have found ways around the limitations of SSD technology, but it's worth noting what is being used in your SSD, regardless of how it performs. When buying an SSD, look out for long warranties and high write limits if you prize data integrity, although with the help of proper backup routines, data loss is less of an issue today. Different SSDs demand more or less power in active use or when idle, and there are different power ratings again for when a laptop is in a sleep or hibernation mode. Unfortunately, we don't have the capability to measure power consumption in-house, and each manufacturer has its own way to present its numbers in the best light so we can't give a meaningful rundown of which has the best power economy. However, laptop users should take note of the rated power consumption of the SSDs in our group test, so that you know how much additional battery power you'll be using with an SSD. Do look out for manufacturers that provide accessible support with firmware updates possible on the platform of your choice. Most storage brands are still firmly routed in the Wintel world although with the decline of that platform more drive makers are making cross-platform upgrade tools available, in the form of bootable ISO images you can download from their support sites. For laptop users specifically, you'll want to also know the exact dimensions of an SSD, as it might not fit into your laptop. All SSDs have a 2.5in form factor, and often have 69.9x100.1x7mm dimensions – ensure it will fit in your laptop before purchasing it. How we test Most of the SSDs here were tested on the same Intel-based Windows 10 test rig. In addition, we ran the same benchmarks on our AMD-based rig and were shocked by the difference in performance. This budget system has an ASRock 970 Extreme3 Rev2.0 motherboard, with an AMD 970 Northbridge and AMD SB950 Southbridge. We found that, for example, the Samsung 850 Evo could only manage 405.3MB/s sequential read speed and 387.8MB/s write speed compared to 550.8 and 505.8MB/s on the Intel rig fitted with an Asus Sabertooth motherboard and the Intel Z77 chipset. This doesn’t mean you’ll see that performance on all AMD systems: we can only speak to our experience of this one PC. We also found that even on our Intel test rig, the ASMedia SATA 6Gb/s ports performed considerably worse than the Intel Z77 SATA 6Gb/s ports. Also, bear in mind that a 3Gb/s port will perform even slower, so you should ensure you’re your laptop or PC’s motherboard has a decent SATA controller in order for you to achieve the fastest possible speeds. We would recommend benchmarking your SSD upon receiving it and making sure it's connected to the fastest SATA port available. Also check that all your motherboard drivers are up to date.

Aimed at the entry-level market for discrete GPUs – that is, laptops that need performance only a bit above an integrated GPU – the MX150 is NVIDIA’s Pascal-based successor to the previous 930M/940M series of laptop adapters that have been in computers over the last couple of years. Today’s reveal is undoubtedly tied to next week’s Computex trade show, so we should expect to see a number of laptops using the new adapter announced in the coming days. From a technical perspective, details on the GeForce MX150 are very limited. Traditionally NVIDIA does not publish much in the way of details on their low-end laptop parts, and unfortunately the MX150’s launch isn’t any different. We’re still in the process of shaking down NVIDIA for more information, but what usually happens in these cases is that these low-end products don’t have strictly defined specifications. At a minimum, OEMs are allowed to dial in clockspeeds to meet their TDP and performance needs. However in prior generations we’ve also seen NVIDIA and OEMs use multiple GPUs under the same product name – mixing in GM107 and GM108, for example – so there’s also a strong possibility that will happen here as well. Officially, all NVIDIA says about the new video card is that it uses GDDR5 and that it offers around 33% better performance than the GeForce 940MX, a (typically) GM108-based product. Based on the market segment and NVIDIA’s recent activities in the desktop space, the “baseline” MX150 is without a doubt GP108, NVIDIA’s entry-level GPU that was just recently launched in the GeForce GT 1030 for desktops. Information about this chip is limited, but here’s my best guess for baseline MX150 specifications. Best Guess: NVIDIA Laptop Video Card Specification Comparison   Typical MX150 Typical 940MX CUDA Cores 384? 384 ROPs 16 8 Boost Clock Variable Variable Memory Type GDDR5 GDDR5/DDR3 Memory Bus Width 64-bit? 64-bit VRAM <=2GB <=2GB GPU GP108? GM108 Manufacturing Process TSMC 16nm TSMC 28nm Launch Date 05/26/2017 03/2016 The limited 33% performance improvement over the existing 940MX comes as a bit of a surprise, but it makes sense within the context of the specifications. Relative to a GDDR5 940MX, the MX150 does not have a significant specification advantage over the aforementioned 940MX, with the same number of CUDA cores and similar memory bandwidth. The one stand-out here is ROP throughput, which doubles thanks to GP108’s higher ROP count. Ultimately what this means is that most of MX150’s performance advantage over the 940MX comes from clockspeed improvements, with a smaller uptick from architectural gains. The counterpoint to that is that these are entry-level laptop parts that are frequently going to be paired with 15W Intel U-series CPUs, so vendors are going to play it safe on clockspeeds in order to maximize energy efficiency. NVIDIA does advertise these GPUs as offering multiple times the performance of Intel’s HD 620 iGPU, however given the higher power consumption of the GPU, I’m more curious how things would compare against Intel’s 28W Iris Plus 650 configurations. Owing to OEM configurability and general NVIDIA secrecy, NVIDIA does not publish official TDPs for these parts. But it’s interesting to note that while performance has only gone up 33%, NVIDIA is claiming that power efficiency/perf-per-watt has tripled. This strongly implies that NVIDIA’s baseline specifications for the product are favoring TDP over significant clockspeed gains, so I’m very interested to see what the real-world TDPs are going to be like. 940MX was a 20-30W part (depending on who you asked and what GPU they used), so with the jump from 28nm to 16nm, NVIDIA should have a good bit of room for drawing down TDPs. Though ultimately what this may mean is that MX150 is closer to a 930M(X) replacement than a 940M(X) replacement if we’re framing things in terms of power consumption. Otherwise, as a GP108 part this is the Pascal architecture we’ve all come to know and love. Relative to NVIDIA’s desktop parts, this is actually a more substantial upgrade, as the previous 930M/940M parts were based on NVIDIA’s Maxwell 1-generation GM108 GPUs, and not the newer Maxwell 2 GM2xx series. The difference being that these earlier parts lacked the DirectX feature level 12_1, HDMI 2.0, and low-level performance optimizations (e.g. newer color compress) that we better know the Maxwell family for. So while MX150 isn’t meant for serious gaming laptops, it has a much richer feature set to draw from for both rendering and media tasks. CUDA road coders will likely also appreciate the fact that the newer part will offer CUDA compute capabilities much closer to NVIDIA’s current-generation server hardware, such as fine-grained preemption. Finally, like its predecessor, expect to see the GeForce MX150 frequently paired up with Intel’s U-series CPUs in ultrabooks. While this SKU isn’t strictly limited to slim form factors – and someone will probably put it into a larger device for good measure – it’s definitely how NVIDIA is positioning the part, as the GTX 1050 series is for larger devices. Also expect to see most (if not all) MX150 parts running in Optimus mode, which continues to be a strong selling point for encouraging OEMs to include a dGPU. With Computex kicking off next week, we should see a flurry of laptop announcements. Though not all of the relevant laptop announcements have gone out yet, NVIDIA’s announcement names Acer, Asus, Clevo, MSI, and HP as laptop vendors who will all be shipping MX150-equipped laptops. NVIDIA and their various partners will in turn hit the ground running here, as NVIDIA’s announcement notes that MX150-equipped laptops will begin shipping next month.

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:35 Don Reba says: They are slightly modified Xeon cores, but you’re right that they are not really comparable. The Phi runs its own OS, it’s not just a chip. We evaluated them for the LHCb compute farm, but they turned out to be far from price-competitive compared to GPUs.

Intel isn’t “lazy”, the problem is that CPU development isn’t magic. The only straightforward thing is using smaller processes for better efficiency, everything else is either a tradeoff or expensive or a genuine innovation. It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming. Of course, it’ll be great for the multi-threaded successor to Dwarf Fortress that I keep hoping somebody makes. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 10:34 Dinger says: I certainly remember the miserable Pentium 4 years, and I also remember the rapid growth that led up to it: the 1990s opened with the 80486 at 33 MHz and ended with Coppermine PIIIs and AMD Firebirds breaking the GHz barrier. So, yeah, the nineties were a decade that saw a 30-fold increase in desktop clockspeeds. The “Megahertz Race” also set the table for the disastrous Pentium 4 era, where Intel ran headfirst into a wall of power and thermal issues, and everything stalled out under 4 GHz. Now, ten years after P4 finally died, we’re getting 16 cores running just under 4 GHz. In short, no, I don’t agree. The Core 2 was an enormous step forward, certainly, but the P4 doldrums before it were largely due to the time it takes for design and administrative inertia to change radically the way chips are designed. Now the doldrums are that the new possibilities offered by hardware don’t make a compelling case for businesses to shorten their hardware replacement cycles.

If this years CPU is only 5% better than last years, with no new bells or whistles, then why bother to upgrade? What this recent crop of AMD processors will hopefully do is prompt Intel to drop their prices somewhat to compete.

This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none. Combined with the aggressive roadmap that AMD has laid out for die shrinkage and general processor improvement and Intel has been scrambling. You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself. Unless Intel pulls a series of rabbits out of their hat AMD is going to seriously cut into their marketshare over the next 5 years. Especially if Apple goes with Raven Ridge for the new Macbook Pro.

A really fast customized car or motorcycle isn’t that useful either, but that’s hardly the point, I think. Shiny new stuff is fun. Where I have been glad I waited is when I had a vague idea of what I wanted and what I could afford pay for it, and just watched for deals. That’s how I ended up with a GTX 1060 3gb for just over 160 USD, and I’m happy as a clam with that card. The hierarchy on Tom’s Hardware for GPUs which I linked to is also helpful, because (even if it’s oversimplified) it shows how silly it would be to drop two or three hundred bucks just to go up one tier for almost no noticeable gains. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:12 snv says: Well, link to xkcd.com but it is my guess that we can thank VR for the restart of the hardware spiral.

Not because I have any particular love for them or dislike of Intel, but just because it’d be better for the market if they did. In my heart of hearts, I hope that they do something as game changing as when they invented x64 and somehow their new advantage is parlayed into an avalanche-like shift to Linux in PC gaming. Not because I’m a Linux evangelist, mind you, but just because Windows 10 is an abomination we only put up with for compatibility reasons.

Not as a pure performance product (the Xeons rule) but as the best performance / value / power efficiency match. With virtualization or 3D, you really don’t care about a single box performance, but about how many boxes you can cram in a datacenter, for a defined budget. AMD has yet to resolve the compatibility problems the Ryzen have on ESXi, but it already seems that Ryzen CPUs are already a good performance / value investment in the rendering farms field. For the enthusiast gamer market, things are a little bit tricky … 10 years ago, 2 cores were enough, because multi-threading a game is a complex job. Now, every single game which comes out is 4-way optimized, it took the gaming industry nearly 10 years ! Multi-threading means separating the game logic between multiple threads, which are run in parallel. You can for exemple separate the main thread, the sound thread, the ai thread, the physics thread. But there’s no point in separating the main thread, because it is a sequential process, not parallel by nature. It cannot be separated, it is considered as “atomic”. The Ryzen many-cores line of products future could be determined by how many threads the gaming industry will adapt to in the not so distant future, and what usages they’ll find to them. More threads would maybe mean more AI or more physics, which are for now quite rudimentary. Or a completely new usage for the threads, like machine learning, which could enhance the player’s experience greatly. In any case, AMD Ryzen could drive Intel’s CPUs prices down, which is a great thing, for the professionnal and the gaming market. The worst case in any market is when a single company has a monopoly, and for many years, Intel had a real monopoly on CPUs =/ Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Data compiled by industry tracker DRAMeXchange shows Intel accounted for 40 per cent of the market, while Samsung's share stood at 25 per cent in the January-March period, Yonhap news agency reported. An SSD is a data storage device made with a NAND flash memory chip that does not need power to store data and is more durable and faster than a hard disk drive. While Samsung stands as the top player in the SSD market for private usage, it still falls behind the US rival in the sector for companies. The combined shipment of the corporate SSDs was estimated at 6 million units in the first quarter -- up 3 to 4 per cent year-on-year, the data also showed. DRAMeXchange said the demand for corporate SSD is anticipated to grow down the road as major online giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft provide services through data centre networks. --IANS qd/ksk/dg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Modi-fying bilateral relations: PM's four-nation Europe tour 'Mor' about law!

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Attention: Read this before you buy a new PC! Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:52 vorador says: On the positive side it will definitely put the screws on Intel, who has been lazy as hell lately on the CPU department, with new models barely a 5%-10% performance improvement over previous ones. While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:35 Don Reba says: They are slightly modified Xeon cores, but you’re right that they are not really comparable. The Phi runs its own OS, it’s not just a chip. We evaluated them for the LHCb compute farm, but they turned out to be far from price-competitive compared to GPUs. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 02:25 TillEulenspiegel says: I swear people are spoiled by the huge jump that occurred around Core 2 and have no memory of the miserable Pentium 4 years. Intel isn’t “lazy”, the problem is that CPU development isn’t magic. The only straightforward thing is using smaller processes for better efficiency, everything else is either a tradeoff or expensive or a genuine innovation. It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming. Of course, it’ll be great for the multi-threaded successor to Dwarf Fortress that I keep hoping somebody makes. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 10:34 Dinger says: I certainly remember the miserable Pentium 4 years, and I also remember the rapid growth that led up to it: the 1990s opened with the 80486 at 33 MHz and ended with Coppermine PIIIs and AMD Firebirds breaking the GHz barrier. So, yeah, the nineties were a decade that saw a 30-fold increase in desktop clockspeeds. The “Megahertz Race” also set the table for the disastrous Pentium 4 era, where Intel ran headfirst into a wall of power and thermal issues, and everything stalled out under 4 GHz. Now, ten years after P4 finally died, we’re getting 16 cores running just under 4 GHz. In short, no, I don’t agree. The Core 2 was an enormous step forward, certainly, but the P4 doldrums before it were largely due to the time it takes for design and administrative inertia to change radically the way chips are designed. Now the doldrums are that the new possibilities offered by hardware don’t make a compelling case for businesses to shorten their hardware replacement cycles.

If this years CPU is only 5% better than last years, with no new bells or whistles, then why bother to upgrade? What this recent crop of AMD processors will hopefully do is prompt Intel to drop their prices somewhat to compete.

Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 02:00 ravenshrike says: Thing is, the Threadripper series of CPU(Incidentally Jeremy, that’s going to be the chips actual name, not Ryzen 9) in combination with Epyc and Ryzen completely saturates every level of the market. This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none. Combined with the aggressive roadmap that AMD has laid out for die shrinkage and general processor improvement and Intel has been scrambling. You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself. Unless Intel pulls a series of rabbits out of their hat AMD is going to seriously cut into their marketshare over the next 5 years. Especially if Apple goes with Raven Ridge for the new Macbook Pro.

I am skeptical. More seriously, is anyone considering an upgrade, and why? I’ve been a cheapskate for so long that the only things which really excite me are the high-value inexpensive things like that Raven Ridge APU. I’ve had a couple of A8 series APUs which were firmly in the “better than nothing” category, but did great with old games. Now I’ve got an i5 3550 that a family member gave me, which is stubbornly holding on at the very bottom of the highest tier in Tom’s Hardware’s hierarchy, so I think Threa will have to drip somewhere else. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:42 Lukasz says: I’m building new system.

A really fast customized car or motorcycle isn’t that useful either, but that’s hardly the point, I think. Shiny new stuff is fun. Where I have been glad I waited is when I had a vague idea of what I wanted and what I could afford pay for it, and just watched for deals. That’s how I ended up with a GTX 1060 3gb for just over 160 USD, and I’m happy as a clam with that card. The hierarchy on Tom’s Hardware for GPUs which I linked to is also helpful, because (even if it’s oversimplified) it shows how silly it would be to drop two or three hundred bucks just to go up one tier for almost no noticeable gains. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:12 snv says: Well, link to xkcd.com but it is my guess that we can thank VR for the restart of the hardware spiral.

Not because I have any particular love for them or dislike of Intel, but just because it’d be better for the market if they did. In my heart of hearts, I hope that they do something as game changing as when they invented x64 and somehow their new advantage is parlayed into an avalanche-like shift to Linux in PC gaming. Not because I’m a Linux evangelist, mind you, but just because Windows 10 is an abomination we only put up with for compatibility reasons.

Not as a pure performance product (the Xeons rule) but as the best performance / value / power efficiency match. With virtualization or 3D, you really don’t care about a single box performance, but about how many boxes you can cram in a datacenter, for a defined budget. AMD has yet to resolve the compatibility problems the Ryzen have on ESXi, but it already seems that Ryzen CPUs are already a good performance / value investment in the rendering farms field. For the enthusiast gamer market, things are a little bit tricky … 10 years ago, 2 cores were enough, because multi-threading a game is a complex job. Now, every single game which comes out is 4-way optimized, it took the gaming industry nearly 10 years ! Multi-threading means separating the game logic between multiple threads, which are run in parallel. You can for exemple separate the main thread, the sound thread, the ai thread, the physics thread. But there’s no point in separating the main thread, because it is a sequential process, not parallel by nature. It cannot be separated, it is considered as “atomic”. The Ryzen many-cores line of products future could be determined by how many threads the gaming industry will adapt to in the not so distant future, and what usages they’ll find to them.

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:35 Don Reba says: They are slightly modified Xeon cores, but you’re right that they are not really comparable. The Phi runs its own OS, it’s not just a chip. We evaluated them for the LHCb compute farm, but they turned out to be far from price-competitive compared to GPUs.

Intel isn’t “lazy”, the problem is that CPU development isn’t magic. The only straightforward thing is using smaller processes for better efficiency, everything else is either a tradeoff or expensive or a genuine innovation. It’s astonishing we’ve come this far; ~15 years ago there was real fear about reaching physical limits due to heat. Yeah you can shove more cores on a single die, but that doesn’t make it a useful consumer product. You add a lot of Watts to crush some benchmarks, but it has zero relevance to the vast majority of “enthusiast” gaming. Of course, it’ll be great for the multi-threaded successor to Dwarf Fortress that I keep hoping somebody makes. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 10:34 Dinger says: I certainly remember the miserable Pentium 4 years, and I also remember the rapid growth that led up to it: the 1990s opened with the 80486 at 33 MHz and ended with Coppermine PIIIs and AMD Firebirds breaking the GHz barrier. So, yeah, the nineties were a decade that saw a 30-fold increase in desktop clockspeeds. The “Megahertz Race” also set the table for the disastrous Pentium 4 era, where Intel ran headfirst into a wall of power and thermal issues, and everything stalled out under 4 GHz. Now, ten years after P4 finally died, we’re getting 16 cores running just under 4 GHz. In short, no, I don’t agree. The Core 2 was an enormous step forward, certainly, but the P4 doldrums before it were largely due to the time it takes for design and administrative inertia to change radically the way chips are designed. Now the doldrums are that the new possibilities offered by hardware don’t make a compelling case for businesses to shorten their hardware replacement cycles.

If this years CPU is only 5% better than last years, with no new bells or whistles, then why bother to upgrade? What this recent crop of AMD processors will hopefully do is prompt Intel to drop their prices somewhat to compete.

This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none. Combined with the aggressive roadmap that AMD has laid out for die shrinkage and general processor improvement and Intel has been scrambling. You can see this in their early(by about 6-8 months) release of the 299 chipset and processors. Now, Intel does have an advantage with Optane for servers, but the amount of data sets that could take advantage of it and would find the load time boosts upon system restarts that 6 terabytes of Optane can give economically feasible at $2-4 per GB has to be pretty damned low. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:35 Buuurr says: ” This puts immense pressure on Intel, as last year they had none.” Yeah, Intel is terrified to lose that other 15% of the market that gives them a ginormous lead in RND and marketing and income. That 15% provides Intel with the best competition that it could possibly ever want to go against… competition that is always on the back foot. Sorry, competition that is always in the air about to hit the mat after a proper upper cut. If you think Intel is fearing anything, go ahead and check the stocks and cash reserves to find all the ‘fear’. AMD’s release was nothing more than a last gasp from them. Years ago when they were emergent they had some great, genuine competition to Intel chips. They really did. But, they fell and haven’t gotten up yet. Yeah, they released some new chips that do a touch better than the Intel line released a year ago. Great. Hi, welcome to the party. Intel releases the new ones soon. As usual, they will destroy. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 05:49 ravenshrike says: Yeah, you don’t seem to understand AMDs play. They’re making a serious push for the server and content creation market out of the gate with servers that will cost from 60-70% of comparable Intel servers. Moreover, Intel doesn’t look to have more than their 5-10% real world performance gains in their current architecture assuming the past three refreshes are anything to go by. Whereas this is the first iteration of Zen, and it’s immediately going through a process shrink, disregarding any other improvements to the underlying architecture itself. Unless Intel pulls a series of rabbits out of their hat AMD is going to seriously cut into their marketshare over the next 5 years. Especially if Apple goes with Raven Ridge for the new Macbook Pro.

I am skeptical. More seriously, is anyone considering an upgrade, and why? I’ve been a cheapskate for so long that the only things which really excite me are the high-value inexpensive things like that Raven Ridge APU. I’ve had a couple of A8 series APUs which were firmly in the “better than nothing” category, but did great with old games. Now I’ve got an i5 3550 that a family member gave me, which is stubbornly holding on at the very bottom of the highest tier in Tom’s Hardware’s hierarchy, so I think Threa will have to drip somewhere else. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:42 Lukasz says: I’m building new system.

A really fast customized car or motorcycle isn’t that useful either, but that’s hardly the point, I think. Shiny new stuff is fun. Where I have been glad I waited is when I had a vague idea of what I wanted and what I could afford pay for it, and just watched for deals. That’s how I ended up with a GTX 1060 3gb for just over 160 USD, and I’m happy as a clam with that card. The hierarchy on Tom’s Hardware for GPUs which I linked to is also helpful, because (even if it’s oversimplified) it shows how silly it would be to drop two or three hundred bucks just to go up one tier for almost no noticeable gains. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:12 snv says: Well, link to xkcd.com but it is my guess that we can thank VR for the restart of the hardware spiral.

In my heart of hearts, I hope that they do something as game changing as when they invented x64 and somehow their new advantage is parlayed into an avalanche-like shift to Linux in PC gaming.

Not as a pure performance product (the Xeons rule) but as the best performance / value / power efficiency match. With virtualization or 3D, you really don’t care about a single box performance, but about how many boxes you can cram in a datacenter, for a defined budget. AMD has yet to resolve the compatibility problems the Ryzen have on ESXi, but it already seems that Ryzen CPUs are already a good performance / value investment in the rendering farms field. For the enthusiast gamer market, things are a little bit tricky … 10 years ago, 2 cores were enough, because multi-threading a game is a complex job. Now, every single game which comes out is 4-way optimized, it took the gaming industry nearly 10 years ! Multi-threading means separating the game logic between multiple threads, which are run in parallel. You can for exemple separate the main thread, the sound thread, the ai thread, the physics thread. But there’s no point in separating the main thread, because it is a sequential process, not parallel by nature. It cannot be separated, it is considered as “atomic”. The Ryzen many-cores line of products future could be determined by how many threads the gaming industry will adapt to in the not so distant future, and what usages they’ll find to them. More threads would maybe mean more AI or more physics, which are for now quite rudimentary. Or a completely new usage for the threads, like machine learning, which could enhance the player’s experience greatly. In any case, AMD Ryzen could drive Intel’s CPUs prices down, which is a great thing, for the professionnal and the gaming market.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Young Scientists Earn International Recognition for Independent Research Judges congratulate SPIE Special Award first-place winner at Intel ISEF 2017. It was great fun to experience how much these young people knew about their topic, and to encourage them to learn more about photonics and optics. BELLINGHAM, Washington, and LOS ANGELES, California, USA (PRWEB) May 25, 2017 SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, and more than 55 organizations representing a multitude of scientific disciplines distributed more than 300 awards, scholarships, internships, and scientific exploration opportunities to high school students at the 2017 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) during the Special Awards Ceremony on 18 May in Los Angeles. The Intel ISEF is a program of the Society for Science and the Public and is the world’s largest international pre-college science competition. Winning students were ninth- through twelfth-graders who earned top prizes at local, regional, state, or national science fairs, gaining them entry in the 2017 Intel ISEF. Approximately 1,800 high school students from more than 75 countries, regions, and territories were awarded the opportunity to showcase their independent research and compete for on average $4 million in prizes. The volunteer judging team for SPIE prizes included SPIE Senior Member John Tamkin (lead judge) of Imaging Insights LLC, SPIE Early Career Professional Member Pang Yu Teng of the University of California, Los Angeles, and SPIE Member Pramod Butte of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. First place with a $2,000 prize was awarded to Nicky Wojtania of Plano West Senior High School, USA, for her project „Cellulose nanocrystals for security applications: embedding nonoptical signatures provided by nanoparticles into cellulose nanocrystal chiral nematic films.” She modified cellulose nanocrystals with nano- and other particles to provide both optical and nonoptical signatures, to create a new class of security features useful for currency and other printed media. Second place with a $1,500 prize was awarded to Valerio Pagliarino of I.I.S. Nicola Pellati, Italy, for his project „LaserWAN — laser broadband internet connections.” He designed and prototyped a fully functional high-bandwidth free-space laser communication system intended for installation on top of power line pylons, reducing isolation of rural areas. The system includes adaptive focusing optics to accommodate changes in weather. Third place with an award of $1,000 went to Dominic Catanzaro, Cathedral Catholic High School, USA, for his project „Quick aligning telescopes.” He investigated alignment strategies of 2-element refractive telescopes both computationally and practically, devising an automated way to achieve collimation and reduce aberrations. His technique involved coupling interferometric wavefront errors using Zernike polynomials to drive actuators for wavefront aberration minimization. He compared his results with expected results from a double-pass optical design model using commercial software. Fourth place with an award of $500 went to Gareth Reid of Grosvenor Grammar School, United Kingdom, for his project „Gaze: a low-cost digital optical device supporting education in developing countries.” He developed a low-cost microscope that uses a smartphone or tablet as a display device, which includes motor-driven focus and an ergonomic design while achieving very low cost — under $10 — for classroom environments. „We viewed more than 30 entries that included SPIE-related content across diverse fields including improvement of solar collection using bio-inspired structures (rose petals),a smartphone-enabled ophthalmoscope that leveraged deep learning algorithms for disease identification, virtual displays, and more,” Tamkin said. „It was great fun to experience how much these young people knew about their topic, and to encourage them to learn more about the world of photonics and optics.” About SPIE SPIE is the international society for optics and photonics, an educational not-for-profit organization founded in 1955 to advance light-based science, engineering, and technology. The Society serves nearly 264,000 constituents from approximately 166 countries, offering conferences and their published proceedings, continuing education, books, journals, and the SPIE Digital Library. In 2016, SPIE provided more than $4 million in support of education and outreach programs. http://www.spie.org Share article on social media or email: CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Computer Accessories Market 5.71% CAGR by 2021 Driven by Growing Popularity of E-Sports Next PostNext Cubic to Discuss Mobility Innovation at BRIDGE Spring 2017 in San Francisco Search Recent Posts Archibald takes CiCLE Classic crown in dramatic Melton Mowbray finale London Attacks: Statement by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini meets with Reported abduction and illegal detention of Azerbaijani national Discours de la HR/VP Federica Mogherini au Sommet de la Communau Business Directory Business Contacts Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Proudly powered by WordPress

By Cale Hunt Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 54 Comments Should I get the older Surface Pro 4 or the new Surface Pro? Now that Microsoft's refreshed Surface Pro 4 — named simply the Surface Pro — has been revealed, many people are wondering whether they should stick with a tried and true device or go for the newer hardware. Let's take a look at some of the differences and similarities to see which Surface is best suited to your needs. See at Microsoft | Surface Pro See at Microsoft | Surface Pro 4 The new Surface Pro is more portable The Surface Pro line has always been about taking on tablets while maintaining the function of a full PC. The new Surface Pro takes this idea and runs with it. Available in models coming later this year will be optional 4G LTE connectivity. This will work with nano SIM cards commonly used now, as well as eSIM cards that are set to take over. Adding to the Surface Pro's portability is a battery that will last about 50 percent longer. You should expect up to about 13.5 hours of use on a full charge, meaning you don't have to worry about hauling a charger with you. Bottom line: If you're working primarily from home or office, LTE connectivity and a larger battery don't mean much. However, if you're constantly on the go to places without Wi-Fi (and likely without an outlet), the new Surface Pro should be your first choice. The new Surface Pro contains new hardware With this overhaul comes a host of new hardware, including 7th-generation Intel "Kaby Lake" processors. The upgrade from 6th-generation processors helps with battery life and delivers a slight edge in performance, but the biggest change is perhaps that Core i5 processors are now fanless. Core i7 models of the new Surface Pro use Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, giving a significant boost to graphics power over the Intel Iris Graphics 540 in the Core i7 Surface Pro 4 models. Bottom line: If you're interested in graphic design or any other hardware-intensive activity, you'll want to opt for the new Surface Pro. Just need a laptop for browsing the web and word processing? The Surface Pro 4 will handle those tasks with ease. There have been some changes to the body of the new Surface Pro Picking up the new Surface Pro, one of the first things you'll notice is how the edges are smoother and more rounded. Also changed are the radial vents that run around the top of the device. They are quite noticeable on the Surface Pro 4, but Microsoft has done a good job of trimming them down on the newer Surface Pro. One other noticeable aspect on the Surface Pro 4 is the front-facing camera. The cutout in the bezel where it sits is sort of wide and is a different color than the rest of the bezel. Not so on the new Surface Pro. The camera has been blacked out, making it disappear into the bezel. No longer will the eye be drawn there. The kickstand on the back of the new Surface Pro now opens further, allowing your device to sit at a 165-degree angle. The Surface Pro 4 does open quite wide — at a 150-degree angle — and is suitable for most people, but artists will love the extra 15 degrees. Bottom line: The big difference here for a lot of people will likely be the extra degrees of rotation in the kickstand, but those concerned with the appearance of their device will also love the smooth edges, hidden camera, and reduced vents on the new Surface Pro. See at Microsoft | Surface Pro See at Microsoft | Surface Pro 4 New Surface Pro Type Covers also work with previous models With the new Surface Pro comes a new collection of Type Covers, the slick keyboards that attach with magnets. These new Type Covers are all covered with Alcantara fabric, the luxury stuff found only on previous Signature Type Covers and on the new Surface Laptops. These new Type Covers are available in three new colors: platinum, burgundy, and cobalt blue. Those who already have a Surface Pro 4 will be happy to know that these new Type Covers are backwards compatible. Bottom line: This one is a draw. The new Type Covers will work with the Surface Pro 4, leaving the option open. The new Surface Pen blows the old one away One of the main features of the Surface Pro is inking, and the new Surface Pen has been updated to reflect the demands of users and advances in technology. Instead of 1,024 levels of sensitivity found in the old pen that comes with the Surface Pro 4, the new pen has a whopping 4,096 levels of sensitivity. Also cut down is the latency. The new Surface Pen sits at 21 milliseconds, while the older pen is more than double that at 45 milliseconds. You can now also use the pen on more of a tilt, great for shading. The extra sensitivity, increased tilt, and decreased latency means an inking experience that's pretty much on par with a real pen on real paper. The good news here is that the new Surface Pens are backwards compatible with the Surface Pro 4. However, not all features will be available due to different technology in the older displays. It appears that you won't be able to experience the same levels of latency or sensitivity, but a later update will bring the increased tilt support to the Surface Pro 4. One more thing: the Surface Dial can now be used directly on the screen of the new Surface Pro, something mobile artists have been clamoring for. Bottom line: For the absolute best pen and inking experience, you have to go with the new Surface Pro. The new Surface Pens will work with the Surface Pro 4, but you won't be getting the same experience. Price and availability Many people will turn to the price comparison as the final decider here. The 128GB SSD, 4GB of RAM, Intel Core m3 configuration of the Surface Pro 4 costs about $700, while the same configuration (albeit with newer hardware) in the Surface Pro costs about $800. Neither of these laptops includes a Surface Pen or Type Cover. As you scale up the hardware, a Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD costs about $2,400, but you also get a Surface Pen (last generation) with the deal. A new Surface Pro with the same specs and no included Surface Pen costs about $2,700. As for availability, the new Surface Pro and new Type Covers will be available June 15 in the following countries: Australia. Austria. Belgium. Canada. China. Denmark. Finland. France. Germany. Hong Kong. Ireland. Italy. Japan. Korea. Luxembourg. Netherland. New Zealand. Norway. Poland. Portugal. Spain. Sweden. Switzerland. Taiwan. U.K. US. Bottom line: If you need the least expensive Surface between these two devices, go with the older Surface Pro 4. The included pen (except for the Core m3 model) and price difference of a few hundred dollars can be a pretty heavy factor. The Surface Pro 4 is still a formidable laptop, especially for anyone not worried about the absolute latest hardware.

No you can't, because it didn't happen 1 1 week ago Reply PoohGQ It's great that they were some updated improvements, and all, but that's not a SP5. I got a better deal on an SP4 and it made more sense than to jump on the little improvements added that will still mean I will have an obsolete piece of hardware in a year anyway! 0 1 week ago Reply superjack How durable is the alcantara fabric covered keyboard?

BTW This truly shows that A SURFACE PHONE ( LTE , TELEPHONY) IS ON ITS WAY!!!!!!! BOTTOM LINE: I 've only had the Pro for a year and I cannot justify buying a new one just yet . 1 1 week ago Reply Aden Rossinni I think, the question should have been, 'Is the Surface Pro 4 still viable since the Pro is soooooo much better!' Future discounted rates on the Pro 4 will tell if that is still worth buying. I have the Pro 4 and love it but there is no way I would still buy it over the new Pro!!! Battery life, better pen, better chip, lighter etc. I think it goes without saying. Deep discounts, well that's another thing. 1 1 week ago Reply Cryio Basically: If you don't have a Surface Pro and you want one, get the Pro 5. It's an improvement all around. If you want one and you've been waiting for the new one, the ... 300$ difference between same configurations SP4/5 is worth it. 0 1 week ago Reply Cryio "Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, giving a significant boost to graphics power over the Intel Iris Graphics 540 in the Core i7 Surface Pro 4 models."

Also, what happened to the same kinds of technology getting less expensive over time?  There is nothing novel about any of these devices over the past 10 years that warrants the trends in pricing that are outpacing inflation as well as cost-benefit.  The inherent planned obsolete nature of these non-user-repairable products should immediately knock their prices down within a year of their release let alone start them off at a much lower price point.  Your bloated R&D isn't producing much that we can't live without short of the government arbitrarily making tech use mandatory to do normal human activities. 2 1 week ago Reply TechFreak1 Interesting approach to surface pen for latest iteration of the surface pro series to say the least (not one that I'm overly fond off, rather Applesque. Also why just Surface Pro? Does that mean it's the last iteration of the series and going forward we will just get internal hardware revamps? Hmm.. 0 1 week ago Reply badMojo69 All I want is a core M with 8 gigs of RAM.  Is that too much to ask. I run AMIDuOs and it would help if I had the extra memory.  4 extra gigs and a i5 isn't worth 2x times the price.  I'd pay an extra $200 tops. 1 1 week ago Reply kingtigre The increased battery is the only thing from the Surface Pro that I will miss on my Pro 4. If I can get tilt and more pen pressure just by purchasing a new pen, I'm perfectly happy with my Pro 4's kickstand angle, pen performance, cpu, display, etc, etc. I'm still a little bitter that we never got on screen Dial support. I bought one ONLY because whats-his-face at Microsoft said we'd be getting it.    0 1 week ago Reply onysi Minimal upgrade. I'll wait for surface pro 2019. I will get the alcantara keyboard tho.

I really don't understand that they had to increase the price by not including the pen. That's a 100 dollar more for nothing. On the other hand they sell it as a laptop but don't include the keyboard and just reveal the even more expensive signature keyboard, which makes the whole system even more expensive. For this price I better buy a pro 4.   1 1 week ago Reply Gertsy New processor = more than $100 cost. 1 1 week ago Reply hellohogo The Dial will work on screen on the sp4 and the SB after firmware updates.

Yep, the pen and cover need to be included or at least discounted if you buy it when you buy the Surface Pro. 2 1 week ago Reply zoom44 Currently Microsoft sells the M3 Pro 4 without the pen included at the reduced price mentioned. the New Surface Pro does not come with the Pen in any configuration. It is sold separetly for $99. 1 1 week ago Reply Gertsy I read that MS surveys have shown that only 25-33% of Sp3 or Sp4 users actually use their pens. If they included the Pen the price would be higher. 1 1 week ago Reply Aden Rossinni Not true. Silly assumption. Most people don't use one because they are not used to it or have no real need. 0 1 week ago Reply AdeptMaven Core i7 models of the new Surface Pro use Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, giving a significant boost to graphics power over the Intel Iris Graphics 540 in the Core i7 Surface Pro 4 models.

However annoying that is, for my needs, this device still has lots of life left so no upgrade for me.  3 1 week ago Reply sholokov I agree. And with new insider builds, I think the power-on from sleep is almost instant. Unless they mean instant on from hibernate or a powered off device. I use the Windows button (tap) to wake the SP3 from sleep. I find it faster than the power button. 1 1 week ago Reply Dradzk Have to agree. As much as I would like a shiny new Surface Pro, my SP3 still runs like a champ. No real reason to upgrade except the desire for new toys, and this is a rather expensive toy to try to keep current. That said, I do predominately use it with the cover attached, so we'll have to see what a SB2 looks like. 1 1 week ago Reply sakischri We are also in Europe (Greece). Why do MS ignore Greece as a market ? -2 1 week ago Reply Gertsy I guess this is a translation error and you mean why do MS ignore Greece.

(And I agree about the instant-on feature mentioned above.) 0 1 week ago Reply Shadow 024 Yes, old keyboards work with the new Surface Pro. 2 1 week ago Reply Aden Rossinni I'm sure they would be. 0 1 week ago Reply Devan Hammack I'm more interested in the instant-on feature that was mentioned quickly somewhere. If one is truly like a tablet while the other still 'turns on quickly' like a PC, that's done deal. I know this seems like an OS thing, but I'd like to know if it truly is, or if there is some hardware component as well 7 1 week ago Reply RayWP7 First of all, I agree. The instant-on is a highly desired feature. It's funny. Back in the day, Microsoft was trying to some core kernel code put onto BIOS chips to enable faster boot times.  I think this was 15+ years ago (at least).   It surprises me today, that they are still unable to forge the type of partnerships required to make that happen.  Maybe they have!  But, I have pretty recent PCs and though sleep/ hibernate resume is fast enough, it isn't "press power, screen on and login waiting" fast. 0 1 week ago Reply Gertsy The current SP4 (i5) takes half a sec to return from Sleep. 12 seconds from a cold start.  like ourselves you don't need to actually turn off until the end of the day. :) An Ipad Pro takes 35 secs from a cold start. Half a sec from sleep.  A Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 takes 25 Secs from cold start.  Half a sec from sleep. I dont want my SP4 or SP to boot truly like a tablet that would be a step backwards of 4 years.

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:39 tormeh says: Technically yes, but if I remember correctly, the cores in Xeon Phi are essentially slightly modified 386 cores. In other words, the Xeon Phi has absolutely useless single-core performance. While there definitely are applications that benefit from this approach, you would be really screwed for everything else. The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs. That it can do all the instructions a standard x86 CPU can do is a unique selling point, but you shouldn’t take that as an invitation to use it as a CPU.

A really fast customized car or motorcycle isn’t that useful either, but that’s hardly the point, I think. Shiny new stuff is fun. Where I have been glad I waited is when I had a vague idea of what I wanted and what I could afford pay for it, and just watched for deals. That’s how I ended up with a GTX 1060 3gb for just over 160 USD, and I’m happy as a clam with that card. The hierarchy on Tom’s Hardware for GPUs which I linked to is also helpful, because (even if it’s oversimplified) it shows how silly it would be to drop two or three hundred bucks just to go up one tier for almost no noticeable gains. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:12 snv says: Well, link to xkcd.com but it is my guess that we can thank VR for the restart of the hardware spiral.

Not as a pure performance product (the Xeons rule) but as the best performance / value / power efficiency match. With virtualization or 3D, you really don’t care about a single box performance, but about how many boxes you can cram in a datacenter, for a defined budget. AMD has yet to resolve the compatibility problems the Ryzen have on ESXi, but it already seems that Ryzen CPUs are already a good performance / value investment in the rendering farms field. For the enthusiast gamer market, things are a little bit tricky … 10 years ago, 2 cores were enough, because multi-threading a game is a complex job. Now, every single game which comes out is 4-way optimized, it took the gaming industry nearly 10 years ! Multi-threading means separating the game logic between multiple threads, which are run in parallel. You can for exemple separate the main thread, the sound thread, the ai thread, the physics thread. But there’s no point in separating the main thread, because it is a sequential process, not parallel by nature. It cannot be separated, it is considered as “atomic”. The Ryzen many-cores line of products future could be determined by how many threads the gaming industry will adapt to in the not so distant future, and what usages they’ll find to them. More threads would maybe mean more AI or more physics, which are for now quite rudimentary. Or a completely new usage for the threads, like machine learning, which could enhance the player’s experience greatly. In any case, AMD Ryzen could drive Intel’s CPUs prices down, which is a great thing, for the professionnal and the gaming market. The worst case in any market is when a single company has a monopoly, and for many years, Intel had a real monopoly on CPUs =/ Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Home Hardware AMD’s 16-core CPU and other exciting stuff By Jeremy Laird on May 25th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Yes, yes, a 16-core CPU is likely-going-on-definitely irrelevant for PC gaming. But it’s an exciting notion in simple technological terms and it represents something that certainly is important for gaming, namely that the PC as a platform has woken up again. Along with that mega-CPU from AMD, we also have the imminent prospect of new graphics card families from both AMD and Nvidia, new CPUs from Intel in response to AMD Ryzen assault, an intriguing new APU, again from AMD, that could just make for some nice cheapo laptops with genuine gaming chops and, well, plenty more. And the annual Computex tech shindig hasn’t even kicked off yet… AMD’s saucy new 16-core Threadripper (yes, really) processor, then. What’s it all about? Socking it to Intel, quite simply. I can’t imagine that AMD is going to sell very many of these new 16-core beasts to desktop PC enthusiasts. But beating Intel on core count and (possibly but not quite certainly) for outright performance in certain metrics has significant PR value. For the record, this 16-core / 32-thread chip will apparently be branded Ryzen 9 and the full range will also include 14-core, 12-core and 10-core models. It’s also mated to its own new socket, much like Intel’s high-end desktop CPUs, so it’s not cross compatible with existing Ryzen CPUs and their AM4 socket. Clockspeeds are expected to be surprisingly high, with a baseclock of 3.5GHz and 3.9GHz Turbo for the top 16-core Ryzen 9 Threadripper. Thus, you can have your single-threaded performance cake and eat the multi-core goodness at the same time. In other words, if you can afford what will undoubtedly be a very expensive chip, it’ll likely be decent for gaming and killer for almost everything else. One chip to rule them all, perhaps. Threadripper will likely be a pair of AMD’s eight-core Ryzen CPU dies crammed into a single package… For real-world gamers, the existing Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7 models still make much more sense. But Ryzen 9’s impact will be felt in terms of how it pushes the market on in general, regards both performance and pricing. Even if you never buy a Ryzen 9, it’ll probably make whatever you do buy a bit faster or a bit cheaper. Indeed, it’s no surprise to learn that Intel is planning a riposte. The web has been alive with reports of a new high-end 12-core Intel CPU for the desktop, branded predictably enough Core i9, plus a pair of slightly odd-ball quad-core CPUs that eschew integrated graphics and slot into Intel’s high-end LGA2011 socket. But for me, it’s what Intel does with its mainstream LGA1151 socket, the one that accepts chips like the £200/$200-odd Core i5-7600K, that’s of more interest. The expectation here is for the debut of a six-core processor as part of the upcoming Coffee Lake family later this year. That’s a big deal given that mainstream Intel desktop CPUs have topped out at four cores ever since they were split off into a separate socket eight long years ago. Even if you’re not convinced that six cores will have much impact on game performance, inserting a new six-core model as the de facto top rung of the mainstream Intel CPU line should push the four-core models down the stack a little and make them more affordable. AMD’s mainstream AM4 socket that appeared with the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 CPUs isn’t compatible with the new Threadripper megachips Another fun-sounding new CPU, or rather APU, due soon is Raven Ridge. It’s basically an AMD Ryzen CPU in dual up to quad-core trim with a slice of AMD’s next-generation Vega graphics all squeezed into a single chip. Nothing is certain, but leaked AMD docs indicate it will have 11 so-called Vega graphics cores, which should work out at about 700 pixel-prettifying shaders or roughly the same as the original Xbox One console. Imagine all of that in a genuinely cheap, thin and light laptop PC and I suggest you are now quite interested. At the very least, Raven Ridge should massively lift the bar for entry-level integrated graphics performance. It might just be the first APU that’s genuinely gaming capable. Dare we hope for, say, a $400 / £400 laptop with decent gaming chops? Fingers crossed. On the graphics side of the equation AMD still has an awful lot of catching up to do. At the high end, it’s a full generation behind AMD’s Pascal graphics cards, such as the GeForce GTX 1080. AMD has had no response to Nvidia’s high-end Pascal cards, like the GTX 1080 Ti In fact, Nvidia even beat AMD to the punch with its recent announcement of the first GPU from its next generation Volta family of graphics tech. It’s a chip aimed at high-end compute and machine learning rather than gaming. But as a member of the new Volta family, it’s fully two generations advantage over AMD’s last high-end GPU, the Radeon Fury. In fairness, it was only a week later that AMD rolled out its own new high-end GPU for compute and in turn the first member of its long-awaited Vega series of graphics cards. The Radeon Vega Froniter Edition, as its known, gives a sneak peak of what to expect from AMD’s next high-end gaming cards. And what we can apparently expect is a GPU that depends on high clocks to achieve its performance edge. If that’s accurate, then it may explain why Vega is so late to launch (yes, late you naughty people in the comments below). Perhaps AMD is struggling to get the clocks up to sufficiently competitive speeds. We’ll find out the truth soon enough as I expect a fairly substantial Vega reveal from AMD in the coming weeks. Anyway, the sum total of all this is that by year end the PC landscape will likely look very different. At any given price point, both CPU and GPU performance will have stepped up fairly dramatically on the desktop and there’s also a half decent chance that new generation of cheap gameable laptops may have arrived. With all that in mind, my broad advice re upgrading your PC or buying a new rig is a very firm hold, currently. Recent years have seen fairly long periods of stagnation in terms of key PC hardware, which meant you may as well buy sooner rather than later. But right now looks very much like a moment where holding off for three to six months could pay significant long-term dividends. Watch this space.

While it likely won’t beat Intel at gaming purposes, for tasks that benefit from multithreading this thing is a beast. Even the biggest Xeon has “just” 12 cores and 24 threads, and its price is/was ridiculous. And the its equivalent on Ryzen has a maximum of 32 cores and 64 threads, a chip named “Epyc” (yes really) the size of a fist.

The Phi booting Windows could take a while. In fact, you should definitely consider taking a nap while it happens. Or even work a couple of days; I’m unsure what order of magnitude this thing is on. The Xeon Phi is supposed to compete with GPUs, not CPUs.

Now I’ve got an i5 3550 that a family member gave me, which is stubbornly holding on at the very bottom of the highest tier in Tom’s Hardware’s hierarchy, so I think Threa will have to drip somewhere else. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:42 Lukasz says: I’m building new system.

And I wanna play now Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 20:54 ephesus64 says: Always waiting for the newest stuff does seem self-defeating, unless the only fun thing about PC gaming for you IS making it faster. A really fast customized car or motorcycle isn’t that useful either, but that’s hardly the point, I think. Shiny new stuff is fun. Where I have been glad I waited is when I had a vague idea of what I wanted and what I could afford pay for it, and just watched for deals. That’s how I ended up with a GTX 1060 3gb for just over 160 USD, and I’m happy as a clam with that card. The hierarchy on Tom’s Hardware for GPUs which I linked to is also helpful, because (even if it’s oversimplified) it shows how silly it would be to drop two or three hundred bucks just to go up one tier for almost no noticeable gains. link to tomshardware.com Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:12 snv says: Well, link to xkcd.com but it is my guess that we can thank VR for the restart of the hardware spiral. Also, since games are still mostly limited by single thread performance (if the CPU is the bottleneck), i find the news about intel’s 4.5 GHz CPU more interesting.

Not because I have any particular love for them or dislike of Intel, but just because it’d be better for the market if they did. In my heart of hearts, I hope that they do something as game changing as when they invented x64 and somehow their new advantage is parlayed into an avalanche-like shift to Linux in PC gaming. Not because I’m a Linux evangelist, mind you, but just because Windows 10 is an abomination we only put up with for compatibility reasons.

Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 16:21 milonz says: Ryzen line of products could be a good deal for the professionnal market, in virtualization (ESXi, Xen, KVM) or rendering farms (3dsmax, Maya, etc). Not as a pure performance product (the Xeons rule) but as the best performance / value / power efficiency match. With virtualization or 3D, you really don’t care about a single box performance, but about how many boxes you can cram in a datacenter, for a defined budget. AMD has yet to resolve the compatibility problems the Ryzen have on ESXi, but it already seems that Ryzen CPUs are already a good performance / value investment in the rendering farms field. For the enthusiast gamer market, things are a little bit tricky … 10 years ago, 2 cores were enough, because multi-threading a game is a complex job. Now, every single game which comes out is 4-way optimized, it took the gaming industry nearly 10 years ! Multi-threading means separating the game logic between multiple threads, which are run in parallel. You can for exemple separate the main thread, the sound thread, the ai thread, the physics thread. But there’s no point in separating the main thread, because it is a sequential process, not parallel by nature. It cannot be separated, it is considered as “atomic”. The Ryzen many-cores line of products future could be determined by how many threads the gaming industry will adapt to in the not so distant future, and what usages they’ll find to them. More threads would maybe mean more AI or more physics, which are for now quite rudimentary. Or a completely new usage for the threads, like machine learning, which could enhance the player’s experience greatly. In any case, AMD Ryzen could drive Intel’s CPUs prices down, which is a great thing, for the professionnal and the gaming market. The worst case in any market is when a single company has a monopoly, and for many years, Intel had a real monopoly on CPUs =/ Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Digital Trends Samsung Galaxy Book 12 review Samsung's Galaxy Book aims for the stars, but barely breaks orbit Share The Galaxy Book’s display is out of this world, but its battery life and keyboard keep it grounded. The Galaxy Book’s display is out of this world, but its battery life and keyboard keep it grounded. The Galaxy Book’s display is out of this world, but its battery life and keyboard keep it grounded. Highs Thin and light OLED display looks beautiful Clear, loud speakers Solid processor performance Lows Awkward keyboard cover Lacks built-in stand Poor battery life DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Samsung Galaxy Book 12 review By Brad Bourque Posted on 05.26.17 Research Center: Samsung Galaxy Book Over the last few years, 2-in-1 and hybrid systems have gone a from clumsy pipe-dream to something of a creative outlet for normally stodgy computer makers. It’s also given traditionally smartphone-centric brands like Samsung and LG an entry point into the computing market, by leveraging existing skills building tablets. Samsung’s previous attempt, the TabPro S, was alright. Its awkward design didn’t sit right with laptop users, but the Super AMOLED screen looked great. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and Plus improved on the formula, but without Windows 10, they focused on budget buyers instead of competing with the Surface Pro 4. The Galaxy Book hits the reset button on Samsung’s 2-in-1 line, with Windows 10, two size options, Intel Core i5 processors, and an improved Super AMOLED screens that promise deep black levels and unmatched contrast. Pricing starts at $1,130 for the 12-inch version, which has 4GB of RAM and a 128GB solid state drive. Our review unit, upgraded to 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, retails for $1,330. Is the Galaxy Book a new beginning for Samsung’s PC ambitions? Let’s find out. Unbearably light There are two distinct pieces to Samsung’s Galaxy Book — the tablet, and the detachable keyboard. The tablet itself shows off Samsung’s strong points, with a design language lifted directly off its Galaxy smartphone line. It has sleek, rounded edges, and a medium-dark silver color that users may recognize from the Chromebook Plus. It’s light enough to work well as a tablet, with a texture that doesn’t slip, although the buttons on the upper left aren’t exactly convenient. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The trade-off is that the Galaxy Book is so very, very light, it doesn’t feel like a sturdy system. There’s no panel flex, and there are no major gaps to speak of, but the Competiting Surface Pro keeps its weight below two pounds as well, and feels a lot more premium than the Galaxy Book. The shape is also very nondescript – which will work for some people. Both systems suffer the same issues when used as a laptop. The Galaxy Book has a folio keyboard, so it wraps around the system like a hot dog bun, with magnetic points on the cover to stick to magnetic points on the tablet. Propping up the screen means scooting the back cover down to one of several points, as opposed to the kickstand on the Surface Pro, which adjustable to any position along its range of motion. While neither system sits well on your lap, the Galaxy Book takes up gobs of space, which makes it particularly hard to use in tight quarters. A few good ports The Galaxy Book has a pair of USB Type-C ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. That’s a common set of configurations for the category, and even beats out the new Surface Pro, which only boats a Type-A USB Port. The Galaxy Book charges over either of its Type-C ports, where the Surface’s magnetic power connection pops right out if someone trips on the cable. There are advantages on both sides, but the Galaxy Book certainly has the better set of wired plugs. For wireless connections, the Galaxy Book packs in 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and optional LTE. Feeling awkward As we mentioned above, the Galaxy Book’s detachable keyboard and touchpad don’t set the bar high for sturdiness and space. Despite a physical connection to the system, we often saw lag in keyboard and trackpad response after the system was sitting idle for a short time. It didn’t take long, and even during our screen testing, we had issues when we didn’t touch either input for less than 30 seconds. It’s a minor inconvenience, but also one that shouldn’t exist. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The keys themselves have solid travel, with a soft, linear action that will appeal to laptop users looking for something light for occasional typing. It’s backlit, as well, with three different color settings that illuminate the characters, and the keycaps around them, in a bluish off-white. Active stylus support is the saving grace for the so-far-troubled Galaxy Book. The pen provides a sharp, responsive writing experience, although its’ drawings capabilities don’t quite match the sensitivity levels provided by the Surface Pen and PixelSense display. The pen writes a familiar story. On its own, it feels comfortable and light, if not on the small side. It writes well, and Samsung’s handwriting wizardry is sharp and reliable. Sitting next to the Surface Pen, the difference is evident immediately. The Surface Pen’s sturdy, barrel-shaped design feels excellent in hand, writes and draws beautifully, and has a real button and eraser, where the Galaxy Pen only has a side button. Movie and music machine Finally, the Galaxy Book has its moment in the sun. Samsung’s displays have always been a strong point for the brand, and it was one of the first manufacturers to put OLED displays into laptops. Organic LEDs create their own light when powered, so there’s no glow in the dark areas of the screen, resulting in perfectly flat black levels. No, the number isn’t a mistake — the Samsung really did hit a contrast ratio above 300,000:1, thanks to the perfect black levels provided by its Super AMOLED panel. It dunked on the Surface Pro 4, which boasted one of the best contrast ratios we’ve seen from a non-OLED screen at just over 1,000:1. The Surface Pro 4 must backlight the whole screen all the time, so even a completely black screen still has some brightness to it, where the Samsung has none. Color accuracy was nothing to write home about, but that’s typically only important to those designing design or production work. The Samsung makes up for it by covering a whopping 99 percent of the AdobeRGB spectrum, a quality we’re only used to seeing in high-end desktop monitors, and the very best laptop screens. The screen is a joy in everyday use. Not only does the screen score exceptionally well in almost all our tests, it’s a joy in everyday use. Deep black levels are incredibly important when it comes to image quality and immersion, because they allow greater sense of depth, and greater detail in shadows. A simple, black jacket is the perfect example. Most laptops and 2-in-1s will display the jacket as dark grey, with little detail in the fabric. On the Samsung Galaxy Book 12, however, the jacket looked dark as night, and showed fine detail in the fabric’s texture. That makes Samsung’s device a superb choice for movies. The Galaxy Book also manages to pack in some serious speakers for its size. Even at full volume, they produce loud, clear sound, with just a hint of distortion, something we’re not used to hearing from laptops in general, let alone a 12-inch 2-in-1. Bass is lacking, but we don’t expect great subwoofers in any laptop, even massive gaming machines. Ready to sprint Our review unit packed in the Core i5-7200U with 8GB of RAM, a step up from the 4GB of RAM found in the base 12-inch model. It’s bound to perform much better than the Core M chips that are becoming more common, but is far from a powerhouse. Compared to similar systems, the Galaxy Book holds its own performance-wise. Granted, these are all a far cry from the sort of performance we see from higher-end laptops, but power tends to take a backseat to versatility and portability with 2-in-1s — a solid trade, if it’s fair on both sides. None of them are built for encoding video, so the slow times on the 4K conversion test shouldn’t be a major concern. In everyday use, the Galaxy Book didn’t feel sluggish or unresponsive, which becomes the more pertinent question at this end of the performance spectrum. Snappy performance and fast boot times are critical, and the Galaxy Book 12 did not disappoint. Just an SSD The SSD in our review unit had 256GB of capacity, which is the other half of the upgrade from the base 12-inch model. The drive connects over the usual SATA standard. Some systems are moving towards the PCIe connection, which has performance benefits. While Samsung’s read and write speeds were competitive, both the HP EliteBook and Surface Pro 4 beat them handily, thanks to their use of the faster PCIe connection. The Surface Pro 4 is a middle ground, with faster read speeds, but write speeds that fall in line with the Galaxy Book. Given the price, we feel giving the Galaxy Book 12 a PCIe drive would’ve been the right call. It’s ironic, actually – Samsung itself produces some of the best solid state drives, but its 2-in-1 falls behind competitors in this area. Game off We have yet to see a 2-in-1 with any sort of graphical power, and the Galaxy Book is no different. Its Intel HD 620 integrated GPU is fine for 2D games and HD movies, but lacks the sort of power, and driver support, needed for modern 3D titles. The 3DMark scores of the competitors fell close to each other, but were all well short of even the most basic dedicated GPU options found in larger systems. Not that we expect anywhere near that sort of performance, particularly in smaller, portable machines like the Surface Pro and Galaxy Book. Its benchmark performance didn’t give us confidence in the Galaxy Book’s gaming prowess, and a quick test run in Sid Meier’s Civilization VI only confirmed that. The game ran at just over 10 frames per second on average at 1080p, with 2X MSAA on, and both sliders set to medium. At Ultra, it went from moderately unplayable to a complete slideshow, at five frames per second. It might be able to play the odd round of Hearthstone, but if your first question is “can it game?” it’s unlikely you’ll be satisfied with the answer. Compact size, compact battery Coming in under two pounds, the Galaxy Book is exceptionally compact. It folds up neatly, and its small footprint means it shouldn’t have any issue fitting into a small back or laptop backpack. That’s only half the story. The other half is battery life, an area where 2-in-1s don’t just need to be average, they need to be excellent. It’s one of the main draws in a lightweight laptop, and the Galaxy Book does fine, but that’s about the nicest we can say. It falls behind the Elitebook G2 in longevity in all but the video playback loop, where both systems lasted just over 12 hours. Both Peacekeeper and a web browsing loop drained the Galaxy Book’s battery in less than five hours, well short of the Elitebook. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 lasted six hours, 26 minutes in the Peacekeeper test – and its hardware is several generations older. We’ve not yet tested the battery life of the new Surface Pro. We previously hoped that OLED screens would improve battery life, but in practice, that’s only been the case in certain situations. That said, the Galaxy Book packs plenty of battery life for a mixed workload, although you may still want to bring a charger to the office. Ditch the screensaver Samsung has kept its Windows 10 installation clean for the most part, although there were certainly some oddities right out of the box. For one, Samsung still insists on using a screensaver, which is just the default cheesy spinning text. As Microsoft has moved almost every system setting into the new Settings pane, screensaver options were left in the old dialogue menu, so turning it off requires a few steps. Samsung Galaxy Book Compared To Samsung Chromebook Pro Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Acer Spin 7 Lenovo Yoga Book Samsung Notebook 7 spin Dell Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Acer Switch Alpha 12 Huawei Matebook Lenovo Yoga 3 Pro Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro Dell XPS 12 (2013) Lenovo ThinkPad Helix Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 Apart from that, there’s no extra bloatware to speak of. Samsung includes a settings panel, but it rolls everything esoteric about the machine into one simple application, including screen options, keyboard and stylus options, and even customer support and warranty links. If manufacturers must include such a menu, that’s the way we prefer they do it. Warranty Samsung’s one year limited warranty on the Galaxy Book is typical of the category. Our Take Samsung’s Galaxy Book 12 aims squarely at Microsoft’s Surface Pro and similar 2-in-1s, and it lands at least one hit – display quality. For some users, the OLED screen will be the killer feature, and admittedly, there’s a lot of appeal to a system that makes watching movies and music videos an absolute pleasure. Yet you might not watch for long, because the tablet’s battery life is a sore spot. Is there a better alternative? Yes. In fact, that’s the Samsung’s biggest issue. It seems appealing at a glance, but loses when set next to the cheaper, more refined Surface Pro. HP’s EliteBook x360 G2 is more expensive, but has one of our favorite laptop keyboards and killer performance. There’s no shortage of competitive 2-in-1s, which means Samsung must really kill it to make a name for itself. The Galaxy Book doesn’t go far enough. How long will it last? Samsung’s adoption of cutting edge tech is limited to the Super AMOLED screen and active stylus support. It’s unlikely any major new features will come to the category in the next few years, and a full-power SSD also helps this system go the distance. Whether it will physically hold up is a question only time can answer, but that keyboard may need a replacement after a couple years. Should you buy it? No, unless the Galaxy Book will spend most its life playing movies. It’s not that the Galaxy Book is a bad option – but there are better options for a lower price.

Two weeks ago we posted a report titled "AI Wars are almost reaching Fever Pitch with new Home Devices and Apple Fans look to WWDC 2017 for Apple's Response." One of Reuters latest reports makes the same point about the activity surrounding AI in the tech sector.   A new Reuters report quotes a statement by research firm CB Insights about the AI frenzy: "A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc's Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel respectively."   The companies noted in the report declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company's recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data.   Apple is focused mainly on the retail/consumer sector while AI is ripping through all sectors of technology. Nvidia's Tesla P100 AI GPU was just adopted by IBM who see's this GPU as a game changer for the AI revolution.   Intel is going full tilt into into AI and made one of their largest acquisitions ever to gain Israel's Mobileye for autonomous vehicles. And the Reuters report today points to Ford Motor spending a billion dollars on Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams ag Google and Uber Technologies.   Large acquisitions aside, Apple never talks about their plans or projects. We know for a fact that they have a Project Titan team resides in Ottawa Canada in an industrial park that houses a research team from BlackBerry developing an autonomous vehicle OS and Apple is hiring as many of BlackBerry engineers that they can for their carOS efforts. You can't be developing an carOS for autonomous vehicles without a connection to AI. So while we don't know at what stage Apple is at, it's assured that one of their AI projects is related to Project Titan. One of their major AI acquisitions was Vocal IQ, a company that had a major focus on a digital assistant designed for the autonomous car.   I remember the unveiling of Apple's iPhone in 2007 which set off the mobile revolution which was an amazing time to see unfold. The AI revolution is not yet here. All we see is the preparation for the AI revolution, but for now it's just tiny baby steps coming to market in the form of Home devices and elementary digital assistants.   So many industries are banking on the coming 5G networks to help ignite the revolution and that's only three years away. So time will tell if that's when the starting gun for the AI Revolution truly fires.Yet whenever it does, we'll get to behold one of the most interesting times in history unfold. The AI revolution will of course dwarf the mobile revolution in shear scope covering every major market sector from the consumer, to the enterprise, to vehicles, to home automation, robotics and far beyond. It's a wonderful time to be alive.  For more on this, read the new Reuters report titled "Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The VR Ready flavor of the XPS 27 has the same 4K display and the same 10-speaker audio sub-system as the latest iteration of the large XPS AIO, but is powered by a more powerful CPU from Intel along with AMD’s discrete Radeon RX 570 graphics board. AIO PCs have existed for decades, with their continued popularity fueled by their compact, desk-sized footprint. In the recent years demand for higher performance and even gaming-grade all-in-ones increased noticeably, and manufacturers started to offer AIOs with rather powerful hardware. In fact, in early 2016 several PC makers even introduced Mini-ITX-based AIOs with top-of-the-range discrete graphics cards aiming at customers seeking for maximum performance. Dell’s new XPS 27 with the VR Ready badge are designed for gamers with average requirements for performance. The systems are still considerably more powerful than their predecessors launched earlier this year are because they do not use integrated or mobile graphics, but rely on AMD’s Radeon RX 570 (2048 stream processors, 128 texture units, 32 ROPs, 256-bit memory bus, etc.) graphics adapter with 8 GB of memory. Meanwhile, the key feature of the latest XPS 27 remained intact: the audio sub-system with 10 speakers (six on the front, two down firing and two radiating) designed to enable surround sound without using bulky external audio equipment. The VR Ready versions of the Dell XPS 27 are based on Intel’s Core i7-7700 CPU as well as the H170 PCH. By default, the systems are equipped with 16 GB of DDR4-2133 memory, but that is upgradeable to 64 GB. As for storage, the PCs have one M.2 slot (PCIe 3.0 x4) as well as two 2.5” bays for HDDs or SSDs, all accessible to the end user. When it comes to connectivity, the Dell XPS 27 feature 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.x, a GbE port, five USB 3.0 Type-A headers, one HDMI output, one DisplayPort 1.2, two Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB Type-C), an SD/MMC card reader, a 720p webcam with an IR sensor for facial recognition, a microphone and so on. Overall, there are plenty of ports to plug-in additional peripherals, including various VR gear.

The stand comes at an extra cost, so some gamers may prefer to install a larger SSD and/or more memory and skip the touch option. At present Dell offers two versions of the VR Ready XPS 27 featuring Intel’s Core i7-7700 CPU and AMD’s Radeon RX 570 GPU, but different storage configurations and touch support. The model with a 2 TB HDD and 32 GB caching SSD costs $1999.99, whereas the model with a 512 GB PCIe SSD, a touchscreen display with articulating stand and optional Windows 10 Pro comes at $2,649.99.

POST A COMMENT 29 Comments View All Comments tipoo - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Doesn't look too bad! What I would change is the sparse 32GB SSD cache in the 2000 dollar model, had it been a 128GB cache (like the Surface Studio or 2TB Fusion Drive) it would be ok to have a rust drive in there. Reply frostyfiredude - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link At that size, maybe its Optane? One can hope anyway. Reply tipoo - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link For the vast majority of uses, 5x the NAND for the same cost as optane would be better though. Reply ddriver - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link Hypetane is so good that intel has to spam people with it, by bundling it with other products. Populating a slot with it would be a waste of the slot and PCIE lanes. It wouldn't really do much good to a gamer, unless he plays a single tame, and it is small enough to fit. Also, it would have been nice if the touch version had some stylus support. For that kind of money it would have added value for particular markets. As it is the value is kinda low for what you get for the money. Reply milkywayer - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link Any idea if I can get that keyboard separately? Reply twtech - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link If I'm not mistaken, that looks like the standard Dell $5 keyboard. I'd sell you the one they sent me with my workstation, but if you do much typing at all, I doubt you really want it. It's not even good by rubber dome standards - mushy keys. Reply DanNeely - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Are those speaker ports on the front bezel or just go faster holes? Reply WinterCharm - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link speakers. Reply tipoo - Sunday, May 28, 2017 - link Those are 6 of the 10 speakers Reply geekman1024 - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link I'm not an audiophile, so I have to ask, Is there a point of have 6/10 of the speakers place so closed together? From what I experienced, as an ordinary speaker user, It's not even be able to offer good stereo positioning if speakers are put so closed together.

Xeon X5670 @ 4.4ghz DDR3 @ 1600 7-8-7 GTX 970 I am wanting to go Ryzen, but I am undecided on whether to buy a 1600x or a 1700/x. I have a new 4k monitor, and use the pc for: Netflix/Hulu/Youtubes Browsing Gaming (Diablo3, Forza Horizon 3, and some others,) FH3 is the most demanding game i play currently I multitask a bit, always have a browser open with couple of tabs on 2nd monitor while gaming. The 6 core xeon was usually enough for this, except for FH3, and honestly the 970 doesnt cut it for that game @4k either. But gfx upgrade will wait until Pascal2 So....Which Ryzen do I buy, I will likely hold onto the system 4+ years. I WILL be ocing the cpu, I have an open loop with a tripple 120 rad and a MCP655 pump.

According to Bloomberg, Apple's dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) chip could be called the Apple Neural Engine, and it would be used to offload AI tasks that require complex algorithms, such as facial and speech recognition and augmented reality (AR) and other intensive features that rely on computer vision. The chip would improve battery live and overall performance of Apple's devices. Keep in mind Bloomberg also reported earlier this year that Apple seems to be actively lessening its reliance on Intel chips by designing its own A-series ARM-based chips for Macs, even though Intel processors have powered Apple's Mac lineup for more than a decade. Apple reportedly wants to offload the Mac's "Power Nap" feature from the main processor, though it has no plans to dump Intel right away. Apple has been investing a lot into its own series of chips for the last seven years. For instance, it even designed an ARM-based chip - the T1 - for the MacBook Pro last autumn. Also, in April, British-based technology Imagination Technologies claimed Apple had ended its long-running partnership because it wanted to instead design and produce its own graphics chip for use in the iPhone and iPad. Which MacBook is best for you? MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro? Is Apple making its own chips for Macs so it can eventually ditch Intel? Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? As for the dedicated AI chip, Apple primarily wants to separate the most heavy tasks from the iPhone’s processor and graphics chip, but it unclear if the chip will be available in devices this year. Bloomberg said Apple is now testing iPhone prototypes with the chip. CEO Tim Cook has also teased several times over the past couple years that Apple sees AI and AR as the future, so it's perfectly believable that the company may be building such technologies into its devices as well as developing a dedicated chip for them. We may learn more at Apple's developers conference in a couple weeks.  Sections Apple Phones Source: Bloomberg Apple WWDC 2017: When is it, where to watch, and what to expect?

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it SkyRoll founder Don Chernoff sits at a baggage claim at Dulles International Airport with one of his creations. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post) By Thomas Heath By Thomas Heath Reporter May 26 Follow @addedvalueth From the outside, Don Chernoff looks like he has the life. The 57-year-old former Intel engineer lives comfortably in Reston, Va., where he runs his one-man luggage company, answers only to himself and pockets a low six-figure income. It doesn’t look so glamorous from where he sits. Chernoff and his 16-year-old luggage firm, called SkyRoll, have weathered two recessions, a retail downturn, occasional problems in his supply chain and an 18 percent import-duty tax (it came to $100,000 last year) that the curmudgeonly businessman really, really dislikes. “It is analogous to having a bloodsucking parasite attached to your body, except it’s the federal government and they attach themselves to my wallet,” he said. The story of how a materials engineer and inventor ended up selling luggage comes down to a simple motivation: “I wanted to work for myself.” His road to self-sufficiency includes educating himself on patent law, joining an inventor group, endless cold-calling of retailers and — the fun part — creating new products. [Can this contraption really help you sleep on a plane?] Chernoff asked me to write about the unglamorous side of business ownership after reading my recent column about another entrepreneur who had to unload a big chunk of his stock portfolio at a big loss to keep his family fed during the lean start-up years. “I really hope you can write in more detail about the other issues that make it hard to survive as an entrepreneur,” he said. Between recessions and taxes, “sometimes I feel like, no matter what I do, I’m at the mercy of forces beyond my control. No one writes about the unglamorous side.” This lone-eagle entrepreneur spends his day at home trying to get the word out about SkyRoll by working social media and talking to journalists like me. He also checks in with his manufacturers and his shipping company to keep tabs on the supply chain. So what is the hard part? “All of it,” he said. “But for me personally, it’s sales and marketing. I am not [emphasis his] a sales and marketing type person. [No kidding, I thought.] Then accounting, which I hate.” SkyRoll’s product line is made up of three polyester-and-nylon luggage pieces, including — in order of sales volume — a cylindrical garment bag that slings over your shoulder ($149), a SkyRoll on two wheels ($249) and something called the Spinner ($299). SkyRoll’s “differentiator” is that they are “roll up” bags that allow you to carry suits and dresses without folding them and risking creases. The military tends to be good customers because they need to keep their uniforms sharp. The products are made in Thailand and China and sold through SkyRoll’s website, as well as at Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank bricks-and-mortar retail stores. They are also in a Canadian men’s store called Moores and some independent Washington-area luggage shops. The retailers account for 75 percent of total sales; the rest is direct to customers through SkyRoll’s online site. The luggage is shipped in containers to the Port of Los Angeles, where they are then moved by truck and train to distribution centers or, sometimes, directly to the stores. The cost to ship a 40-foot container from Asia to the United States is around $5,000, not including import duty. [More than a million patients flock to this website. Drug companies are in hot pursuit.] SkyRoll’s annual revenue drifts between $1 million and $2 million, depending on how many units are sold. A good year will bring 25,000 in sales. A poor year will see that number drop to 10,000. Chernoff prefers online sales because he gets to keep more of the sale price. So Chernoff’s bottom-line profit, which he lives on, can run from more than $100,000 to well over $200,000 after subtracting costs for manufacturing, shipping, Web design, accounting and that dreaded import duty. The company has zero debt. Chernoff began his business career at Intel, where he helped make computer chips for $25,000 a year in California. He had just graduated from the University of Florida in 1982 with a materials engineering degree. He developed a specialty in something called electron microscopes — expensive technology used in industry. Around the mid-1990s, when he was a 30-something, he was on a flight when he saw a fellow passenger trying to jam his garment bag into the overhead compartment by folding it in half. “That just gave me the idea that the shape is wrong,” he said. “The solution may be to make something that rolls up.” He experimented in his spare time, building prototypes, buying fabric and messing around with different shapes at his Silicon Valley apartment. He took a night class on intellectual property at the University of California at Berkeley, learning enough to file a patent for the SkyRoll. “It was a great introduction to the nuts and bolts about patents, trademarks and copyrights,” he said. “It should be a required class for any inventor.” He had no idea he wanted to start a luggage company. But he did know he wanted to invent something to turn into a business. Patent in hand, he moved to the Washington area to be near his brother. He also wanted to buy a home, which he could not afford in California. He asked a journalist (not this one) for advice on how to meet inventors who have bridged the gap between making a product and selling it. That led to finding a manufacturer who built some SkyRoll prototypes. Ever resourceful, he funded the luggage project with the $100,000 or so he made from a sideline selling products for people who work with electron microscopes. “It was basically a salary that let me go and play with ideas,” he said. His hope was to license the product with a big luggage company or sell the business altogether and become an full-time inventor. “The world doesn’t operate like that,” he said. He had to prove that his luggage would actually sell. So he began to hunt for a big retail clothing chain that could sell his products alongside the suits it was meant to carry. He made a list of candidates, and Men’s Wearhouse was No. 1. He called them. He emailed them. He talked to vice presidents. The courtship lasted a year. Finally, the company asked him to send a few dozen. “A few weeks later, they said, ‘How soon can you send us a few thousand?’ ” [The terrifying downside to a start-up: Being too broke to feed your family] He knew he had a business in 2004, when he sold 8,000 SkyRolls in stores and on the Web. Sales of SkyRolls mounted, and he was eventually selling more than 20,000 a year. SkyRoll’s sales dropped by half last year after bricks-and-mortar retailers had their own mini-recession. Stores closed. One big SkyRoll retail order from Jos. A. Bank was pushed into 2017, also crimping revenue for 2016. Now with the Trump administration’s proposal for a border-adjustment tax, Chernoff worries about a new bloodsucker feeding off his business. “Although he will pay more in tax due to the border adjustment, his total import costs will not go up,” according to Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation, a non-partisan think tank headquartered in Washington. “ The value of the U.S. dollar would increase to offset the additional taxes he would have to pay.” Chernoff doesn’t believe it. “If the BAT is on top of this import duty, as you say, then I might as well just file bankruptcy now and get it over with,” Chernoff said. Chernoff said that he has had a few nibbles from would-be acquirers. The key, he said, is to find a partner that can scale his luggage to global distribution, which would shave costs and boost profits. That would make SkyRoll more valuable. “This takes a bit of vision from a CEO at a bigger luggage or consumer products company, something I think is in short supply,” he said. “When I find them, the first thing I’ll tell them to do is fire me. I shouldn’t be running this business.” He already has his next project: artificial ivory. That will allow him to do his part to save elephants and get back to his engineering background. That’s sure to put a smile on the curmudgeon’s face.

Sollenberger and Mark J. Rozell, opinion contributors - 05/26/17 03:21 PM EDT 1,109   © Greg Nash The ongoing investigation into Russia’s possible interference with the presidential election has all the markings of turning into a full-blown scandal. The investigation is already filled with political intrigue but now former advisers of President Trump are not cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee’s requests for information. This stonewalling not only escalates interbranch conflict, but it affirms for many the impression that the president has something to hide.  Certainly, withholding documents and testimony from Congress is nothing new. In recent years, Presidents George W. Bush and Obama had their own run-ins with Congress, which resulted in executive privilege claims and even contempt resolutions by Congress. ADVERTISEMENT More recently former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Obama administration, not him, likely has the most relevant documents related to the investigation. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerDem senator warns against Trump rhetoric in wake of London attacks Warner on Russia probe: 'We have no smoking gun at this point' Sunday shows preview: Pruitt, Gore face off over Paris deal MORE (Va.), said that it appears that only one person has so far complied with the committee’s request for information.   Republican Chairman Richard BurrRichard BurrPence presses Congress to pass healthcare by end of summer Pence 'cautiously optimistic' about ObamaCare repeal Trump administration sends CIA torture report copies back to Congress MORE (N.C.) noted that “all options are on the table” if individuals do not comply with requests for information, including using the subpoena power. That is exactly what the committee did in issuing a subpoena for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to provide documents relevant to its investigation. However, Flynn has told the committee he will not comply, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  Although the investigation is in its early stages, the reluctance and even initial refusals to cooperate do not point to a positive path forward. Clearly, the committee is in a strong position as the investigation is germane to its oversight responsibilities over federal elections. However, as has been the case in past interbranch disputes, just because Congress is in a strong position doesn’t mean the executive branch will cooperate. For example, a resolution in the case of the U.S. attorneys’ firings scandal under President George W. Bush did not occur until Obama’s first year as president. And it was over five years before the so-called Fast and Furious controversy during Obama’s administration was resolved. A better course of action would be for Trump to speak publicly in support of the investigation and ask that his former advisers cooperate with the committee. We realize that Trump came into the presidency with an awful relationship with the media and a reputation for attacking all parts of the Washington, D.C., establishment, regardless of political party affiliation. His challenges working with the media and Washington "insiders" have not gone away and, in fact, have only gotten worse as his presidency has progressed, especially since he removed FBI Director James Comey from office.  But, despite those issues, Trump’s positioning on this matter will do much to signal to Congress and the public his developing views on executive power and the manner in which he intends to work with lawmakers. More importantly, Trump would likely be in a stronger position with Congress and the public if he followed a more collaborative path that placed the national interest ahead of his short-term personal and political ambitions. As Chairman Burr has explained, “What we’re attempting to do in the Senate Intelligence Committee is not a charade. It’s a very serious investigation to look at Russian active measures that tried to shape in some way, shape or form in our elections.” The president’s best play at this point is to encourage transparency and cooperation with investigations. It is the only way for him to begin to restore confidence in the electoral system and to ensure that the rule of law and constitutional government prevail. If, as he claims, he has done nothing wrong, such transparency and cooperation risk nothing.

Storage expansion and remote management features are limited, but if you want a quiet and environmentally friendly server, the TS100 warrants closer inspection. Broadberry's CyberServe TS100 is the most energy-efficient small-business server we've ever seen. With the operating system idling, we measured this little tower drawing a mere 25W. Even with its 3GHz Intel Xeon E5-1220 v5 CPU being pummelled by SiSoftware Sandra, it still spiked at only 65W. This means there's no need for noisy cooling: the SPLnFFT iOS app on our iPad recorded a noise level of only 36.5dB - that's whisper-quiet. The CyberServe TS100 is the perfect choice for small offices, or even libraries. It's built on Asus' TS100-E9-PI4 server platform, which couples a compact and sturdy chassis with Asus' P10S-X motherboard. The chassis offers three internal cold-swap drive bays at the front, with additional mount points at the base of the cage for an extra SFF drive. There's no hot-swap capability, but Broadberry mitigates this by including dual mirrored 240GB Samsung SSDs in the price: these come fitted in the main cage, providing a speedy system drive for your OS. For general data storage, a 2TB Toshiba Enterprise SATA hard disk occupies the third drive bay. The mirrored SSDs certainly are speedy: we saw Iometer report raw sequential read and write rates of 475MB/sec and 262MB/sec respectively. When it comes to adding data storage, RAID options are decent, thanks to the partnership of Intel's C232 chipset and its integrated RSTe (Rapid Storage Technology enterprise). You can set up stripes, mirrors and RAID5 arrays - it's just a shame that the chassis doesn't have room for more drives, as we really would have liked to protect the data storage drive with a mirror at the very least. The internals are super-tidy, making it easy to access the important parts for routine maintenance. You get a generous 32GB of DDR4 RAM, which should be more than enough for most SMB applications - although two free DIMM sockets provide the option of adding extra modules and maxing out the memory to 64GB. There's a pair of 5.25in bays at the top and a 3.5in bay below. Broadberry has fitted an optical drive in the top bay and, with a total of six SATA ports on the motherboard, there are still two spare interfaces up for grabs. For network connectivity, the TS100 has dual embedded Gigabit ports; connections can be upgraded further via the motherboard's two PCI Express slots (one full-width x16 slot and one shorter x8 slot). There are also four conventional PCI slots, which will almost certainly be excessive, but they do ensure that any legacy adapters can be kept in service. Remote management features are limited, however. The P10S-X motherboard doesn't have a dedicated slot for Asus' ASMB8-iKVM plugin controller, so you can't reach the server remotely via a web browser, control power, or access its BIOS screen and OS via remote control sessions. All is not lost, however: the server comes with the free ASWM Windows utility, which provides centralised server management, monitoring and alerting. Setting up ASWM is easy. Each managed server requires an agent loaded, which we deployed to the TS100 from the ASWM web console. Installation is fully automated, and the console pulls in plenty of details on hardware status and performance from the agent. Its fault monitoring, meanwhile, can send out email alerts and SNMP traps. The interface is garish, but usability is much improved compared to previous versions. The CyberServe TS100 is a strong starter package, and the price is reasonable considering you get fast SSD storage and a big helping of DDR4 memory. Storage expansion and remote management features are limited, but if you want a quiet and environmentally friendly server, the TS100 warrants closer inspection.

Blog Robo-car Redraws Auto Landscape Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 5/26/2017 11:01 AM EDT  2 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet We can count at least 10 ADAS/autonomous vehicle platforms. How will these hardware and software platforms overlap, interact and compete? Most non-gearheads who have grown up outside Detroit have some difficulty understanding the inner workings of the auto industry, particularly how car OEMs, tier ones and component vendors mesh together to get millions of cars off the assembly line. This choreography is now complicated by technology suppliers — none based in Detroit and all new to the traditional automotive market. These players include Tesla, Waymo (formerly Google) and chip companies like Nvidia and Intel. In an industry jumbled by newcomers, the partnerships among OEMs and tier ones are no longer business as usual. Existing alliances might be suddenly superseded by new ones. Competing technologies within rival autonomous vehicle platforms render the whole landscape alien and unpredictable. The reporter’s life, of course, would be so much easier if the industry’s battle over automated vehicle platforms could be simply framed as a race between Nvidia vs. Intel. But nothing could be further from the truth. On one hand, Nvidia wants the world to believe advancements in deep learning are swiftly and vastly transforming the automotive industry. On the other hand, Texas Instruments, which has put more than 150 million of its ADAS and digital cockpit SoCs on the road, is confident that it can push its current [Level 1 & 2] platform to support Level 3 automated vehicles later this year. TI aims to take customers to the next level while protecting its software investment. TI also claims that a low-power embedded solution for running an AI-inference model is also in the offing. The two companies represent polar opposite views and approaches, about how fast and how drastic the automotive industry is changing.   ADAS/Autonomous Vehicle (AV) platforms     “The auto industry has historically been a huge networked ecosystem with multiple tiers of suppliers,” Mike Demler, a senior analyst at the Linley Group, reminded us. “No one company can supply everything.” Demler believes that at this stage, “most carmakers are still evaluating and developing. No one is looking to buy a complete stack.” However, we can count now at least 10 ADAS/autonomous vehicle platforms — publicly touted and promoted by different parties. Automated driving platforms we’ve seen so far include: Autonomous Vehicle Platforms (Source: EE Times) Click here for larger image As shown in the table, not every AV platform can handle the gamut of ADAS and autonomous functions. Even Nvidia’s AV platform, focused on deep learning, can be described as a partial solution. It “will still need a safety monitor that can process control signals and monitor that,” noted Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI). Egil Juliussen, director, research, infotainment & ADAS at IHS Automotive, told EE Times, “I think there will be multiple software and hardware platforms that overlap, interact and compete with each other.” Next page: AV Stacks Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 4 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Freelancer Do I really want to pay $10,000+ for a car with this garbage on it?

Re-architect the car , simplify it and you cut development times, manufacturing costs and operating costs - operating costs will be very important for car as a service. For the AV stack, at some point soon costs will need to be factored in too. Tesla today is using a Parker SoC paired with a mid range GPU (GP106 - a 200mm2 die, likely with 3GB GDDR) but they might get away with just a single Xavier SoC soon.

[State Department photo/ Public Domain]    Tillerson Apologizes To Britain After Intel Agencies Leak Manchester Bombing Details Saagar Enjeti Reporter 10:23 AM 05/26/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson apologized to the United Kingdom Friday after details of the Manchester bombing were leaked to U.S. media outlets. “We take full responsibility for that and we regret that that happened,” Tillerson said in a joint appearance with U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. He continued, “This special relationship that exists between our two countries will certainly withstand this particular unfortunate event.” The U.K. temporarily suspended Manchester bombing intelligence sharing with the U.S. Thursday after photos of the crime scene appeared in The New York Times. British Prime Minister Theresa May considered the leak so serious that she said she would raise the matter with President Donald Trump to stress that information shared between the two allies must remain secret. President Donald Trump pledged in a Thursday statement to get to the bottom of the leaks and suggested that he may even prompt prosecution of the leakers. Intelligence sharing resumed Friday after May’s warning to Trump. “They have an absolute right to do what they did. It should be a lesson for us,” former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden lamented Thursday. “This is British information that is shared on the condition that we will follow British rules.” Follow Saagar Enjeti on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Digital Trends Home > Buying Guides > The Best 2-in-1s You Can Buy The Best 2-in-1s You Can Buy Tablet or notebook? Our favorite 2-in-1 PCs give you the best of both worlds By Mark Coppock — Updated May 26, 2017 8:47 am Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: One of the fastest growing segments of the PC market is the 2-in-1, machines that can morph from one form factor to another, make use of touchscreen displays and, sometimes, active pens as well. Microsoft kicked off the modern Windows 2-in-1 market with the original Surface in 2012, and since then Microsoft, its OEM partners, and even Chromebook makers have continued to grow the segment with increasingly high-quality options. Like all PCs, 2-in-1s vary in their configurations, performance, and battery life. They also span a range of price points, from the low-end to the stratospheric. The 2-in-1 has become so popular that there seem to be as many different models produced as traditional notebooks. And that makes some sense, because the best 2-in-1s really can become your primary machine. Our pick HP Spectre x360 13 Why should you buy this: It’s fast, has great battery life, offers a lovely display, and swivels around into multiple modes. The best HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx The HP Spectre x360 13 is a no-compromise notebook that can also serve as a useful tablet PC. $1,099.99 from Best Buy Who’s it for: Anyone with around $1,000 to spend How much will it cost: $1,090 – $1,960 Why we picked the HP Spectre x360 13: The competition among 13-inch 360-degree convertibles is fierce, with many excellent options fighting for the top spot. It’s also an important segment, given that it’s right in the sweet spot of performance and mobility — given the trend of reducing chassis size via smaller display bezels, the 13-inch 2-in-1 is just right to bring the benefits of both traditional clamshell notebooks and tablet form factors. We picked the newly refreshed HP Spectre x360 13 because it offers the best combination of performance, battery life, display quality, and price, among a very loaded field. We had already rated the Spectre x360 13 as one of the best machines around at the end of 2016, and the early 2017 refresh added in the only things we found missing from the machine. Namely, HP added a 4K UHD display option that many potential buyers were demanding. Also added is an active pen, for drawing and handwriting on the screen. The best thing about today’s 360-degree convertible 2-in-1s is that they work extremely well as traditional notebooks, and the Spectre x360 13 epitomizes the segment. It offers seventh-generation Core i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to 1TB of fast SSD storage, meaning that it can be configured as well as any competing notebook. And its battery will easily last a full workday. Our full review The best budget 2-in-1 Samsung Chromebook Pro Why should you buy this: It’s a solid performer that makes good use of Chrome OS, and it also incorporates all the technology needed to fully support Android apps. The best budget 2-in-1 Samsung Chromebook Pro The Samsung Chromebook Pro is arguably the best Chromebook around, and is a great platform for Android apps, too. $449.00 from Best Buy $449.00 from Amazon Who’s it for: Anyone wants the flexibility of the 2-in-1 form factor but doesn’t care for Windows 10 – or needs to save some cash How much will it cost: $550 Why we picked the Samsung Chromebook Pro: The Windows 10 ecosystem doesn’t have a monopoly on the 2-in-1 form factor. If you haven’t bought into Windows 10 or you just don’t have the cash for some of these Windows 10 machines, then you’ll likely be looking for a different option. That’s where the Samsung Chromebook Pro comes in. Samsung’s machine comes in two flavors, the Pro with an Intel Core M processor, and the Plus with an ARM CPU. The difference in price is only $100, meaning that you’re getting significantly more performance by going with the higher-level machine. Of course, the Chromebook Pro runs Google’s Chrome OS platform, which is incredibly lightweight compared to Windows 10. But you can also download Android apps, which are fully compatible. That helps fill some gaps in services not supported by Chrome OS. Samsung also includes its S Pen for some nifty drawing and handwriting capabilities. Samsung has also included all the technology needed — like an accelerometer — to ensure that Android apps work properly. The Chromebook Pro punches above its weight class in hardware, too. It sports a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution display, offers multiple Thunderbolt 3 ports, and is equipped with 4GB of RAM and a 32GB SSD. The memory and storage configurations might seem on the small side but they’re actually more than sufficient to comfortably run the lightweight Chrome OS, with its emphasis on cloud storage. By choosing the Chromebook Pro, you’re getting a solid 2-in-1 compared to the Windows 10 machines you’ll find at the same price point. You’re limited in what applications you can run, but the arrival of Android app support will change that to a degree. If you’re good with Google’s Chrome OS platform, then the Samsung Chromebook Pro is a great lower-cost 2-in-1 option. Our full review The best for tablet use Surface Pro 4 Why should you buy this: It’s a great tablet PC because of its thin and light form factor, but it offers a solid physical keyboard for real productivity. The best for tablet use Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Surface Pro 4 truly is the tablet that can replace your notebook. $1,233.49 from Amazon $1,299.99 from Microsoft Who’s it for: Anyone who just can’t decide between a tablet and a traditional notebook How much will it cost: $699 – $1,799, $60 for Surface Pen, $130 for Type Cover Why we picked the Surface Pro 4: Note: The newest Surface Pro has been announced, and is available for pre-order. It’s not a major overhaul, so most of what we’ve said here applies to the new model. Waiting for the new version is a good idea if you’re not in a hurry to buy. Like the Surface Book, the Surface Pro 4 uses sixth-generation Intel Core processors, but it has gone through its own growing pains as well, and is now a stable and reliable machine for most people. It also offers solid configurations at reasonable price points, and so you can even save a little money by picking one up. In terms of design, the Surface Pro 4 is a tablet first. It’s thin, light, and features a solid pane of Gorilla Glass 3 that covers the entire face of the machine. It features a detachable keyboard called the Type Cover that attaches magnetically to the bottom and performs without the lag associated with many Bluetooth keyboards. The Type Cover can be connected via a second magnet that props it up at a more comfortable angle. Though small, the Surface Pro 4 doesn’t sacrifice much performance. If you pick an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor, then you won’t notice much performance difference compared to other similarly equipped machines. You can configure the Surface Pro 4 with a full 16GB of RAM and 1TB of PCIe SSD storage, making it a solid productivity option. As with all Surface machines, Windows Hello support is via infrared camera and facial recognition. With the kickstand that can rotate out to 150 degrees and support for the Surface Pen, the Surface Pro 4 can also work as a kind of highly mobile electronic drawing easel for artistic types. Our full review The best large 2-in-1 Surface Book Why should you buy this: It’s a great solid performer for just about any productivity task, but converts to a tablet for on-the-go use. The best large 2-in-1 Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base The Surface Book has a luscious display, serious power, and market-leading battery life. $1,499.00 from Amazon.com Who’s it for: Business and creative professionals with money to spend on the best How much will it cost: $2,399 – $3,299 Why we picked the Surface Book: If money is no object, then Microsoft’s Surface Book with Performance Base remains the best overall 2-in-1 choice among large devices. The original model was introduced in October 2015, which was eons in computer time, but the design was so forward-looking that it still seems futuristic even today. The Surface Book’s claim is its detachable keyboard. The 13.5-inch display contains the main processing components, and can be popped off the base to become a surprisingly thin, light, and powerful tablet. The keyboard base is more of a dock, one that contains discrete graphics on some models, and that carries most of the combination’s battery capacity. It also supports the Surface Pen, which is a great choice for creative types. And of course, the Surface Book supports Windows 10’s Hello password-less authentication via an infrared camera and facial recognition. Yes, the Surface Book hasn’t yet been upgraded to Intel’s seventh-generation Intel Core processors, but it’s been tweaked and updated so much since its introduction that it’s now a rock-solid performer. The Performance Base update was launched in October 2016, and it added a faster Nvidia GeForce 960M discrete GPU, and a serious bump in battery capacity. RAM can be configured to a solid 16GB, and up to 1TB of fast PCIe SSD storage can be selected. Add in one of the best displays available in a notebook, a solid keyboard, and a very good touchpad. and you have an excellent machine for anyone who needs to get some real work done. And it offers some of the best battery life we’ve seen, at least as long as you’re using it as a notebook – the keyboard base contains an additional battery. Our full review Should you buy now or wait? There’s never been a better time to buy a Windows 10 2-in-1. The market is full of great options, and we’re convinced that the machines we’ve listed here will serve you well for years to come. Performance, battery life, displays, and connectivity are all top-notch, and will handle everything you need them to do now and well into the future. And there’s not much coming soon to give you pause. Intel has just released it’s seventh-generation Core processors, and there’s no reason to believe that the next generation will make Windows 10 2-in-1s any better at their primary productivity purposes. How We Test We spend a tremendous amount of time reviewing notebooks of all shapes and sizes — and that’s saying something today, when notebooks come in so many shapes, sizes, and configurations. To make sure our recommendations provide real value to our readers, we live with the machines for a time and use them in writing our reviews — to make sure we can assess how they’ll work for real users. But we do have a method to our madness in conducting these reviews, and you can look behind the scenes here. Hopefully it will be obvious that our reviews are real labors of love — or hate, depending on the notebook – and therefore you can at least recognize that we don’t arrive at our conclusions without some serious consideration.

Here's how.     Share   Tweet 0 Comments May 26, 2017 A simulation of cars using Autotalks' vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. TEL AVIV (JTA)-Israeli startups are revving their engines ahead of the country's largest-ever "smart transportation" event. Over 200 local companies working in transportation technology will be at the EcoMotion Conference on Thursday at the Peres Center for Peace in Jaffa. The plan is to give auto industry giants a look under the hood of "Startup Nation." "Companies from around the world want to see what's happening in Israel," said Lior Zeno-Zamasky, the executive director of EcoMotion, a networking group for transportation technology companies in Israel that is organizing the conference. "The idea is ultimately to make deals, and I can tell you we've had a lot of success stories in the past." Israel in recent years has become an unlikely center for automotive innovation-it has no car manufacturing to speak of, and the country is notorious for its bad drivers. It started with the electric car company Better Place, which in spite of its high-profile bankruptcy in May 2013 is credited with putting Israel's automotive tech scene on the map. The next month, Google bought the Raanana-based mapping company Waze for $1 billion. And in March of this year, Intel agreed to acquire the self-driving car technology powerhouse Mobileye, located in Jerusalem, for a record $15 billion. BMW, Ford, General, Honda, Motors, Uber, Volkswagen and Volvo have also invested in Israeli technology since 2016. Now that they have the world's attention, Israeli entrepreneurs have shifted into overdrive. According to Zeno-Zamasky, at least 550 startups now work in the country's transportation technology industry. Here are some of the revolutionary things those attending the fifth annual EcoMotion conference are trying to make cars do. Run on electricity with little or no charging The era of the electric vehicle has officially arrived. A couple million plug-in cars are now whirring along roads across the globe, consuming a third as much energy as their gasoline-powered counterparts. Pulling over to recharge them, however, is a buzzkill. So Israeli startups are working on ways to make the pit stops faster and less frequent-or even unnecessary. Tel Aviv-based StoreDot claims to be developing an electric vehicle battery that can be recharged in five minutes-that's compared to the hours that are typically required today. The company says a single charge would run a car for about 300 miles-farther than almost any electric vehicle now on the market and nearly as much as a gasoline-powered car. StoreDot recently demonstrated proof of the concept on a single battery cell, and previously recharged a smartphone in 30 seconds. Electroad thinks its can do away with plugs altogether. At its headquarters in Caesarea, the company has developed an under-the-pavement wireless technology that recharges electric vehicles while they drive. With "inductive charging," vehicles can carry lighter, less expensive batteries-and never have to stop to recharge. Israel's government is working with Electroad to build a half-mile public bus route in Tel Aviv using its technology. If the planned 2018 launch goes well, there are plans for more routes, starting with an 11-mile shuttle between the city of Eilat and the Ramon International Airport in the south. Navigate by 'sight' Mobileye provides most of the world's driver-assistance technology. That includes the sensors-mainly cameras, lidar lasers and radar-and computing power that cars need to "see" the road. And the company is working with Intel and others to roll out a test fleet of 40 self-driving vehicles later this year. But car vision is still far from 20/20, and some Israeli startups apparently think they can do better. Innoviz Technologies, located in Kfar Saba, and Vayavision, from Or Yehuda, are both developing their own lidar laser systems, which use light and radar to determine distance. Meanwhile, Oryx Vision promises "nano antenna" sensors that perform 50 times better and cost much less than the technologies used by Mobileye. Last October, the Petach Tikvah-based startup raised $17 million in its first round of funding. If all goes well, it anticipates seeing its product on the road by 2020. By then, some analysts predict, there will be 10 million self-driving cars in operation. The Mobileye group has set the following year, 2021, as the target for its technology to take the wheel. Talk to each other and the world The cars of the future will communicate to avoid crashes and ease traffic jams. Experts predict some cars will have this ability within a year or two, and the technology will be commonplace in self-driving cars within a decade. Headquartered in Kfar Netter, Autotalks is making chip sets that can link vehicles not just to each other but also to infrastructure and people. The semiconductor company has collaborated with Audi on "smart antennae" and started selling to car equipment manufacturers. In March, it raised $30 million in funding, touting its chips' compliance with a rule proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation in December that would mandate the use of vehicle-to-vehicle communication in new cars. The department estimated the rule could prevent more than half a million accidents and a thousand U.S. deaths every year. As cars become more connected, Herzliya-based otonomo wants to bring driver and passenger services-from apps to roadside help-via its cloud-based marketplace. It has deals with nine automakers, but as usual, consumers will pay with their data, which otonomo allows automakers to sell. While Autotalks and otonomo provide their own security, Argus Cybersecurity designs systems to protect the electronics that control a vehicle's basic functions from hackers. The Tel Aviv company does this by analyzing the data that come in and out of a vehicle's communications systems, which is otherwise highly vulnerable. Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon came up with the idea while serving in Israel's elite 8200 intelligence unit. For those attached to their regular old car but fed up with driving it, IVO Driver Robot has a solution: a robot that can drive for you. So far, the robot has mostly driven a golf cart-style buggy around a parking lot at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba, where it is being developed. But a new and improved version is in the works.

Data compiled by industry tracker DRAMeXchange shows Intel accounted for 40 percent of the market, while Samsung’s share stood at 25 percent in the January-March period, Yonhap news agency reported. An SSD is a data storage device made with a NAND flash memory chip that does not need the power to store data and is more durable and faster than a hard disk drive. While Samsung stands as the top player in the SSD market for private usage, it still falls behind the US rival in the sector for companies. The combined shipment of the corporate SSDs was estimated at 6 million units in the first quarter – up 3 to 4 percent year-on-year, the data also showed. DRAMeXchange said the demand for corporate SSD is anticipated to grow down the road as major online giants such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft provide services through data centre networks.

It enumerated the benefits of this technology, which is basically a beefed up USB-C connection. One of those is the ability for a single cable to do everything from power to data to display. No where is that going to be more evident than in Elgato’s Thunderbolt 3 Dock specifically designed with the new MacBook Pro in mind and finally shipping next month. Apple giveth and Apple taketh away. In its newest MacBook Pros, however, it has taken away more than it has given. Specifically it has removed almost all holes save for 2 or 4 Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports. Fortunately for users, accessory makers like Elgato are coming to the rescue. Announced back in January, the Thunderbolt 3 Dock boasted of a feature list which would have been nearly impossible with older connections and even a plain USB-C. It is capable of supporting two 4K displays, among other things. It also has ports for one more Thunderbolt 3/USB-C connection, Gigabit Ethernet, three USB 3.0, a headphone jack, and a mic plug. The real magic with this dock is that it does all that with only a single cable connecting to a MacBook Pro, or really any computer that supports Thunderbolt 3. So you can hide all those other cables and have only one wire bridging the Dock and the computer itself. That same cable also charges the MacBook at the same time. The Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock is finally shipping starting 6th June and could have come at a better time for Thunderbolt 3 proponents like Intel and Apple. Initial price was set to $299.95, but be sure to keep tabs on the link below for the exact figure when it launches.

By: Bloomberg | San Francisco | Updated: May 26, 2017 12:58 pm Samsung’s commitment underlines the importance of its chip unit and the growth in demand for outsourced production of chips. (Source: Bloomberg) Related News Samsung India to expand technical training schools to Bengaluru and Jamshedpur Samsung Galaxy S8 ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ Special Edition launched in China Sony Xperia XZ Premium vs Samsung Galaxy S8+ vs LG G6: Specifications battle Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-biggest chipmaker, is increasing its effort in semiconductor outsourcing, separating the company’s foundry business into a new unit as part of a challenge to market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Samsung is elevating the foundry business to show its independence and guarantee its access to resources within the company. The South Korean company on Wednesday also promised customers that it will introduce new production techniques ahead of competitors and have a new plant up and running by the fourth quarter of this year. Creating a separate unit for the business may ease the concerns of some potential customers who compete with other parts of Samsung, said Kelvin Low, a senior director of foundry marketing. “As part of our commitment to play seriously in the foundry area we felt that it was best that we create an independent organization,” Low said. “That will result in less conflict of interest — although that’s not really an issue these days — it’s still a perception in some customers’ minds.” Samsung’s commitment underlines the importance of its chip unit and the growth in demand for outsourced production of chips. Fewer companies than before can afford to invest the billions of dollars it takes to build and equip plants and fund research into new manufacturing. TSMC, which dominates the market by producing components for companies such as Apple Inc., has posted double-digit percentage revenue gains for the last five years. In March, Intel Corp., which is the world’s largest maker of chips through its lead in the market for computer microprocessors, said it’s recommitting itself to building its own made-to-order chip business and claimed its manufacturing is still ahead of Samsung and TSMC. All three companies fight for orders from companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Apple, which design their own chips but don’t own any manufacturing. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy J7, J5 Prime in 32GB storage now available in India The electronics arm of South Korea’s largest business group doesn’t currently break out sales of its foundry unit. As the world’s biggest maker of memory chips, sales of those components make up most of the company’s total semiconductor revenue, contributing 12.12 trillion won ($10.5 billion) of 15.66 trillion won in the first quarter. That indicates the other chips, including foundry produced and those made for its own internal consumption, had sales of 3.54 trillion won in the quarter, a gain of 10 percent from a year earlier. That’s still less than half of the $7.53 billion in revenue TSMC posted in the quarter. Samsung, whose chip unit provided two-thirds of companywide operating profit, is locked in a race with TSMC and Intel to improve factory output in increments the industry refers to as nanometers. Currently the best is 10-nanometer production. Samsung said it was the first to mass produce at that node and TSMC said it’s now in full production of 10 nanometer with a rapid increase in output due in the second half of this year. Also Read: Samsung Galaxy S8’s iris scanner can be hacked, company says it is investigating Samsung on Wednesday said 8 nanometer is coming later this year and 7 will follow in 2018. Its 7-nanometer production will be the first to use extreme ultraviolet lithography — a new version of the process of burning the circuit patterns into layers of materials on silicon to create chips. Switching to that will reduce the number of steps required, reduce cost and make the chips perform better, Samsung said. The company believes it will begin to introduce 4-nanometer production in 2020, a step which will require a brand new arrangements of transistors, the fundamental building blocks of chips.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The growing belief now is that Apple will be releasing a new MacBook Pro at the Worldwide Developer Conference on June 5, an act that may work against the Cupertino company. While most are criticising the laptops released in late 2016, the cycle of introducing the MacBook line has been singled out. The MacBook Pro 2016 came out last year. It was a much-needed refresh for a device in need of an update. The only problem was that it came with an old Intel Skylake chipset limited to 16GB of space. Power-hungry users were upset since they wanted the best possible configuration they could get.  Most users wanted to see Intel Kaby Lake SoCs on-board, but supply issues were rampant at that time. In short, timing was a bit off. Apple's rival Microsoft, however, still opted to delay its Surface Pro series to early 2017.  Apple could have followed the same tactic, only that the clamour for a new MacBook Pro had grown loud. Would it have made sense to delay the device until early 2017 as well? Probably.  Regardless, Apple may still release an updated version of the MacBook Pro line outside of its normal schedule. Most are already anticipating Intel Kaby Lake chip-backed devices. Under normal circumstances, it would have been good news, but not for those who have already bought the MacBook Pro 2016.  It is a gamble that could put a dent on Apple’s credibility. Even with the backlash towards the underpowered MacBook Pro 2016, many still took the bait. In fact, Trendforce reports a 15-percent year-on-year rise for the last quarter of 2016. With the cycle more than likely to be broken with a potential release of updated MacBooks next week, Apple will have to give a plausible explanation for doing so. Most consumers know the reason behind it, but one couldn't help but wonder what will happen late this year. This is, of course, if Apple fans assume there will be another batch coming out.  If consumers are thrown off with an untimely release, the effects could be detrimental. Most of them want a powerful MacBook Pro, and the early 2017 version seems to be such. Looking ahead, will a new batch stay on schedule? Or will Apple save new variants for consumers before the year comes to a close?

It's our top pick for high-end gaming desktops. Origin Neuron editor rating: excellent Comments May 19, 2017 REVIEW Comments SPECS COMPARE View Gallery View All 8 Photos in Gallery Starting Configuration Price $964.00 Pros Extraordinary gaming proficiency. Plenty of storage, plus speedy M.2 SSDs. Stylish, relatively compact tower. Easy access for maintenance and upgrades. Customizable case and RAM lighting. Cons Pricey as configured. Bottom Line The Origin Neuron is a stellar gaming machine with practically unrivaled gaming power housed in an elegant design. It's our top pick for high-end gaming desktops. By Matthew Buzzi Consumer gaming and 3D performance are being pushed to absurd new heights on the back of Nvidia's Pascal graphics architecture and Intel's latest generation of processors. Both of these platforms are on full display in the Origin Neuron (starts at $964; $3,900 as tested), with dual GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards and an overlocked Core i7-7700K processor. These components help the Neuron blow past competitors in our gaming tests, it's also speedy with productivity pursuits, and comes with a huge amount of storage to boot. This configuration is expensive, but for what you get and relative to the Editors' Choice Digital Storm Velox, the pricing is fair. Given its superior performance and overall execution, the Origin Neuron is our new top pick for high-end gaming desktops. //Compare Similar Products Compare Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K)   %displayPrice%%seller% CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Talon (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock   %displayPrice%%seller% Corsair One Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Predator G1-710-70001   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG GT51   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Tiki (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% iBuyPower Snowblind Pro   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen X   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo IdeaCentre Y710 Cube   %displayPrice%%seller% Form, Function, and More Built into Phanteks' Enthoo Evolv mATX case, the Neuron is relatively unassuming if you look at it head on, but there's a lot to like inside once you start poking around. Its black aluminum frame stands 17.8 by 9 by 15.7 inches (HWD), with tempered glass panels on both flanks. The left side is nearly a full window, while the right is backed with aluminum and has a small cutout window for the SSDs. The case isn't a small-form-factor design, but it's on the smaller side for traditional towers. For size comparison, the Velox stands 22.2 inches tall, 9.25 inches wide, and 19.5 inches deep, taking up much more space. View All 8 Photos in Gallery The panels on either side are actually doors on rear hinges, held closed magnetically toward the front. They both swing open easily, making for one of the most accessible cases I've seen in a while. This lets you in to either side of the tower, which is good for swapping out components and cable and storage management beneath the motherboard. Having such easy access to the space with no screws or removable doors makes it a breeze to pop open and work in the case despite the size, and everything is organized neatly within. This includes neatly cut and routed cables, which are clipped together and funneled behind the motherboard. The CPU cooler stands vertically along the front panel and vents out the front, with a rear case fan in the back and slits along the top panel for more ventilation. The top panel lifts away if you remove one rear hand screw, though there's not much reason to take it off. The bottom of the case is raised about 2 inches by front and back feet, so most of the bottom is above surface level. This allows the bottom vent more room to breathe, and a removable filter over it keeps out dust and debris. The front panel pops off, revealing case fans behind another removable dust filter. The Editors' Choice CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra, one of the first Ryzen-equipped systems we reviewed, uses the same case. CyberPower plastered its logo over the corner of the door window, whereas Origin places a smaller logo on the front panel and on the CPU cooler. Since the case on our review unit is all black, the only color comes from an array of LED lights. The customization is handled through the included Asus Aura software, for which there's a slight learning curve. It's not immediately clear where each setting is (the arrow to switch between each lighting element is particularly small), but once you spend some time poking around, you should get the gist of it. The color and effects of an interior LED light strip, the RAM, the LED ring around the power button, and a slim strip on the front panel can all be changed. The RAM in our unit is G.Skill TridentZ RGB, which is illuminated in customizable segments. You can change the colors of five discrete sections of each stick, which can lead to some cool designs and color combinations, or make lighting "flow" down each stick in conjunction with the case lighting, which is a really cool effect. All of the lighting can also fade in and out slowly, or you can have the LED strip and RAM alternately strobe on and off. The case is not only well designed for maintenance, but is packed with the high-end components you'd hope for at this configuration's price. Everything is powered by an 850W EVGA SuperNOVA G3 power supply, which can run the demanding dual graphics card setup (two Nvidia GTX 1080 Tis in SLI), and the wattage leaves you some headroom. A lightning-fast Intel Core i7-7700K processor, overclocked to 5.0GHz out of the box, serves as the heart of the system. To supplement that, there are 32GB of the 3,000MHz G.Skill memory in our model, and since it's set up as four 8GB sticks, there are no free DIMM slots. Storage comes in the form of two 250GB Samsung 960 EVO NVMe M.2 SSDs in a RAID 0 array, along with two 2TB Seagate Firecuda hybrid drives—a one-two punch that delivers a massive amount of storage and a super-fast boot drive. It adds to the price, for sure, but if you do a lot of media work, you'll appreciate the added speed, and there's more than enough room for many projects and games. As configured, there are still two 2.5-inch and two 3.5-inch storage bays free. The Neuron won't leave you wanting for connectivity options. At first glance, it doesn't seem as if the case has any front-facing ports, but a small panel at the top retracts to reveal two USB 3.0 ports, as well as a headphone jack and a mic jack. The top panel has no ports, just the LED-ringed power button. The rear panel holds the vast majority of connections: There's a USB-C port, a USB-A port, four more USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports. Via the graphics cards, there are a total of seven DisplayPort connections and three HDMI ports. The system also has built-in Bluetooth and dual-band 802.11ac wireless. Origin includes lifetime 24/7 support and free lifetime labor, alongside a one-year part-replacement warranty. Insane Power for Gaming and Productivity With such premium parts, it's no surprise that the Neuron is a performance dynamo. If you're paying for a dual 1080 Ti desktop, you should expect no less than top-end speed, which it delivers across all tests. In terms of general productivity, it was one of the fastest computers we've tested. Its PCMark 8 Work Conventional score beat all comers, such as the Digital Storm Velox, the 2016 Falcon Northwest Talon, and the Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock. In the multimedia test results (timed Photoshop and Handbrake tests, plus the CineBench score), the Neuron didn't lead the pack in such dominant fashion, but it was right up there with the best of the category. Gaming and 3D performance is where the Neuron really separates itself from the pack. The competitors are all fast desktops, many of which are equipped with GTX 1080s in SLI, but the 1080 Ti upgrade pushes the Neuron to the front, scoring a category-best 21,481 points on 3D Mark's Fire Strike Extreme test. Its Cloud Gate score is on the top end, as well. It should be noted that in real-world use, the Falcon Northwest Talon's dual Pascal Titan X cards should provide more power, which doesn't fully translate on the synthetic tests, but the Talon configuration we tested rings north of $9,500. See How We Test Desktops The Heaven and Valley gaming tests tell the same story of the Neuron's capabilities. Set to Ultra quality and 1080p resolution, the Neuron averaged 278 frames per second (fps) on Heaven and 175fps on Valley. When cranked up to 4K, the desktop averaged 95fps and 113fps on these same tests, proving it's more than capable of smooth 4K gaming. I further confirmed this by playing DOOM in 4K at maximum settings, and the in-game frame counter hovered around 100fps or higher for most of my gameplay. I also played The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 4K with all the settings and effects on Ultra, and had a smooth experience. A Clear Leader in Desktop Gaming Sure, the Neuron is more expensive than single-GPU desktops like the Gamer Master Ultra, but you get what you pay for. It's still thousands of dollars less than other high-end systems like the Falcon Northwest Talon or Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock (though those PCs do come with their own top-end advantages), and the stylish but functional case provides a great home for the premium hardware. If you can afford the high-end components, it's tough to beat the power, design, and organization offered by the Origin Neuron. The Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K) is a fast computer, but it's also even more expensive than the Neuron, which is a superior all-around performer with better graphics cards. For its design, pricing, and impressive gaming capability, the Origin Neuron is our new Editors' Choice for high-end gaming desktops.

Points of focus that pertain to Kushner include: the Trump campaign's 2016 data analytics operation; his relationship with former national security adviser Michael Flynn; and Kushner's own contacts with Russians, according to the officials. Kushner met at least once in December with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and he also met last year with Sergey Gorkov, chairman of VneshEconomBank, a Russian government-owned institution that has been under US sanctions since July 2014. It remains unclear if the FBI plans to talk to Kushner. "Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings," Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told NBC News. "He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry." The FBI is investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia in connection with Moscow's alleged interference in the 2016 election, reports USA Today. Flynn, along with former Trump campaign associates Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Carter Page, are active subjects of the investigation. --IANS ksk (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

He worships David Lynch, Italian food, and is rarely seen without tea. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram! Microsoft just unveiled the new Surface Pro with shiny new internals and an array of upgraded features. The 2-in-1 tablet form factor remains a divisive point, so much so that Microsoft recently unveiled a classic Surface Laptop clamshell for people who find the Surface Pro's hybrid configuration a little off-putting. Still, I'm of the opinion that the Surface Pro remains a great option, even with the clamshell configuration now available. But is it right for you? Let's discuss the "pros" and cons (see what I did there? Pros?... sorry.) Tech Specs Both the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop are incredibly similar on the inside, but there are a few differences worth noting. We've highlighted in bold when a device wins the spec battle.

Interestingly, the i5 version of the Surface Pro is, like the m3, fanless in design, which means it will be practically silent compared to its i7 counterpart. Every version of the Surface Laptop is equipped with a fan, though we've yet to spend any time with either the new Surface Pro or the Surface Laptop in an isolated and quiet setting where we could put them under load and see just how noisy the fans are. Previous Surface Pro models have struggled with throttling due to heat generation. Kaby Lake Intel processors could go some way to improve the situation, but if you'd prefer peace of mind when it comes to thermals, the Surface Laptop might be a better bet. But this is, again, something that's hard to judge without a thorough analysis. In any case, both devices should perform similarly, with the Surface Laptop edging the Surface Pro into second place when it comes to battery life. Part of that, however, might be due to Windows 10 S, which blocks Win32 programs like Chrome which are known to impact battery life. Windows 10 S vs. Windows 10 Pro The Surface Laptop comes with Windows 10 S, Microsoft's new super-secure OS locked to the vetted Windows 10 Store. It is upgradeable for free until the end of 2017, giving you access to the full compliment of Win32 programs on the market: Steam, Adobe CC, and beyond. After 2017, it will cost around $50 to purchase a Windows 10 Pro upgrade license, which is still cheaper than usual. Students will probably get far more out of the Surface Pro for note taking, due to its form factor. The Surface Pro comes with Windows 10 Pro as standard, because Microsoft expects it to be used by professional artists who rely on programs like Clip Studio and Adobe Photoshop. I think Microsoft missed an opportunity, though, at least with the fanless m3 and i5 versions, as I feel these would make for pretty great tablets with Windows 10 S, but perhaps that's for another discussion. Because Windows 10 S is so easily upgraded, it shouldn't really factor into your purchase decision between the two devices, but if you're a student simply looking for a standard clamshell that will run Office programs and a web browser efficiently, the Surface Laptop is a safe bet even without the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. That said, students will probably get far more out of the Surface Pro for note taking, due to its form factor. Form factor wars While the Surface Laptop supports inking, it's not something you'll enjoy doing. The screen doesn't tilt back nearly as far as the Surface Pro, and being a laptop you can't quite curl up with it in a chair and draw. Expect to use inking on the Laptop more for utilitarian purposes — signing and annotating documents, for example — than artistry. If you intend to make extensive use of the pen — sketching, drawing, taking notes by hand, etc — then the Surface Pro tablet is a great option. The Surface Pro's kickstand/tablet configuration is oft-criticized as having poor "lappability," i.e. it's difficult to use on your lap like a, well, laptop. The kickstand has been improved yet again with the new Surface Pro — it's more stable for lap-typers and more flexible for artists that want to fold it back nearly flat (a full 165 degrees). This will work well with the newly supported Surface Dial, another huge boost for artists. Price This is where things get a little complicated. The price listings for the Surface Pro only include the tablet. No keyboard, and no pen. The keyboard alone adds $160 to the equation, throw in the new tilt-shifting pen (which we expect to be $100), and a Surface Dial ($100), and that Surface Pro starts to look extremely expensive by comparison. If you want the Surface Pro form factor, chances are you're going to want at least the pen and the keyboard. The 512 MB, Core i7, 16GB RAM Surface Laptop costs $2,199, the same as the Surface Pro. Throw in the keyboard cover and pen, and the Surface Pro becomes $2,459, which is a significant bump. If you're spending money at the high-end, an additional $260 might not bother you so much, but if you're going for the lower-end devices to save money, it's something worth considering. You're going to have to really want that Surface Pro drawing, inking configuration to justify the extra costs. Which is right for you? The new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are mostly evenly matched on specs and are fairly close in price. It comes down to a matter of form factor, and that's a debate for the ages. If it's art or handwriting or flexibility that's your draw, then the Surface Pro's 2-in-1 tablet design is likely the best for you. If you're planing on doing a lot of typing — or simply have no need for digital inking in your life — the Surface Laptop should rank higher on your list. Of course, there is Surface Book to consider as well, artfully bridging the divide between the tablet and laptop. Though right now, after the unveiling of the Surface Laptop and new Surface Pro, the Book is comparatively out-of-date when it comes to the chips inside. For now, let us know your thoughts on the laptop vs. 2-in-1 hybrid war in the comments below. Which would you rather get? Which Surface should you get: Pro or Laptop?

When on the go, the Pro is good enough since the best I'll be doing is only lightweight stuff anyways. I have recently observed that I'm either using my workstations when at home or at work, or I'm using my tablet for notetaking, drawing, sketching designs etc. (this is mission critical in my case, I can't live without OneNote!).

If it flippd under, it is out of teh way, but a second keyboard is needed.  0 1 week ago Reply John McIlhinney There's certainly an argument to be made for a wireless keyboard but then you need to keep it powered, which the Type Cover doesn't need.

Also, I'm in love with the kickstand, mostly for its aesthetics, but also stability (no wobble ever!). 1 1 week ago Reply Camilo Hoffmann Kuschel Really agree with you on the Windows 10 S on the Surface Pro m3. Was thinking exactly the same the other day. Actually I think that even the i5 4GB one could also come with Windows 10 S. I personally love my SP4 i7 and was really hoping the new Surface Pro would have a bit larger screen as it feels really small when I need to spend hours at uni working on assignments. But, given that it didn't happen and given that the new Surface is now overall more expensive, I'll be probably going for the Surface Laptop. 2 1 week ago Reply ananve If you need the screen real estate, Yes I agreed the laptop is made for you.

You can preorder without a commitment to actually buy when they are available. An aside: The reason I had to go to the store is that my Surface Dock for my SP4 failed after one and a half years and I had to buy a new one. No good at all. If fact I am pretty irritated. I was offered the Student (10%) discount but when you add Jerry Brown Sales Tax it was still $200. The Dock should be functioning for years and there is not any excuse for this poor quality.

They're ahead of Apple with Surface Studio, Surface Pro tablet, and Surface Book. The 2-in-1 form factor has killed the iPad and Mac. Apple fans have never been more frustrated and angry with their company. The Surface Laptop just makes Microsoft look like they are more comfortable being followers rather than leaders in this industry. Windows owns the 2-in-1 category and the touch screen PC market. Microsoft should be more proud of what they accomplished and stop second-guessing themselves with the form factors of yesterday. Surface Laptop was a huge misstep that only makes Apple look less ridiculous than they actually are. -12 1 week ago Reply Enza Knight Disagree, the laptop completes the Surface family for this screen size and there is now something for everyone. 2 1 week ago Reply Urbautz Basically yes.

It is pity that new device comes without pen and there is no noticeable change in price. I was ok to add $150-160 for keyboard and have really good 2-in-1 device where pen was nice bonus to SP3. But now it looks less attractive than before. If I'll go to change SP3 to new device I'll still prefer Surface Pro over Surface Laptop, but most likely won't buy pen. It is interesting if there will be i7 LTE versions and price difference for LTE. Have you seen any info on this? 3 1 week ago Reply Cryio You can still buy a Pro 3 or 4 Pen to go along with the Pro 5.

They cut the M3 by $100, but didn't for the i5 (probably gonna be the most bought model) and i7s. In the pre-order section you can't access the normal Surface Type Cover, so it's the $100 Surface Pen + $160 Surface Alcantara TC = +$260.

What a piece of crap. The Surface tablet is obviously better than the laptop version. If the Surface Laptop had a detachable display and came with a full OS like the Surface Book I think it could've been a pretty good product. At the very least Surface Laptop should've been able to flip over like a Lenovo Yoga and every other modern ultrabook. The fact that this is the first "Surface" device that you can't use as an actual surface to work on is a huge branding fail for Microsoft. -7 1 week ago Reply RobbCab I agree that the Surface Pro is better. but it is most definitely not cheaper. The Core M3 is $100 cheaper without the $159 type cover (=$60 more). When you price comparable i5/4gb/128gb devices with the type cover, the Surface Pro is $159 more expensive than the Laptop. 6 1 week ago Reply Sin Lee Ng A comparable tablet with a detachable keyboard should be more expensive than the laptop, isn't it? That's why the Surface Laptop is targeted at students who need those power but not blow their money on tablet features. 1 1 week ago Reply ia_win If you think about the price difference (150-200) in the long term (duration of device: 2-3 years), is not that big factor. For me the biggest gap in favour of Surface Pro are the SD card, natural pen support and mobility factor. Not sure why i5/16GB and i7/32GB configurations are not available. These are the best for 'real' pros like architects, developers, designers. My company is in the process of replacing several thousands desktops with mobile devices. Surface Pro is considered as well. However, Dell's XPS 15 will win the order because offers above configurations. I really don't get it. Nowadays, memory is so cheap. All Surface devices should come with min 8GB.

One of them is this, the Nitro 5, an entry-level gaming laptop with either NVIDIA or AMD power. Consumers can choose from models that feature up to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti graphics with 7th Generation Intel Core™ processors or AMD Radeon™ RX 550 graphics with 7thGeneration AMD A-series processors. Specifically you're looking at either a Kaby Lake Intel Core i5 or i7 processor with the NVIDIA version, or 7th-generation AMD FX, A10 or A12 processors with the RX 550 model. Both will support up to 32GB of DDR4 2400 RAM, and of course, come with Windows 10. "Selected" models will come with a combination of PCIe SSD (up to 512GB) and HDD storage to cover both fast boot times and sheer volume, making sure you don't run out of space for your favorite games. You'll also find a USB 3.1 Type-C port, one USB 3.0 port with power-off charging for your phone or tablet, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI 2.0 port that supports up to 90Hz refresh rates. When it comes to cooling: The Nitro 5 features dual fans with Acer Coolboost™technology, which delivers heightened fan speeds and cooling ability, and allows users to manually control the cooling process when heavy use requires an added boost. Out front, you'll be looking at a 15.6-inch 1080p IPS display and some red backlighting on the keyboard, while your ears will be treated to Dolby Audio Premium and Acer's TrueHarmony. The Nitro 5 is set to launch in July in North America and China with prices starting at $799. A launch in the EMEA region will follow in August.

PHOTO: REUTERS PublishedMay 26, 2017, 10:02 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4ubh Copy WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is facing a mounting tangle of potential legal troubles arising from his business dealings with foreign entities and his interactions with both executive branch and congressional investigators. One set of problems stems from Russia. In 2015, Russian-linked companies paid Flynn more than US$65,000, including about US$45,000 from the state-backed Russian television network RT for a December trip to Moscow, where he delivered a speech and sat next to President Vladimir Putin at a dinner. In December, a US wiretap of the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, intercepted conversations he had with Flynn discussing the Obama administration's imposition of sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election. The other set stems from Turkey. Last year, Flynn's lobbying firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid more than US$500,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch corporation. Inovo is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish-American businessman with ties to the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The work centred on research to discredit Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, and whose extradition Erdogan has been seeking. Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, declined to comment. But in a letter to the Senate this week, Kelner and other lawyers portrayed Flynn as being treated unfairly, saying he was "the target on nearly a daily basis of outrageous allegations." Here is a breakdown of some of the possible legal problems for Flynn. Making False Statements Investigators are scrutinising whether several of Flynn's statements violated a statute that makes it a felony, punishable by five years in prison, to make a false statement to the government. To convict, prosecutors must prove that the violation was knowing and willful, not merely inadvertent. In January 2016, Flynn, a former three-star general who retired in 2014 after being forced out as head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, applied to have his security clearance extended. As part of the process, he filled out and signed a SF-86 form. It directed him to disclose his foreign travel, compensation and contacts. It also referred to the false-statement statute as part of a certification that the information was truthful and complete. After viewing the form, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said Flynn had concealed his Russia trip and the compensation when he filled it out. In February 2016, investigators reviewing Flynn's application to renew his security clearance interviewed him. According to a letter this month from Cummings, documents suggest Flynn falsely stated in that interview that US companies had funded his Moscow visit and that he had only "insubstantial contact" with foreigners, despite the dinner with Putin. Flynn's legal team has said he briefed the Defence Intelligence Agency about the trip. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, also failed to mention encounters with Russian officials on their SF-86 forms. Separately, four days into the Trump administration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about his conversations with Kislyak in December. Several news outlets have reported that he initially told the FBI that he had not discussed sanctions on Russia but then backtracked and said he could not remember. Taking Foreign Payments Without Permission The Constitution's emoluments clause prohibits people who hold government positions from receiving payments from foreign governments without prior consent from Congress. This rule extends to retired military personnel, and Congress enacted a statute to carry it out. It says retired military personnel may accept such compensation only if they get permission from their service secretary and the secretary of state. Flynn apparently did not obtain permission before taking compensation from RT or Inovo. That failure is complicated by the fact that they are companies, not governments, but the US government has portrayed RT as an arm of the Kremlin. Alptekin has told reporters he hired Flynn with his own funds and did not coordinate with the Turkish government. But congressional investigators have expressed skepticism after receiving classified briefings. "As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else," Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said in April. "And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for the violation of law." Such a violation would not constitute a criminal offence; a Pentagon ethics document says the penalty is forfeiting the funds through withheld retirement pay, not prison time. The acting inspector general of the Defence Department, Glenn Fine, told Congress that his office had begun investigating whether Flynn violated emoluments rules. Failure to Register As a Foreign Agent The Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, requires that people representing foreign governments or political parties register with the Justice Department within 10 days. Under departmental regulations, this rule extends to lobbyists hired by foreign companies if the "principal beneficiary" of their work is a foreign government. In September, after signing the contract with Inovo, the Flynn Intel Group registered as an ordinary lobbyist for that firm but did not make a FARA filing, which requires greater disclosure. However, in March, after his ouster from the Trump administration, Flynn's lawyers filed a belated FARA registration about the arrangement "to eliminate any potential doubt." "Because of the subject matter of Flynn Intel Group's work for Inovo BV, which focused on Mr Fethullah Gulen, whose extradition is sought by the government of Turkey, the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey," the lawyers wrote. Violating FARA is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison, although legal specialists say the Justice Department rarely prosecutes that charge. Failure to Comply With Subpoenas Several congressional committees have been seeking information about Flynn's activities, and there are signs more subpoenas are coming. The Senate Intelligence Committee voted unanimously Thursday to give its top Republican and Democrat broad authority to issue subpoenas. The most advanced subpoena is one the Intelligence Committee issued to Flynn on May 10 seeking all records of his meetings and communications with Russian officials, and of his communications with Trump's campaign about Russia in the 18 months before Trump's inauguration. On Monday, Flynn's lawyers told the committee that he was invoking his right against self-incrimination to avoid complying with the subpoena. Although invoking the Fifth Amendment is usually associated with live testimony, his lawyers argued that it fell under a precedent for document production requests that are so broad that the act of acknowledging whether any such files exist could amount to self-incriminating testimony. The committee can vote to hold anyone refusing to comply with a subpoena in contempt of Congress. If the full House or Senate chamber votes likewise, the dispute moves into court. The Justice Department would have to decide whether to prosecute the subpoena recipient for criminal contempt of Congress, which carries a penalty of one to 12 months in prison. Lawmakers could also file a lawsuit asking a federal judge to order compliance with their subpoena.

C'est un mouvement original et significatif des bouleversements actuels de l'industrie automobile. Renault a annoncé mercredi le « projet d'acquisition » des activités de recherche et développement d'Intel en France, soit 400 salariés répartis sur deux sites, Sophia Antipolis (Alpes-Maritimes) et Toulouse. Les experts d'Intel sont spécialisés sur les logiciels de connectivité et les solutions embarquées. Le logiciel représente aujourd'hui de 15 à 25 % de la valeur d'une voiture, et ce sera plus de 50 % après 2020. Renault doit donc maîtriser cet univers en interne. Pour éviter que la culture software des ingénieurs d'Intel ne soit dissoute dans celle, plus mécanique, de l'Alliance Renault Nissan, les deux sites et leurs écosystèmes seront totalement préservés. Au final, l'opération vient renforcer significativement le poids de la R&D de Renault en France, qui compte à ce jour environ 6.000 ingénieurs. @CDucruet Suivre @CDucruet Ailleurs sur le web Commentaires Tous droits réservés - Les Echos 2017 Suivez nous Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Newsletter Service Client Abonnement Rediffusion Publicité Espace presse Abonnement presse numérique sur epresse.fr Fréquentation certifiée par l'OJD Cookies CGU - CGV Charte éthique Plan du site Election Plan du site Rechercher dans : Tout le texte Le titre Le titre et le chapô Auteur Limiter la recherche sur : Toutes les sources Les Echos Investir Dépêches d'agence Enjeux Série Limitée Capital Finance Type de documents : Tous les documents Articles Interviews Dossiers Infographies Blogs Vidéos Sur la période : Du Au 7 derniers jours 30 derniers jours 1 an 2 ans Fermer Bienvenue !

Used with permission Is the Raspberry Pi ready to take over the low-end thin client market? This week, NComputing unveiled the RX-HDX, its second Raspberry Pi based thin client. In addition, ViewSonic announced a software upgrade for the Pi-based SC-T25 thin client that it announced last year. The future of thin clients -- low-cost, remotely managed virtual client computers -- has always been a question mark. On one hand, dropping PC prices and increasing use of multimedia in the enterprise has slowed the demand for bare-bones thin clients. Yet, improvements in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology and the ongoing need to cut maintenance, support, and operating costs have kept the market alive. Cheap PCs have may have put the brakes on thin clients in recent years, but a rebound seems likely. The arrival of more affordable and power efficient embedded computers -- and the Raspberry Pi in particular -- is helping to drive down prices and restore thin clients’ edge over standalone PCs. Early last year, Citrix, one of the major virtualization software providers for thin clients, along with VMware and Microsoft, jumpstarted the Pi thin client market by partnering with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Broadcom, ThinLinx, and others to bring its Citrix HDX remote display protocol to the Raspberry Pi. The H264-ready Citrix HDX technology, which is available with Citrix’s XenDesktop virtual desktop and XenApp virtual application software, is an extension of Citrix’s earlier ICA protocol. It adds intelligent redirection, adaptive compression, and data de-duplication to boost performance, especially in multimedia. Citrix HDX is implemented partially via a custom version of a SoC -- in this case the Broadcom BCM43437 -- that enables compute-intensive HDX algorithms to execute on the CPU. Yet, HDX avoids device obsolescence by not “burning the remoting protocol into silicon,” says Citrix. Last year, Citrix announced a Raspberry Pi 3 based Citrix HDX Ready Pi mini-PC reference design with preconfigured HDX support for XenDesktop and XenApp. The device’s Linux-based HDX SoC Receiver SDK enables hardware acceleration on the quad-core Broadcom SoC, as well as off-loading to the VideoCore IV GPU. The device offers device management for firmware updates, remote configuration, and DHCP tagging for plug and play deployment. It can automatically connect to Citrix’s StoreFront enterprise app store like higher-end Citrix clients. The Citrix HDX Ready Pi ships with a version of ThinLinx’s TLXOS. This Raspbian spin-off, which supports VMware Horizon Blast Extreme and Microsoft RDP/RemoteFX protocols as well as Citrix HDX, also provides a virtual client and management stack that can manage both x86 and ARM devices at once. The TLXOS client runs on Intel’s NUCs and Compute Sticks in addition to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3. ViewSonic  SC-T25 and NComputing RX-HDX Last July, ViewSonic released a version of the Citrix HDX Ready Pi as the $89 SC-T25. This week, ViewSonic announced that the SC-T25 now offers the Linux-based NoTouch OS from Stratodesk, another Citrix HDX collaborator. NoTouch OS provides the SC-T25 with new features like Skype for Business support, as well as single sign-on and dual monitor support. Also this week, NComputing unveiled its own $119, Citrix HDX compliant RX-HDX thin client. The product is also based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi technology, but features a different design borrowed from NComputing’s $99, Raspberry Pi 3-based RX300 thin client, announced in March. The RX300 hosts images provided by its own Windows-based vSpace Pro 10 platform, and is aimed more at the educational and small business markets where NComputing is among the leaders. The new RX-HDX, meanwhile, should boost its prospects in the enterprise market. Due to ship in July, NComputing’s RX-HDX features dual monitor support and a sleep mode button. There’s also a Pi Management Console (PMC) and web-based device management for up to 10,000 RX devices. The RX-HDX runs on less than 5W, and offers Raspberry Pi 3 features such as 1GB RAM, WiFi and Bluetooth, and 4x USB ports with full USB redirection. There’s also a Kensington lock, an optional VESA mount, and a sealed, internal 8GB microSD card. Even at the $119 level, the Citrix HDX Ready Pi systems are competitive with DIY solutions. A homegrown thin client system with a $10 TXLOS build and a typical Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit and keyboard and mouse bundle can be had for about $100 without the display. Initially, Citrix listed Micro Center as a Citrix HDX Ready Pi partner, but no longer. The computer retailer still offers a PowerSpec Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit that is billed as a zero thin client with “Citrix Receiver for Linux and a fully licensed ThinLinX TLXOS RPi OS on 8GB microSD.” The system sells for only $50, discounted from $80. Although it appears to be based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi, Micro Center does not promote the connection. Unlike ViewSonic and Micro Center, which are newcomers to thin clients, NComputing was ranked number three in the market at 10.2 percent, according to a March 2016 IDC report. The report also noted that NComputing was one of the fastest growing thin client vendors after fourth place Centerm of China. The 2015 thin client market slumped due to competition from low-cost computers such as Chromebooks. However, IDC projected the market would return to steady growth through 2019 when it expects sales of 6.4 million units, up from 5.1 million in 2015. This week’s reaffirmation by NComputing and ViewSonic of their Raspberry Pi experiments suggests that thin client market leaders Dell and HP, which both saw reduced sales in 2015, might consider similar moves. There are other low-cost, VESA mountable size embedded platforms to build on, but it’s hard to beat the Pi 3 for its platform ecosystem. Its price/performance is pretty darn good, as well. “The Raspberry Pi is renowned for its innovation, portable size, versatility, and economic viability,” said NComputing CTO Richard Sah in an email Q&A. “With each iteration, the affordable computer has established itself as a robust and reliable device, one increasingly become viable within an enterprise setting. NComputing strives to be the market leader in Pi-based thin clients and will continue to innovate on top of the Pi platform.” Aside from small, and high price/performance, the Raspberry Pi also attracted NComputing with its larger developer base. “With a vast community of developers behind Raspberry Pi, we believe the platform will become more and more popular in different vertical markets,” says Sah. Meanwhile several open source community projects are offering alternatives to TXLOS for DIY Pi-based thin clients. The Raspberry Pi Thin Client project, which now supplies a RPiTC v3 1.12 release, supports Citrix Receiver 13.4.2, VMWare Horizon 4.3, NoMachine 5.2.11, and FreeRDP, among other platforms. There’s also WTware, which offers a client for Windows Remote Desktop Services and Windows Terminal Server. The rise of Raspberry Pi based thin clients could boost the role of ARM thin clients in this very x86-centric market. ARM thin clients have been available for years, and like a fair share of x86 thin clients, they run Linux. Options include the i.MX6-based Atrust T66, Allwinner A20-based Share FL120, and NComputing’s own Cortex-A9 based N500.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Zotac’s new mini PC lineup includes AMD Ryzen, Intel Kaby Lake CPUs and NVIDIA graphics 05/26/2017 at 11:21 AM by Brad Linder 7 Comments Zotac is expanding its line of tiny desktop computers with a whole bunch of new ZBOX mini PCs All of the new ZBOX E-series computers support for NVIDIA GeForce 10 series graphics, but you get a choice of CPU options: some models ship with Intel Kaby Lake chips while others are equipped with AMD Ryzen processors. Zotac’s ZBOX M-series of more mainstream mini computers are also getting an update, as is the company’s eve tinier ZBOX P-Series. Folks looking for something a bit more powerful can also opt for Zotac’s brand new MEK Gaming PC, which is much less compact, but still pretty small for a gaming tower. Zotac ZBOX EN1050K More details should be revealed at Computex next week, but here’s a brief run-down of the new systems: E-series (Magnus Gaming Series) ZBOX EN1050K – Compact desktop with Intel Kaby Lake/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 ZBOX EK5106o – Taller model with Intel Kaby Lake Core i5/NVIDIA GeForce 1060 ZBOX EK71070 – Intel Kaby Lake Core i7/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 ZBOX ER51060 – AMD Ryzen/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 ZBOX ER51070 – AMD Ryzen/NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 M-series ZBOX MI553 – Intel Kaby Lake model (with Thunderbolt 3) ZBOX MA551 – AMD Ryzen model (without TB3) P-Series The Zotac ZBOX PI225 is a fanless mini computer with support for 4K displays. Zotac calls this a “card-sized PC, although it seems to be a bit larger than a typical playing card or business card. But it does seem to have at least two USB Type-C ports and a microSD card slot. There’s also a new ZBOX PI335 model coming, which is expected to look a lot like older P-series models from the company. MEK Gaming PC This new “gaming first” PC features an Intel Kaby Lake Core i7 processor, GeForce GTX 1080 mini graphics, and a “low-profile” CPU cooler. And that’s about all we know for now. via Zotac, Digital Trends and TechReport Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "Zotac’s new mini PC lineup includes AMD Ryzen, Intel Kaby Lake CPUs and NVIDIA graphics" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest CampGareth Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

The mini PC with it’s also interesting since as far as I know the Intel Skull Canyon NUC is the only TB3 mini PC and we need more options in that space.

I really dont like the slowness of Atom or the fan noise/fragility of the Core i series which ultimately requires turning them off/on so they dont break.

(AMD): It’s Do or Die Time for AMD Stock AMD stock slightly favors bulls, but a drop below $10 would change that By Bret Kenwell, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 27, 2017, 1:08 pm EDT     Popular Posts: Is It Time to Bail on Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock?

Recent Posts: BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Is the Next Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). What? Why General Motors Company (GM) Stock Is a Better Buy Than Ford Facebook Inc (FB): Wait for the Pullback, Then Buy FB Stock for the Long Term View All Posts Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on a volatile ride this month. AMD stock came into May hot, up 20%. Shares subsequently lost 24% after AMD missed revenue estimates and reported in-line earnings results. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Those losses were seemingly in the rearview mirror when, in mid-May, rumors of a licensing deal between AMD and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) materialized. No comment from the company and denial from Intel caused those gains to fade though. Moving Forward with Advanced Micro Devices Shares are still down about 19% for the month of May. Despite the decline, Advanced Micro Devices is still up a whopping 184% over the past 12 months. Investors now need to figure out if it’s time to bail on AMD stock or get in on the action. A big part of AMD’s story is execution. Basically, can management deliver? Over the past six quarters, AMD has beaten EPS estimates four times and had in-line results the other two. In that same span, Advanced Micro Devices has beaten revenue estimates five times. Not to get too historical, but AMD didn’t have one beat in either category for the six quarters prior to that period. So, to say management is improving would be an understatement. Analysts expect earnings of 7 cents per share in 2017. It would be a big deal if AMD were to become profitable this year, after four years of losses. Building on that momentum, analysts expect ~330% earnings growth in 2018 to 30 cents per share. This is where management’s execution comes into play. Advanced Micro’s debt picture is another reason for optimism. In June, AMD was carrying $2.24 billion in debt. As of last quarter, that figure stood at just $1.41 billion, a reduction of 37%. Finally, there’s valuation. As AMD works toward profitability, its earnings-based valuation is just okay. But, on a sales-basis, Advanced Micro Devices isn’t too bad. In fact, trading at 2.33x trailing sales is lower than both Intel and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). On a forward sales basis, AMD is also cheaper. Trading AMD Stock AMD gives bullish traders a good opening — albeit, a slight one. Support currently sits at the 200-day moving average, around $10.10. Below that, the stock is pretty iffy. Source: Stockcharts.com That’s good for bulls and bears alike though. Bulls can use this level, or one close to it, as their stop-loss. AMD stock should rally should that level hold, although it could have trouble clearing $12.50. Previously serving as support, this level will now likely act as resistance and give AMD stock limited upside. Make no mistake about it, AMD suffered some big damage when it fell on earnings. But, a run back to $12.50 would represent a 15%-20% return, depending on where investors buy the stock. The Intel-rumor rally gave hope to bullish momentum returning. But, its negative reaction could cause the MACD to turn bearish once more (purple circle). That’s what gives bears some hope. Should the MACD turn bearish — the black line falling below the red line — and the $10 level give way as support, bears will be in control. In that case, there’s no real way to know how much downside could exist. But, one thing would be certain: Bulls would be in trouble. At least in the short-term, then, being long AMD would be painful. In the current case of Advanced Micro Devices, the advantage goes to bulls, for now. But, that will change if AMD stock falls below $10.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Will Himax Technologies Stock Rebound on This Potential Design Win? The company missed estimates but gave investors an encouraging signal that business could soon take off. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 27, 2017 at 12:00PM Himax Technologies' (NASDAQ:HIMX) fiscal 2017 first quarter failed to meet Wall Street's revenue and earnings targets, thanks to lower orders from its augmented reality (AR) and smartphone customers. Nevertheless, shares initially jumped more than 12% after the report as the semiconductor and sensor specialist has potentially landed an important design win with a major smartphone customer. Why Himax can land a spot at Apple As it turns out, Himax has received a large order commitment from an unnamed customer for its wafer-level optics (WLO) sensors. Rumors suggest that this could be Apple as the next iPhone is expected to feature 3D sensing technology, so Cupertino could be tapping Himax to supply the 3D scanners. Image source: Himax Technologies.  Back in March, noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the next iPhone's front camera will come equipped with AR capabilities and advanced facial recognition. What's more, the front camera is also expected to take 3D selfies and scan 3D objects. Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan believes that Himax could become the supplier of choice for Apple given its progress in WLO technology (via Barron's): Today, Intel's RealSense 3D camera has enabled 3D sensing in PC/tablet platforms. Himax's wafer-level optics (WLO) technology can further reduce the size and fit the 3D sensing in smartphones. Now, Himax has been dropping subtle hints regarding the uptake of its WLO products. Earlier this year, the company pointed out that it will spend between $50 million and $55 million to enhance its WLO and liquid-crystals-on-silicon (LCOS) capacity. More specifically, Himax had pointed out that the "WLO technology is adopted by our customers to enable new things such as 3D depth scanning," so it was already preparing for a production ramp to meet an anticipated jump in demand. Now, a design win at Apple has probably encouraged Himax to boost investment in this area. The semiconductor specialist will spend $80 million to build new WLO capacity this year with a major ramp slated to begin in the third quarter. In fact, Himax believes that it will witness "explosive revenue growth" once this technology goes mainstream, and the company is already collaborating with leading OEMs to achieve this goal. Why a place in the iPhone will be big for Himax Himax Technologies has struggled to increase revenue in recent quarters, while its margin has also been on the decline as some of its AR customers have decided to scrap current-generation products. Data by YCharts. A design win for the next iPhone will bring about a much-needed boost to its financials. Chan believes that 20% of Himax revenue will come from 3D sensing products in 2018. Consensus estimates place revenue growth at 14% in fiscal 2018 versus a 6% decline this year. The turnaround makes sense if Apple ends up manufacturing approximately 100 million units of its next-generation smartphone. That will deliver significant top line gains to Himax, and the adoption of its 3D sensing products will also have a positive effect on the bottom line since they carry higher margins.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build Artificial Intelligence smarts iCrowdNewswire – May 27, 2017 A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co (F.N) invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL]. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

High-Def Digest Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming Blu-ray Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Gaming HD Gear Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Blu-ray Ultra HD Games Home News HD Gear News Roundup: Dolby Atmos Laptops, Quantum Dot Tablet, Alexa for DISH DVR, and More HD Gear News Roundup: Dolby Atmos Laptops, Quantum Dot Tablet, Alexa for DISH DVR, and More Posted Fri May 26, 2017 at 10:00 PM PDT by Steven Cohen We've compiled the latest gear news, including new laptops with Dolby Atmos tech, a tablet with quantum dots, and voice control for DISH DVRs.  From product announcements and streaming app updates to general industry news and recent gear trends, keeping up with the latest tech news can be a daunting task. With that in mind, we're here to offer you a roundup of some of the latest gear and consumer electronics news that you may have missed. For this edition, we're covering new Huawei MateBook laptops with Dolby Atmos technology, an Acer tablet with a quantum dot display, the launch of Alexa voice control for the DISH Hopper DVR, the arrival of the Starz app on Samsung Smart TVs, and Screen Innovations' ambient light rejecting tech. So, without further ado, here's a rundown of some of the latest gear and tech news: Huawei Announces New MateBook Laptops with Dolby Atmos Sound Systems Huawei has revealed its new series of MateBook Laptops. The products will feature the world's first Dolby Atmos Sound System with custom speakers and software specially designed for a PC form factor. "Dolby Atmos Sound System is enabling a new level of immersive experiences through PC speakers, extending the reach of Dolby Atmos into the portable realm," said Giles Baker, SVP, Consumer Entertainment Group, Dolby Laboratories. "This innovation is made possible through deep collaboration in both hardware and software engineering, and we are thrilled to partner with Huawei on its new feature-rich set of laptops." The MateBook Dolby Atmos Sound Systems were developed in partnership with Dolby and offer boosted bass, enhanced volume without distortion on speakers and headphones, and a larger range of frequencies. The flagship Huawei MateBook X model will include two motors in each speaker, placed in an upward-firing configuration to direct sound at the listener in a clear and natural way. And beyond Atmos audio, the MateBook X features a 13-inch 2K display, a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. In addition, the Huawei MateBook D will also feature a Dolby Atmos Sound System.  "We are very excited to continue our track record of bringing to market high-end consumer devices with the latest technologies," said Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group. "And what better way to showcase our innovation than working with Dolby, the innovator in sound and imaging technology, to bring the best possible audio experience to our customers." Pricing has not been announced for the new Huawei MateBook laptops with Dolby Atmos, but the MateBook X is expected to hit the market this summer. Sources: Dolby, Engadget Acer Details Iconia Tab 10 Tablet with Quantum Dot Display Acer has announced the latest addition to its tablet lineup. The new Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) has been designed with premium multimedia experiences in mind, and includes quantum dot display technology. The device is powered by quad-core MediaTek processor running Android 7.0 Nougat, and is rated for up to 8 hours of battery life. An Acer-patented subwoofer and four speakers with DTS-HD Premium Sound are integrated as well, along with 802.11ac wireless support. In addition, the 10-inch IPS display features wide-viewing-angles and quantum dot technology. Quantum dot tech places nano-crystals on a film over an LCD display's backlight. The nano-crystals then emit different colors when exposed to light depending on their size, offering a wider color range with higher brightness, deeper saturation, and better accuracy. Pricing and availability for the Iconia Tab 10 (A3-A50) has not been announced yet. Source: Acer DISH Launches Alexa Support for Hopper DVR & Brings DISH Anywhere App to Amazon Fire TV DISH has announced the arrival of Amazon Alexa compatibility for its Hopper 3 and Wally set-top boxes. With Alexa support, users can now control their set-top boxes with voice commands through a paired Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap. "Hopper and Alexa introduce next-level convenience that redefines the way TV fits into our lives," said Niraj Desai, DISH vice president of product management. "Instantly, it's easier to read player stats on your phone while flipping between basketball games; to chop ingredients in the kitchen while rewinding a TV scene you just missed; to snack on popcorn while searching for your favorite film – the list goes on." Broadband-connected Hopper DVRs (all generations) or Wally set-top boxes can now pair directly with an Amazon Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap, adding hands-free Alexa voice control support for navigation, play, pause, fast-forward, rewind, and searches based on channel, title, actor or genre. In addition, universal search functionality works across DISH's live, recorded, and on-demand titles as well as Netflix's library of TV shows and movies. For instance, a customer could simply say "Alexa, tune to AMC" or " Alexa, find Matt Damon movies" to change channels or search for films. Meanwhile, DISH has also announced the launch of its DISH Anywhere app on the Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick. The app lets Hopper customers watch all of their live and recorded content, along with thousands of DISH on-demand titles, from any location on Internet-connected mobile devices, computers, and now through Fire TV devices. "While DISH Anywhere has historically been embraced on mobile devices, users are now getting even more of what they want – their DISH subscription on any TV at no extra cost," said Niraj Desai, DISH vice president of product management. "DISH Anywhere on Fire TV is an excellent value that further brings choice and flexibility to our customers' television experience."

Davao girls shine at Intel Fair in LA | SunStar Skip to main content SunStar DAVAO Mon, June 5, 2017 SunStar DAVAO Home News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment Superbalita Cagayan de Oro Cebu Davao SunStar Cebu Bacolod Baguio Cagayan de Oro Davao Dumaguete Iloilo Manila Pampanga Tacloban Zamboanga Mon, June 5, 2017 Home Local News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment SuperBalita Home / Davao / Weekend / Davao girls shine at Intel Fair in LA Davao girls shine at Intel Fair in LA Time to read 2 minutes Share Print a- a+ Read so far Davao girls shine at Intel Fair in LA Saturday, May 27, 2017 By Liberato F. Ramos CALIFORNIA. Rubeliene Chezka Gloria, Myrelle Angela Colas and Nadine Antonette Obafial from Davao City National High School won the second grand award of US$1,5000 in the plant sciences from the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair held in Los Angeles, California on May 14-19, 2017. THEY proved that the acacia bark extract is an effective organic insecticide against the adult black rice bug. For this outstanding science investigatory project, Rubeliene Chezka Gloria, Myrelle Angela Colas and Nadine Antonette Obafial of the Davao City National High School brought home the second grand award of US$1,5000 in the plant sciences from the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) held in Los Angeles, California on May 14 to 19, 2017. The trio will be in Grade 10 when schools open in June. They will have the next three years until they graduate from senior high school to hone their research skills with new projects that can be of great benefit to the country. They brought honor and pride to their school and country, and they also earned a place in the galaxy. Their names will be given to three asteroids discovered by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Near Earth Asteroid Research Program (LINEAR). The Fernandez, Colas and Obafial asteroids will join the main-belt asteroids previously named after Filipinos under that program: 28439 Miguel Reyes, 11697 Estrella, 12088 Macalintal, 12522 Rara and 13241 Biyo. The first was named after Miguel Arnold Reyes, a grand awardee for his materials and bioengineering project in the 2011 ISEF. The other three were those of awardees in the 2002 ISEF: Allan Noriel Estrella and Jeric Valles Macalintal for their physics team project, Prem Vilas Rara for his microbiology study, and Dr. Josette Biyo for excellence in teaching. The Davao team was part of this year’s ISEF Team Philippines, which included Ricky Dave Mercado of Nabuslot National High School, Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro and Maries Ann Silvestre of Juan R. Liwag Memorial High School, Gapan, Nueva Ecija. ISEF Team Philippines was consolidated from among the top winners in the life and physical sciences competition in the National Science and Technology Fair of the Department of Education held in Tagaytay City in December 2016. The Davao girls extracted their potential insecticide from chipped-off acacia bark. They set up experimental houses with rice plants and black rice bugs. They tested varying concentrations of acacia extract on the bugs for one week to determine which is more effective in killing them. Their coach is Julius Centina. Mercado examined the morphology of agricultural wastes—coconut husk, banana pseudo-stem and sugarcane husk—and he found that coconut husk fibers, which have more diverse microporous cells, have better noise and hear reduction properties. He competed in the environmental engineering category. Silvestre investigated the neuro-protective potential of coconut leaf extract using a transgenic worm in a search of a cure for Alzheimer’s Disease and Inclusion Body Myositis. The study competed in biochemistry. The Department of Education is looking at the victory of the young scientists from Davao National High School as an inspiration for the students who will pursue their science research plans as soon as the schools open in June. This year, around 1,800 finalists from 78 countries, regions and territories were in the ISEF in Los Angeles to vie for grand prizes in twenty categories. From the best of each category, the three ‘bests of the best’ went home with the Dudley E. Moore award of $75,000 and the two runners-up, Intel Foundation Young Scientist awardees, winning $50,000 each. Top winner Ivo Zell from Germany got the Moore award for his design of a small flying wing based on a bell-shaped lift distribution. Runner-ups Amber Young from Florida worked on a technique to predict the orbits of space junk circling the earth, and Valerio Pagliarino from Italy addressed how to get internet service to remote areas by using lasers to transmit signals between large high-voltage power transmission towers.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Much to Sean Hannity’s dismay, Fox News issued a long-awaited retraction on Tuesday of a story involving slain Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer Seth Rich pushed heavily by the host. Naturally, Hannity hit back via Twitter, slamming liberal watchdog Media Matters for America for trying to get him fired. IMPORTANT! Mediamatters is trying to silence me, get me fired, pressure my advertising on radio & TV. Liberal Fascism. I need your help!! — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) May 23, 2017 “In case you haven’t been following it, the Seth Rich conspiracy holds that before his death (or, in this version of events, assassination) in July Mr. Rich had been involved in the leaking of Clinton campaign emails to WikiLeaks, which the United States intelligence community has attributed to Russian-sponsored hackers,” The New York Times summed up on Wednesday, just before Hannity lost his first advertiser amid fallout. But Media Matters and others have been debunking Hannity’s fake news for years. Here are 5 of his more baseless theories: 1. CIA framed Russia for hacking the DNC Fox News reported on Russia’s hacking the DNC as well as the January 6 Intel report. Yet, less than 48 hours after a Wikileaks dump of the Vault 7 documents (March 7), Hannity began citing Breitbart’s reporting of the scoop: “WikiLeaks: CIA Uses ‘Stolen’ Malware To ‘Attribute’ Cyberattacks To Nations Like Russia.” The Fox News host was joined on his show by retired 9/11-truther and torture proponent Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Schaffer. “Sean, we did it. Not me, but our guys, former members of NSA, retired intelligence officers used these tools to break in there and get the information out. That’s what the Democrats don’t want to talk about because it doesn’t fit their narrative,” Shaffer said. “You’re telling me this whole Russian story that the media has been running with for months and months and months — that it was our people that did it, and they put the fingerprints of the Russians on it?” Hannity asked. “That’s right,” Shaffer said, although he then admitted on-air he had no proof. 2. Hillary’s Health As Media Matters noted, Hannity perpetuated the rumor of  Hillary Clinton failing heath weeks after it was debunked. 3. Benghazi  “During the attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times, and we needed, you know, permission from the Libyans to actually save Americans, and that’s what they were discussing,” Hannity said, shortly after the GOP’s report on the 2012 attack, was released on June 28, 2016. Politifact rated Hannity’s comment mostly false. 4. Obamacare “Average Americans are feeling the pain of Obamacare and the healthcare overhaul train wreck,” Hannity announced in an  October 2013 episode. “and six of them are here tonight to tell us their stories.” One week later, Salon reporter Eric Stern had tracked down all six guests, proving their Obamacare misnomers were easily debunked. 5. Voter Fraud Hannity continues to cite Philadelphia’s overwhelming preference for Barack Obama over Mitt Romney in 2012 as proof of voter fraud. “In 59 separate precincts in inner city Philadelphia, Mitt Romney did not get a single vote! Not one!” he reiterated last August, nearly four years later. “Maybe I’m being conspiratorial,” he added. to which CNN’s Brian Stelter. answered, “Yes, Hannity, you are.” Essay: Trump is sowing doubt about the legitimacy of the election. It’s dangerous. Press has a duty to challenge him https://t.co/V6CCyZIfdF — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 7, 2016 Additionally, Fact.check.org has considered this an open-shut case as of January 2013. “It’s not mathematically impossible,” Lori Robertson wrote. “The 59 districts are in areas of the city that are mainly African American, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

The ball rolls around the side of the arena with everyone chasing it, and when it passes a goalmouth occasionally it flukes in. I don’t get the appeal.

Having all entrys on a single page (or a few pages in case of the really long ones) would be so much better. Must be an advertisement thing. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 17:35 theallmightybob says: Its honestly not what I’ve come to expect from this site, its just a little surprising. I understand it likely is to improve the article to advert ratio, but its annoying as hell to do to a list… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:20 April March says: I doubt it’s an advertising thing, because it doesn’t reload the page between slides, so they aren’t getting additional views. That or I’m really dumb about how it works. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:37 Rack says: They’re almost certainly working on the back end so it will get extra impressions. Just the content was available before the tech was. No-one WANTS the content to be harder to access and less portable. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:06 Chaoslord AJ says: Maybe it’s for mobile devices like all the horizontal videos over the web lately? Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:07 Fomorian1988 says: I suspect any lo-fi indie game will run on most laptops. VA-11 HALL-A, Papers Please, the Cube Escape games, any game by Kitty Horrorshow, Oxenfree, Sunless Sea… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:54 Barts says: Oxenfree actually run like crap on integrated graphic cards. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely game, but I bought based on your assumption and had to postpone playing until I get a decent rig. So I’m sharing this here so that noone else makes the same mistake. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:19 nottorp says: Just stay away from indies made in Unity – even if they look lo fi, at the least they’ll put your laptop in screaming vacuum cleaner mode. Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:14 CelticPixel says: My laptop’s bust at the moment, so I’m doing all my gaming on a Surface Pro 4. Eve Online looks and runs great on it and Killing Floor 2 is surprisingly playable at the lowest settings, with the odd bit of slowdown.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:41 GeoX says: Seriously, you take the trouble to make this list, and then you include 2-D indie games that it’s transparently obvious would run well on any computer? What value did you think you were creating by putting something like that into the world, exactly?

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list. Rocket League and League of Legends. I am surprised at some of these picks, like Prey and Elder Scroll Online, I thought you need an amazing PC to run these. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:22 torkan217 says: An older workstation at much lower price will get you decent specs, especially cpu’s like the qm line which perform on par with some modern cpus in the passmark tests. I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS. Call Of juarez Gunslinger, 1080p, 30-45, avg settings MGSV Phantom Pain, 30+, low/med settings, 1280×720, still looks really good MGS Ground Zeroes, 30, low settings, 1280×720, constant weather hurts it somewhat Fallout New Vegas Utlimate, 1080p, 35+, low/med settings Company of Heroes 1, 1080p, med settings, 35+ Dirt 3, med/high, 1080p, 30+ always WRC 4, med, 1080p, 30+ Infra, med 1080p, 30-40 Grid, med/high, 1080p, 35+ Need For Speed Hot Pursuit/NFS 11, 1600×900, 35+, med Skyrim, low/med, 1080p, 30+ Resident Evil REvelations, low/med, 1600×900, 40fps+ Deus Ex HR, low/med, 1600×900, 35+ Witcher 3, ultra low preset mod file, ~30 FPS, 1280×720 Arkham City, 1600×900, 35+, low/medium Fallout 4 was in the less than 20fps lowest settings, unplayable NierA, less than 20fps lowest, unplayable Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:34 left1000 says: dead cells should not be on this list. although it looks like it doesn’t require a fancy gpu, and I’m sure it doesn’t. It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:30 poliovaccine says: As an owner of a terrible laptop, longtime lover of the immersive sim (since way before we had that term, i.e. back when Deus Ex looked like Deus Ex), and someone who’d previously ogled at Prey but felt forlornly resigned to spend the next year or so admiring it on others’ rigs from afar, I can safely say I care not an ass! That was some exciting news to me. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:58 Barts says: I played these on my Dell Latitude E7250 and I highly recommend them: Darkest Dungeon Sunless Sea Invisible Inc.

Speeds them way up and gives them a charming retro feel. How did that old quote go? “640×480 ought to be enough pixels for anybody.” Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:25 Chaoslord AJ says: Prey is the only entry that surprised me. Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

Log in to Reply 28/05/2017 at 17:59 Nixitur says: A recent game that I really like is Cosmic Star Heroine. To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier. Log in to Reply 28/05/2017 at 18:05 Nixitur says: Somehow messed up the link there and ran out of editing time. That was supposed to be Downwell, must have messed up a closing bracket. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:25 poliovaccine says: Donno if it’s been said here already, or if this is too late for anyone to even read it, but upon discovering it works, I’m too excited not to share myself: Resident Evil 7! On a terrible laptop with an integrated Intel HD gfx card! Gotta whack down the resolution but it damn well plays! I had longed for that game but never thought my system might be able to handle it, so wrote it off til an upgrade. But then I found it has a demo – demo works a trick. Proceeding to get the full thing! Woop! Never would’ve thought to try, if not for Prey being in this list. Gotta thank RPS (again) for that one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

PHOTO: AFP A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. The next revolution: artificial intelligence Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Toyota to use Nvidia’s AI technology for self-driving cars Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

Is the Raspberry Pi ready to take over the low-end thin client market? This week, NComputing unveiled the RX-HDX, its second Raspberry Pi based thin client. In addition, ViewSonic announced a software upgrade for the Pi-based SC-T25 thin client that it announced last year. The future of thin clients — low-cost, remotely managed virtual client computers — has always been a question mark. On one hand, dropping PC prices and increasing use of multimedia in the enterprise has slowed the demand for bare-bones thin clients. Yet, improvements in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) technology and the ongoing need to cut maintenance, support, and operating costs have kept the market alive. NComputing’s RX-HDX (left) and Citrix HDX Ready Pi (click images to enlarge) Cheap PCs have may have put the brakes on thin clients in recent years, but a rebound seems likely. The arrival of more affordable and power efficient embedded computers — and the Raspberry Pi in particular — is helping to drive down prices and restore thin clients’ edge over standalone PCs. Early last year, Citrix, one of the major virtualization software providers for thin clients, along with VMware and Microsoft, jumpstarted the Pi thin client market by partnering with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Broadcom, ThinLinx, and others to bring its Citrix HDX remote display protocol to the Raspberry Pi. The H264-ready Citrix HDX technology, which is available with Citrix’s XenDesktop virtual desktop and XenApp virtual application software, is an extension of Citrix’s earlier ICA protocol. It adds intelligent redirection, adaptive compression, and data de-duplication to boost performance, especially in multimedia. Citrix HDX is implemented partially via a custom version of a SoC — in this case the Broadcom BCM43437 — that enables compute-intensive HDX algorithms to execute on the CPU. Yet, HDX avoids device obsolescence by not “burning the remoting protocol into silicon,” says Citrix. Last year, Citrix announced a Raspberry Pi 3 based Citrix HDX Ready Pi mini-PC reference design with preconfigured HDX support for XenDesktop and XenApp. The device’s Linux-based HDX SoC Receiver SDK enables hardware acceleration on the quad-core Broadcom SoC, as well as off-loading to the VideoCore IV GPU. The device offers device management for firmware updates, remote configuration, and DHCP tagging for plug and play deployment. It can automatically connect to Citrix’s StoreFront enterprise app store like higher-end Citrix clients. The Citrix HDX Ready Pi ships with a version of ThinLinx’s TLXOS. This Raspbian spin-off, which supports VMware Horizon Blast Extreme and Microsoft RDP/RemoteFX protocols as well as Citrix HDX, also provides a virtual client and management stack that can manage both x86 and ARM devices at once. The TLXOS client runs on Intel’s NUCs and Compute Sticks in addition to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3.   ViewSonic SC-T25 and NComputing RX-HDX Last July, ViewSonic released a version of the Citrix HDX Ready Pi as the $89 SC-T25. This week, ViewSonic announced that the SC-T25 now offers the Linux-based NoTouch OS from Stratodesk, another Citrix HDX collaborator. NoTouch OS provides the SC-T25 with new features like Skype for Business support, as well as single sign-on and dual monitor support. ViewSonic SC-T25, front and back (click images to enlarge) Also this week, NComputing unveiled its own $119, Citrix HDX compliant RX-HDX thin client. The product is also based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi technology, but features a different design borrowed from NComputing’s $99, Raspberry Pi 3-based RX300 thin client, announced in March. The RX300 hosts images provided by its own Windows-based vSpace Pro 10 platform, and is aimed more at the educational and small business markets where NComputing is among the leaders. The new RX-HDX, meanwhile, should boost its prospects in the enterprise market. Due to ship in July, NComputing’s RX-HDX features dual monitor support and a sleep mode button. There’s also a Pi Management Console (PMC) and web-based device management for up to 10,000 RX devices. The RX-HDX runs on less than 5W, and offers Raspberry Pi 3 features such as 1GB RAM, WiFi and Bluetooth, and 4x USB ports with full USB redirection. There’s also a Kensington lock, an optional VESA mount, and a sealed, internal 8GB microSD card. NComputing RX300 alone (left) and with monitor, mouse and keyboard (click images to enlarge) Even at the $119 level, the Citrix HDX Ready Pi systems are competitive with DIY solutions. A homegrown thin client system with a $10 TXLOS build and a typical Raspberry Pi 3 starter kit and keyboard and mouse bundle can be had for about $100 without the display. Initially, Citrix listed Micro Center as a Citrix HDX Ready Pi partner, but no longer. The computer retailer still offers a PowerSpec Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit that is billed as a zero thin client with “Citrix Receiver for Linux and a fully licensed ThinLinX TLXOS RPi OS on 8GB microSD.” The system sells with for only $50, discounted from $80. Although it appears to be based on the Citrix HDX Ready Pi, Micro Center does not promote the connection. Unlike ViewSonic and Micro Center, which are newcomers to thin clients, NComputing was ranked number three in the market at 10.2 percent, according to a Mar. 2016 IDC report. The report also noted that NComputing was onee of the fastest growing thin client vendors after fourth place Centerm of China. The 2015 thin client market slumped due to competition from low-cost computers such as Chromebooks. However, IDC projected the market would return to steady growth through 2019 when it expects sales of 6.4 million units, up from 5.1 million in 2015. This week’s reaffirmation by NComputing and ViewSonic of their Raspberry Pi experiments suggests that thin client market leaders Dell and HP, which both saw reduced sales in 2015, might consider similar moves. There are other low-cost, VESA mountable size embedded platforms to build on, but it’s hard to beat the Pi 3 for its platform ecosystem. Its price/performance is pretty darn good, as well. Raspberry Pi 3 “The Raspberry Pi is renowned for its innovation, portable size, versatility, and economic viability,” said NComputing CTO Richard Sah in an email Q&A. “With each iteration, the affordable computer has established itself as a robust and reliable device, one increasingly become viable within an enterprise setting. NComputing strives to be the market leader in Pi-based thin clients and will continue to innovate on top of the Pi platform.” Aside from small, and high price/performance, the Raspberry Pi also attracted NComputing with its larger developer base. “With a vast community of developers behind Raspberry Pi, we believe the platform will become more and more popular in different vertical markets,” said Sah. Meanwhile several open source community projects are offering alternatives to TXLOS for DIY Pi-based thin clients. The Raspberry Pi Thin Client project, which now supplies a RPiTC v3 1.12 release, supports Citrix Receiver 13.4.2, VMWare Horizon 4.3, NoMachine 5.2.11, and FreeRDP, among other platforms. There’s also WTware, which offers a client for Windows Remote Desktop Services and Windows Terminal Server. The rise of Raspberry Pi based thin clients could boost the role of ARM thin clients in this very x86-centric market. ARM thin clients have been available for years, and like a fair share of x86 thin clients, they run Linux. Options include the i.MX6-based Atrust T66, Allwinner A20-based Share FL120, and NComputing’s own Cortex-A9 based N500. This article is copyright © 2017 Linux.com and was originally published here.

It has a Dolby Atmos audio system and its power button doubles as a fingerprint reader. The Bad The US price is still not confirmed, configuration options are limited and it lacks a touchscreen. The Bottom Line The thin, light and fast Matebook X is a tempting MacBook alternative for Windows 10 fans. Visit manufacturer site for details. Review Sections Review User Reviews CNET Computers Laptops Huawei Matebook X First generation devices usually lack finesse and style, or at least still have a lot of rough edges, but not the Huawei Matebook X. As the first clamshell laptop manufactured by Huawei, the Matebook X looks like a Macbook Pro running Windows 10 ($119.99 at Dell Home). The 13-inch fanless notebook has Intel's latest-generation processor, a crazy-sharp 2K screen and a fancy power button that doubles as a fingerprint reader. It has the chic design and high-end trimmings that any premium laptop needs. All it's missing, for now, is an official price. That's right, Hauwei gave us a Matebook X to test, but the company is not yet announcing how much this new slim laptop is going to cost in the US. Several configurations of it will be available in Europe for between €1,399 and €1,699, but it may be closer to the expected summer ship date before we have prices and configuration options for other markets. The review unit we tested had an Intel i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD. Macbook design, Windows heart. Josh Miller/CNET How much it costs in comparison to the MacBook Pro, as well as the bevy of Windows alternatives such as the new Microsoft Surface Laptop ($999.00 at Amazon.com), will determine if Huawei's first clamshell laptop will convince laptop shoppers to try this new-to-them brand. We'll update this review with further benchmark results and a final rating when these worldwide price and availability questions are answered. Svelte city Luxury doesn't boast. Luxury just is. The Huawei Matebook X is a perfect example. The laptop's matte, metallic aluminum construction oozes style, and it feels as premium as it looks. Similar to the Huawei Mate 9 phone, the Matebook X's elegantly inconspicuous power button doubles as a Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader. The power button doubles as a fingerprint reader. Josh Miller/CNET Available in gold, grey and pink, the Matebook X's dimensions are thinner and it weighs less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Its 12.5 mm thick and weighs 2.31 pounds, while the comparable MacBook Pro is 15 mm thick and weighs about 3.02 pounds. (The 12-inch MacBook, which uses lower-power Intel Core M processors, is 13 mm thick and weighs 2.03 pounds.) There is a striking resemblance between the two high-end laptops. That's a big compliment. If the TouchBar-less version of the MacBook Pro is the "Retina MacBook Air" you've always wanted, the Matebook X is the Windows 10 version you never knew you needed. Fashionably thin. Josh Miller/CNET Sounds great The Matebook X is the first laptop to feature Dolby's Atmos sound system. (This is different from devices that simply have Dolby Atmos software technology that only optimizes sound via headphones). Using integrated software and hardware solutions for superior sound quality, it emulates the way sound travels in real life for an immersive viewing experience. The speakers are located above the keyboard. Josh Miller/CNET Dolby collaborated with Huawei to help design the speakers, as well as the preloaded software that optimizes the sound for movies, music or gaming. The speakers sound satisfyingly full and loud. Dialogue is clear, background and soundscape noises are fittingly accentuated and sound travels up and down the speakers for a movie theater-like experience. At maximum volume they don't sound tinny, though highs can get a little screechy when maxed out. I was usually able to find a happy medium. Laptops don't have a high bar for sound quality. It's nice to see (and hear) Huawei putting in some effort.

As Information Age points out, Enhancing E-commerce, calculating valuations, inventory management and of course enabling driverless cars are among the many uses of artificial intelligence. With this in mind, which tech stocks should investors buy to cash in on this trend? Source: ©iStock.com/carloscastilla Although Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) now appears to be the prime beneficiary of the machine learning aspect of artificial intelligence, Nvidia stock has soared over 200% in the last year and likely already reflects a great deal of revenue from AI. Consequently, investors should wait for a better entry point before buying Nvidia stock. But four other tech stocks Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Delphi Automotive PLC (NYSE:DLPH),  Visteon Corp (NYSE:VC), and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) — are definitely poised to get a meaningful boost from AI and should be bought at current levels. The first three companies have significant exposure to technology that enables self-driving cars. That technology is not only poised to proliferate in cars, but could very well potentially spread to other mobile systems, i.e., drones and robots. Obviously, both drones and robots could be used to carry out a plethora of highly useful functions. As a result, companies that provide the technology that enables autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile systems should do quite well over the longer-term. 10 Dividend Stocks That Will Deliver Double-Digit Returns Every Year Additionally, Intel has a number of products and upcoming products that should generate strong, needle-moving revenue for the company as AI becomes more widespread. Baidu has spent a great deal of money on AI. Moreover, the company should benefit from the superior data it has on Chinese consumers and from the tremendous size and growth of the Chinese market.

Given that history, it only seemed natural for me to take on the task of helping you, our faithful reader, learn how to create your own Hackintosh. I’m currently in the process of doing just that with an HP Z2 G3 Mini, but more on that later. For now, here are the five best motherboards to choose from if you want to start creating a Hackintosh. Any good Hackintosh has to start with a great motherboard, such as this Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1 A Few Preliminary Notes First, why is creating a Hackintosh worthy of detailed hardware discussions? The main reason is that Cupertino does a reasonably good job of trying to ensure its operating system only runs on Apple hardware. I say “reasonably good job” because there are ways around the constraints built into OS X and macOS. Second, you will need to understand that this is a moving target. As Apple releases new hardware, it adds support for certain devices, while taking away support for older hardware. Because of this, I give you this list with an important caveat: it’s prone to change over the years. This list consists of the most compatible motherboards as of May 2017. It’s also worth noting that some of these motherboards won’t support resolutions higher than 1080p at 60hz. Intel, AMD, and nVidia graphics resolutions higher than that will require a DisplayPort connection, but nVidia 9XX cards with HDMI or DisplayPort will support displays to 4K resolution at 60hz. On to the List of Motherboards Good for Creating a Hackintosh These motherboards are all considered to be easily adaptable to running macOS Sierra. That means the built-in chipsets work, with some modification or custom drivers, under macOS Sierra. While I have my own preferences as far as form factor, I’ve tried to make this list inclusive of many different motherboard and case sizes. ATX Form Factor Motherboards Gigabyte’s GA-Z170XP-SLI motherboard is a great choice for the ATX form factor If you opt for an ATX form factor, such as in a medium- to large-sized tower or desktop case, your best option is the Gigabyte GA-Z170XP-SLI motherboard. It boasts an LGA1151 CPU socket, and supports sixth generation Intel Core processors. This motherboard has plenty of PCI-Express expansion slots for building a monster of a Hackintosh. It has built-in gigabyte Ethernet supported by macOS, along with an excellent on-board audio chipset that also works wonderfully in Sierra. The only drawback to this motherboard is that the onboard graphics only supports HDMI, but we will be providing you with a list of much better graphics cards in an upcoming article. The Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1 is another fantastic ATX motherboard for creating a Hackintosh Another excellent choice for an ATX motherboard is the Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1. This mobo has an LGA1151 CPU socket with support for sixth-generation Intel Core processors, and is ready for USB-C, M.2 SATA and SSD drives, and more than enough RAM to keep your Hackintosh running smoothly. It’s expandable, has integrated Intel HD graphics with HDMI and DisplayPort ports, and has gigabit Ethernet support. The Realtek ALC1150 audio chipset supports up to 7.1-channel surround sound, and the system board has plenty of USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, and USB-C ports. Everything is macOS Sierra-friendly.

You covered all of the main pain points about making MacOS work on other than Apple hardware. The Network, WiFi, and Sound hardware are the biggest headaches in choosing a motherboard. I would love it if you expanded the information into a table showing what hardware drivers to use for each, and if the built in WiFi / Bluetooth on these boards work. When I did my last two Hacks, that was the most interesting part to get working. Love the series so far and want to see where you go with video cards. –Rick– May 26, 2017 at 4:09 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 26, 2017 Thanks, Rick! I’ll definitely consider that kind of a table 🙂 I agree, after graphics, Wi-FI and Bluetooth are the biggest challenges. Very little support out there, especially if you want to use an M.2 card for your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. May 26, 2017 at 4:12 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Fantastic article Jeff. Have you come across any motherboards that support Xeons? May 26, 2017 at 4:18 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 With regard to the wifi/Bluetooth, I bet you can buy the part from eBay straight from an iMac. I bought such a part and upgraded my 5,1 cheese grater Mac Pro to the latest Bluetooth and 802.11ac May 26, 2017 at 4:22 EDT PM Rick Allen May 26, 2017 @John – Yes, I did end up buying the Mini PCI/E cards off of eBay that had the proper Broadcom chipsets. In my Mac Pro 5.1 I have TP-Link AC Wifi card. Also working on flashing a Titan X 12 gig card to go into it. May 26, 2017 at 4:28 EDT PM John Kheit May 26, 2017 Nice job Rick! The titan is a beast. Does the fan kick up running it? May 26, 2017 at 4:38 EDT PM emlitu May 27, 2017 Thank you for a great article. Would it be possible to select a motherboard that supports Thunderbolt 3. I know you mentioned the ones that support USB 3.1 but that does not mean they are TB3 as well. Thanks so much. May 27, 2017 at 4:56 EDT PM Jeff Butts May 28, 2017 I’ll do some more digging, emlitu, but Thunderbolt 3 support is slim for Hackintosh. If I find anything, I’ll let you know 🙂 May 28, 2017 at 10:36 EDT AM Jeff Butts May 28, 2017 @John and @Rick: Mini PCI/E cards are fairly easy to come by for Hackintosh setups. Cards that use the M.2 slots on many modern mobos, no so much so. I’m still working on that, and it’s going to make for an interesting Wi-Fi article a few episodes down the road =) May 28, 2017 at 10:37 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Posted 26 May 2017 Kyle R. ConwayFeed 22up 13 comments Image by :  opensource.com Have you ever heard someone say, "It's impossible to do X with Linux"? Me too. This is the story of how I busted the myths about open source in my own head and used Linux to finish my PhD in fine arts. Many people think non-technical students can't use Linux, and they make a lot of assumptions about people who use it in their advanced degree programs. They scoff and reply with something along the lines of, "Well, of course; those people do 'computer stuff,' but in my [lofty, important, unique area] it's just not possible." Well, it is possible, and I'm proof. Here are some of the many (misguided) reasons I've heard people use to argue why Linux can't work in higher ed: Real world: Linux/open source is not what I'll/they'll need or use in the real world. Tool over task: I have to use [special program] in [specific field]. Special knowledge: Sure, it works for you because you understand computers. Change is hard: Open source is just different/another thing to learn. I know how to use [Windows/Mac/Chrome]. Lack of integration: It just won't run/do [specific application / task]. While all of these things hold a grain of truth, usually the objections come because they're underexplored or misplaced. How I discovered Linux I grew up using Windows, learning Microsoft Office, and believing that I should use them because well, honestly, I didn't think about tools because that was just what everyone else used. Eventually, I bought a PowerPC Mac Mini, only to discover mere months later that Apple was switching to Intel processors and my desktop would eventually be unsupported. (A shoutout to Debian for keeping the Mac Mini running and useful well into 2017.) Being newly married and entering graduate school 1,000 miles away from family made me extremely price sensitive. I also had a growing interest in free/libre software, having been swayed by the ethical arguments and the strong communities, plus I like having alternatives that aren't necessarily driven by a profit motive (and if they are—and if things go wrong—they can be forked). Learning that GIMP was this thing called "free and open source software" opened a new world to me. Suddenly I saw open source software everywhere, even in things I was already using, and I reached out for other options like OpenOffice, Firefox, and Audacity. That brought me to something entirely new to me: free and open source operating systems. I read with interest and suspicion. Eventually, Ubuntu's Wubi install (a familiar-feeling .exe file) won me over because it allowed me to choose whether to boot into Ubuntu or Windows. I found myself using Windows Vista less and less, until one day my Wubi install wasn't an option anymore. It had disappeared. The community came through for me, and I learned how to use Windows' cmd.exe to restore my folder, boot back into Ubuntu, and rescue my files. That day I wiped my drive and installed Ubuntu as my sole OS. To this day, I've never met another Linux user in the flesh. The tools shouldn't matter Language works against you when you're an open source student in a closed-source world. Instructors will tell you to turn in your paper as a Word document (with specific formatting guidelines and instructions for the version of Word that's on their computer) or insist that you give a PowerPoint presentation. They're likely well-meaning people who are unaware of the alternatives. You'll have to educate them. At the end of the day, they're not teaching you software, they're teaching you concepts and ideas. In my fine arts PhD program, I was ultimately being judged on how effectively I employed the concepts of narrative structure or negative space, so it shouldn't (and didn't) really matter if I put the words into LibreOffice or the pixels into GIMP; what I said with those words and how I arranged the pixels are what was most important. How I found the right solutions Still, finding the right open source tools was somewhat of a trial-and-error process. While you can use LibreOffice Impress for presentations, I saw so many PowerPoint-style presentation mishaps that I started to use PDFs when presenting. Every computer and every OS will display them, and they always work―no glitches. At the beginning, I designed in LibreOffice Impress and printed to PDF, but eventually, I started hand-designing my own slides in Inkscape for pixel-perfect presentations. Now there are tons of cool, open source presentation software available. For example, Sozi is an amazing tool that creates what most people know as Prezi-style presentations. I greatly prefer it, as you can dance around your .svg files from Inkscape and infinitely zoom without loss. Here's a quick, incomplete example of something I did for the Fedora Project about the process of becoming a contributor. Perhaps the most essential tool in my area of study is playwriting software. There are important reasons for standard formatting in plays, such as allowing a quick way to assess a play's length (i.e., how long will this play be?) by page number that is common across all scripts. Professional playwrights tend to use the closed source Final Draft for formatting, and the old, rebellious writers use Microsoft Word with painful, manual manipulations. Since neither of those met my demands, I googled a bit and found Celtx. This cross-platform desktop application worked beautifully. It turned out that no one could tell I didn't use Final Draft, and I was even able to help other writers use Celtx on their own computers. You'd probably be surprised how many of my fellow students had Windows but not Microsoft Word. I introduced them to OpenOffice (and later LibreOffice) and even created some custom formats and keyboard shortcuts to make quick work of formatting play scripts in those apps in real time. When I was writing scripts as part of my dissertation project, I moved to Emacs for writing and LaTeX for processing PDFs because why not? The words are what matter most, the format matters next, the software matters not at all. Since then there have been even more interesting developments. Screenwriter John August found the joy of open-format text files and developed a markdown-like plain-text conversion system called Fountain. Apps (many open source) can be created to leverage this format. Busting the myths I think educators, students, and others often get lost on the tools at the expense of the thing they're actually doing—teaching and learning new ideas—and that's a mistake. If education is overly focused on teaching you a specific tool, then you could just as easily RTFM and save the expense of a degree. People have legitimate reasons to think they can't use Linux for education, but if you dig just a layer below their initial, knee-jerk assumptions, you'll often find they're built on unsound ground. Remember all those reasons I relayed at the beginning for why people say open source won't work in education? Here are my responses to them. Real world The real world changes so fast that this really isn't a solid argument. I wrote my dissertation on Emacs and Gedit and formatted it in LibreOffice. I work at an organization that runs on Google Apps for Business. In the real world, you're better off being adaptable, and most organizations expect to give you on-the-job training anyway. Start learning to adapt today. Consider it part of your education. Tool over task This is related to No. 1 but has a different focus. The tool (Photoshop, Word, Final Draft) is not what you're actually trying to accomplish (e.g., create a poster for your event, send a memo, write a screenplay). Don't confuse the tool with the task. I was fortunate to team-teach an art course with Dirk Fowler at Texas Tech University. Dirk is a visual artist who has made posters for bands you probably like. He's also a visual artist who doesn't use Photoshop―he doesn't even use computers, rather he uses an antique letterpress. Task > Tool. Special knowledge I "understand" computers (better than most, I guess) because I tried to do things with them that teachers couldn't or wouldn't teach me. Again, start adapting. Don’t let your fear of getting it wrong prevent you from learning something new. There's no cost to start (i.e. free as in beer) and nothing prevents you from learning (i.e. free as in freedom). Wanna know how it works? Read the source, mod the config file, or talk with the dev on IRC. Heck, get a group of users together and code it yourselves or fund its development. You'll gain knowledge by doing, and that knowledge is both specific (to the improvements you identify and the changes you make) as well as general (because whether you know it or not you can affect the tools you use directly if they're free/libre and open source). Change is hard Yes, it is. That's the wrong point to make though. The question isn't whether or not it's hard―it's whether or not it's worth it. When most "normal" users have complaints about their tools they tend to make an incorrect assumption―not that they don't know how to do it (which might be true), or that the tool doesn't do it (which also might be true), but that it simply can't be done. And I can't overstate this point enough: using and being a part of the community that uses open source tools means that the answer the to question "Can X be done?" is always―always―yes. It might not be how you thought of doing it, but there's always a way (and, helpfully, often multiple ways). So if "change is hard" is the mantra you hear, focus on the benefits: Is it worth it? (Note: the answer is always "yes.") Lack of integration Do you need to use [application]? If so, then, by all means, use it. If not, what are you waiting for? And even if you do need to use a certain application for some reason, ask yourself what you're missing by not integrating other tools into your workflow. As an example, Emacs's Org-Mode is amazing. I challenge any writer hooked on Scrivener to watch science writer Jay Dixit's walk through of his customized Org-Mode writing setup and not drool a few times. Then, read an article by Howard Abrams about styling Org-Mode as a word processor so that it looks better for writing. The point is this: There are features out there that you don't even know you're missing. You'd want them if you knew about them. There are people just like you who have already thought these features up, coded them together, and shared them freely. I promise they'll help. Lastly, the biggest lack of integration is that a piece of software is not open source and free/libre. That one omisson means you have anti-integrations (e.g. no export at all for vendor lock-in), and no real ability to get new features added ("it's too hard to maintain, "not enough of our users want it," "we don't integrate with X because they're a competitor"). Every time I even think of using a closed piece of software I run through a list of negatives related to this "lack of integration" that is thrown around―falsely―as a negative of free/libre software. The opposite is true. Can this free/libre software integrate with X? Yes. If like me, you're using open source against the grain in your industry, you've probably heard similar excuses from your colleagues about why it won't work. How do you respond?

Open project collaboration from elementary to university classrooms 13 Comments Don Watkins on 26 May 2017 Permalink Great article. Thanks for the great links to other open source products like Sozi. I'm going to have to explore that more. I too used OpenOffice to write APA styled papers and found that my professors were none the wiser when they didn't know. reply Vote up! 2 Vote down! 0 Kyle R. Conway on 26 May 2017 Permalink Sozi is great. And as someone who has recently needed to use its business-approved alternative, Prezi, it's going to get even more serious looks from designers because Prezi has just released a new version of their product ("next") that severely limits the ability for designers to move around a single, connected freely. reply Vote up! 1 Vote down! 0 Bob Martens on 26 May 2017 Permalink Thanks for the article!

They are not interested in the learning process.

Yes, there are certain things that only work in Windows, but the caveat to that is.....do you NEED that one particular app? For the longest while, when I was still "on the fence" about whether or not I should use Linux or stick with Microsoft, I would read articles about the various software that existed in the open source community, but I was hesitant to "let go" of Adobe Acrobat reader, and Internet Explorer, and Windows Media Player, and (of course!) Microsoft Office. That was....until I finally plunged feet first into Linux,...(my first exposure to it was "gasp"! Fedora Linux!!! I learned a lot of "hard" lessons about Linux and how it works....yes...I've had to re-install the OS countless times due to ignorance on my part regarding certain files that cannot be deleted, or altered!) But after my initial "teething" stage?..I discovered "eVince"...."Firefox & Midori"....and "VLC"....and now?....I can NEVER go back to using Windows, (and don't get me started on the whole Apple ecosystem!..LoL!)...I for one will not only use, but will support Open Source and the many channels they exist in for as long as I use my computers. Not only do I support it, but I try to "spread" it to whomever is willing to be adventurous enough to try it. In some circumstances, it was unavoidable, (my 70+ year old Mum who's Dell laptop "died" in 2014....and who now uses that same laptop with Linux Mint "Cinnamon"....we're in 2017 and that machine has had NO issues!...not even with upgrades!!) also there's my younger brother, my older sister, her husband, their eldest son, various cousins, aunts....uncles, and a few co-workers to boot! I see no reason to NOT be an advocate for Linux and open source. I've gotten through two years of college with LibreOffice and for the life of me I cannot understand why colleges and universities insist on their students using Microsoft Office! But I guess money makes the world go 'round? As for me and anyone I come into contact with...."Expect Linux....Embrace Open Source" is the motto! Great article!! Thanks for sharing! (I wonder if I could use this as a "reference" when pointing someone else towards open source?...of course I'd credit YOU!...LoL! No plagiarism here!!!) reply Vote up! 2 Vote down! 0 Kyle R. Conway on 31 May 2017 Permalink Eddie, Thanks for your comment. Please do feel free to share with others. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Mark Harris on 27 May 2017 Permalink Nailed it. I'm OS-agnostic. I have a few (!) computers including Macs, Windows, and several different Linux laptops. I run LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape on all of them, so it really doesn't matter which one I'm at when I want to edit or create something. I've been doing this for 15 years or more. I output PDFs to people, unless they are really specific about being able to edit the files, then I give them Word97. Gods forbid I plague people with dodgy OOXML files! It. Just. Works. Glad it did for you, too reply Vote up! 2 Vote down! 0 Anonuser on 27 May 2017 Permalink Nice article. I also did my B.S. - I.T. degree completely in Linux and the profs were none the wiser. Programming, web development, online coursework, SQL, networking, etc.....all Linux. For the MCST stuff, I used VMWare to run instances of Win7. reply Vote up! 2 Vote down! 0 Jeff Saxton on 28 May 2017 Permalink Unfortunately, some courses require students to use Windows specific software for that course. In particular, some math courses that my children have taken required them to purchase a Windows only software for the course. There was no alternative because this is how the homework was assigned and done, via the program. Universities are married to Microsoft. I don't know why. It was Microsoft that convinced me to move to Linux when they released Windows 8. reply Vote up! 1 Vote down! 0 Kyle R. Conway on 31 May 2017 Permalink This is true (and terrifying). Math (in particular, accounting) was one of the reasons I ended up writing this article. A relative indicated that using Linux would be impossible (for school) because they needed a special program for accounting. When pressed or features the application did nothing that [GnuCash](https://gnucash.org/) didn't do. Policies like that would have me inquiring (very politely at first) and then finding my own workarounds (if possible) while simultaneously complaining formally. Maybe there is some magical benefit to the software, but odds are good it's not even usefully restrictive. reply Vote up! 1 Vote down! 0 Alanmoore on 29 May 2017 Permalink Don't forget Zotero! :-) reply Vote up! 2 Vote down! 0 Kyle R.

The pen and keyboard cover are also improved, and this is one of the first mobile systems that includes Intel’s latest processors. The bad: Microsoft still refuses to include the Type Cover keyboard with the tablet, forcing a separate purchase. Battery life still isn’t enough for a full day. Latest news videos The cost: $624 to $1,052 The bottom line: A host of small refinements cements the Surface Pro 4’s position as the best-in-class Windows tablet — as long as you’re prepared to pay extra for the required keyboard cover. Lenovo Yoga 910 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: This premium convertible has a gorgeous display that spans nearly the entire lid and delivers solid performance and long battery life for the category. It’s a really cool looking laptop, too. The bad: The right-hand Shift key is poorly placed and sized. Webcam is at the bottom of the screen. No direct video output or SD card slot. Separate USB Type-C ports for power and video-out kill the option for a single connection all-in-one dock. The cost: $1,000 to $1,085 The bottom line: With a beautiful design, excellent performance and battery life, and a great display, the Lenovo is a head-turning hybrid. Apple iPad Pro Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The iPad Pro is the biggest and fastest Apple tablet. The pressure-sensitive Pencil stylus offers superior sketching and drawing, and the Pro’s gorgeous screen and quad speakers are ideal for split-screen apps, multitasking and watching movies. The bad: Few apps are optimized to take advantage of the Pro’s full potential. Its large size makes it less portable than other iPads. Once you’ve paid for the Pencil and keyboard peripherals, the Pro costs as much as a good laptop, but lacks its flexibility. The cost: $600 (32 GB, refurbished) to $799 The bottom line: The iPad Pro is a dream machine for graphic designers and media mavens, but this elegant tablet needs more optimized apps and accessories before it can achieve laptop-killer status. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The Galaxy is an elegantly designed tablet that comes with a capable stylus. It has a stunning screen, fingerprint sensor for extra security and satisfyingly loud quad speakers. It’s also the first HDR-ready tablet. The bad: Despite the hype, HDR content is not available on the tablet yet. Large games take time to load. The keyboard add-on is an expensive extra. The cost: $550 to $600 The bottom line: Samsung packs buzz-worthy features like S Pen and HDR support into the premium Galaxy, but without a keyboard, it’s still more about content consumption than creation.

At least 500 regular employees and as many as 711 would be affected, according to a May 19 letter released by state officials Thursday night: “This employment action is expected to be permanent.” The letter also says the plant could close, painting a considerably more dire picture than the one SolarWorld has presented in the two weeks since its German parent declared itself insolvent. As recently as Wednesday, SolarWorld had said it was operating as usual and ” intends to continue operating into the future,” albeit with an unspecified number of job cuts. SolarWorld sent its May 19 letter in compliance with the 1998 federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires employers to give employees and local communities advance notice of large job cutbacks. It’s not clear why state officials hadn’t disclosed the letter earlier. Previously, they’d said they were expecting a letter from the company but didn’t know when. Like other U.S. solar manufacturers, SolarWorld had been under growing pressure from Chinese competitors the company says are dumping products on the American market. Earlier Thursday, SolarWorld joined a trade case that it hopes could trigger tariffs or other sanctions on Chinese imports. SolarWorld opened its 103-acre Washington County campus in 2008, after spending $440 million to convert an idle computer chip factory for solar production. State and local tax breaks worth $80 million helped underwrite the project. From the start, though, SolarWorld has battled Chinese competition in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels in 2012 and 2014, but they proved insufficient. On May 10, the company’s German parent, SolarWorld AG, announced it could no longer cover its debts and would file for insolvency – which is roughly analogous to corporate bankruptcy in the United States. The pending layoffs may be the largest since last year, when Intel eliminated 784 jobs in Washington County in a massive restructuring. Hundreds or thousands of additional Intel employees in Oregon – Intel won’t say just how many – took buyouts to leave the company as it retooled to prepare for long-term decline in the PC market. Nonetheless, Oregon’s job market is the best it’s been in decades. The state’s unemployment rate stands at 3.7 percent, the lowest since at least 1976. And economists say Oregon is approaching “full employment” – a metric that suggests employers are having increasing trouble filling open positions, but not that every single person who wants a job can find one. Oregon once sought to become a leader in solar manufacturing, pumping tens of millions of dollars in subsidized loans and tax credits at a time into large companies like Sanyo and SolarWorld, as well as smaller outfits with little track record, such as the thin film solar manufacturer SoloPower and polysilicon manufacturer Peak Sun Solar. The strategy has largely flopped. Oregon has 4,509 jobs in the solar industry, according to the most recent census from the Solar Foundation. But only 1,200 of those jobs are in manufacturing, and SolarWorld accounts for two-thirds of them. The solar installation and development business, by contrast, remains fairly strong, and is largely responsible for the 1,500 jobs the industry added in 2016.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

I had longed for that game but never thought my system might be able to handle it, so wrote it off til an upgrade. But then I found it has a demo – demo works a trick.

Acer Spin 1 and Nitro 5 laptops are ready for school season by Eric Born  4:30 PM on May 25, 2017 Parents and students alike might not be ready to hear this, but back-to-school season is a few short months away. That means it's time for notebook manufacturers to update their lineups in anticipation of those end-of-summer sales events. Accordingly, Acer has a new Spin convertible and a lineup of Nitro 5 gaming notebooks to show off at Computex this year—all with affordable price tags. The Spin 1 notebook is a thin-and-light 11.6" convertible notebook with a metal chassis. It weighs only 2.8 lbs (1.24 kg) and is 0.55" thin (14 mm), so it'll slip easily into a backpack or satchel. The touch-enabled IPS display has a resolution of 1920x1080, generally a good fit for a smaller laptop screen. Acer touts how well the notebook pairs up with a stylus and the latest tools in the Windows 10 Creators Update, though we don't know if the laptop comes with a pen. Buyers get to pick one of Intel's "latest" (we presume seventh-generation) Pentium or Celeron processors, and 32, 64, or 128 GB of eMMC storage. The systems pack 4GB of DDR3L memory, and their battery should be good for about eight hours. Peripheral connectivity comes courtesy of a USB 3.1 port and a USB 2.0 connector. There's also an HDMI output and a microSD card slot. For networking purposes, the Spin 1 uses an 802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi adapter. Users who like their notebooks served with a side of gaming might take a peek at Acer's Nitro 5 lineup. Acer equips these 15.6" notebooks with a 1920x1080 display and more horsepower than the lightweight Spin 1 models. Users can get a machine with two combinations: a choice of Kaby Lake Core i7 CPUs paired with GeForce cards up to a GTX 1050 Ti, or an AMD seventh-generation A-series processors coupled with a Radeon RX 550. Acer says the notebooks support up to 32GB of DDR4-2400 RAM. The company doesn't say what's the baseline storage configuration, but notes that buyers have options for PCIe SSDs and an optional HDD as secondary storage. The Nitro 5s come with one USB 3.1 Type-C port, one USB 3.0 connector, two USB 2.0 ports, and an HDMI 2.0 output. Wireless networking comes by way of an 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter with 2x2 MIMO support. The systems are kept cool with two fans that exhaust heat out the back, and have a black-and-red "gamer" style finish. These notebooks will all start selling in July. Pricing for the Spin 1 starts at a remarkably affordable $329, while the Nitro 5 models start at $799.

Ryzen AGESA 1.0.0.6 exposes more memory overclocking options by Jeff Kampman  4:12 PM on May 25, 2017 Over the past couple months, we've come to understand that memory speed and latency plays a major role in Ryzen CPU performance. Higher speeds and lower latencies are desirable for getting the most out of a Ryzen chip. Outside of a few motherboards with external base-clock generators, however, the memory multipliers for Ryzen CPUs have maxed out at 32. With a 100-MHz default base clock, that means builders have been limited to running overclocked RAM at DDR4-3200 speeds. Today, that all changes. AMD has announced that its AMD Generic Encapsulated System Architecture, or AGESA, version 1.0.0.6 will expose 26 new RAM tuning settings to tweakers looking to extract the most from their Ryzen systems' RAM. These updates should bring AM4 motherboards' firmware settings for memory tweaking more on par with that of the Intel competition. Of the wealth of memory overclocking options AGESA 1.0.0.6 will offer, the two most important settings to me are an extended range of memory multipliers (up to 40, or DDR4-4000) and the option to set command rates at one tick or two ticks (1T or 2T). For example, the hot G.Skill DDR4-3866 memory I have here requires a 38.66 multiplier and a 2T command rate, but those settings simply couldn't be dialed in on Ryzen motherboards under the current AGESA (1.0.0.4) without resorting to changes in the base clock that also controls important bus rates like PCI Express. Changing that base clock rate could result in unexpected behavior, so it's a relief that the masses won't have to resort to that approach any longer.  Of course, AMD is quick to point out that using memory speeds above DDR4-2667 or settings not in accordance with JEDEC values is considered overclocking. Overclocking RAM with these new knobs will void a Ryzen CPU's factory warranty, even if you're using the company's Ryzen Master utility. Still, the temptation of performance gains will probably be too much to resist for many Ryzen owners. In news that will be music to the ears of another class of users, AMD also says that AGESA 1.0.0.6 will improve support for PCI Express Access Control Services, or ACS. According to the company, these improvements will allow users who run virtual machines on their Ryzen systems to better manage the assignment of PCIe devices within IOMMU groups. In short, the company says this feature will let VM wizards dedicate multiple graphics cards within a Ryzen system to the operating systems of their choice, whether natively installed or virtual, among other benefits. AMD says motherboard firmware incorporating AGESA 1.0.0.6 will be available starting in "mid-to-late June." The company notes that some motherboard makers have already begun issuing beta firmwares for some products with the new AGESA on board, most notably Gigabyte with its AX370-Gaming 5 and Asus with its Crosshair VI Hero. Folks eager to push Ryzen memory performance to its limits will doubtless welcome this update warmly.   Tags: CPUs Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Zotac previews plenty of petite PCs for Computex 2017 by Zak Killian  3:30 PM on May 25, 2017 Zotac is probably more known for its mini-PCs than its graphics products. The company was doing "NUC-likes" before the NUC existed, and it continues to produce some of the more interesting mini-PCs around. At Computex, Zotac will be showing off no less than nine new takes on the Zbox idea, plus an intriguing gaming machine called MEK. Zotac Zbox EN1050K The E-series is primarily aimed at gamers and enthusiasts who need high performance. Zotac will have five new E-series machines to show off at Computex, including the EN1050K, EK51060, EK71070, ER51060, and the ER51070. The first model, the EN1050K, is externally identical to the Magnus EN1070 we reviewed. We can surmise from the model name that it probably includes a GeForce GTX 1050 or GTX 1050 Ti, but the rest of the hardware is a mystery for now. Zotac Zbox ER51070 The other four E-series machines utilize a taller chassis like that found on the EN1080 Magnus. The extra height gives them room to accommodate a standard desktop graphics card rather than having to rely on mobile-specific hardware. The two "EK" models, EK51060 and EK71070, use Kaby Lake Core i5 and i7 processors respectively. Those CPUs are paired with GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 graphics cards depending on the model. Zotac Zbox ER51070 Meanwhile, the ER51060 and ER51070 are mini-PCs based on AMD's Ryzen processors. Zotac doesn't specify exactly which chips, although it says that the CPUs in question have a 65W TDP rating. Given that fact and the "R5" in the model numbers, we could probably make a fair guess. Besides the different internals, these machines appear to be identical to their Intel-based counterparts. That means you get a desktop-style (Zotac says "full-size") GeForce GTX 1060 or 1070 card. Zotac Zbox MA551 The M-series comprises Zotac's bread-and-butter mini-PCs. Zotac says the M stands for "multi-function", but it could as easily be "mainstream." The company will be bringing two M-series machines to Computex, the MI553 and MA551. These two little computers are nearly identical, except that one uses a Kaby Lake Intel processor, while the other uses a 65W Ryzen CPU. Zotac Zbox MA551 The Intel-powered MI553 comes with Thunderbolt 3 support, although it loses an HDMI port versus its Ryzen cousin for the privilege. Meanwhile, the Ryzen-based MA551 has a whole bunch of video connections. That leaves us wondering if it includes a discrete graphics card in some form, or if it will be based on an as-yet unannounced Ryzen-based APU. We're as eager to know as you are. Zotac Zbox PI225 The smallest of Zotac's mini-PCs are the Zbox P-series, formerly known as Zbox Pico. The company calls these its smallest Zboxes yet. The info sheet refers to the PI225 as "card-sized," and while the machine appears to be a a little too big for that moniker, it's doesn't appear to be larger than a typical smartphone. Zotac PR says the passively-cooled pocket PC is "4K display ready." Another fanless pocket PC, the PI335, will also be debuting at Computex. That model is thicker and closer to what we've seen from previous Zbox P-series models. Zotac Gaming MEK Finally, there's the MEK Gaming PC. While this machine doesn't exactly qualify as "mini PC," it's nonetheless interesting. The MEK is Zotac's first product from its new Zotac Gaming brand. The machine appears to be a more-or-less standard Mini-ITX gaming PC. The company didn't say much about what kind of internals will be available in the, but given its expertise with cramming hardware into micro machines, we have high expectations for the MEK's firepower.

U.S. Geological Survey Among the many vital infrastructure improvements that a new proposed federal budget ignores is one that could mean the difference between life or death for residents up and down the West Coast: A revised budget would eliminate the nearly $10 million per year which had, until recently, been allocated for the development of an earthquake early warning system. Seismologists have been working for over a decade on an earthquake early warning system that could be deployed across the Western U.S. In fact, a prototype also being tested as an app for smartphones has been developed right here in Southern California by scientists at Caltech and USGS, in partnership with other institutions. But an estimated $38 million is still needed to install the network of sensors at a density needed to properly report quakes and get the system up and running. Early warning systems that have become widely adopted in countries like Japan and Mexico have been credited with not only saving lives but saving cities money as officials have time to shut down transit systems, factories, and power plants, avoiding crucial damage. In San Francisco, for example, the BART rail system already uses the early warning data to stop or slow trains when a tremor is reported, averting derailments. An early warning system could give Angelenos up to 30 seconds notice to prepare for a large earthquake USGS In 2016, Congress allocated $10 million for the early warning system, with some additional funds coming from private donors like Intel. Then the state of California kicked in an additional $10 million that year to help speed the early warning system towards reality, announcing that it could be ready as soon as 2018. But without federal dollars it will be difficult to keep the research momentum going on the project, says Dr. Lucy Jones, the former city seismologist for Los Angeles and founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Society. “Eliminating the $10 million per year that the government has been spending would stop the program and waste the $23 million that has already been invested,” she says. “The talented scientists and technicians that are working on the project now will go to other jobs, so their experience and expertise would be lost.” Caltech and USGS are working on a smartphone app for the early warning system. Art Center College of Design and Foxio Mayor Eric Garcetti also chimed in about the importance of the early warning system for Los Angeles, which he says has already invested millions in the project. “The President’s proposal to eliminate funding for the West Coast’s earthquake early warning system is an abandonment of his duty to protect Americans, and I trust that our representatives in Congress will have the wisdom to reject a plan that could cost lives,” he said in a statement. It’s true that Congress still has to approve the budget, but it isn’t necessarily only California representatives that should be advocating for better earthquake protection. A 2015 USGS survey showed that 143 million Americans—about half the country—live in places where they could experience potentially damaging earthquakes. That’s a number that’s growing due to population shifting towards these areas. And although the Pacific Rim region of the country is most at risk for a large earthquake, it’s not just a West Coast thing anymore. With tremors due to fracking also on the rise in places like Oklahoma, which are not located in traditionally seismic zones, the early warning system could be potentially used in more places across the country.

Did Michael Flynn Lobby for the Turkish Government?

Kevin DrumMay 26, 2017 2:27 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Last year, Michael Flynn received half a million dollars as part of a contract with the Inovo Group, headed by Ekim Alptekin, the chairman of the Turkey-US Business Council. Was this legit? Or is Inovo just a front for the Turkish government? David Corn investigates: The paperwork Flynn filed with the government is confusing. Some of the records note that his company, the Flynn Intel Group, was hired to compile opposition research on Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania whom the Turkish government claims helped orchestrate an unsuccessful coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last summer....It was through his contract with Inovo that Flynn ended up in a September 19 meeting set up by Alptekin at the Essex House hotel in New York City with Turkish government officials, where reportedly the participants considered kidnapping Gulen. (A Flynn spokesman insisted Flynn had not discussed any illegal actions, and Alptekin has denied there was any talk of abducting Gulen at this gathering.) OK. But there's also this: An attachment to the filing, citing an American law firm representing Alptekin, says that "Inovo represented a private sector company in Israel that sought to export natural gas to Turkey".... In March, Alptekin told one reporter that he had hired Flynn "principally to produce geopolitical analysis on Turkey and the region" for a "regional energy company that is considering an investment in Turkey." Digging up dirt on Gulen doesn't sound like something a private consulting group would be interested in. It sounds like something the Turkish government would be interested in. This is all the more mysterious because we don't know who was funding Flynn's work: In an interview with a Dutch newspaper in April, Alptekin said the funds for the Flynn project came from a loan from his wife and payments from Ratio Oil Exploration, an Israeli natural gas company. It seems unlikely that an Israeli oil company would have much interest in Michael Flynn's assessment of the potential market in Turkey for Israeli natural gas—especially since the oil company in question flatly denies that it has any connection with Alptekin at all. And it seems even more unlikely that Alptekin's wife would have any interest in this. So was Flynn actually acting as an agent of the Turkish government, with the money being thinly laundered through Alptekin? Or was it, as both Flynn and Alptekin claim, really all about Alptekin's belief that Flynn had keen insights to offer regarding geopolitical analysis of Turkey and the region? We report, you decide.

A prototype of the earthquake early warning system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. (Rick Loomis/Los Angeles Times) Trump wants to cut funding for earthquake warning system Fri May 26th, 2017 10:46am News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Rong-Gong Lin II / Los Angeles Times LOS ANGELES — President Donald Trump’s budget would eliminate federal funding for an earthquake early warning system being developed for California and the rest of the West Coast, which if enacted would likely kill the long-planned effort. The budget proposal for the year ending in September 2018 also seeks to eliminate U.S. funding for critical tsunami-monitoring stations in oceans and reduce funds for a next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists said the loss of federal funding would derail the early warning system, which officials hope would one day send public earthquake alerts to smartphones seconds or even minutes before a temblor. “It probably would kill the early warning system if we thought there were no more funding coming from the U.S. Geological Survey,” said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a seismology professor at the University of Washington. “The money we’ve received is essential,” he said. In a statement announcing the USGS budget, the Department of the Interior said the budget “focuses on core USGS science and efficiency,” and asserted that the budget would be able to fund monitoring of the nation’s earthquakes. But the budget document posted on the U.S. Department of Interior’s website did not elaborate on the reason for cutting the alert system, saying only: “This elimination would end USGS efforts to implement the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system.” The earthquake early warning system, being built by the USGS in conjunction with several major universities, still needs more seismic sensors installed across Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and it needs a staff of 40 to 50 people to install and maintain equipment as well as monitor the computer systems. Already, hiring has proved difficult. Since Trump was inaugurated, new hires for the network have not been approved. “There are people we’ve identified and interviewed and we’d like to hire them as soon as we have permission,” Vidale said. “These are the people who would keep the computer doing what we need to to get the early warning system up and operating.” Without ongoing funding, the ShakeAlert system would need to lay off employees, said Tom Heaton, a California Institute of Technology professor of engineering seismology. “If that funding went away, we would have to lay off a number of the developers and the development would basically cease,” Heaton said. “I’m not sure how we could possibly recover from that.” Such a blow would likely cause Heaton, who said he is nearing retirement, to work on other issues. “I’ve been kind of excited at the possibility we’ll have a system up and running by the time my career was done. That hope would be dashed in that case,” Heaton said. Companies have been seeking to use the system Companies have started to notice the potential benefits of an earthquake early warning system. Intel, for example, “is very eager to use early warning to make their manufacturing safer,” Vidale said. Computer companies can use seconds of warning before shaking comes to halt sensitive manufacturing processes — preventing equipment from clanging together and being damaged in the shaking. That would enable factories to resume operations much faster after the earthquake. And factories using toxic chemicals can prevent problems by securing operations before shaking arrives, too, Vidale said. And just telling people that shaking is coming so that they can drop, cover and hold on could save lives and reduce injuries. “This is a simple technology. We know how to do it,” Vidale said. “Even Mongolia is doing it.” The budget proposal would also reduce $800,000 in funding for earthquake monitoring in Alaska and the central and eastern United States, where earthquakes are a risk on the East Coast, in the South and in the Midwest. The reduction may “slow the rate of updates to seismic provisions in building codes and provide less science to support risk mitigation actions. The USGS would also suspend its annual forecast of hazard related to both natural and induced seismicity.” An additional $561,000 would be cut under the proposal from earthquake hazards operations, diminishing the government’s ability to monitor and report on earthquakes, assess earthquake hazards, and send earthquake results to emergency responders, the budget document said. Congressional response A champion of the earthquake early warning system, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it would be foolish to end it. “After years of educating the public and Congress to the benefits of the earthquake early warning system, we have been able to deliver $23.4 million in federal funding to help build out an early warning system across the West Coast,” Schiff said in a statement. “But we cannot stop now, just as monitoring stations are being built out and the system is expanding its reach. Support for the early warning system in Congress is sustained, growing and bipartisan, and we will not accept this attempt by the president to cut a vital funding stream for a program that will protect life, property and critical infrastructure,” Schiff said. A spokesman for Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who serves on the House appropriations committee, said late Thursday that the congressman was on a plane and could not be immediately reached to comment on the proposal to end funding for the earthquake early warning system. He referred to an earlier statement on the overall budget, which said: “The budget also proposes some reductions for agencies that fall within the Interior Subcommittee’s jurisdiction. Those agencies perform important work, so the members of our committee will be faced with making some difficult decisions.” U.S. far behind other nations The United States is far behind other nations in developing an earthquake early warning system. In Japan, for instance, national TV broadcasts and cellphones are interrupted with warnings about incoming shaking, and for significant quakes high-speed trains automatically slow down, as slower speeds reduce the threat of a deadly derailment. “All of Japanese society is very happy for their early warning system. Nobody in Japan really wants to turn it off. They view it as a great step ahead for them. Californians will, too,” Heaton said. In the last few years, lawmakers in Washington and in Sacramento have started to devote significant dollars to developing the system. In fact, the budget deal reached in Congress for the current budget year that ends in September penciled in $10.2 million for the system, which represented an increase from the previous year’s $8.2 million for the system. The system needs about $16.1 million a year in yearly operating and maintenance costs, and $38.2 million to build it. How the early warnings work The earthquake early warning system works on a simple principle: The shaking from an earthquake travels at about the speed of sound through rock — slower than the speed of today’s communications systems. That means it would take more than a minute for, say, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that starts at the Salton Sea to shake up Los Angeles, 150 miles away, traveling on the state’s longest fault, the San Andreas. The prototype system has had some early successes. When a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014, the system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. Last year, 30 seconds of warning reached downtown L.A. before the ground shook from a magnitude 4.4 quake centered near Banning. As the system gets built, officials have talked about allowing places such as classrooms, offices, shopping malls, amusement parks and police and fire stations to have ready access to alerts. Eventually, bigger benefits are expected: technology to open elevators at the next floor, sparing occupants from being trapped, and warnings that could halt the flow of natural gas through major pipelines, preventing catastrophic fires. Tsunami sensing stations could lose all funding The proposed budget also affects other agencies monitoring natural disasters. The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, faces eliminating funding — $12 million — that pays for a critical network of buoys in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The network can sense an incoming tsunami, enabling officials to send watches and warnings for the United States. This is known as the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis, or DART. A budget document said that the termination of the program “is anticipated to have a 20 percent or greater impact on the accuracy, certainty, and timeliness of NOAA’s tsunami watches and warnings.” The DART buoys are essential for telling local authorities whether the public needs to be evacuated from the coast, Vidale said. “Those DART buoys are our eyes out in the sea for incoming tsunamis from distant earthquakes.” “The zeroing out of the DART buoys is just startling,” said University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor Cliff Mass. The agency is also facing a proposed reduction of funding for a network of automated weather stations that can indicate rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, called Mesonet. That means NOAA won’t be able to monitor these conditions in all 50 states, but will have to “prioritize states most susceptible to tornadoes and severe weather.” The budget also proposes reducing funding for an array of sensors in the ocean designed to detect El Nino, which officials said may delay the recognition of the onset of phenomenon, and hamper the ability to deal with its effects, such as heavy rain or drought. Slowing program to improve weather forecasts The budget proposal also would slow down the development of the National Weather Service’s next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists and officials have been pushing for a major upgrade to the weather service’s forecasting system, which is well behind European modeling systems, Mass said. That flaw was seen in Hurricane Sandy as it struck New York, in which U.S. forecasting was far inferior to European forecast models, he said. “What they’re proposing to do is cutting a large amount of money out, which would delay it at best and kill it at worst,” Mass said. “If you look at the statistics for virtually any place in the country, you’ll see the American model is well behind.”   Most Read Neighbors worried about development next to former Everett dump EVERETT — Two groups of homeowners are asking the Snohomish County hearing… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Noah Haglund 2 charged after scuffle over stolen meat and a stab in the eye MARYSVILLE — A Snohomish woman was indignant that a grocery store manager… Jun 3rd, 2017 by Diana Hefley Anchor Pub hosts nontraditional church services once a month EVERETT — Their beliefs are traditional, but not much else.

13:04 ET Share this article CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., May 26, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The University of Virginia Darden School of Business has announced the launch of the Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative, an ambitious new project spearheaded by Darden's Batten Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation aimed at exploring how business innovation can be a source for pragmatic solutions to one of the world's most urgent issues. The initiative, which is made possible by a generous gift from an anonymous donor, launched with a kickoff event on 22 May in Rosslyn, Virginia. As part of the kick-off, Professor Mike Lenox, author of the forthcoming book, Will Business Save the Earth: Innovating Our Way to Sustainability, led a discussion with thought leaders in the field, including: Kevin Fay, an internationally recognized specialist on environmental and energy issues, and vice chairman and CEO of Alcalde & Fay; John Mandyck, chief sustainability officer at United Technologies Corp. and chair of the corporate advisory board of the World Green Building Council; and Stephen Harper, global director of environment and energy policy at Intel Corp. Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century, and the initiative recognizes that the ability to rise to meet the challenge will require substantive and disruptive innovation across a broad spectrum of sectors, as well as a concerted resolve from business and government leaders. This Washington, D.C.-based initiative marks a bold commitment to address an issue of vital interest to both business and society, and will include leadership education, stakeholder events, applied research and nonpartisan analysis. "Darden's mission is to improve the world by developing responsible leaders and advancing knowledge, and business innovation to tackle climate change offers a great opportunity for business leaders to help improve the world," said Dean Scott Beardsley. "This initiative is a chance for Darden students, faculty and corporate partners to join with colleagues across the University to lead the way in how business reimagines itself in order to solve one of the most significant and singular challenges facing society." The School has already made sustainability a priority, and it aims to be a carbon-neutral enterprise by 2020. In 2016, Darden and UVA entered into a solar power partnership with Dominion Energy in which the School and University will purchase all of the output produced at a new 160-acre solar facility in rural Virginia. The new initiative's work will be led by Lenox, Erika Herz, director of research and intellectual capital at Darden's Batten Institute, and a team of experienced scholars, educators and professionals. It will also leverage Darden's growing presence in the Washington, D.C. area, to involve policymakers, congressional staffers, regulators and think tanks. "We believe that Darden is uniquely positioned to actively engage key stakeholders — especially the business community — in order to advance innovative outcomes," said Lenox. "Over the course of the next two years, we will create actionable insights to positively impact the policy environment and help advance progress around clean energy and climate change." Specific outcomes of the Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative will include: A biannual Sustainability Innovators' Roundtable bringing together a group of senior executives from diverse industries to address issues related to climate change and other environmental challenges. Briefings published following the roundtables will represent key vehicles for engaging corporate stakeholders and bridging the gap between sustainability offices and the government. A multi-day innovation summit in Washington, D.C., that will bring together corporate and nonprofit leaders, policy experts, academics, federal regulators and the media for in-depth dialogue and a workshop that will inform a "policy playbook" that will encourage innovation in the energy industry. A leadership academy, modeled on the University of Virginia's successful Emerging Leaders Program, aimed at educating policy makers and influencers, and advancing a meaningful dialogue about business innovation and climate change among a rising generation of policy makers, executives and thought leaders. A fellows program, providing the opportunity for UVA students to spend meaningful time in a congressional office and help bridge the human capital gap on clean energy policy. The Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative will also produce additional research and host events on an ongoing basis.   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uva-darden-launches-business-innovation-and-climate-change-initiative-300464667.html SOURCE Darden School of Business 16 Nov, 2016, 12:00 ET Preview: Reitor da Darden School of Business chega ao Brasil em busca de novos mercados My News Release contains wide tables.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman UVA Darden Launches Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., May 26, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The University of Virginia Darden School of Business has announced the launch of the Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative, an ambitious new project spearheaded by Darden's Batten Institute for Entrepreneurship and Innovation aimed at exploring how business innovation can be a source for pragmatic solutions to one of the world's most urgent issues. The initiative, which is made possible by a generous gift from an anonymous donor, launched with a kickoff event on 22 May in Rosslyn, Virginia. As part of the kick-off, Professor Mike Lenox, author of the forthcoming book, Will Business Save the Earth: Innovating Our Way to Sustainability, led a discussion with thought leaders in the field, including: Kevin Fay, an internationally recognized specialist on environmental and energy issues, and vice chairman and CEO of Alcalde & Fay; John Mandyck, chief sustainability officer at United Technologies Corp. and chair of the corporate advisory board of the World Green Building Council; and Stephen Harper, global director of environment and energy policy at Intel Corp. Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century, and the initiative recognizes that the ability to rise to meet the challenge will require substantive and disruptive innovation across a broad spectrum of sectors, as well as a concerted resolve from business and government leaders. This Washington, D.C.-based initiative marks a bold commitment to address an issue of vital interest to both business and society, and will include leadership education, stakeholder events, applied research and nonpartisan analysis. "Darden's mission is to improve the world by developing responsible leaders and advancing knowledge, and business innovation to tackle climate change offers a great opportunity for business leaders to help improve the world," said Dean Scott Beardsley. "This initiative is a chance for Darden students, faculty and corporate partners to join with colleagues across the University to lead the way in how business reimagines itself in order to solve one of the most significant and singular challenges facing society." The School has already made sustainability a priority, and it aims to be a carbon-neutral enterprise by 2020. In 2016, Darden and UVA entered into a solar power partnership with Dominion Energy in which the School and University will purchase all of the output produced at a new 160-acre solar facility in rural Virginia. The new initiative's work will be led by Lenox, Erika Herz, director of research and intellectual capital at Darden's Batten Institute, and a team of experienced scholars, educators and professionals. It will also leverage Darden's growing presence in the Washington, D.C. area, to involve policymakers, congressional staffers, regulators and think tanks. "We believe that Darden is uniquely positioned to actively engage key stakeholders — especially the business community — in order to advance innovative outcomes," said Lenox. "Over the course of the next two years, we will create actionable insights to positively impact the policy environment and help advance progress around clean energy and climate change." Specific outcomes of the Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative will include: A biannual Sustainability Innovators' Roundtable bringing together a group of senior executives from diverse industries to address issues related to climate change and other environmental challenges. Briefings published following the roundtables will represent key vehicles for engaging corporate stakeholders and bridging the gap between sustainability offices and the government. A multi-day innovation summit in Washington, D.C., that will bring together corporate and nonprofit leaders, policy experts, academics, federal regulators and the media for in-depth dialogue and a workshop that will inform a "policy playbook" that will encourage innovation in the energy industry. A leadership academy, modeled on the University of Virginia's successful Emerging Leaders Program, aimed at educating policy makers and influencers, and advancing a meaningful dialogue about business innovation and climate change among a rising generation of policy makers, executives and thought leaders. A fellows program, providing the opportunity for UVA students to spend meaningful time in a congressional office and help bridge the human capital gap on clean energy policy. The Business Innovation and Climate Change Initiative will also produce additional research and host events on an ongoing basis.   SOURCE Darden School of Business CategoriesUncategorized TagsCorporate Social Responsibility, Education, Environmental Products & Services, Higher Education Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Rev.

MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Justice and Public Safety Trump Wants to Cut Funding for California’s Earthquake Early Warning System Scientists say the loss of federal funding would derail the early warning system, which officials hope would one day send alerts to smartphones seconds or even minutes before a temblor. by Rong-Gong Lin II, Los Angeles Times / May 26, 2017 A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014. A prototype of the earthquake early warning system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. (Rick Loomis/Los Angeles Times/TNS) (TNS) — President Donald Trump’s budget would eliminate federal funding for an earthquake early warning system being developed for California and the rest of the West Coast, which if enacted would likely kill the long-planned effort. The budget proposal for the year ending in September 2018 also seeks to eliminate U.S. funding for critical tsunami-monitoring stations in oceans and reduce funds for a next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists said the loss of federal funding would derail the early warning system, which officials hope would one day send public earthquake alerts to smartphones seconds or even minutes before a temblor. “It probably would kill the early warning system if we thought there were no more funding coming from the U.S. Geological Survey,” said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a seismology professor at the University of Washington. “The money we’ve received is essential,” he said. In a statement announcing the USGS budget, the Department of the Interior said the budget “focuses on core USGS science and efficiency,” and asserted that the budget would be able to fund monitoring of the nation’s earthquakes. But the budget document posted on the U.S. Department of Interior’s website did not elaborate on the reason for cutting the alert system, saying only: “This elimination would end USGS efforts to implement the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system.” The earthquake early warning system, being built by the USGS in conjunction with several major universities, still needs more seismic sensors installed across Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and it needs a staff of 40 to 50 people to install and maintain equipment as well as monitor the computer systems. Already, hiring has proved difficult. Since Trump was inaugurated, new hires for the network have not been approved. “There are people we’ve identified and interviewed and we’d like to hire them as soon as we have permission,” Vidale said. “These are the people who would keep the computer doing what we need to to get the early warning system up and operating.” Without ongoing funding, the ShakeAlert system would need to lay off employees, said Tom Heaton, a California Institute of Technology professor of engineering seismology. “If that funding went away, we would have to lay off a number of the developers and the development would basically cease,” Heaton said. “I’m not sure how we could possibly recover from that.” Such a blow would likely cause Heaton, who said he is nearing retirement, to work on other issues. “I’ve been kind of excited at the possibility we’ll have a system up and running by the time my career was done. That hope would be dashed in that case,” Heaton said. Companies Have Been Seeking to Use The System Companies have started to notice the potential benefits of an earthquake early warning system. Intel, for example, “is very eager to use early warning to make their manufacturing safer,” Vidale said. Computer companies can use seconds of warning before shaking comes to halt sensitive manufacturing processes — preventing equipment from clanging together and being damaged in the shaking. That would enable factories to resume operations much faster after the earthquake. And factories using toxic chemicals can prevent problems by securing operations before shaking arrives, too, Vidale said. And just telling people that shaking is coming so that they can drop, cover and hold on could save lives and reduce injuries. “This is a simple technology. We know how to do it,” Vidale said. “Even Mongolia is doing it.” The budget proposal would also reduce $800,000 in funding for earthquake monitoring in Alaska and the central and eastern United States, where earthquakes are a risk on the East Coast, in the South and in the Midwest. The reduction may “slow the rate of updates to seismic provisions in building codes and provide less science to support risk mitigation actions. The USGS would also suspend its annual forecast of hazard related to both natural and induced seismicity.” An additional $561,000 would be cut under the proposal from earthquake hazards operations, diminishing the government’s ability to monitor and report on earthquakes, assess earthquake hazards, and send earthquake results to emergency responders, the budget document said. Congressional Response A champion of the earthquake early warning system, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it would be foolish to end it. “After years of educating the public and Congress to the benefits of the earthquake early warning system, we have been able to deliver $23.4 million in federal funding to help build out an early warning system across the West Coast,” Schiff said in a statement. “But we cannot stop now, just as monitoring stations are being built out and the system is expanding its reach. Support for the early warning system in Congress is sustained, growing and bipartisan, and we will not accept this attempt by the president to cut a vital funding stream for a program that will protect life, property and critical infrastructure,” Schiff said. A spokesman for Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who serves on the House appropriations committee, said late Thursday that the congressman was on a plane and could not be immediately reached to comment on the proposal to end funding for the earthquake early warning system. He referred to an earlier statement on the overall budget, which said: “The budget also proposes some reductions for agencies that fall within the Interior Subcommittee’s jurisdiction. Those agencies perform important work, so the members of our committee will be faced with making some difficult decisions.” U.S. Far Behind Other Nations RELATEDCalifornia to Start Limited Public Rollout of Earthquake Early Warning Alerts by 2018Earthquake Warning System Extends to Washington The United States is far behind other nations in developing an earthquake early warning system. In Japan, for instance, national TV broadcasts and cellphones are interrupted with warnings about incoming shaking, and for significant quakes high-speed trains automatically slow down, as slower speeds reduce the threat of a deadly derailment. “All of Japanese society is very happy for their early warning system. Nobody in Japan really wants to turn it off. They view it as a great step ahead for them. Californians will, too,” Heaton said. In the last few years, lawmakers in Washington and in Sacramento have started to devote significant dollars to developing the system. In fact, the budget deal reached in Congress for the current budget year that ends in September penciled in $10.2 million for the system, which represented an increase from the previous year’s $8.2 million for the system. The system needs about $16.1 million a year in yearly operating and maintenance costs, and $38.2 million to build it. How the Early Warnings Work The earthquake early warning system works on a simple principle: The shaking from an earthquake travels at about the speed of sound through rock — slower than the speed of today’s communications systems. That means it would take more than a minute for, say, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that starts at the Salton Sea to shake up Los Angeles, 150 miles away, traveling on the state’s longest fault, the San Andreas. The prototype system has had some early successes. When a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014, the system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. Last year, 30 seconds of warning reached downtown L.A. before the ground shook from a magnitude 4.4 quake centered near Banning. As the system gets built, officials have talked about allowing places such as classrooms, offices, shopping malls, amusement parks and police and fire stations to have ready access to alerts. Eventually, bigger benefits are expected: technology to open elevators at the next floor, sparing occupants from being trapped, and warnings that could halt the flow of natural gas through major pipelines, preventing catastrophic fires. Tsunami Sensing Stations Could Lose All Funding The proposed budget also affects other agencies monitoring natural disasters. The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, faces eliminating funding — $12 million — that pays for a critical network of buoys in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The network can sense an incoming tsunami, enabling officials to send watches and warnings for the United States. This is known as the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis, or DART. A budget document said that the termination of the program “is anticipated to have a 20 percent or greater impact on the accuracy, certainty, and timeliness of NOAA’s tsunami watches and warnings.” The DART buoys are essential for telling local authorities whether the public needs to be evacuated from the coast, Vidale said. “Those DART buoys are our eyes out in the sea for incoming tsunamis from distant earthquakes.” “The zeroing out of the DART buoys is just startling,” said University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor Cliff Mass. The agency is also facing a proposed reduction of funding for a network of automated weather stations that can indicate rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, called Mesonet. That means NOAA won’t be able to monitor these conditions in all 50 states, but will have to “prioritize states most susceptible to tornadoes and severe weather.” The budget also proposes reducing funding for an array of sensors in the ocean designed to detect El Nino, which officials said may delay the recognition of the onset of phenomenon, and hamper the ability to deal with its effects, such as heavy rain or drought. Slowing Program to Improve Weather Forecasts The budget proposal also would slow down the development of the National Weather Service’s next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists and officials have been pushing for a major upgrade to the weather service’s forecasting system, which is well behind European modeling systems, Mass said. That flaw was seen in Hurricane Sandy as it struck New York, in which U.S. forecasting was far inferior to European forecast models, he said. “What they’re proposing to do is cutting a large amount of money out, which would delay it at best and kill it at worst,” Mass said. “If you look at the statistics for virtually any place in the country, you’ll see the American model is well behind.” ©2017 Los Angeles Times.

The budget proposal for the year ending in September 2018 also seeks to eliminate U.S. funding for critical tsunami-monitoring stations in oceans and reduce funds for a next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists said the loss of federal funding would derail the early warning system, which officials hope would one day send public earthquake alerts to smartphones seconds or even minutes before a temblor. Quake early-warning system comes to Washington, but it's not for the public yet “It probably would kill the early warning system if we thought there were no more funding coming from the U.S. Geological Survey,” said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a seismology professor at the University of Washington. Prepare for an earthquake Earthquakes may be unpredictable — but they are also inevitable. Here are some tips to help you get ready before the next one hits. “The money we’ve received is essential,” he said.

But the budget document posted on the U.S. Department of Interior’s website did not elaborate on the reason for cutting the alert system, saying only: “This elimination would end USGS efforts to implement the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system.” The earthquake early warning system, being built by the USGS in conjunction with several major universities, still needs more seismic sensors installed across Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and it needs a staff of 40 to 50 people to install and maintain equipment as well as monitor the computer systems.

Already, hiring has proved difficult. Since Trump was inaugurated, new hires for the network have not been approved. “There are people we’ve identified and interviewed and we’d like to hire them as soon as we have permission,” Vidale said. “These are the people who would keep the computer doing what we need to to get the early warning system up and operating.” Without ongoing funding, the ShakeAlert system would need to lay off employees, said Tom Heaton, a California Institute of Technology professor of engineering seismology. “If that funding went away, we would have to lay off a number of the developers and the development would basically cease,” Heaton said. “I’m not sure how we could possibly recover from that.” Such a blow would likely cause Heaton, who said he is nearing retirement, to work on other issues. “I’ve been kind of excited at the possibility we’ll have a system up and running by the time my career was done. That hope would be dashed in that case,” Heaton said. Companies have started to notice the potential benefits of an earthquake early warning system. Intel, for example, “is very eager to use early warning to make their manufacturing safer,” Vidale said. Computer companies can use seconds of warning before shaking comes to halt sensitive manufacturing processes — preventing equipment from clanging together and being damaged in the shaking. That would enable factories to resume operations much faster after the earthquake. And factories using toxic chemicals can prevent problems by securing operations before shaking arrives, too, Vidale said. And just telling people that shaking is coming so that they can drop, cover and hold on could save lives and reduce injuries. “This is a simple technology. We know how to do it,” Vidale said. “Even Mongolia is doing it.” The budget proposal would also reduce $800,000 in funding for earthquake monitoring in Alaska and the central and eastern United States, where earthquakes are a risk on the East Coast, in the South and in the Midwest. The reduction may “slow the rate of updates to seismic provisions in building codes and provide less science to support risk mitigation actions. The USGS would also suspend its annual forecast of hazard related to both natural and induced seismicity.” An additional $561,000 would be cut under the proposal from earthquake hazards operations, diminishing the government’s ability to monitor and report on earthquakes, assess earthquake hazards, and send earthquake results to emergency responders, the budget document said. A champion of the earthquake early warning system, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said it would be foolish to end it. “After years of educating the public and Congress to the benefits of the earthquake early warning system, we have been able to deliver $23.4 million in federal funding to help build out an early warning system across the West Coast,” Schiff said in a statement. “But we cannot stop now, just as monitoring stations are being built out and the system is expanding its reach. Support for the early warning system in Congress is sustained, growing and bipartisan, and we will not accept this attempt by the president to cut a vital funding stream for a program that will protect life, property and critical infrastructure,” Schiff said. A spokesman for Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who serves on the House appropriations committee, said late Thursday that the congressman was on a plane and could not be immediately reached to comment on the proposal to end funding for the earthquake early warning system. He referred to an earlier statement on the overall budget, which said: “The budget also proposes some reductions for agencies that fall within the Interior Subcommittee’s jurisdiction. Those agencies perform important work, so the members of our committee will be faced with making some difficult decisions.” The United States is far behind other nations in developing an earthquake early warning system. In Japan, for instance, national TV broadcasts and cellphones are interrupted with warnings about incoming shaking, and for significant quakes high-speed trains automatically slow down, as slower speeds reduce the threat of a deadly derailment. “All of Japanese society is very happy for their early warning system. Nobody in Japan really wants to turn it off. They view it as a great step ahead for them. Californians will, too,” Heaton said. In the last few years, lawmakers in Washington and in Sacramento have started to devote significant dollars to developing the system. In fact, the budget deal reached in Congress for the current budget year that ends in September penciled in $10.2 million for the system, which represented an increase from the previous year’s $8.2 million for the system. The system needs about $16.1 million a year in yearly operating and maintenance costs, and $38.2 million to build it. The earthquake early warning system works on a simple principle: The shaking from an earthquake travels at about the speed of sound through rock — slower than the speed of today’s communications systems. That means it would take more than a minute for, say, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that starts at the Salton Sea to shake up Los Angeles, 150 miles away, traveling on the state’s longest fault, the San Andreas. The prototype system has had some early successes. When a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014, the system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. Last year, 30 seconds of warning reached downtown L.A. before the ground shook from a magnitude 4.4 quake centered near Banning. As the system gets built, officials have talked about allowing places such as classrooms, offices, shopping malls, amusement parks and police and fire stations to have ready access to alerts. Eventually, bigger benefits are expected: technology to open elevators at the next floor, sparing occupants from being trapped, and warnings that could halt the flow of natural gas through major pipelines, preventing catastrophic fires. The proposed budget also affects other agencies monitoring natural disasters. The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, faces eliminating funding — $12 million — that pays for a critical network of buoys in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The network can sense an incoming tsunami, enabling officials to send watches and warnings for the United States. This is known as the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis, or DART. A budget document said that the termination of the program “is anticipated to have a 20 percent or greater impact on the accuracy, certainty, and timeliness of NOAA’s tsunami watches and warnings.” The DART buoys are essential for telling local authorities whether the public needs to be evacuated from the coast, Vidale said. “Those DART buoys are our eyes out in the sea for incoming tsunamis from distant earthquakes.” “The zeroing out of the DART buoys is just startling,” said University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor Cliff Mass. The agency is also facing a proposed reduction of funding for a network of automated weather stations that can indicate rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, called Mesonet. That means NOAA won’t be able to monitor these conditions in all 50 states, but will have to “prioritize states most susceptible to tornadoes and severe weather.” The budget also proposes reducing funding for an array of sensors in the ocean designed to detect El Nino, which officials said may delay the recognition of the onset of phenomenon, and hamper the ability to deal with its effects, such as heavy rain or drought. The budget proposal also would slow down the development of the National Weather Service’s next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists and officials have been pushing for a major upgrade to the weather service’s forecasting system, which is well behind European modeling systems, Mass said. That flaw was seen in Hurricane Sandy as it struck New York, in which U.S. forecasting was far inferior to European forecast models, he said. “What they’re proposing to do is cutting a large amount of money out, which would delay it at best and kill it at worst,” Mass said. “If you look at the statistics for virtually any place in the country, you’ll see the American model is well behind.” Rong-Gong Lin II Next Story Seattle settles discrimination claim with Mayor Murray’s former press secretary: She gets a six-figure job at City Hall Previous Story Washington state to let whale rot on beach — no dynamite needed Contact Newsroom staff list FAQ Contact form About the company Seattle Restaurant Week Newspapers in Education Fund for the Needy Employment Historical Archives Pulitzers Company information Permissions Seattle Times Store Advertise Classifieds Autos Homes Obituary Jobs Media Kit Advertise with Us Subscriber Services Subscribe Activate Account Manage Subscription Place Temporary Hold Report Delivery Issue Make a Payment Print Replica Today’s Front Page Facebook Twitter RSS Feeds Newsletters Mobile Apps Subscribe Copyright © 2017 The Seattle Times Company | Privacy statement | Terms of service Get our Morning Brief delivered to your inbox.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Graphics Laptop News 3 Nvidia introduces the GeForce MX150 laptop GPUs by Mark Tyson on 26 May 2017, 10:31 Tags: NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadhww Add to My Vault: Nvidia has announced the GeForce MX150 GPU for laptops. In a nutshell this is the Pascal-based successor to the popular GeForce 940MX, which was seen in many a laptop designed to deliver GPU acceleration without going for full throttle gaming. Nvidia admits as much in its blog blurb, saying that it is targeted at those who indulge in "photo and video editing, as well as a spot of gaming at the end of the day". So what does the GeForce MX150 bring to the table? Nvidia largely compares it to the aforementioned predecessor, the 940MX, and to common integrated graphics solutions from recent Intel architectures. First of all, considering performance, the new GeForce MX150 is said to be 20 per cent faster than the 940MX in advanced photo editing, 33 per cent faster in video processing, and 33 per cent faster in gaming. That's 4x faster than the Intel HD520 or HD 620 in gaming.   In example games tested by Nvidia (Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, or World of Tanks) the MX150 is said to be capable of delivering "full HD resolution at a smooth 60 frames per second". Gaming benchmark results For mobile solutions power efficiency is also key and the new Pascal-based part helps deliver significant advantages judged by this important metric. In Nvidia's own tests the MX150 offers 3x the performance per watt compared to the 940MX. As usual, Nvidia helps conserve your laptop battery life using its Optimus and GPU Boost technologies. New laptops featuring the GeForce MX150 GPU, from the likes of Acer, Asus, Clevo, HP, and MSI, will begin shipping globally in June. We are likely to see quite a few of these at Computex, just a few days away. Tech specifications of the GeForce MX150 are currently only sketched out vaguely on the official Nvidia product pages. Hopefully that will change with the first hardware releases.

Yes, looks like I calculated that upside down. Will correct shortly. Posted by Valantar - Fri 26 May 2017 13:25 Interesting to see how they for some reason entirely divest this chip from the mainstream Geforce series. I wonder if it's based on GP108, cut down in some way, or if it's an even smaller chip (which sounds unlikely, although the 940MX seems to have impressive adoption rates, which might make that viable). Also, does this mean that there won't be a mobile GT 1030?

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature A wealth of splendid 2016-17 games for the lousiest of hardware Home Featured Articles Prey 13 recent games that run well on terrible laptops By Alec Meer on May 25th, 2017 at 5:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

The ball rolls around the side of the arena with everyone chasing it, and when it passes a goalmouth occasionally it flukes in. I don’t get the appeal.

Having all entrys on a single page (or a few pages in case of the really long ones) would be so much better. Must be an advertisement thing. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 17:35 theallmightybob says: Its honestly not what I’ve come to expect from this site, its just a little surprising. I understand it likely is to improve the article to advert ratio, but its annoying as hell to do to a list… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:20 April March says: I doubt it’s an advertising thing, because it doesn’t reload the page between slides, so they aren’t getting additional views. That or I’m really dumb about how it works. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:37 Rack says: They’re almost certainly working on the back end so it will get extra impressions. Just the content was available before the tech was. No-one WANTS the content to be harder to access and less portable. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:06 Chaoslord AJ says: Maybe it’s for mobile devices like all the horizontal videos over the web lately? Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:07 Fomorian1988 says: I suspect any lo-fi indie game will run on most laptops. VA-11 HALL-A, Papers Please, the Cube Escape games, any game by Kitty Horrorshow, Oxenfree, Sunless Sea… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:54 Barts says: Oxenfree actually run like crap on integrated graphic cards. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely game, but I bought based on your assumption and had to postpone playing until I get a decent rig. So I’m sharing this here so that noone else makes the same mistake. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:19 nottorp says: Just stay away from indies made in Unity – even if they look lo fi, at the least they’ll put your laptop in screaming vacuum cleaner mode. Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:14 CelticPixel says: My laptop’s bust at the moment, so I’m doing all my gaming on a Surface Pro 4. Eve Online looks and runs great on it and Killing Floor 2 is surprisingly playable at the lowest settings, with the odd bit of slowdown.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list. Rocket League and League of Legends. I am surprised at some of these picks, like Prey and Elder Scroll Online, I thought you need an amazing PC to run these. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:22 torkan217 says: An older workstation at much lower price will get you decent specs, especially cpu’s like the qm line which perform on par with some modern cpus in the passmark tests. I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS. Call Of juarez Gunslinger, 1080p, 30-45, avg settings MGSV Phantom Pain, 30+, low/med settings, 1280×720, still looks really good MGS Ground Zeroes, 30, low settings, 1280×720, constant weather hurts it somewhat Fallout New Vegas Utlimate, 1080p, 35+, low/med settings Company of Heroes 1, 1080p, med settings, 35+ Dirt 3, med/high, 1080p, 30+ always WRC 4, med, 1080p, 30+ Infra, med 1080p, 30-40 Grid, med/high, 1080p, 35+ Need For Speed Hot Pursuit/NFS 11, 1600×900, 35+, med Skyrim, low/med, 1080p, 30+ Resident Evil REvelations, low/med, 1600×900, 40fps+ Deus Ex HR, low/med, 1600×900, 35+ Witcher 3, ultra low preset mod file, ~30 FPS, 1280×720 Arkham City, 1600×900, 35+, low/medium Fallout 4 was in the less than 20fps lowest settings, unplayable NierA, less than 20fps lowest, unplayable Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:34 left1000 says: dead cells should not be on this list. although it looks like it doesn’t require a fancy gpu, and I’m sure it doesn’t. It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

That was some exciting news to me. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:58 Barts says: I played these on my Dell Latitude E7250 and I highly recommend them: Darkest Dungeon Sunless Sea Invisible Inc.

How did that old quote go? “640×480 ought to be enough pixels for anybody.” Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:25 Chaoslord AJ says: Prey is the only entry that surprised me. Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

Log in to Reply 28/05/2017 at 17:59 Nixitur says: A recent game that I really like is Cosmic Star Heroine. To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that.

I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS. Call Of juarez Gunslinger, 1080p, 30-45, avg settings MGSV Phantom Pain, 30+, low/med settings, 1280×720, still looks really good MGS Ground Zeroes, 30, low settings, 1280×720, constant weather hurts it somewhat Fallout New Vegas Utlimate, 1080p, 35+, low/med settings Company of Heroes 1, 1080p, med settings, 35+ Dirt 3, med/high, 1080p, 30+ always WRC 4, med, 1080p, 30+ Infra, med 1080p, 30-40 Grid, med/high, 1080p, 35+ Need For Speed Hot Pursuit/NFS 11, 1600×900, 35+, med Skyrim, low/med, 1080p, 30+ Resident Evil REvelations, low/med, 1600×900, 40fps+ Deus Ex HR, low/med, 1600×900, 35+ Witcher 3, ultra low preset mod file, ~30 FPS, 1280×720 Arkham City, 1600×900, 35+, low/medium Fallout 4 was in the less than 20fps lowest settings, unplayable NierA, less than 20fps lowest, unplayable Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:34 left1000 says: dead cells should not be on this list. although it looks like it doesn’t require a fancy gpu, and I’m sure it doesn’t. It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

Of particular interest here, the latest firmware is going to enhance memory overclocking and compability, as well as add a much needed virtualization-related feature. AGESA is an acronym for “AMD Generic Encapsulated System Architecture", and it is essentially the foundational code on which BIOS files for AM4 motherboards are built. When the Ryzen AM4 platform was launched back in March, the early AGESA versions lacked a lot of the core capabilities and settings that we have come to expect from a modern platform. As a result, motherboard manufacturers did not have a lot to work with when it came to creating feature-rich custom BIOSes for their own motherboards. Since then AMD has been pretty vocal and proactive about fixing any bugs, opening up new BIOS features, and improving overclocking. With this new AGESA version, AMD has added 26 new memory-related parameters. The most dramatic improvement is the significant expansion of memory speed options. If we exclude base block overclocking - which relatively few motherboards support - the AM4 platform has thus far been effectively limited to memory speeds of DDR4-3200. Not only that, but the supported range of options from DDR4-1866 to DDR4-3200 was in large 266MT/s increments. With AGESA 1.0.0.6, memory frequencies have not only been expanded all the way up to DDR4-4000, but between DDR4-2667 and DDR4-4000 the increments have been reduced to 133MT/s. Not only does this mean that more memory kits will be able to be run at their rated speed - and not get kicked down to the nearest supported speed - but it also significantly reduces the high-speed memory gap that the AM4 platform had with Intel's mainstream LGA1151 platform. The other important announcement is the unlocking of about two dozen memory timings. Up until now, only five primary memory timings have been adjustable and there wasn't even a command rate option, which was natively locked to the most aggressive 1T setting. All of this should help improve overclocking and most importantly compatibility with the large swathe of DDR4 memory kits that have largely been engineered with Intel platforms in mind. The last addition should excite those interested in virtualization. AMD has announced "fresh support" for PCI Express Access Control Services (ACS), which enables the ability to manually assign PCIe graphics cards within IOMMU groups. This should be a breath of fresh air to those who have previously tried to dedicate a GPU to a virtual machine on a Ryzen system, since it is a task that has thus far been fraught with difficulties. AMD has already distributed the AGESA 1.0.0.6 to its motherboard partners, so BIOS updates should be available starting in mid to late June. Having said that, there are apparently beta versions currently available for the ASUS Crosshair VI and GIGABYTE GA-AX370-Gaming 5.

Reply vladx - Friday, May 26, 2017 - link Did you even read the article? Intel motherboards already support all of that and more and Intel never had such restrictions to their platforms. Reply Alexvrb - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link They have other, different restrictions instead. Such as locking most of their lineup, and preventing overclocking on non-Z chipsets. Some OEMs tried to bypass the second limitation... it didn't work out in the long run, especially if you want an updated BIOS that supports the latest chips. Reply nottatard - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link One the reason AMDs stock tanked recently was due to them not locking up their lineup.. either way, hardly a defense for not having basic bios options. Inb4 new platform cop-out. Reply TiberiusJonez - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link Are you on crack? I suggest you go back and read some history on the first year of the Intel x99 platform. It was a disaster. Memory support was horrendous. MUCH worse than this and BIOS updates didn't come anywhere near as fast as this. Stop being a fanboy hater, it makes you arrogant at worst, and ignorant at best. Reply Scannall - Saturday, May 27, 2017 - link When X58 came out that was pretty awful as well. It took a while to get that cleaned up and running well. Reply Lord of the Bored - Monday, May 29, 2017 - link New Intel platforms and crap memory immediately makes me think of ye olde Pentium 4/Rambus debacle back at the turn of the century.

Image: Draper Esprit Nicola McClafferty started out as a venture capitalist, then she earned her stripes with her own start-up, Covetique. Now she’s back in the investment game. The realities of starting and scaling a start-up business and then selling it are top of mind for Nicola McClafferty, who joined esteemed Irish entrepreneur and investor Brian Caulfield at Draper Esprit’s Dublin office earlier this year. McClafferty and Caulfield make for a dynamic team, since both of them are seasoned entrepreneurs as well as investors. ‘What breeds greater diversity is, people need to see successes that look like them. How do we better elevate and promote diverse success stories that we start to see?’ – NICOLA MCCLAFFERTY Caulfield led the successful exits of Exceptis in 2000 for $26m, Similarity Systems in 2006 for $55m and Aepona, which was acquired by Intel for $120m in 2013. Last year, he helped to spearhead the £100m flotation of Draper Esprit on the Dublin and London stock exchanges. McClafferty, who will be speaking at the upcoming Bank of Ireland-backed Startup Grind in Dublin on Wednesday 31 May, is of the same pedigree as Caulfield for starting and selling companies. As well as her investment prowess, she also built and sold her own start-up, Covetique, to online fashion giant ASOS in 2015. The University College Dublin graduate began her career in London in investment banking before going on to work with notable investment firms Balderton Capital and Ravensbeck. The lure of entrepreneurship Inspired by the start-ups she was guiding and advising, McClafferty felt the start-up urge and co-founded Covetique, a leading online retailer of pre-owned luxury fashion. “I think when you spend so much time around start-ups and entrepreneurs, you kind of want to give it a go yourself,” she recalled. “It’s all well and good sitting behind a table and being able to make judgements on business plans and entrepreneurs and invest in their businesses, but I felt I wanted to do it myself on a much more grassroots, hands-on level.” McClafferty spotted a gap in the market and was eager to give it a bash before anyone else thought up the same idea. “The thesis behind Covetique was that there was this huge luxury market where women were spending money on goods, and a lot of these items just sit in wardrobes representing a lot of value. These are women who don’t have a lot of time or inclination to use eBay. It was just something I had seen from friends, and I spent a lot of time looking at e-commerce and flash sale businesses that were emerging. And what was clear to me was that off the back of Airbnb and all the peer-to-peer car sharing and rental services, people were thinking differently about the assets they owned. They were thinking of extracting more value from their own assets, whether it was renting a room or a car. “We felt that for most women, your wardrobe is more valuable than your car – you would resell your car, why not your wardrobe? The big challenge was, to resell your wardrobe or high-end designer clothes, shoes, jewellery [etc] required time and patience. I felt there was this whole market of women who, in theory, would be very active sellers of an interest asset – their wardrobe – but didn’t necessarily have the time to do to it.” A year after Covetique was set up, ASOS invested in the company and helped to grow the business. “We were still an independent business but we worked closely with ASOS and they were a supporter of the business throughout the growth period.” Growing pains McClafferty learned that one of the hardest parts of scaling a business isn’t just access to capital, it is access to technology. “We reached a point where we had 20 people, we were shipping to 68 countries, doing a run rate of $5m in sales, but we were struggling to scale on the infrastructure side. “One of our major challenges was that we underestimated the complexity of our operational model. We had underinvested in technology and got to a point that our growth was becoming an issue and we were struggling to scale systems to meet our growth. “That triggered a fundraising drive to try and raise the funds we needed, to invest to address that scale-up [of] our infrastructure. It was a difficult time to raise money. “Appetite for e-commerce investment at the time was more muted than we would have liked and so, after number of different discussions and in the midst of that, ASOS put an offer to us for them to take on the business. “It was the right thing at the right time. I would have liked to have taken it further and driven the growth but we were struggling to raise the capital we needed. And so, ASOS became the right home for the business.”  When a good idea just won’t let you go Nicola McClafferty, investment director, Draper Esprit. Image: Covetique The Covetique experience sated McClafferty’s curiosity about start-up life and taught her valuable lessons. “Nothing can you prepare you for start-up life. That’s for sure. I felt like I had been surrounded by so many incredible businesses that really had inspired me. I just love working with technology companies and was inspired to want to run my own. “I felt I spotted an opportunity too in the market; I had sat on an idea and it was sitting with me for a long time. I put off starting it for a while on the basis that I was looking at these people who were entrepreneurs and wasn’t sure if I was one. I think a lot of people think like that. That’s it’s not for me. I still struggle to call myself an entrepreneur. “But I felt somebody needed to do this and eventually, I talked myself into a place where if I didn’t do this, then someone else will and I will kick myself. I felt strongly that there was a strong market opportunity. “There is very little that can prepare you for that life. But I suppose I still underestimated what it was going to involve, both from a personal standpoint and a professional standpoint. “There is no question. The way I see it, in the start-up world, the highs are higher and the lows are lower than anything you will ever do.” Gender bias in investment circles I ask McClafferty about being a woman investor in a venture capital industry with a dearth of female partners. I pointed to Astia figures that show just 6pc of investment partners in VC firms are women, and this results in a correspondingly poor 6pc investment rate in women-led start-ups. “You are right, this is an issue. There is a diversity issue both on the gender side but increasingly, whether it is ethnic, culturally – there is definitely a diversity problem. “How do we fix this? The only good news is that it is being talked about a lot more, but that by no means is enough. “There are, without question, particularly on gender side, unconscious biases that come to play when female entrepreneurs or business leaders are pitching. And I think that when people talk about VC being largely pattern-recognition, that it is true to a certain extent. “Having more women in investment roles is going to help the backing of women-led companies. Different perspectives around a table are going to lead to a broader range of businesses and business types being invested in. “We as a firm have three women investors on our investment team, which is not a small number. Investment firms, number one, need to make that conscious decision that they need to grow the team. “What breeds greater diversity is, people need to see successes that look like them. How do we better elevate and promote diverse success stories that we start to see? “People are inclined to stick with what they know and what looks like them. It is a long term game unfortunately, but the more female investors there are, the more investors that are of a diverse background, the more diverse companies get funded and the more success there will be. “It is our job to make sure we celebrate those successes in a great way because, for young kids coming through, young entrepreneurs starting to think about opportunities open to them, it is vitally important.” Ireland has software in its DNA McClafferty’s e-commerce and consumer experience means that she is 70pc focused on Ireland, with the remainder of her time focusing on Draper Esprit’s consumer and retail interests. “We have a remit to build the Irish pipeline and actively invest in Irish businesses, and that’s what we are doing. “What is notable to me is that Ireland has always punched above its weight in terms of its ability to produce interesting and global-scale technology businesses. There is a strong culture of entrepreneurship in Ireland. I think that is being embraced in a big way now. “The Irish State has done a very good job in seeding the market and, to a certain extent, there is a bit of a volume gain in that the more start-ups that enter the market, the more successes we will see. “The key here is the huge amount of activity in the very early stage in Ireland. It is about trying to understand how do we build companies in Ireland that are world-leading technology business. There is a lot of really interesting intellectual property coming out of Ireland. The universities have incredible research and, no question, the ability to create really interesting scalable technologies. But we need to make sure the companies we are building and the teams we build around them can scale to an international level. “Ireland has done that, just let’s do more of it.” From Draper Esprit’s perspective, the focus is on Series A-plus investments in businesses that can demonstrate a €1m annual revenue run rate. “We are seeing a lot of interesting fintech plays come out of Ireland, especially around blockchain, and we are keeping a close eye on that. It is still early days. “There are interesting things happening in AI and that’s where a lot of the new killer apps are going to be. “We see a lot of good software coming out of Ireland, but not really in consumer. Overall, Ireland has good DNA for software building,” McClafferty concluded. “Enterprise software and SaaS is a large proportion of what we would see reaching a meaningful scale in Ireland.” Related: funding and investment, entrepreneurs, e-commerce, The Interview 66 DAYS 4 HOURS 26 MINUTES Get your early bird tickets now!

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman UltraSoC attracts fresh investment as technology industry recognizes huge potential for embedded intelligence Investors commit support for UK’s hard-tech expertise CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, 26th May 2017 – UltraSoC today announces the completion of a £5m ($6.4m) funding round to drive continued deployment of its technology and realize its vision of embedding intelligent analytics capabilities into every chip. Atlante Tech leads a strong line up of new investors including Enso Ventures, Oxford Capital, and successful CEO and serial entrepreneur Guillaume d’Eyssautier, who join existing investors Octopus Ventures and South East Seed Fund (FSE Group). “Hard tech is back in favor with the UK and global investment community, with recent funding for Ultrahaptics, Graphcore and SiFive (a fellow RISC-V proponent), plus successful exits at Movidius and Mobileye,” said Rupert Baines, UltraSoC CEO. “Our investors are excited by the potential of UltraSoC’s technology and are committed to supporting our aim of putting intelligent analytics into every chip.” As part of the funding, Miles Kirby of Oxford, Kirill Mudryy of Enso and Alvise Bonivento of Atlante will join the UltraSoC board, alongside existing investor representative Luke Hakes (Octopus), board Chair Chris Gilbert and non-executive director Chris Wade. UltraSoC’s semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) enables designers to easily and cost-effectively create complex SoCs (systems on chip) with built-in intelligence that continuously monitors and responds to real-world behavior. This allows SoCs to optimize power consumption and performance and deal with security threats or safety breaches. Successful development of the company’s debug tools and increased awareness of the technology’s potential benefits has meant a series of significant commercial engagements, with more in the pipeline. Amongst others, HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel), and Microsemi all use UltraSoC technology in their designs, delivering proven hardware-embedded benefits to their customers. To ensure these benefits are accessible to customers in all sectors across the globe, UltraSoC partners with leading names in the semiconductor industry including ARM, Baysand, Cadence/Tensilica, CEVA, Codasip, Lauterbach, MIPS and Teledyne LeCroy. The significant line-up of new and existing investors in this funding round reflects the company’s growing commercial traction and technological progress. Likewise, the company’s potential is being realized as the need for safety, security and performance-tuning becomes critical. Embedded analytics allows the chip to monitor and optimize its own behavior at a hardware level; and provides insights that enable engineers to make improvements and fix problems. The same technology can detect evolving real-world threats and problems – for instance those caused by malicious attacks. These features benefit any electronic system, but are particularly attractive in the automotive and high-performance computing (HPC) sectors. The investment in UltraSoC also reflects changes taking place in market areas where embedded analytics offers chip makers and their customers a distinct competitive advantage. Dr. Alvise Bonivento of lead investor Atlante Tech commented on this point: “UltraSoC has a great team, technology and substantial commercial traction. The time is right for UltraSoC’s embedded intelligence to make a significant difference to mass market and mission critical applications.” UltraSoC chairman, Chris Gilbert, commented: “We are delighted to receive the backing of prominent industry figures and distinguished investors like Atlante, Enso and Oxford, as we take UltraSoC to the next level of success. It’s great to welcome these new investors on board, and we are delighted to retain the support of our existing backers Octopus Ventures and the FSE Group’s South East Seed Fund.” Kirill Mudryy, Partner at Enso Ventures, added: “We at Enso Ventures are always looking to support companies that have innovative and truly disruptive technology. That is why we are delighted to add UltraSoC to our portfolio.” UltraSoC was named one of the 100 most exciting companies in the UK in the 2016 Mishcon de Reya CityAM “Leap 100” list, and nominated by Gartner as one of its 2016 “Cool Vendors”. It was recognized as “Best New Company” in the 2015 ELEKTRA Awards. UltraSoC’s flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that allows chip designers to integrate an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of their devices. By monitoring and analyzing the real-world behavior of entire systems via UltraSoC’s intelligent analytics embedded in the silicon, engineers can take action to reduce system power consumption, increase performance, protect against malicious intrusions, and ensure product safety. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure. Silverpeak, the technology investment bank, acted as exclusive financial advisor to UltraSoC in the transaction. About UltraSoC UltraSoC is an independent provider of SoC infrastructure that enables rapid development of embedded systems based on advanced SoC devices. The company is headquartered in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

Having all entrys on a single page (or a few pages in case of the really long ones) would be so much better. Must be an advertisement thing. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 17:35 theallmightybob says: Its honestly not what I’ve come to expect from this site, its just a little surprising. I understand it likely is to improve the article to advert ratio, but its annoying as hell to do to a list… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:20 April March says: I doubt it’s an advertising thing, because it doesn’t reload the page between slides, so they aren’t getting additional views. That or I’m really dumb about how it works. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:37 Rack says: They’re almost certainly working on the back end so it will get extra impressions. Just the content was available before the tech was. No-one WANTS the content to be harder to access and less portable. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:06 Chaoslord AJ says: Maybe it’s for mobile devices like all the horizontal videos over the web lately? Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:07 Fomorian1988 says: I suspect any lo-fi indie game will run on most laptops. VA-11 HALL-A, Papers Please, the Cube Escape games, any game by Kitty Horrorshow, Oxenfree, Sunless Sea… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:54 Barts says: Oxenfree actually run like crap on integrated graphic cards. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely game, but I bought based on your assumption and had to postpone playing until I get a decent rig. So I’m sharing this here so that noone else makes the same mistake. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:19 nottorp says: Just stay away from indies made in Unity – even if they look lo fi, at the least they’ll put your laptop in screaming vacuum cleaner mode. Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:14 CelticPixel says: My laptop’s bust at the moment, so I’m doing all my gaming on a Surface Pro 4. Eve Online looks and runs great on it and Killing Floor 2 is surprisingly playable at the lowest settings, with the odd bit of slowdown.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:41 GeoX says: Seriously, you take the trouble to make this list, and then you include 2-D indie games that it’s transparently obvious would run well on any computer?

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list. Rocket League and League of Legends. I am surprised at some of these picks, like Prey and Elder Scroll Online, I thought you need an amazing PC to run these. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:22 torkan217 says: An older workstation at much lower price will get you decent specs, especially cpu’s like the qm line which perform on par with some modern cpus in the passmark tests. I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS. Call Of juarez Gunslinger, 1080p, 30-45, avg settings MGSV Phantom Pain, 30+, low/med settings, 1280×720, still looks really good MGS Ground Zeroes, 30, low settings, 1280×720, constant weather hurts it somewhat Fallout New Vegas Utlimate, 1080p, 35+, low/med settings Company of Heroes 1, 1080p, med settings, 35+ Dirt 3, med/high, 1080p, 30+ always WRC 4, med, 1080p, 30+ Infra, med 1080p, 30-40 Grid, med/high, 1080p, 35+ Need For Speed Hot Pursuit/NFS 11, 1600×900, 35+, med Skyrim, low/med, 1080p, 30+ Resident Evil REvelations, low/med, 1600×900, 40fps+ Deus Ex HR, low/med, 1600×900, 35+ Witcher 3, ultra low preset mod file, ~30 FPS, 1280×720 Arkham City, 1600×900, 35+, low/medium Fallout 4 was in the less than 20fps lowest settings, unplayable NierA, less than 20fps lowest, unplayable Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:34 left1000 says: dead cells should not be on this list. although it looks like it doesn’t require a fancy gpu, and I’m sure it doesn’t. It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:49 HoboDragon says: Motorsport Manager, esp. in the 2D mode runs well. Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2…. (most games RPS recommended if I recall :-D) Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:06 Bernardo says: Recent Games that run smoothly or at least reasonably well on my integrated Intel HD 4400 Ultrabook not on this list: Salt and Sanctuary Shrouded in Sanity Order of Battle Thea: The Awakening Pillars of Eternity Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 23:05 Bernardo says: Not that recent, but Legend of Grimrock 1 and 2 also work like a charm (medium setings).

That was some exciting news to me. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:58 Barts says: I played these on my Dell Latitude E7250 and I highly recommend them: Darkest Dungeon Sunless Sea Invisible Inc.

Speeds them way up and gives them a charming retro feel. How did that old quote go? “640×480 ought to be enough pixels for anybody.” Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:25 Chaoslord AJ says: Prey is the only entry that surprised me. Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

Log in to Reply 28/05/2017 at 17:59 Nixitur says: A recent game that I really like is Cosmic Star Heroine. To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier. Log in to Reply 28/05/2017 at 18:05 Nixitur says: Somehow messed up the link there and ran out of editing time. That was supposed to be Downwell, must have messed up a closing bracket. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:25 poliovaccine says: Donno if it’s been said here already, or if this is too late for anyone to even read it, but upon discovering it works, I’m too excited not to share myself: Resident Evil 7! On a terrible laptop with an integrated Intel HD gfx card! Gotta whack down the resolution but it damn well plays! I had longed for that game but never thought my system might be able to handle it, so wrote it off til an upgrade. But then I found it has a demo – demo works a trick. Proceeding to get the full thing! Woop! Never would’ve thought to try, if not for Prey being in this list. Gotta thank RPS (again) for that one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

We like this definition. Investors commit support for UK’s hard-tech expertise CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, 26th May 2017 – UltraSoC today announces the completion of a £5m ($6.4m) funding round to drive continued deployment of its technology and realize its vision of embedding intelligent analytics capabilities into every chip. Atlante Tech leads a strong line up of new investors including Enso Ventures, Oxford Capital, and successful CEO and serial entrepreneur Guillaume d’Eyssautier, who join existing investors Octopus Ventures and South East Seed Fund (FSE Group). “Hard tech is back in favor with the UK and global investment community, with recent funding for Ultrahaptics, Graphcore and SiFive (a fellow RISC-V proponent), plus successful exits at Movidius and Mobileye,” said Rupert Baines, UltraSoC CEO. “Our investors are excited by the potential of UltraSoC’s technology and are committed to supporting our aim of putting intelligent analytics into every chip.” As part of the funding, Miles Kirby of Oxford, Kirill Mudryy of Enso and Alvise Bonivento of Atlante will join the UltraSoC board, alongside existing investor representative Luke Hakes (Octopus), board Chair Chris Gilbert and non-executive director Chris Wade. UltraSoC’s semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) enables designers to easily and cost-effectively create complex SoCs (systems on chip) with built-in intelligence that continuously monitors and responds to real-world behavior. This allows SoCs to optimize power consumption and performance and deal with security threats or safety breaches. Successful development of the company’s debug tools and increased awareness of the technology’s potential benefits has meant a series of significant commercial engagements, with more in the pipeline. Amongst others, HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel), and Microsemi all use UltraSoC technology in their designs, delivering proven hardware-embedded benefits to their customers. To ensure these benefits are accessible to customers in all sectors across the globe, UltraSoC partners with leading names in the semiconductor industry including ARM, Baysand, Cadence/Tensilica, CEVA, Codasip, Lauterbach, MIPS and Teledyne LeCroy. The significant line-up of new and existing investors in this funding round reflects the company’s growing commercial traction and technological progress. Likewise, the company’s potential is being realized as the need for safety, security and performance-tuning becomes critical. Embedded analytics allows the chip to monitor and optimize its own behavior at a hardware level; and provides insights that enable engineers to make improvements and fix problems. The same technology can detect evolving real-world threats and problems – for instance those caused by malicious attacks. These features benefit any electronic system, but are particularly attractive in the automotive and high-performance computing (HPC) sectors. The investment in UltraSoC also reflects changes taking place in market areas where embedded analytics offers chip makers and their customers a distinct competitive advantage. Dr. Alvise Bonivento of lead investor Atlante Tech commented on this point: “UltraSoC has a great team, technology and substantial commercial traction. The time is right for UltraSoC’s embedded intelligence to make a significant difference to mass market and mission critical applications.” UltraSoC chairman, Chris Gilbert, commented: “We are delighted to receive the backing of prominent industry figures and distinguished investors like Atlante, Enso and Oxford, as we take UltraSoC to the next level of success. It’s great to welcome these new investors on board, and we are delighted to retain the support of our existing backers Octopus Ventures and the FSE Group’s South East Seed Fund.” Kirill Mudryy, Partner at Enso Ventures, added: “We at Enso Ventures are always looking to support companies that have innovative and truly disruptive technology. That is why we are delighted to add UltraSoC to our portfolio.” UltraSoC was named one of the 100 most exciting companies in the UK in the 2016 Mishcon de Reya CityAM “Leap 100” list, and nominated by Gartner as one of its 2016 “Cool Vendors”. It was recognized as “Best New Company” in the 2015 ELEKTRA Awards. UltraSoC’s flagship product line is a suite of semiconductor IP that allows chip designers to integrate an intelligent analytics infrastructure into the core hardware of their devices. By monitoring and analyzing the real-world behavior of entire systems via UltraSoC’s intelligent analytics embedded in the silicon, engineers can take action to reduce system power consumption, increase performance, protect against malicious intrusions, and ensure product safety. These capabilities address applications in a broad range of market sectors, from automotive and IoT products, to at-scale computing and communications infrastructure. Silverpeak, the technology investment bank, acted as exclusive financial advisor to UltraSoC in the transaction.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

I understand it likely is to improve the article to advert ratio, but its annoying as hell to do to a list… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 03:20 April March says: I doubt it’s an advertising thing, because it doesn’t reload the page between slides, so they aren’t getting additional views. That or I’m really dumb about how it works. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:37 Rack says: They’re almost certainly working on the back end so it will get extra impressions.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 18:07 Fomorian1988 says: I suspect any lo-fi indie game will run on most laptops. VA-11 HALL-A, Papers Please, the Cube Escape games, any game by Kitty Horrorshow, Oxenfree, Sunless Sea… Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 09:54 Barts says: Oxenfree actually run like crap on integrated graphic cards. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely game, but I bought based on your assumption and had to postpone playing until I get a decent rig. So I’m sharing this here so that noone else makes the same mistake. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 13:19 nottorp says: Just stay away from indies made in Unity – even if they look lo fi, at the least they’ll put your laptop in screaming vacuum cleaner mode. Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that.

I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS.

It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway. Use the arrow keys above/below the images to navigate the list, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

That or I’m really dumb about how it works. Log in to Reply 26/05/2017 at 11:37 Rack says: They’re almost certainly working on the back end so it will get extra impressions.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

Back when the “new” x-com 1 was new, i used to get 50% more battery life and less fan noise than any random Unity indie when playing it. And it’s still 3D. Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 22:54 poliovaccine says: Yknow, I never realized it, but that’s super true. In fact I tend to whack down settings further than I need for smooth visual performance, cus I specifically want to chase down that horrific sound of whining, straining effort. Hadnt put it together but yeah, the first three games I can think of like that are Unity. Seems like even when CryEngine chugs it doesnt whine, ditto UE4. It’s certainly a hit or miss thing – I mean Prey is running beautifully for me, on Medium settings. A topdown isometric shouldnt run worse than that.

I’ve got a Dell Precision m4600, 15.6″, 1080p, i7-2620m@2.7ghz/3.4 turbo dual core, 8GB RAM, quadro 1000m 2GB. From what I saw on the web the quadro 1000m is 20% overall less than an hd 4400. Most reviewers don’t even try newer or games perceived to be too demanding, this is a serious error. 30+ FPS means over 30 in normal play and usually above this up to 45 FPS.

It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

Log in to Reply 30/05/2017 at 23:03 poliovaccine says: Fwiw, I first found this site by googling “best [genre here] games on pc,” and finding some lists of theirs like this. Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article. There’s no “You know guys, I learned something today…” It’s like there’s no cigarette after sex.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

I had longed for that game but never thought my system might be able to handle it, so wrote it off til an upgrade. But then I found it has a demo – demo works a trick. Proceeding to get the full thing! Woop! Never would’ve thought to try, if not for Prey being in this list. Gotta thank RPS (again) for that one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Now Missing from President Trump's budget: Funds for California's earthquake early warning system Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014. A prototype of the earthquake early warning system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014. A prototype of the earthquake early warning system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles Times) By Rong-Gong Lin IIContact Reporter Earthquakes Tornadoes and Wind Storms Donald Trump Adam Schiff National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service Ken Calvert President Trump’s budget would eliminate federal funding for an earthquake early warning system being developed for California and the rest of the West Coast which, if enacted, probably would kill the long-planned effort. The budget proposal for the year ending in September 2018 also seeks to eliminate U.S. funding for critical tsunami-monitoring stations in oceans and reduce funds for a next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists said the loss of federal funding would derail the early warning system, which officials hope would one day send public earthquake alerts to smartphones seconds or even minutes before a temblor. “It probably would kill the early warning system if we thought there were no more funding coming from the U.S. Geological Survey,” said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network and a seismology professor at the University of Washington. “The money we’ve received is essential,” Vidale said. In a statement announcing the USGS budget, the Department of the Interior said the budget “focuses on core USGS science and efficiency,” and asserted that the budget would be able to fund monitoring of the nation’s earthquakes. Bill Leith, the USGS acting associate director for natural hazards, said a decision was made to focus on USGS’ service core capabilities — services that are already offered, rather than a new service such as the earthquake early warning system. The budget document posted on the U.S. Department of the Interior’s website did not elaborate on the reason for cutting the alert system, saying only: “This elimination would end USGS efforts to implement the ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system.” New hires haven’t been approved by Trump administration The earthquake early warning system, being built by the USGS in conjunction with several major universities, still needs more seismic sensors installed across Washington, Oregon and Northern California, and it needs a staff of 40 to 50 people to install and maintain equipment as well as monitor the computer systems. Already, hiring has proven difficult. Since Trump was inaugurated, the Department of the Interior has frozen hiring of senior scientists, including those needed to operate the early warning network. “There are people we’ve identified and interviewed and we’d like to hire them as soon as we have permission,” Vidale said. “These are the people who would keep the computer doing what we need to to get the early warning system up and operating.” Without ongoing funding, the ShakeAlert system would need to lay off employees, said Tom Heaton, a Caltech professor of engineering seismology. “If that funding went away, we would have to lay off a number of the developers and the development would basically cease,” Heaton said. “I’m not sure how we could possibly recover from that.” Such a blow probably would lead Heaton, who said he is nearing retirement, to work on other issues. “I’ve been kind of excited at the possibility we’ll have a system up and running by the time my career was done. That hope would be dashed in that case,” Heaton said. Lucy Jones in 2015 discusses California's prototype earthquake early warning system. (Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times) Companies have been seeking to use the system Companies have started to notice the potential benefits of an earthquake early warning system. Intel, for example, “is very eager to use early warning to make their manufacturing safer,” Vidale said. Computer companies can use seconds of warning before shaking comes to halt sensitive manufacturing processes — preventing equipment from clanging together and being damaged in the shaking. That would enable factories to resume operations much faster after the earthquake. And factories using toxic chemicals can prevent problems by securing operations before shaking arrives, too, Vidale said. And just telling people that shaking is coming so that they can drop, cover and hold on could save lives and reduce injuries. “This is a simple technology. We know how to do it,” Vidale said. “Even Mongolia is doing it.” The budget proposal would also reduce $800,000 in funding for earthquake monitoring in Alaska and the central and eastern United States, where earthquakes are a risk on the East Coast, in the South and in the Midwest. The reduction may “slow the rate of updates to seismic provisions in building codes and provide less science to support risk mitigation actions. The USGS would also suspend its annual forecast of hazard related to both natural and induced seismicity.” An additional $561,000 would be cut under the proposal from earthquake hazards operations, diminishing the government’s ability to monitor and report on earthquakes, assess earthquake hazards and send earthquake results to emergency responders, the budget document said.

Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), said it would be foolish to end it. “After years of educating the public and Congress to the benefits of the earthquake early warning system, we have been able to deliver $23.4 million in federal funding to help build out an early warning system across the West Coast,” Schiff said in a statement. “But we cannot stop now, just as monitoring stations are being built out and the system is expanding its reach. Support for the early warning system in Congress is sustained, growing and bipartisan, and we will not accept this attempt by the president to cut a vital funding stream for a program that will protect life, property and critical infrastructure,” Schiff said. Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona), who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement Friday that he believes the “earthquake early warning system can be a lifesaving tool for the millions of Californians and other Americans who live in earthquake-prone areas. “That’s why I have been at the forefront of advocating for funding of the program, including the $10.2 million in funding that was signed into law earlier this year,” Calvert said. “Obviously, the president’s budget proposes some reductions for this program and other agencies that fall within the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee’s jurisdiction, which I oversee as Chairman. During the appropriations process, important programs like this will be given full consideration.” Watch the earthquake early warning appear on TV in Japan before the great 2011 earthquake. The alert shows up about 36 seconds into the video. At about 2 minutes into the video, shaking arrives in Tokyo, and a news anchor interrupts the programming. U.S. far behind other nations The United States is far behind other nations in developing an earthquake early warning system. In Japan, for instance, national TV broadcasts and cellphones are interrupted with warnings about incoming shaking, and for significant quakes, high-speed trains automatically slow down, as slower speeds reduce the threat of a deadly derailment. “All of Japanese society is very happy for their early warning system,” Heaton said. “Nobody in Japan really wants to turn it off. They view it as a great step ahead for them. Californians will, too.” In the last few years, lawmakers in Washington and Sacramento have started to devote significant dollars to developing the system. In fact, the budget deal reached in Congress for the current budget year that ends in September penciled in $10.2 million for the system, which represented an increase from the previous year’s $8.2 million for the system. The system needs about $16.1 million in yearly operating and maintenance costs, and $38.2 million to build it. Seismologist Lucy Jones said she was “deeply disappointed” to see Trump’s budget proposal. “Eliminating the $10 million a year that the government has been spending would stop the program and waste the $23 million that has already been invested,” Jones said in an email. “The talented scientists and technicians that are working on the project now will go to other jobs, so their experience and expertise would be lost. “Many life- and money-saving measures would not be available when the next earthquake strikes,” she added.

(Richard Derk / MCT) How the early warnings work The earthquake early warning system works on a simple principle: The shaking from an earthquake travels at about the speed of sound through rock — slower than the speed of today's communications systems. That means it would take more than a minute for, say, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that starts at the Salton Sea to shake up Los Angeles, 150 miles away, traveling on the state’s longest fault, the San Andreas. The prototype system has had some early successes. When a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Napa in 2014, the system gave researchers in San Francisco about eight seconds of warning before shaking began. Last year, 30 seconds of warning reached downtown L.A. before the ground shook from a magnitude 4.4 quake centered near Banning. As the system gets built, officials have talked about allowing places such as classrooms, offices, shopping malls, amusement parks and police and fire stations to have ready access to alerts. Eventually, bigger benefits are expected: technology to open elevators at the next floor, sparing occupants from being trapped, and warnings that could halt the flow of natural gas through major pipelines, preventing catastrophic fires. Officials last week had said they hoped to have an early version of the system sometime next year. The waters of the tsunami were still evident in the Japanese town of Ishinomaki days after the March 11, 2011 tsunami. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times) Tsunami sensing stations could lose all funding The proposed budget also affects other agencies monitoring natural disasters. The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, faces eliminating funding — $12 million — that pays for a crucial network of buoys in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The network can sense an incoming tsunami, enabling officials to send watches and warnings for the United States. This is known as the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis, or DART. A budget document said that the termination of the program “is anticipated to have a 20% or greater impact on the accuracy, certainty, and timeliness of NOAA’s tsunami watches and warnings.” The DART buoys are essential for telling local authorities whether the public needs to be evacuated from the coast, Vidale said. “Those DART buoys are our eyes out in the sea for incoming tsunamis from distant earthquakes.” “The zeroing out of the DART buoys is just startling,” said University of Washington atmospheric sciences professor Cliff Mass. In this March 11, 2011 file photo, boats collide with one another after a tsunami swept through a boat basin in Crescent City, Calif. (Bryant Anderson / Associated Press) The agency is also facing a proposed reduction of funding for a network of automated weather stations that can indicate rapidly deteriorating weather conditions, called Mesonet. That means NOAA won’t be able to monitor these conditions in all 50 states, but will have to “prioritize states most susceptible to tornadoes and severe weather.” The budget also proposes reducing funding for an array of sensors in the ocean designed to detect El Niño, which officials said may delay the recognition of the onset of phenomenon and hamper the ability to deal with its effects, such as heavy rain or drought.

(Spencer Platt / Getty Images) Slowing or ending programs to improve weather and tornado forecasts The budget proposal also would slow the development of the National Weather Service’s next-generation weather forecasting system. Scientists and officials have been pushing for a major upgrade to the weather service’s forecasting system, which is well behind European modeling systems, Mass said. That shortcoming was seen in the U.S. forecasting of Hurricane Sandy as it struck New York, he said. “What they’re proposing to do is cutting a large amount of money out, which would delay it at best and kill it at worst,” Mass said. “If you look at the statistics for virtually any place in the country, you’ll see the American model is well behind.” The proposal would also end an effort to extend operational weather outlooks from 16 days to 30 days, saving $5 million, and halt a project that would improve tornado forecasts in the southeastern United States, which would also save $5 million. In an executive summary accompanying the budget proposal, the Commerce Department said that “the termination and rescaling of programs, while challenging and impactful, is necessary as we move toward a more efficient government model that refocuses on national security and core government functions.” Support our journalism Already a subscriber?

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit 1 of 14 ‘Terrible’ only in the sense of their gaming capability. Honestly, I’m sure your laptop is lovely to look at and it was definitely a extremely sensible idea to spend all that money on it instead of buying a holiday or helping to save the pandas. Truth is, though, that playing recently-released games on the vast majority of laptops is about as effective as starting an online petition to uncancel your favourite television show. A little discretion goes a long way, however. Sure, you may be denied the glossiest of exploding viscera, but it is entirely possible to keep up with the Joneses even on a Terrible Laptop that has no dedicated graphics card. Here are but twelve contemporary games – either recently released or still-evolving going concerns – that will indeed run on your glammed-up toaster. Additional suggestions below are entirely welcome. The exact definition of a Terrible (for gaming) Laptop clearly differs, but for the sake of argument, my test system has a dual-core cpu that runs at between 1.9 and 2.9GHz depending on load and heat (and thermal throttling to prevent overheat means it’s usually the former figure) and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics, which borrows memory from the laptop’s 8GB of RAM. Absolutely fine for general purpose computing then, but as useful as a mohawk on a lobster when it comes to games. The Intel graphics on your Terrible Laptop may well have a lower or higher-sounding number than that, but in most cases don’t expect a great deal of variance. In some cases, though you might get excited about the mention of your laptop having AMD or NVIDIA graphics in it, the chip in question could still be so lowly as to offer you few extra options – and, as such, you are still the proud owner of a Terrible Laptop. As for performance, my criteria is a game that looks and feels playable at lowest settings and a resolution of 1280×720. Depending on the exact nature of the game in question and of your own Terrible Laptop, you may be able to go a bit higher than that. Oh, and ‘playable’ here means a minimum of 30 frames per second. Some games, particularly turn-based ones, are absolutely fine at lower than that, but 30 is our benchmark for this piece. Onto the games, anyway.

Stayed for the writing, of course, but it may well be a goldmine of SEO hits. Also yeah, I almost always read this site on mobile, and in that format, A.) I’ve always seen RPS do slideshows, and B.) it’s never bothered me. I dont see any extra ads – if they occur at the bottom of the screen, whatever, I dont see em. Hope RPS gets the teenths of a penny per view anyway. But scrolling on mobile gets finicky the longer the page, and having all these items in one page would be annoying to scroll through on a phone. I do think it’d make a good option at the start, an alt view that’s all in one like that, for those who’d rather it, but from a mobile perspective I dont mind their slideshows a bit. It’s not like they’re yr average copy-paste-from-reddit clickbait with a Next button that loads below a big ad that deforms the page in hopes you accidentally click on it – like I say, I see less ads in a slideshow than I do in a regular article, cus they’re all at the bottom, I just pass em omw to comments, if ever. Idk how it appears on a PC to be perfectly fair, but equally so, I wouldnt say this is some egregious, clickbaity practice here. I get the pavlovian response against slideshows, but to me the usual complaints dont register in this case. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 19:09 someoneelse84 says: I’m not one to normally complain. Having said that… The real thing that bugs me about the slideshow format is the lack of closure to the article.

I’m currently loaning my new GPU to my brother, so i’m rocking my old 6950 GPU at the mo, which is well below the listed minimum specs so i had discarded that as an option for now. But if it’ll somewhat run on an intel IGP it’ll run on that for sure… Would mean tearing myself away from Rimworld though :P Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 21:20 Expose Gaming1 says: Wow, two of my favorite game are on this list.

It’s poorly optimized and lags on non-topoftheline cpu’s. Log in to Reply 25/05/2017 at 22:02 Bernardo says: Yes, I’m having the same problem. It bugs me a bit, because I love to play these games when travelling and have only my work laptop with me. To be fair, the game gives you a warning that it’s not optmised for Intel cards, and hints at future optimisation. So there’s still hope.

Almost any 2D, pseudo 3D “pixel-art” game will run well (as already mentioned Stardew Valley), e.g. To The Moon, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Duskers, Terraria, Dungeon of the Endless, or older games such as SW KOTOR1/2….

Most indie games aren’t graphic fiestas and shouldn’t really need much performance. Same goes for mobile ports. Or anything not asking for x64 architecture specifically could run on obsolete hardware. Cartoon graphic adventures? Some developers can’t optimize them even for sota-gaming rigs but it’s not the fault of the hardware really.

To my surprise, it ran entirely smoothly on my potato of a laptop which is far worse than what Alec described as “terrible” in the article. Definitely worth a look if you like turn-based RPGs. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes came out in late 2015, is lovely, hilarious and runs well enough on that, too. Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an exceedingly good 2D platformer. Not a fan of the artstyle, personally, but the strength of the gameplay made it very easy for me to look past that. Also, it’s free. VA-11 HALL-A is a cyberpunk bartending simulator with lovely characters and a fantastic soundtrack. Since it’s a visual novel, it running smoothly on terrible laptops is no surprise. And for those who think it “obvious” that 2D indie games would run flawlessly on laptops, I would like to point out that <a href="link to store.steampowered.com is very deliberately not on that list. It’s a fantastic game, don’t get me wrong, but it runs much slower than it’s supposed to on my laptop. That makes the game much easier.

I had longed for that game but never thought my system might be able to handle it, so wrote it off til an upgrade. But then I found it has a demo – demo works a trick. Proceeding to get the full thing! Woop! Never would’ve thought to try, if not for Prey being in this list. Gotta thank RPS (again) for that one. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Josh King has the story (@abridgetoland). 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: Apple Will Invest $1 Billion To Promote Manufacturing Jobs In The U.S. Apple will be investing $1 billion dollars into an advanced manufacturing fund to promote jobs in the United states. CEO Tim Cook said in an interview on CNBC’s Mad Money “I’m proud to tell you… putting in billion dollars in the fund.” Cook did not say who the who the company was but it makes Apple one of the latest to jump on the growing trend of adding U.S. jobs. Companies like Amazon have pledged to create 100,000 jobs in the next two years and Intel says it will invest $7 billion dollars in an Arizona-based chip-making plant. Cook says that these new jobs will create even more jobs later on SOT "By doing that, we can be the ripple in the pond. Because if we can create many manufacturing jobs around, those manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them." And so it does seem like President Trump’s urging of companies to bring jobs back to the United States is having an effect. 8/9(*VO-Reuters apple china/VB tax) Although Cook did also say that he thinks the Trump Administration should give tax breaks to companies that bring money back from overseas.

Over at Greek online retailer Skroutz two 16-core Threadripper Processors surfaced online in their store, the AMD Threadripper 1998 and 1998X. Interesting as Threadripper processors are due for release in the summer. The listing is curious as it doesn't even come with pricetags. However the listing does show some specifications. Both models are th 16-core 32-threaded parts, and they have specced them at a 3.20 GHz base (unknown Boost) for the 1998 model and 3.5 GHz for the 1998X model.  Both procs are tagged under socket SP3r2, AMD's 4,094-pin LGA socket. AMD’s high-end desktop (HEDT) platform, code named Whitehaven, will include support for quad-channel DDR4 memory and up to 44 PCIe lanes. It will compete directly with Intel’s upcoming HEDT X299 platform and Skylake X CPUs which will feature up to 12 cores. Previous have indicated that the flagship 1998X would feature clock speeds of 3.5GHz base and 3.9GHz boost with AMD XFR (Extended Frequency Range) feature. The CPU get a very reasonable 155W TDP, 5 watts less than Intel’s 12-core Skylake X CPU. To be released soon? Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Emille Master Guru Posts: 550 Joined: 2014-09-22 #5436623 Posted on: 05/27/2017 03:45 PM This is great for all consumers. Whether or not it can compete clock for clock with intels sklyake x etc is irrelevant, because if people see that they can buy a cpu with more cores with a motherboard that has 44pci lanes top to bottom, they might think long term it's a better and possibly cheaper option and intel will have to react accordingly. The 4 core b.s race is over, and it would be pointless to say '10, 12, 16 cores is overkill' because then sooner it's available the sooner it will become mainstream and I applaud AMD for doing what intel held off doing for far too long because of their market dominance.

BigMaMaInHouse Member Guru Posts: 52 Joined: 2016-10-11 #5436775 Posted on: 05/28/2017 11:48 AM ???? The Intel Core i7-6950X sells for $1649 on newegg now, and its only 10C cpu, so why AMD do suicide and sell the top 16core CPU for $999, remember it's not for gaming like 1800X vs 7700K, in CB and similar multi core rendering etc' already the 1800X comes near i7 6950X so the 16Core will crush it, this is why I think $1599 will be good price by AMD. And like the 1700 vs 1800X the 1998 will be much cheaper and best seller 16Core . Man I can't wait :-), last time I was so exited was 12 years ago when I finished High school :-). JamesSneed Newbie Posts: 44 Joined: 2017-02-14 #5436811 Posted on: 05/28/2017 05:22 PM I suspect the pricing will start at $500 and will go up to $1,600. The 1800x will go down to $450. This is what my crystal ball says. The reasoning is the AMD 10 core will compete against Intel's 6 core, 12 vs 8, 14 vs 10, 16 vs 12. This would land the pricing right around Intel in each bracket and if AMD's scaling is as good as I expect it to be then AMD should be the clear winner in each of the price comparisons.

And two cores on the 6950x would likely be the difference in power but as the 1800X matched or beats the 6950x in a lot of multithreaded tasks and the argument was Intel beats Ryzen in performance per watt those charts are very relevant. Darkest Ancient Guru Posts: 9956 Joined: 2003-03-25 #5436867 Posted on: 05/28/2017 11:05 PM I didn't even notice the 1500 there to be honest, although I was more using the same article that poster used as an example for performance per watt VS value than anything. The results seem odd given the 1500 is using less power than the 1400, but then I don't normally use the Hexus website. I'm not disagreeing with the thought that AMD is better than Intel in certain respects at the moment. I wouldn't touch a 4c4t Intel processor with a barge pole at the moment if I was in the process of building a new system. I think Ryzen offers incredible price/performance for most consumer market segments, and that unless you have specific needs that favour Intel hardware you're better off saving a chunk of money. 2 pages 1 2 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

Moran Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Requesting Swift Movement of MGT Act By Foreign Affairs Publisher  /  May 27, 2017  /  Comments Off on Sen. Moran Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Requesting Swift Movement of MGT Act       Print       Email MIL OSI United States – Source: United States Senator for Kansas – Jerry Moran Headline: Sen. Moran Leads Bipartisan Group of Senators Requesting Swift Movement of MGT Act WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) today authored a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee requesting swift consideration of the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act of 2017 (S. 990/H.R. 2227), legislation to modernize government information technology (IT), eliminate wasteful spending and strengthen cybersecurity. The letter was also signed by U.S. Senators Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.). “In the time that has passed since we first introduced this legislation, the threats of hacking, espionage and cybercrime have only grown more real,” said Sen. Moran. “This month we saw a worldwide ransomware attack that impacted hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Protecting our data has never been more important. By bringing government IT systems into the 21st century, not only can we strengthen the security of our data, we can save billions of taxpayer dollars by reducing long-term wasteful spending.” “Senators from both sides of the aisle recognize the urgency of this issue: as we have seen just this month with the ‘WannaCry’ attack, global cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pose a complex and serious threat to our national security,” said Sen. Udall. “But the federal government continues to rely on grossly outdated IT systems that make us vulnerable to such damaging cyberattacks. I welcome House passage of this bipartisan legislation, which will help federal agencies to retire old systems and invest in new and critical technologies. Maintaining old IT systems is a security risk and costs taxpayers billions of dollars each year. Now it’s time for the Senate to pass this bipartisan bill and see it signed into law, to ensure that our government is getting better service at a better value for American taxpayers.”? “Having spent twelve years in the technology sector, I know firsthand the threats cyber criminals pose and the need for modernized equipment to protect against attacks,” said Sen. Daines. “We have seen in recent years attacks on private business and governments that have crippling effects. It is more important now than ever to pass this important bipartisan legislation and bring the government into the modern era.”   “Ensuring that government agencies have the resources to invest in current technology is just smart management: Up-to-date systems means better service delivery and improved cyber security,” said Sen. Warner. “Our bipartisan legislation is a commonsense step to enable federal agencies to make these critical investments.” In the House, which passed the MGT Act with bipartisan support on May 17, the bill was led by U.S. Representatives Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). The bill is supported by a number of IT industry stakeholders and trade associations including the IT Alliance for the Public Sector (ITAPS), Professional Services Council (PSC), TechNet, Amazon Web Service, Cisco, Adobe, BMC, Brocade, Intel, Microsoft, Business Roundtable, CA Technologie, Compuware, CSRA, Level 3 and Unisys. Full text of the letter is below and can be found here.  Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member McCaskill, We write to respectfully request that the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs mark up the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act of 2017. We believe our bipartisan legislation complements your interest in improving how the federal government acquires, implements, and manages information technology (IT).  The federal government spends over $80 billion annually on major IT systems, with more than 75 percent expended on maintaining existing IT rather than investing in development, modernization and enhancement activities.  The rising cost of maintaining such “legacy” IT systems hinders the ability for agencies to replace their aging technology tools with more cost-effective solutions. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), federal IT systems use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks.[2] Aging federal IT systems may pose other serious security risks due to the inability to use data encryption, multi-factor authentication and other current security best practices. The MGT Act would establish IT working capital funds at the 24 agencies pursuant to the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-576) and a separate centralized modernization fund within the Department of the Treasury for a federal IT expert board to administer across the federal government.  Savings obtained by federal agencies through streamlining IT systems, replacing legacy products and transitioning to cloud computing can be placed in a working capital fund that can be accessed for up to 3 years for further modernization efforts. The House of Representatives has already approved its companion legislation, H.R. 2227, which passed by voice vote on May 17, 2017.  The MGT Act garnered endorsements from numerous stakeholder groups, including the IT Alliance for the Public Sector (ITAPS), Professional Services Council (PSC), TechNet, Amazon Web Service, Cisco, and others.  Reporting the MGT Act out of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs will help advance our shared goal of preserving national security and ensuring that the federal government uses taxpayer dollars wisely.  Thank you for your consideration and your continued leadership on these issues.  ###     Print       Email Published: 1 week ago on May 27, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 27, 2017 @ 7:50 pm Filed Under: Americas, English, MIL OSI, News Releases, Open Source Intel, United States, United States Government, United States of America, United States Senate, United States Senator for Kansas - Jerry Moran NEXT ARTICLE → Queensland’s NAIF announcement a nail in the coffin for Adani’s Carmichael mega-mine ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Motorists advised to drive with caution on Tamaki Drive, Auckland About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts UN chief strongly condemns terrorist attacks in London Statement on investigation into London Bridge and Borough Market terror attacks New York-Israel Global Path Through History Initiative New York-Israel Global Path Through History Initiative Canadian Defence Minister and Chief of the Defence Staff Attend Asia Security Summit © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Computing as either a laptop or a tablet is becoming an industry standard — even long-time holdouts like Apple, with the iPad Pro, have dipped their toes in the 2-in-1 water. Into this crowded field comes Samsung’s Microsoft Pro 4 clone, the Galaxy Book. Spec-wise, it’s a fierce machine: The Galaxy Book boasts a lot of the cutting edge in hybrid tablets. This includes a sharp Super AMOLED display, with a 2,160-by-1,440 resolution, the latest, fastest, fanless Intel Core i5 processor, and two USB-C ports to plug in all your peripherals. (We should say — we're testing out the 12-inch version. There is also a 10-inch version that is considerably cheaper, and has considerably less going for it.) There’s plenty of storage offered, starting at 128GB and going up to 512GB, and plenty of memory for all your computing needs, with 8GB of RAM. ALSO: 72 Hours With the iPad Pro The Galaxy Book comes bundled with a keyboard cover and included S-Pen, unlike, say, the iPad Pro or the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, whose pens and keyboards are sold separately. If you’re in the market for a new laptop and you’d like a tablet for all your entertainment, the Galaxy Book is a fair value proposition, with a starting price of $1,130. Over three days, we put the hybrid tablet through the motions. Here’s what we found. Day 1 The first thing you notice about the Galaxy Book is how thin it is for a full-powered Windows tablet — before you put the cover on. At only a few millimeters thin and 1.6 pounds heavy, the tablet itself is easy to pick up and carry around one-handed (not a trivial detail for those looking to replace their laptop). When you slap the keyboard cover on, it definitely adds a little density and heft into the mix, but that’s at least partially because of the quality of the keyboard itself: It’s unrivaled in the 2-in-1 community, as far as we can tell. While Type Covers for the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 have valued thinness and low-key travel, the Galaxy Book’s keyboard has more of a full-on laptop feel to it. That means the keys are snappy, have lots of travel, and are generously spaced. In other words, you feel like you’re typing on a laptop. Typing this review right now might be a breeze, but I immediately notice one of the hybrid’s biggest weaknesses: The keyboard cover is flimsily adjustable to three positions, so while you can modify the Galaxy Book’s “lapability” (how well the laptop sits in your lap), like you can with the Surface Pro 4, there’s a bit of a balancing act going on. That’s due to the fact that the tablet itself doesn’t have an adjustable stand, but relies on the keyboard to stay vertical. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but not a deal breaker. ALSO: Tablets That Do It All for Under $100 And the battery life? We’ve only been typing this review for a couple hours, switching between Word and Chrome on medium brightness, and the tablet’s already drained 25 percent of its battery. The Galaxy Book might just squeeze by with an all-day battery life, but barely. Day 2 Since the Galaxy Book comes boxed with software, we needed an update. That's when we noticed something: While the Galaxy Book performed the update well, it got hot. Very hot. The Galaxy Book relies on Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor, an i5 that doesn’t require a fan, but in this instance, the tablet feels like it could use one. The included S-Pen is certainly one of the bigger draws (no pun intended) of the Galaxy Book. The S-Pen isn’t pressure sensitive, like the Apple Pencil, but performs admirably. The tip moves across the screen smoothly, and there’s no delay in what you’re drawing and what you end up seeing on the screen. In order to plug in any peripherals — a mouse, a hard drive, what have you — we needed to use an adapter (or “dongle”) because there are two USB-C ports, and that’s all you get. Either port will charge the device when it’s plugged in. You’re seeing more and more USB-C ports on machines, such as the new Macbook Pros, and that’s because they’re becoming a highly adaptable universal standard. We’re glad to see them included on the Galaxy Book — it keeps the device thin, and with a simple adapter, you can plug in whatever you’d like. Of course, you’ll have to pay extra for that dongle. Day 3 By day three, it's clear that the Samsung Galaxy Book is a breeze to get used to, and is capable of running multiple programs and windows without any slowdown. We wrote in Word, browsed in both Chrome and Edge, and played a video in VLC without experiencing any stuttering or slowdowns.  The batteries, however, continue to be a problem. Barely half an hour into working, we’re down to 85 percent life. We checked, and there were no demanding tasks outside of Chrome and Word. Samsung estimates that the tablet will get 10 hours or so of life with mixed use, but we’re entirely skeptical. Then again, it could just be our test model. It’s evident that the Galaxy Book is meant to be a Surface Pro 4 competitor — and, for right now, it beats the Surface Pro 4 in terms of specs. The Galaxy Book has the latest hardware, but the Surface Pro 5 is expected soon, so the Galaxy Book won’t be top-of-the-line for too incredibly long. It’s sure to beat the Surface Pro 5 in price — at $1,300 or so, keyboard and pen included, it’s a really great value — and the keyboard is one of the best we’ve used with a 2-in-1. But the Galaxy Book could use some finessing in terms of its keyboard cover’s “lapability,” battery life, and heat. When it comes to a Windows machines, we say Microsoft makes the best ones. Samsung’s new Galaxy Book isn’t far behind, and more budget friendly. If you’re looking for a Windows 2-in-1 to replace your laptop, in a thin design and future-proofed with USB-C ports, it’s a good deal.  More News The Sleeping Bag Re-Imagined: A Field Test of the ZenBivy Bed The Best Bike Helmets for Every Kind of Rider Everyday Carry — The 5 Multi-Tools that Can Do It All Bespoke Is Better: 15 Handmade Accessories You Can't Get Anywhere Else Upgrade to a Better Beer Fridge All Stories Want More?

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 27, 2017 6:23 PM Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. (Reuters) Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. You May Also Like To Watch This: The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. J Jack Smith May 28, 2017 at 5:39 pm Apple has become the vapor ware company and it really saddens me. We hear that Apple will do a self driving car but then nothing. Apple will do a TV streaming service and we get nada! Apple will create their own cloud and even gets a code name of McQueen but nothing produced. Continue spending over 600m a year to use Google cloud and still has a large chunk running on AWS. Apple resorts to leaking something so they do not look so pathetic and we get nothing. I remember when Apple kept things secret and close to the vest and then when it was done and really something surprised us and completely blew us away and then I loved those words and you can buy it today! I have goose bumps right now. This is not my Apple any longer.

By: Bloomberg | Published:May 27, 2017 1:02 pm Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Related News Apple WWDC 2017: Look for signs when Tim Cook takes the stage Apple WWDC 2017: iOS 11 to Siri speaker, everything to be announced Apple WWDC 2017: Refreshed MacBooks, Siri-powered speaker, and more announcements expected Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

Even today the first generation TPUs beat anything commercially available. But Google now has generation 2 which is just miles ahead of anything else. A TPU pod is able to generate 11.5 peta flops of fp16. No that is NOT a typo. But the key is Google is doing it on a small fraction of the power of any compe or. So Google inference per joule is a tiny fraction of someone like Nvidia. Smart move on Apple to try to copy Google and create something similar.

Home > News By Company > Market Research Hub Tweet   Global Client Solid-State Drive (SSD) Market to grow at a CAGR of 36.14% during the period 2017-2021 An SSD is a solid state disk or an electronic disk that is used for data storage and is built out of semiconductors. It uses the same I/O interface design as HDDs and stores data in solid state memory.   Market Research Hub - Market Research Company (EMAILWIRE.COM, May 27, 2017 ) An SSD is a solid-state disk or an electronic disk that is used for data storage and is built out of semiconductors. It uses the same I/O interface design as HDDs and stores data in solid state memory. They are made of silicon microchips and stores data electronically. These devices use dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or negative-AND (NAND)-based flash memory to store data. The lack of moving parts reduces the risk of mechanical failures of SSDs allowing data transfer at higher speeds. In addition, they are suited for harsh environments, extreme shock, high altitude, and consume less power. Request For Free Sample @ http://www.marketresearchhub.com/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=1107450 This market research study identifies Samsung, Kingston, Lite-On, and Toshiba as the leading players in the global client solid-state drive (SSD) market. A comprehensive analysis of this market is also presented by the end-user (laptops and PCs), by product (MLC NAND, TLC NAND, and 3D NAND), and by geography (the Americas, APAC, and EMEA). According to Market Research Hubs market research report, the global client solid state drive market will grow rapidly during the next four years and in terms of units, will post an impressive CAGR of more than 36% by 2021. The enhanced performance and durability of SSDs will drive the growth prospects for the client solid-state drive market during the projected period. The market is witnessing a huge shift from HDDs towards SSDs because HDDs are more susceptible to damage, hold up a high-traffic environment, require loads of extra RAM to work normally, and physically scans the disk for reads/writes. SSDs reaches memory addresses much faster, contains no physical tracks or sectors, exhibits better performance with high I/O environments, offers instant access, faster file transfers, quicker boot ups, and an overall faster computing experience, which in turn, will result in the increased sales volume of SSDs. The client SSD market in APAC accounted for the majority market share during 2016 and the region will continue its dominance in the forthcoming years as well. The markets growth in this region is mainly attributed to the presence of major vendors in countries such as South Korea and Japan and the rise in indigenous manufacturing in the region.

We will journey to the Amazon to discover the secret history of Wonder Woman, hop over to New Orleans to hear the funk-soul of Tank and the Bangas and fly home to Portland to hear about the clown who inspired “The Simpsons” character Krusty the Clown. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman Courtesy of Warner Brothers/DC Entertainment A Lasso, A Lady and A Legacy: Wonder Woman In Comics And Film - 1:18 Great Hera’s Girdle! Wonder Woman fans of all ages and stripes are eagerly awaiting the roll-out of the Amazing Amazon’s new feature film. It’s almost more than we can bear, from the Lynda Carter flashbacks to conceptually suspect campaigns to introduce Wondy as a UN spokeswoman and purveyor of protein bars. We’ve gone peak nerd and can’t resist drawing your attention to several related stories, including comic book store events in Redmond, Salem, Hillsboro, St. Johns, and Eugene. If you can’t get to a retailer, there are still plenty of Wonder Woman comics to check out. Did you know one of the most celebrated writers in the character’s history lives in Portland? We chat up comic book writer Greg Rucka about his history with the character. We also touch base with a BDSM practitioner to ask: Exactly what is up with the bracelets and rope stuff, anyway? Then there’s the matter of going to the movie. The Portland chapter of Women in Film is pleased to invite you along for a Friday night screening, to show support for the first $100+ million budget blockbuster action film in the hands of a female director. While the trailers are flying fast and furious on the big screen, several observers, including the Women in Film ladies, have noticed that the early marketing effort belies something less than full support. (Here’s a bit chunkier read from Adweek.) It seems entirely possible that a world without a Wonder Woman breakfast cereal tie-in might not be so bad for the film’s prestige. You decide. And we’ll see you in the popcorn line next weekend.  Could Holograms Bring The Universe To A Classroom Near You? - 24:55 A virtual trip to the pyramids? An interactive hologram of the solar system? Virtual reality has the potential to transform the classroom and how we learn everything from history to astronomy to engineering. A unique local partnership between Oregon Story Board, Intel and Clackamas Community College received a prestigious grant from Microsoft to create and test an educational curriculum for the company’s mixed reality Hololens, which allows users to see and interact with holograms laid over the real world. They found that the potential to help students understand complex systems like the automatic transmission was stunning. If you want to learn even more about virtual reality, Oregon Story Board is offering a variety of VR and Mixed Reality design classes starting June 5. And for more on how Oregon’s incredible VR ecosystem, check out our story about a VR artists residency and our story about how architects are using VR to dream up new buildings. Tank and the Bangas perform at OPB 5-10-17 David Stuckey/OPB opbmusic Session With Tank And The Bangas - 30:53 Thousands of bands entered NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest this year, but the judges said the answer was clear: The New Orleans band Tank and the Bangas. Filmed in a classroom, the video for their song “Quick” schooled us with infectious joy and introduced viewers all around the world to the band’s funk-soul-spoken-word style and the rapid-fire storytelling of Tarriona “Tank” Ball. You can hear the full interview and watch the performance here. Also, don’t miss their high-energy live show at Pickathon in August.  Playwright’s Estate Says “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” Can’t Be Performed With A Black Actor - 39:17 This month, a Portland Production of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” by Edward Albee made headlines — without an actor setting foot on-stage. A Portland producer had planned to stage the play this fall, casting an African-American actor, Damien Geter, in one of the four lead roles. However, as Albee was notoriously strict about casting, his estate delivered an ultimatum: cast a white actor in the role or lose the rights to the production. The producer Michael Streeter cancelled the play. Streeter talked about his decision with OPB’s Dave Miller and with Brian Herrera, an Assistant Professor of Theater at Princeton University who’s working on a book about casting. The Portland Clown Who Inspired The Simpsons - 48:25 And now … a blast from Portland’s past. OPB digital producer John Rosman recently produced a birthday video tribute to an icon: the entertainer who helped to inspire Krusty the Clown from “The Simpsons.” Rusty Nails was a much-loved staple in the Portland entertainment community back in his day, and, despite his dangerous name, nothing like the depressed, alcoholic Krusty.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 27 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

By Tiernan Ray May 26, 2017 4:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple (AAPL) is working on a computer chip that would “offload” tasks in artificial intelligence, according to an article today by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, citing a single unnamed source. Gurman writes that the A.I. chip, dubbed "Apple Neural Engine” internally, would be meant for “devices,” meaning, the company’s iPhone and iPad. It’s not yet clear if it will be available this year, according to his source. Gurman writes that the device is meant to take over some processing done currently by the microprocessor or “application processor,” and by the graphics processing unit, or “GPU,” circuitry. Apple’s custom “A” series chips in its iOS devices fulfill both those roles. As Gurman notes, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google unit has developed its own chips for machine learnings, called “TPUs,” the second version of which were shown by the company last week at its annual developer conference. Such chips can to an extent be competition for parts from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), at least in the data center. I penned an article for Barron’s print magazine in October of 2015 that said cloud computing companies would develop more and more custom parts for tasks that relate to A.I., such as machine learning. Google, for one, has boasted of how its chips can beat traditional CPUs and GPUs in machine-learning tasks. Apple stock today closed down 26 cents at $153.61.

Markets News provided by Research and Markets 26 May, 2017, 16:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "QLC in the Datacenter" report to their offering. With the explosion in data content, the use of data has transitioned from simply recording transactions to using it to make important decisions and gain new insights for competitive advantage. As a result, storage has to become faster, cheaper and more scalable. Hard disk drives have been the primary workhorse for a wide range of storage applications including mission critical drives for high performance. However, the relentless cost declines of NAND flash memory have already catapulted NAND flash-based solid state storage to become the solution of choice in performance-critical applications. In addition, NAND flash memory's transition from 2D to 3D technology has enabled enterprise SSD capacities already exceeding that of enterprise HDDs. The introduction of QLC technology is expected to drive SSD capacities even higher. Where do fat QLC-based SSDs fit in the datacenter and can they compete with fat HDDs? QLC in the Datacenter examines these questions.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops Microsoft Surface Pro (2017) vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop Emily Ferron May 26, 2017 A spec-by-spec look at how the two newest devices in Microsoft's Surface line compare View gallery - 25 images Microsoft rounded out its Surface lineup this month by introducing the all-new education-focused Surface Laptop and the latest generation of the Surface Pro. Here's how the specs and features of these devices compare. Form factor NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW The biggest difference between these two machines is their form factor. The Surface Pro is a tablet first; it doubles as a laptop with the addition of a Type Cover keyboard accessory (sold separately). The Surface Laptop is a classic clamshell-style laptop. Size For the Surface Pro, the measurements shown here are for the tablet only. The Type Cover adds a small amount of bulk, but overall, the Surface Laptop is still the larger device. Weight Again, the weight shown here does not include the keyboard for the Surface Pro, but it's still considerably lighter than the Laptop. For reference's sake, the Surface Pro Signature Edition Type Cover adds an additional 0.31kg. Build materials (case) Microsoft uses a magnesium alloy for its entire Surface lineup, excepting the Surface Laptop, which is aluminum. If you get your hands on one of these, you'll also notice a different material used in the keyboard. The Laptop has an Alcantara fabric-covered keyboard that makes for a soft touch and sound while typing. The Signature Type Cover for the Surface Pro also incorporates Alcantara. Display size The smaller Surface Pro offers 83-percent of the overall display area of the 13.5-inch Surface Laptop. Both have a 3:2 aspect ratio. Touchscreen display Both Surfaces have touchscreen displays. Display resolution The Surface Pro has higher resolution, but it probably not enough to make a significant difference for most day-to-day use. Fingerprint sensor Neither machine has a built-in fingerprint sensor, but some older editions of the Type Cover for the Surface Pro are equipped with one, and they appear to be forward-compatible. Facial recognition You're not out of luck when it comes to biometrics, however. Both devices support the facial recognition feature in Windows Hello, for fast, secure logins with just your face. Stylus support Again, both devices support the Surface Pen active stylus – but it is not included with either of them. The Surface Pen retails on its own for US$99. Processor The latest generation Intel Core processors show up in both of these devices. However, the entry-level Surface Pro has a less-powerful core m3 processor and the Laptop goes straight for the i5 chip. Graphics Every configuration has embedded graphics with no options to upgrade. RAM Each machine contains 4, 8 or 16 GB of RAM, but your exact options depend on which processor you choose. Storage Both are available with 128, 256 or 512 GB of built-in storage. The Surface Pro has an additional 1 TB option. Fanless For the quietest computing, you'll want to go fanless. You have that option with the m3 and i5 variants of the Surface Pro. Ports Ports stand pat. Microsoft has equipped each with one USB 3.0 port (not the newer USB-C standard) and a mini DisplayPort. SD card reader The Surface Pro has a microSD slot, but not the Laptop. Dedicated charging port You won't have to occupy that precious USB port to charge your device. Both are equipped with a Surface Connect port for dedicated charging. Speakers The Surface Pro has standard stereo speakers, but the Surface Laptop has so-called omnisonic speakers built into the keyboard. Battery Microsoft's battery life estimates are fairly impressive. If they are accurate, then both of these can get you through a work day (and then some) without charging. Camera The Pro has a tablet-like camera configuration with both a front and rear shooter. The Laptop has a 720p webcam. Software The Surface Pro runs a full version of Windows 10. The default option for the Surface Laptop is Windows 10 S, a walled version of the OS that only supports apps downloaded from the Windows Store. This is purportedly to keep prices low and the system robust. If Windows 10 S sounds like a hassle, Microsoft is offering free upgrades to the full version of Windows 10 until the end of the year. After that, it will require an additional fee. Release Both are available for pre-order now to start shipping in a few short weeks. Starting price The entry-level Surface Pro is the least expensive device, but once you consider accessories and upgrades, it easily becomes more expensive than the Surface Laptop. These prices do not include the Signature Type Cover (US$160), so if you want an all-in-one Intel core i5 or i7, it's cheaper to go with the Laptop. It's likely that preferences here will come down to form factor. For some, the portability and flexibility of a tablet will be a major advantage, but for others, it could be an unnecessary complication.

Join the battlefield littered with artillery shells and turn the tide of war to your team’s favor. "The new laptop from MSI is a great choice for those who are used to playing on the top settings. This machine is able to show "Tanks" in all its glory and is one of the best offerings on the market at the moment. Looking forward to the start of sales to please their players," said Maxim Chuvalov, product Manager of World of Tanks. Each Tank-designed GP62M is made with delicate craftsmanship. An image of the unique tank IS-2 will be embedded onto the top-cover and the palm rest, forging an impregnable appeal with IS-2’s commanding presence, elevating overall appeal and quality. With the new Intel® 7th Generation Core i7 CPU, AKA Kaby Lake, gamers are expected to experience up to 10% in CPU performance boost, 4K gaming and 4K video transcoding. GP62M provides 2 GPU options that boost performance in high-definition games and support DirectX 12 features to deliver super-fast, smooth, power-efficient gameplay. Performance comparison between GeForce GTX1050Ti and GeForce GTX965M is shown in 3Dmark11; and with GP’s OC tools to turbo charge the 1050Ti model, it even outperforms GeForce® GTX970M. On the other hand, GeForce GTX1050 also offers superior performance over 965M but at more approachable prices. Steelseries RGB gaming keyboard has ergonomically-designed keys with 1.9mm of key travel for high responsive and tactile feedback; optimum WASD zone and supports anti-ghosting for up to 45 keys. Mechanical-level Shielding solution makes up the robust and durable keyboard. Gamers can enjoy the briliant 100+ Backlighting Combinations with high-grade silver lining printed keys.

According to Nvidia Acer, HP, Asus, Clevo and MSI will all be embedding the new GPy into some of their laptop models. Nvidia has not been sharing any specification on the product, however it should be up-tp 4x faster than a Intel HD620-gpu as used in Kaby lake processors. On the product page as stated, specs are missing. the manufacturers can change the specifications withing the laptop configuration. The MX150 however is based upon the same GP108 GPU that launched earlier last week as the GeForce GT 1030. That GPU has 384 shader processors, a 64-bit memory bus and 2 GB GDDR5 memory. GeForce MX150 based laptops will hit the stores roughly half June. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

I am more of miser with my money then that, the lack of DVI-I on these new cards is also issue for current set up. which would mean i would have buy new AV receiver with 6+ hdmi to be able to keep everything hooked up which i dont want to do ether. I buy something i usual have buyers remorse, and there 50% chance i send it back, which i another reason why i dont buy hardware stuff offten anxious_f0x Maha Guru Posts: 1070 Joined: 2013-11-08 #5436427 Posted on: 05/27/2017 12:37 AM I remember trying to play Unreal Tournament 2004 on an GeForce4 MX440 back in the day, such a bad card tsunami231 Ancient Guru Posts: 7289 Joined: 2003-05-24 #5436429 Posted on: 05/27/2017 12:47 AM I remeber trying to play doom3 on such card, at time i had a 9800gt, well i remember my uncle trying it was slide show of mega proportions. it forced him for first time to pay more then 70$ for gpu. I want to see xx60 series with sub 150 tdp with power of 1080gtx, for about 300$ that might still be wishful thinking though. Only upgrade my GPU every 3 gen if not longer and some time wait till the gpu dies XD Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum. Guru3D.com © 2017

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 26, 2017 11:36am   Comments Share: Amid the hype of the WannaCry scare, which catalyzed a 43-percent pop in bitcoin value, the cryptocurrency is all anyone’s talking about. In the last two months, it has more than tripled in price, from $925.20 on March 24 to $2,791.70 May 25. Wednesday’s rate was more than double that of April 30 and represented a 447-percent year-over-year gain. At the beginning of 2015, it was trading below $200, and at a present rate of $2,577.32, it’s continuing to shatter all-time highs. But even as the bitcoin rockets, some traders are disinclined to engage. Why Some Won’t Buy Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC and co-host of Benzinga’s PreMarket Prep radio show, remains skeptical, deterred primarily by uncertainty surrounding valuation and price targeting. “How do I sit back and crunch numbers and come up with a fundamental value for bitcoin?” he quipped on Thursday’s PreMarket Prep. “If you have a traditional currency like the Canadian dollar, you can look at trade, you can look at interest rates, you can look at what shape the economy is in to try to get a gauge for if people are going to demand Canadian dollars or not.” Jeff Goldman, author of "Failed Traders," can empathize.

It Is If You Bought Bitcoin 7 Years Ago “It just comes down to supply and demand,” Goldman said on the show. “But the supply part is set on bitcoin, and now all it is is being demand-driven right now, so fundamentally, I don’t know how you value it, to be honest.” But that hasn’t prevented him from trying. Goldman weighs cryptocurrencies’ fundamental values partly by looking at “smart players” and high-profile companies buying in, and it appears other investors entertain similar strategies. Since Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) made a February play on Ethereum, the currency’s value has rose from $14.58 to $193.04. Another method of valuation is tracking the scheduled mining of bitcoins. Specific quantities are released periodically, and the exact number in circulation is easily discovered for calculations. Goldman’s Bitcoin Play As a believer in blockchain technology, Goldman first bought bitcoin in April 2015 at a value around $250. He continues to hold most of his portfolio amid all-time highs but has begun to sell some “because it’s just getting way, way bubbly at this point.” “Right now, I think this is being driven by everybody wanting to get in,” he said. “There are only 16 million bitcoins ━ that’s not a lot of bitcoins [...] It’s really just hitting the news now, and there are real investors wanting to get in, and there’s just not a lot of supply of bitcoin.” Related Link: SEC To Review Decision Denying Bitcoin Market Listing Despite his active participation, Goldman understands why many opt for the sidelines. “To buy bitcoin is not all that easy,” he said. The process begins with opening an account through a platform like Coinbase and linking to a bank account. After that, traders are limited in the amount they can invest until they provide more personal information, such as a photo ID or social security number. Then the ceiling rises. Additionally, coin delivery takes days from the time of purchase, so access is not immediate.
