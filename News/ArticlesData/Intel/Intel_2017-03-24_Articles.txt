Blog :  For Cutting Edge IT, You’ll Need the Cloud Article :  IT Business Edge 2016 Editorial Calendar IBM Locks Down VMware on Public Clouds Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 24 Mar, 2017          |         |     Share IBM is working with Intel and HyTrust to provide a means of locking down VMware virtual machines on IBM Cloud. At the IBM InterConnect 2017 conference this week, the three companies unfurled IBM Cloud Secure Virtualization, which makes use of Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) on x86 servers to lock down a VMware virtual machine. John Considine, general manager for cloud infrastructure at IBM, says IBM has been offering this capability on physical servers. But now with help from HyTrust, IBM can extend Intel TXT all the way up to the virtual machine itself. Considine says partnering with HyTrust is critical because it enables IT organization to implement a consistent set of security and management polices across a hybrid VMware cloud environment. VMware has partnered with both IBM and Amazon Web Services to create those hybrid clouds in addition to building its own cloud service. In addition to being available today, Considine says that support for Intel TXT means IT organizations can be certain that their virtual machines are running in one specific location. That is crucial when it comes to passing an audit associated with any number of compliance regulations or laws involving data sovereignty, says Considine. “Companies need to be able to geo-lock their data,” says Considine. IBM is betting that as more enterprise IT organizations look to public clouds to host instances of VMware, the ability to specify where those machines are located will push many of those organizations toward an IBM cloud. Of course, it remains to be seen what AWS will ultimately offer once its alliance with VMware starts to bear fruit. But for now at least, any IT organization that needs to lock down a VMware virtual machine running on a public cloud to achieve compliance will need to be sure whether Intel TXT is available or not.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit As we saw two weeks ago, AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is excellent in many regards. Hurrah. But its most conspicuous weakness is gaming. Haroo. Ryzen really is awfully important for all PC enthusiasts, so it’s worth a closer look at just what is going on with Ryzen and PC gaming. Be warned, however, for now there aren’t any easy answers. Part of the problem is the inevitably silly scheduling of big product launches. I understand some of our American cousins got as much as a week with Ryzen before the reviews were published. Back here in Blighty, I only got my hands on the thing 24 hours before the story went up and I was not alone in that. Moreover, Ryzen is a brand new and largely unknown architecture which makes everything a lot more complicated. At launch, in other words, it just wasn’t possible to have a complete handle on how the thing performed and why. Anyway, the broad picture from the first round of reviews was that Ryzen was hot stuff for multi-threaded apps and decent in terms of single-threaded performance but suffered from some performance blackspots, many of which just so happened to overlap with games. Bit of a bummer. The immediate rationalisation was that games simply aren’t optimsed for Ryzen. They’re largely developed on Intel platforms and often using tools like Intel’s own compilers. So it’s no surprise to see occasionally mediocre games performance on Ryzen. Unfortunately, on reflection that argument doesn’t really bear scrutiny. For starters, virtually none if not very actually none of the benchmarks used in any of the reviews were optimised for Ryzen. Cinebench isn’t optimised for Ryzen. But it absolutely bloody flies. Likewise, many games are indeed designed first to run on AMD hardware – namely the AMD CPU cores found in the current high-performance console duo. Granted, those low-power AMD cores bear little relation to the new Ryzen chip. But they bear even less relation to any Intel CPU core, on which they pretty much all run very well, it must be said. An optimisation issue or just basically borked? So, there really must be something quite specific about Ryzen that’s causing the problem. That isn’t to say that it can’t be solved with optimisations. But as a generic PC-compatible CPU, Ryzen must have a few wrinkles. Frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s a brand new architecture and AMD simply doesn’t have the man power and resources to polish its product to quite the same sheen as Intel. Indeed, when some early benchmark numbers leaked out and looked extremely promising, it was just this scenario that prevented me from getting too excited. Ryzen was looking quick. But would it also be a bit, for want of a better word, buggy? For AMD’s part, in an official statement it very much pointed the finger for perceived gaming performance shortfalls at a lack of optimisation: “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR.” Its immediate response is to seed over 300 Ryzen kits to game developers with a view to supporting a flurry of optimisation work. But I’m not completely comfortable with AMD’s attitude as it stands. Aside from the obvious issue of console ports initially developed for AMD CPU cores, my personal experience simply doesn’t tally with AMD’s statement. I revisited a few games and while many are indeed subjectively indistinguishable running on Ryzen as opposed to an Intel CPU, that doesn’t apply to all. In subjective terms, to give just one example, Total War: Attila running on Ryzen is tangibly choppier than a typical Intel processor. There’s no getting away from it. But why, exactly, might that be given Ryzen’s basic performance is competitive to say the least? Currently, there are a number of candidate problems that may eventually be deemed the prime culprit. They include the specifics of AMD’s simultaneous multi-threading technology which, like Intel’s HyperThreading, allows a single CPU core to crunch two software threads in parallel. Then there’s the basic architecture of Ryzen which consists, essentially, of two quad-core modules. The talk here is of latencies in communication between the two modules. See those two big rectangular lumps? Those are the dual quad-core modules… Compatibility issues with the ways Windows 10 schedules software threads and indeed how that relates to both Ryzen’s multi-threading and its modular architecture are also in the mix. For now, however, AMD is dismissing much of that: “We have investigated reports alleging incorrect thread scheduling on the AMD Ryzen™ processor. Based on our findings, AMD believes that the Windows® 10 thread scheduler is operating properly for “Zen,” and we do not presently believe there is an issue with the scheduler adversely utilizing the logical and physical configurations of the architecture.” And: “We have investigated reports of instances where simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) is producing reduced performance in a handful of games. Based on our characterization of game workloads, it is our expectation that gaming applications should generally see a neutral/positive benefit from SMT.” You can read AMD’s view in more detail here. But the overall upshot of all this is that we probably won’t know exactly how Ryzen’s gaming performance is going to shake out until a good number of game developers have had a crack at optimising their engines. Until then the same conclusion I drew last time applies. Ryzen is a great chip at a fantastic price. But the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers.

The R7 chips were never really that gaming-oriented anyway. You don’t need 8 cores for current games.

Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:12 geldonyetich says: One thing I was wondering about this: are AMD (formerly ATI) graphics cards inherently more compatible with AMD CPUs? Because currently I have a pair of GeForce 970s running in SLI which are, in all honestly, complete and absolute overkill. However, they are running an an AMD FX-8120 (an earlier revision) which is I feel is getting a tad long in the tooth, even though it’s perfectly adequate at running anything that isn’t Planetside 2. Consequently, while my benchmarks with the same cards aren’t very impressive as some, I wonder at the necessity of upgrading. So, theoretically, lets say I want to get the best possible performance out of SLI 970s. Would it matter if my motherboard/CPU is based on Intel architecture or not? Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 21:32 Don Reba says: I don’t think there is such a thing as CPU-GPU compatibility. Those choices are completely independent. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 01:59 Harvey says: While you’re right, it’s worth noting that if you buy an AMD graphics card and and want to use your old Nvidia graphics card for PhysX, you cannot, as Nvidia will detect red and disable the feature. I recall dimly that Nvidia cards disable physX with an AMD chipset mobo too, but as i type this I realize that’s probably not the case. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 03:30 Person of Interest says: A recent interview with AMD CEO Lisa Su at Anandtech sort of explained why AMD isn’t trying to bind its CPU’s and GPU’s too tightly: LS: What I’d like to say is (and you’ll appreciate this) that I love CPUs and GPUs equally, and the markets are a little bit different. And so think about it this way: our GPUs have to work with Intel CPUs, and our CPUs have to work with NVIDIA GPUs, so we have to maintain that level of compatibility and clarity. Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 01:33 tehfish says: I’m really not answering your main question here. But as someone with the same CPU (though in my case overclocked to 4.2ghz base clock no turbo) and just one of a comparable specced GPU (an R9 390) You are being CPU limited without doubt in some modern games. In my example, with AMD’s power saving active, the GPU might only be running at 2/3 the max GPU clockspeed as the CPU can’t keep up to fully load it. It still does surprisingly well considering the sheer age of the CPU, but it really is at it’s limit now for modern games… I’m saving for a Ryzen for when a few more models are out :) Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:01 aircool says: I’ve used AMD CPU’s and ATI GPU’s before. It always seemed that there would be some problem with one or the other when a game was released. Even now, after a game has released, the forums for that game will have a thread dedicated to some bug or screw up due to AMD hardware. These things often get fixed, but, now matter how clever the hardware, I refuse to use anything but Intel/Nvidia as the CPU and GPU (along with the dedicated mobo) are the most expensive parts of a PC. Too much risk (ah-hah… CPU pun) to throw £500-600 at team Red, even if their hardware performs better for less cost. Programs and games are generally more stable with Intel. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:35 Sakkura says: Nvidia has always had its share of driver issues, and for the past couple years I honestly think AMD has been considerably better than Nvidia on this point. HDMI color bug, the various embarrassing bugs at Pascal release, and so on. Log in to Reply 16/03/2017 at 22:42 Baines says: That depends a bit on the games, or more particularly on the publishers and dev studios. I’ve seen several console ports that have Nvidia-specific issues, particularly among titles by Japanese studios. You can also get the occasional bit of software that prefers an AMD CPU (and much more rarely might not even support an Intel CPU) simply because the devs favored using AMD chips over Intel. As for forums having a thread dedicated to AMD screw ups, to be fair it seems every game forum these days will have a bug/crash thread regardless of hardware. Maybe it will be AMD, maybe Nvidia, maybe Intel, maybe Win10, maybe controllers, … Something, and as likely several somethings, won’t work for some people. (Last time I looked, the UMvC3 thread had complaints because the fighting game released without support for the d-pad on Xbox 360 controllers. Something that almost no reviews mentioned, and which Capcom seemed to have no interest in addressing.) Intel and Nvidia are probably a more stable pairing, simply because the two see so much developer support and user support.

So I should spend my hard earned money on inferior hardware in order to support some fanboi’s favourite multinational corporation in its failing attempts to earn more than another? We’d all like to see real competition driving CPU innovation but wishful thinking and ‘supporting’ a so called little guy like a football team will just prolong stagnation. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:08 Yasha says: You know, this is precisely the type of marketing fallout that companies like Intel and Nvidia depend upon to make sales. Truthfully, programs are not “more stable” on Intel and Nvidia. AMD has had not had bad driver days in an awfully long time, and the only reason that “AMD = Bad Drivers” still exists in the consumers’ imagination is because of marketing techniques and silly comments like yours which continue to perpetuate lies and fear. You are saying that 500-600$ is too much money to drop on “unstable hardware” and thus AMD is a poorer choice. This is just false, and just because people say it all the time does not make it true. I should clarify and say that this post is NOT suggesting that you only buy AMD and never buy Intel or Nvidia. What I AM suggesting is that by perpetuating lies derived from corporate marketing, you are doing far more harm than you realize, for the narrative you spin finds a home in many hearts.

Ryzen wasn’t meant to be the king of the hill. It was meant to be competition. In that, it succeeded. Once the programmers learn to properly manage threads from sharing data across the CCX, this flaw can be mostly avoided. Do you think microsoft won’t optimize the scheduler to not move threads that communicate across CCX boundaries? Even with the flaw, I’m going to get awesome performance for a lot less. I’ve been clinging to my 8350 for a long time – and gaming just fine with it. Next year’s refresh might even take care of this issue anyway – just in time for us to complain about some other issue on a processor that costs half as much as it’s direct comparison. *eye roll* Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:30 ColonelFlanders says: I agree with this sentiment. What I also find a barmy notion is that any modern processors aren’t MORE than enough for gaming. A lot of people are acting like the flagship Ryzen not being *quite* as good as the flagship i7 makes a shit of a difference, when in fact any processor over £200 will do you for 5+ years of ultra settings. Hell, I have an i5 4570 which is about as entry level a gaming chip as you could get, and it’s still more than adequate for anything (except of course for Planet bastard Coaster, which needs Stanford’s distributed computing network to even bloody run). Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:44 xyzzy frobozz says: Well, technically, with only two companies making x86 chips, if you’re not first you are indeed last. But I totally agree with your sentiment. My next build will be AMD purely because the performance is more than acceptable at above 1080p, where I game. And, frankly, I’d like to support competition. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 05:52 ElementalAlchemist says: Jeremy if you are doing benchmarks you may want to investigate the effect of memory frequency. From what I have seen, frequency is having an inordinate effect on performance. I think Ryzen tops out at 2666, and it seems like it may be effectively bottlenecked by that in some cases, especially at lower frequencies. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:24 RCoon says: To echo this, Zen’s Infinity Fabric (the connect between the two CCX’s) clockspeed is directly tied to memory frequency. Increases in memory speed significantly improve performance. Basically for the first time in ages, memory speed actually matters. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:35 ElementalAlchemist says: You think their current frequency limit is hardware related (either CPU or chipset), or will it be able to be raised via a BIOS update in the future? I’m seeing high end DDR for Z270 boards with freqs up of 4266MHz, which is almost double. If Ryzen really is memory frequency limited, you’d have to wonder how it would perform with a few sticks of that tasty RAM. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 08:40 xyzzy frobozz says: If the problem is SMT, surely it’s easy enough to test it by disabling it? Hell, you’d still have up to eight cores, which is more than enough for pretty much any game out there. This should be easy to test and confirm/dismiss, surely? Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 12:43 Malcolm says: You could also go some way to ruling out the latency between the quad-core modules by setting the thread affinity of the .exe (assuming you can work out which of the logical cores map to which modules). Right click the process in the details tab in task manager -> Set affinity Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 13:43 MajorLag says: There’s a few things about this that seem strange to me. Firstly, modern games are much more GPU bound in my experience than CPU bound, so to see any significant difference in gaming experience when using such a high-end processor is odd. If I had to guess, it has less to do with the processor than some other part of the architecture that’s married to processor, something in the motherboard chipset, where it’s impossible to do a straight side-by-side comparison with Intel. Granted, my experience here is very limited since I don’t develop in the AAA game space, nor do I pay a whole lot of attention to the high-end graphical whizbang gaming scene at all, so take that with a grain of salt. I think the bit about optimization and console hardware is off the mark too. I’m not familiar with the situation, but I imagine that most developers use some form of game engine as a base that has, over the years, already been optimized for PC (Intel) and consoles (some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM?) in completely separate build paths, so “Optimized for Intel, not Rizen” is still pretty damn valid as an argument. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 16:28 ElementalAlchemist says: some non-Rizen architecture, I assume ARM? No, the PS4 and Xbone both use a customised (each slightly different) version of an x86 8 core AMD Jaguar CPU. It’s basically a laptop CPU.

Log in to Reply 19/03/2017 at 14:03 carewolf says: More a netbook CPU than a normal laptop CPU. But with 8 cores it is more like 4-8 netbook CPUs. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 15:16 pistachio says: Competition is always good but I am just too satisfied an Intel customer to switch to AMD. The first generation i7 i bought performed so far beyond expectation that I am still using it right now. Overclocked from 2.67 to 3.8, water-cooled it has never hit over 75 degrees, the mainboard a mid-range Asus P6, and the best memory available at that time, 5 years ago. The whole thing cost me around 1000 pounds without a graphics card, yes quite a lot but heck it has been worth it. Even though I am on a bit of a tight budget, I am simply not looking for a bargain anymore, that’s how much value I have gotten out of this machine. Just started saving a little earlier so I can do it again right now if i want to. But I don’t need to just yet, it still runs pretty much everything to my satisfaction. Happy with Ryzen’s arrival but I just don’t want to risk it.

It still performs perfectly adequate, but the chipset is a bit long in the tooth. No SATA600, no USB 3, those make no difference for gaming but for some of the more workstation-y loads (wouldn’t have an i7 if it was only for gaming) I’d like faster IO, so an upgrade is really due. I could add some of the above ports with PCIe cards to my system, but my massive CPU and GPU coolers are blocking most of the PCIe slots, leaving only some PCI slots open and what use are those. Regarding your system, Intel has no real successor for your 920, that was a bargain to get on the high end desktop platform. Right now you’d have to pay twice as much to get the cheapest high end Core i7 (the 6800K hexacore). If you’re willing to stay on your current platform and make it last even longer, you could get a Xeon W3670 3.2GHz hexacore, they’re quite cheap on eBay.

In the beginning it was a mixed bag in gaming for Athlon vs. the original Pentiums, but just a couple of months later you could no longer find a gaming web site that used Intel cpus at all–and that lasted for almost two years…;) In the coming months look for dramatic game-performance improvements for people restricted to 1080P or less. As we move past 1080P, however, the cpu becomes progressively less important to frame-rate performance, right now. Future is very bright for Ryzen–it’s a much newer architecture than Intel’s iX series, which is already very mature and tapped in terms of optimizations, etc. Log in to Reply 17/03/2017 at 20:31 rodan32 says: I pondered this a very long time. My poor old i5 2500k (or the mobo it’s in) started getting a little flaky. I’m glad AMD is back in the game; these look like nice chips at a good price. My kids game on APUs (I’ve got three of them; two A6s, and one A10), and I have no complaints at all about AMD quality or performance for the price. But I wound up replacing my i5 with an i3 7350K. The reason? Most of the games I play take more advantage of high single-core performance than multiple cores (I’m looking at you, KSP). The i3 7350K is a rocket in single-core stuff. I’ll have more AMD hardware in the future, as well as Intel and Nvidia. It’s all about matching up price/performance/need. I’m waiting to see how the R5 chips stack up before I drop on a new CPU for my choreputer (Plex server, game server, Teamspeak server, whatever crap I don’t want on my main machine). It’ll make better use of multiple cores. Log in to Reply 18/03/2017 at 08:10 uh20 says: Definitely picking up an APU when it is available. I have high expectations that it will be the gamechanger. Log in to Reply 24/03/2017 at 21:03 changeofpants says: I keep seeing the intimation that “Ryzen is bad for gaming,” frequently accompanied by accusations that AMD as a company has dropped the ball or something. I get that some gamey gaming gamers in the PC master race are obsessed with the absolute greatest number of foopas, but for the majority of gamers playing at 60hz or below, the difference between an 1800x and a 7700k will be invisible. Ryzen IS inferior for the gaming enthusiast/VR/high refresh rate monitor owners who mostly use their PC to play games, especially considering the $500 price point of the 1800x. However, for the typical person who games at 60hz and the people who use their computer for other things in addition to gaming, the sub-$300 hexa-core and sub-$200 quad-core chips are compelling. Users will soon have access to an unlocked 4c/8t for under $200, or a 6c/12t chip for about the same price that Intel charges for a 4c/4t chip. Assuming these lower core count Ryzen parts don’t dip below 60hz in game benchmarks, I bet budget-minded gamers will tend to go for the discernible utility of additional cores over the nigh-imperceptible benefit of 120hz headroom on their 60hz displays.

Woolsey confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that he attended a Sept. 19 meeting in New York City in which Flynn and two Turkish government ministers discussed ways to obtain and remove Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who has lived in the U.S. since 1999. Woolsey, who served under Bill Clinton, told The Wall Street Journal that the plan was to make “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away.” “It seemed to be naive,” Woolsey told the newspaper of the plan to remove Gulen, who lives in self-exile in the Pocono mountains of Pennsylvania. “I didn’t put a lot of credibility in it. This is a country of legal process and a Constitution, and you don’t send out folks to haul somebody overseas.” (RELATED: As Foreign Agent, Flynn Agreed To Form ‘Investigative Lab’ And Make ‘Criminal Referrals’) The Justice Department and federal court system would have final say over whether Gulen will be extradited. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants the extradition as he believes the imam was behind a failed coup attempt in July. Former head of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey, July 20, 2004. REUTERS/Mannie Garcia. Flynn and Woolsey met with the ministers, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and Berat Albayrak (Erdogan’s son-in-law), as part of a consulting contract that Flynn’s firm, Flynn Intel Group, signed with Inovo BV, a Dutch shell company operated by a businessman named Ekim Alptekin. In August, Flynn Intel and Alptekin signed a $600,000 contract for three months of work on the Gulen issue. Alptekin ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for the work. Woolsey said that specific tactics for the covert removal of Gulen were not discussed. If they had, he told The Journal that he would have openly questioned whether the plan was legal. The Daily Caller first reported the arrangement between Flynn Intel Group and Inovo BV in November, several days after Flynn wrote an op-ed calling for Gulen’s extradition. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying For Firm Linked To Turkish Government) At the time of that first report, the depth of Flynn’s work on the Gulen issue was not known. Alptekin denied in numerous interviews, including with TheDC, that he hired Flynn to work on the Gulen issue. Flynn registered his lobbying activity only with the Senate, which has relatively lax disclosure requirements. But earlier this month, the retired lieutenant general registered as a foreign agent of Turkey with the Justice Department. In detailed disclosure reports he acknowledged that Flynn Intel’s work likely benefited the Turkish government because it dealt with the Gulen issue, which is a major area of interest for the Turkish government. Ekim Alptekin (Youtube screen grab) TheDC also reported that Flynn pledged in his contract with Inovo BV to create an “investigative laboratory” consisting of former intelligence officials, including Woolsey and former FBI assistant director Brian McCauley, to conduct research on Gulen and potentially make criminal referrals in the case. Woolsey told TheDC, through a spokesman, that he did not authorize Flynn to list him as part of an investigative unit. Flynn Intel paid McCauley $28,000 for consulting work, disclosure reports show. Woolsey also told TheDC earlier this month that he received no compensation from Flynn Intel. He told The Journal that he did not accept payment because of what he heard in the Sept. 19 meeting. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, told The Journal that “at no time did Gen. Flynn discuss any illegal actions, nonjudicial physical removal or any other such activities.” The White House has said that President Trump was not aware of Flynn’s work for the Turkish government. Flynn, who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Obama, was fired as Trump’s national security adviser after only 24 days on the job because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador in December. Update: Floyd, the spokesman for Flynn, sent TheDC the following statement after publication of this article.  The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn, or anyone else in attendance, discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false.  No such discussion occurred.  Nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend, or afterwards.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News Titan Platform US Names Kelly DiGregorio as Chief Content Officer and Richard Sussman as Chief Revenue Officer SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Titan Platform US, a global creativity and technology development company based in Santa Monica, CA, announces the addition of digital media entertainment executives Kelly DiGregorio as Chief Content Officer and Richard Sussman as Chief Revenue Officer to head content strategy and business development for the U.S. “As we build out the US market for Titan and look to differentiate as a challenger brand, it all starts with top talent,” said Adrian Sexton, CEO, Titan Platform US. “Based on Kelly’s leadership at YouTube, Verizon, Intel and Alibaba’s Lazada, Titan will distinguish our smart content offering by giving it a defined programming voice. On the revenue side, Richard’s successes driving strategy and monetization across TiVo/Rovi, Gracenote, IPG, Nielsen and multiple start-ups will put Titan Platform on the global map for advertisers and businesses seeking to use data and video content to create more engaging consumer experiences.” Kelly DiGregorio, Chief Content Officer, comes to Titan Platform from Lazada, where she was SVP Partnerships for the Southeast Asia region. Alibaba acquired Lazada in April 2016 for $1 billion for an undisclosed majority stake. Prior to Lazada, DiGregorio was Director of Content Partnerships for Verizon Communications’ go90, joining the company as part of Verizon’s acquisition of Intel’s OnCue. DiGregorio spent six years in Content Partnerships at Google-owned YouTube, developing new business models and partnerships for digital content distributed across YouTube, GoogleTV, and Android Market/Google Play. She negotiated over 50 deals per quarter to launch YouTube’s staple AVOD partner program following Google’s acquisition, secured over 10,000 titles for the U.S. and Canada launch of Google Play TVOD/EST, and led content programming and production for over $20M in event-based brand sponsorships offered through YouTube’s on-demand and live streaming services. DiGregorio was instrumental in establishing both content and operations for Google Play, navigating partnerships with back-end partners such as Deluxe, DETE, Premiere Digital, and Rovi in addition to major studio partnerships. She was awarded the Producers Guild of America’s Digital VIP award for her work on YouTube’s first original programming fund, which developed into the video host’s $100M original channels initiative. As part of this channels initiative, DiGregorio helped incubate several new digital content networks, including the JASH comedy network (Sarah Silverman, Tim Heidecker & Eric Wareheim, Reggie Watts, Michael Cera), which has subsequently sold series to go90, Comedy Central, MTV and Syfy. At Intel’s OnCue, DiGregorio mixed digital programming deals with linear programming deals, setting the stage for OTT service MVPD rights with the broadcast and cable networks. DiGregorio’s prior work in branded media and filmed entertainment includes posts at Interpublic Group, New Line Cinema, and Warner Bros. With an initial focus on creating a curated, lean-back content experience for both U.S. and Asia, DiGregorio will lead content strategy and programming for Titan’s smart content platform across Titan’s set-top device and digital signage display network. Utilizing her experience at YouTube, DiGregorio will also work with talent, influencers and brands to develop content-enabled ecommerce that empowers programming distributed by Titan Platform with new forms of monetization. “With so many companies in the media space focused on either platform or hardware offerings, it’s inspiring from a content perspective to join a company that is forging a direct relationship between programming and distribution, and has the talent in both camps to pull it off,” said DiGregorio. “There’s a unique opportunity at Titan to curate content that enhances their ecosystem—spanning smart IoT, e-commerce and immersive entertainment experiences like VR and Cloud Karaoke.” Richard Sussman, Chief Revenue Officer for Titan Platform US, has more than eighteen years of experience as founder, board member, advisor and investor in a number of VC-funded, early-stage companies. Sussman comes to Titan from TiVo/Rovi with a proven track record in public companies including The Nielsen Company, which acquired Netratings for $328M where Sussman was revenue head. Nielsen then purchased the remaining interest in Nielsen Buzz Metrics for $47M which became Nielsen Digital where Sussman was monetization lead for its M&E business. Sussman was also business development lead at Baseline, Inc., acquired by Gracenote for $50M, and continued in this role when Tribune Media acquired Gracenote for $170M, then recently sold to Nielsen for $560M. Sussman oversaw the strategy of $500M in media spend strategy and optimization for companies like Hyundai-Kia, Logitech, PepsiCo, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, and Lionsgate Films. Sussman led partner and client growth closing several ten-digit multi-year SaaS, licensing and data solutions deals representing over 150 accounts with Google, Apple, Disney, Viacom, Netflix, NewsCorp, Samsung, Comcast and others. Sussman will lead growth strategy and monetization for Titan across the ecosystem platform with an emphasis on revenue partnerships, licensing and hardware sales for the smart set-top and display devices. He will also focus on related data discovery to inform the content and marketing offerings for the group. Sussman is building out a monetization team with key hires from Samsung and T-Mobile. “There are a lot of companies chasing platform innovations in AI, VR, IoT, and content-to-commerce services and they’re struggling to find their market position. Titan incorporates all of these diverse platforms into one agnostic ecosystem, providing media and technology gateways for home, education, medical, government and business,” said Sussman. “I’m excited to build Titan’s business solutions at this nexus of content, data and technology.” About Titan Platform US: Based in Los Angeles, Titan Platform US is creating a new ecosystem of “smarter content across smarter devices” with the clueworks set-top device which integrates IoT, Cloud Karaoke, 4K VR WiFi headsets, enhanced multimedia and content-to-commerce digital signage functionality, together with winvention, a highly encrypted and transactional smart content platform.

Wow...OK, Intel drives that start with 'DC' are for Data Center use - so no, not for average guy, and they NEVER claimed that. It's about endurance, not size or speed, server loads like SQL can kill SSD's fairly quick. Did you guys even read the article? It's not for you. Get over it and move on. The Optane brand is being applied several technologies. I think you might be confusing this with the Optane 'DIMMS' coming soon for Kaby Lake/Z270.

(Casper) Share Written by Anne Quito Obsession How We Buy March 24, 2017 Restless insomniacs, this is for you. Casper, pioneers of the burgeoning online mattress industry, are airing a series of mysterious late-night TV commercials designed to lull viewers to sleep. Airing between 2 am to 5 am in 13 cable channels in the US (including USA, AMC, Comedy Central, TBS, and TNT), Casper’s unbranded, 15-second spots ape the soothing, lo-fi aesthetic of karaoke videos and ends with an invitation to call an extremely boring toll-free number. Dialing 888-890-2040 connects callers to a series of pre-recorded sounds that will hopefully make one nod off. Among the sleep-inducing options: listen to the relaxing white noise of water and wind chimes, submit to hypnosis, hear a lullaby from Jaleel White (aka Urkel from the 1990’s sitcom Family Matters), eavesdrop on a conference call, or if you wait till the end, listen to a guy named John prattle on about mattresses. “Can’t Sleep? Call,” is the latest in Casper’s series of inspired marketing gimmicks. Since launching in 2013, the mattress start-up has relied on “experiential marketing,” a promotional strategy that hinges on live events, parties and happenings (aka “activations”) to connect with consumers. Experiential marketing goes beyond the trade show appearances and product launch parties. It involves designing scenarios for consumers to “experience the brand,” and often not directly driving instantly to sales. For example, the fast casual salad chain Sweetgreen hosts an annual music festival called Sweetlife or microchip manufacturer Intel sponsored Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl performance through a fleet of Intel-enabled aerial drones to back her up. (Intel’s engineers also co-designed Lady Gaga’s tech-powered tribute to David Bowie at the 2015 Grammy Awards.) @casper #naptour #seattle #sleeplessinseattle got a quick nap in, I'd have to say these are pretty nice 👍🏻👍🏻 A post shared by Eric Piggott (@ericgti) on Jun 26, 2016 at 12:15pm PDT Yesterday I got to chill in a Casper nap pod and write about it, which is relevant to all of my interests. #naptour A post shared by Chloe (@mccallchloe) on Mar 15, 2017 at 7:32am PDT In the same vein, Casper’s Nap Tour deploys RV’s retrofitted with sleeping pods offering passers-by free power naps; their “Nap Simulator” allows users to simulate sleep in virtual reality; a Sleep Symposium headlined by the celebrity sleep endorser Ariana Huffington unpacked the science of sleep and altered states. Instead of just pushing new mattresses models, Casper’s marketing mines a more universal problem: sleeplessness. “Talking about the molecular composition of our proprietary foam would put most people to sleep, yes, pun intended,” says Lindsay Kaplan, Casper’s vice president of communications and brand engagement. “Our marketing celebrates the shared emotions of the joy of bedtime, the freedom of staying up late, the agony of the alarm clock, and the absurdity of dreams.” Last year, the US Centers for Disease Control published findings suggesting that up to one-third of the American adults are not getting enough sleep and classified the epidemic as a “health problem.” At the #sleepsymposium, illustrator Branche Coverdale is on standby to sketch your recurring dreams 🌙 @casper #nyc #illustration #sharpie A post shared by Anne Quito (@annequito) on Apr 17, 2016 at 4:46pm PDT Kaplan says that their push to design unique experiences is working for their bottom line. She reports that in under three years, they’ve hit $300 million in sales and garnered awards including a #1 ranking from Consumer Reports in the memory foam mattress category. Independent reviewers pit Casper against other online mattress brands like Helix, Saatva, Leesa, and Tuft & Needle and though they differ on their choice for “the best mattress online,” Casper—with humor, delight and surprise—is writing the rule book on how to generate excitement around an otherwise boring product category. “We get it. Marketing sleep is a little absurd,” explains Kaplan to Ad Age. “The ‘Nap Simulator,’ like ‘Can’t Sleep?’ is in on that absurdity in a very obvious way to cut through the noise.” Most Popular A Stanford psychologist just disproved the oldest love advice in the book Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The new boards are perfectly suited for space-constrained, high-performance, low-power IoT designs. Besides all the enhancements of the new processor generation, they also offer comprehensive IoT support including a SIM card socket for 3G/4G or Narrow Band connectivity and first versions of the congatec Cloud-API that will be demonstrated at Embedded World (Hall 1, Booth 358). The extremely low profile design of congatec’s new Thin Mini-ITX industrial motherboard family makes it perfectly suited for slim system designs such as industrial GUIs/HMIs, digital signage systems, point-of-sale terminals, and medical tablets. The boards excel through the option of ultra-fast Intel® Optane™ memory via M.2 connector, enabling extremely fast system boots, application starts, video recording and processing, and software updates. The boards further support Hyper-Threading which turns the dual-core design into a 4-in-1 system when utilizing the RTS real time hypervisor. “Our new Thin Mini-ITX motherboards can be universally employed in all the various embedded and IoT applications as the new low-power versions of the high-end 64-bit Intel® Core™ processors offer a highly configurable thermal design power (TDP) of 15W, with the flexibility to scale dissipation from 7.5W cTDP to 25W cTDP for an exceptional balance of power and performance,” explains congatec Director Product Management Martin Danzer. Perfectly tailored for the embedded and rugged industrial market, the new flagship motherboard design offers at least 7 years long term availability as well as a comprehensive set of industrial interfaces and drivers. Thanks to congatec’s personal integration support, the design-in phase is highly simplified and becomes an easy job for OEM engineers. The feature set in detail The new industrial grade conga-IC175 Thin Mini-ITX motherboards ship with 4 different dual-core variants of 7th Gen Intel® Core™ U SoC processors and have a configurable cTDP from 7.5 W to 25 W. Two SO-DIMM sockets support up to 32GB DDR4-2133 memory. For non-volatile memory the boards offer 1x M.2 slot supporting the new Intel® Optane™ memory for significantly lower latency and higher data rates mass storage devices. 2x SATA 3.0 interfaces allow additional HDDs or SSDs to be connected. The new boards connect the DirectX 12 capable Intel® HD Graphics 620 with up to three independent displays in 4k resolution @ 60 Hz via 2x DP++ plus eDP or dual channel LVDS. The new hardware-accelerated 10-bit encoding/decoding of HEVC and VP9 videos offloads the CPU while HDR support makes videos more vibrant and lifelike. The industrial grade I/O set includes 2x Gigabit Ethernet and 1x SIM card socket for 3G/4G or Narrow Band M2M and IoT connectivity, 1x PCIe x4 and 1x mPCIe for generic expansions, 4x USB 3.0, 6x USB 2.0, 8x GPIO, and 2x serial COM ports – one of which can be configured as ccTalk. An integrated Board Management Controller, HDA audio including a stereo amplifier, a MIPI CSI-2 interface for direct connection of low-cost CMOS cameras as well as optional TPM 2.0 round off the feature set. The boards support the 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 10 and Windows 10 IoT as well as all common Linux operating systems. A comprehensive choice of add-ons for easier design-in, including cooling solutions, I/O shields and cable sets, is also available.

The Sooners expect to hear good news at least once but maybe even twice on the recruiting trail for the 2018 class. All eyes are going to be on Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy running back T.J. Pledger as he is expected to make his long-awaited trip to Norman. http://www.scout.com/player/198166-t-j-pledger?s=73 Pledger, ranked No. 20 in the Scout 100 and No. 3 at running back, has clearly been OU’s No. 1 choice at the position for the last several months. Although running backs coach Jay Boulware did indeed end up making several offers in January and February, things have gone quiet on that front ever since it has felt like Pledger has become the top priority. https://twitter.com/uno_tj/status/845087574406262784 Though most believe Pledger is going to commit to the Sooners when it’s all said and done, the speculation is about when. Pledger has been consistent about saying he wants to visit Nebraska’s spring game, but there are those who believe he might never make it to Lincoln. Two sources connected to OU and one source connected to Pledger have said there’s a strong chance that as long as Pledger arrives in Norman this weekend, he’ll leave as the next pledge for OU’s #SavageTeam2K18. One thing OU has working in its favor is the friendship built between Pledger and OU quarterback commit, Newbury Park (Calif.) High’s Cameron Rising. “Cameron is talking to guys all the time he can, especially T.J. Pledger,” said Nicko Rising, Cameron’s father. “They talk a lot.” https://twitter.com/crising7/status/845091548895178753 They don’t just talk, now they play. Pledger and Rising were on the same 7-on-7 team at an even last weekend on the west coast. The Pro Way Hot Boyz went 8-0 during the event take home the championship. “Cam and T.J. were clicking on all cylinders,” Nicko said. “It’s like they have been playing together for 10 years.” It’s hard to imagine the excitement from the OU side of things if three of its first five pledges are not only Scout 300 kids but Scout 100 kids. A firm foundation would be set with Rising, Pledger and Moore (Okla.) Southmoore five-star offensive tackle Brey Walker. Pledger is someone who can do it all on the field. Someone who can be as dangerous out of the backfield as a receiver as he can as a running back. The waiting game continues. The countdown is on. But are we just about at the time for that clock to expire and Pledger to come home to OU?   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Video: Baker Mayfield addresses arrest Sources: IU picks Archie Miller Video: OU's Baker Mayfield on college career 'Pledge(r) of allegiance' -T.J. commits to OU OU rolling out red carpet for T.J.

Intel has formed a new artificial intelligence (AI) unit, which will consolidate all of its AI efforts under one roof. The new unit has been named Artificial Intelligence Products Group and will be led by Naveen Rao as the vice president and general manager of the unit. He was the former CEO of Nervana, an AI start-up that was acquired by Intel last year for $400m. Naveen Rao said: “This organisation is about aligning our focus. The new organisation will align resources from across the company to include engineering, labs, software and more as we build on our current leading AI portfolio: the Intel Nervana platform, a full-stack of hardware and software AI offerings that our customers are looking for from us.” “In addition, we will be creating an applied AI research lab dedicated to pushing the forefronts of computing. “We will be exploring novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to inform future generations of AI. This includes a range of solutions from the data center to edge devices, and from training to inference – all designed to enable Intel and its customers to innovate faster. This will be the home for AI innovation at Intel.” Intel recently acquired Mobileye, a company in the development of computer vision for application in self-driving vehicles for $13.3bn. The company plans to support the development of self-driving vehicles. Prior to the acquisition, Intel, BMW and Mobileye collaborated to develop autonomous vehicles. Before this, in 2015, the company also acquired Altera, a manufacturer of programmable logic devices for $16.7bn. Rao believes that AI will add new capabilities to things like smart factories, drones, sports, health care and driverless car with data will be at the heart of everything. Since data is the common thread to all applications, the company needs to develop solution which will create, use and utilise large volume of data, he added. The company also added that it will rally the industry around a set of standards for AI which will help in bringing down the cost, to make it accessible to large number of customers, instead of limiting its use by institutions, governments and large companies.

From fans, casings, PSUs, and RAMs, the company has a very diverse set of products. Now, Corsair has jumped in head-first into the PC making business with the Corsair ONE, a mini-ITX form-factor gaming rig. The Corsair ONE was first announced back in February. At the time, the company is still trying to market its bare-bone PC, the Bulldog. Although a fully-built PC is something new to Corsair, it sure did not leave any screw untightened. The new Corsair ONE, with its tiny form factor, is packed with performance. The mini-ITX motherboard has the newest Intel Kaby Lake i7-7700 at the helm. Supporting the Intel processor is an air-cooled NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. With a RAM size of 16GB – DDR4 2400 – and SSD of 240GB paired with a 1TB spinning platter, this rig can cost anyone around $1,800. And that is only for the basic model. The Corsair ONE has one more model in the lineup. Corsair ONE PC (via corsair.com) The Corsair ONE PRO comes in two different versions. The only difference between the two is the type of storage used by each. The slightly cheaper PRO version has a 480GB SSD paired with a 2TB spinning disk hard drive. Meanwhile, the top-of-the-line version has a 960GB SSD for storage. Just like the standard version, the PRO versions have a 16GB DDR4 2400 RAM. However, both of the PRO versions are equipped with an Intel i7-7700K processor and a water-cooled NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. The cheaper Corsair ONE PRO is priced at $2,299 while the top-tier one is only $100 more expensive. When it comes to the build, the Corsair ONE is mainly built with black aluminium panel with the side covers active as air vents. The main fan is a 140mm exhaust situated at the top of the casing. On idle, the system gives only around 20dB of audible noise. The Corsair ONE runs on Windows 10 Home Edition with all the necessary drivers including Corsair’s CUE customization tool. The system also has installers for popular game distribution platforms such as Steam, UPlay, Origin, and GoG Galaxy. Corsair’s first fully built PC will be distributed to major PC sellers as well as its own online store. For more updates on the Corsair ONE, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. WASHINGTON — President Trump's ousted national security adviser did not seek permission from the U.S. government to work as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests, U.S. defense officials said, raising the possibility that the Pentagon could dock the retirement pay of Michael Flynn. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Defense Department is reviewing the issue. It arose after Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, registered retroactively this month with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work that his company, Flynn Intel Group, carried out on behalf of Inovo BV, a Netherlands-based company. It is owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is not a part of the Turkish government, but has links to it. The Inovo assignment centered on researching Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric whom Ankara blames for fomenting a coup attempt last summer and wants extradited from the United States, where he has lived in exile for years. That led Flynn's company to conclude that the work “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” according to a letter sent by Flynn's attorney, Robert K. Kelner, to the Justice Department, along with the filing. Flynn Intel Group received a total of $530,000 in three payments between September and November from Inovo BV before discontinuing the arrangement after Trump was elected president, according to Flynn's filings. It is unclear from the paperwork how much Flynn personally profited from the deal, but he is the majority owner and chief executive officer of the firm. Kelner, reached by phone Wednesday night, declined to comment on the deal. Flynn filed the foreign agent paperwork March 7, about three weeks after being removed as national security adviser after revelations that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn's company previously disclosed its role in lobbying for Inovo BV, but did not file any paperwork as a foreign agent for Turkey because it had concluded that its client was a foreign corporation, rather than a foreign government. It changed course and filed as a foreign agent to “eliminate any doubt” about the issue, Kelner wrote. Individuals who represent foreign governments must register with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Flynn's work for Inovo came as he prepared an opinion piece for The Hill newspaper that appeared on Election Day and criticized the Obama administration while arguing that “from Turkey's point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey's Osama bin Laden.” Flynn's new filing acknowledges that the piece used information gathered through work for Inovo, but denies that either Inovo or the Turkish government requested it or had a hand in writing it. However, Inovo did receive an advance copy of it for review, the filing said. An Army spokesperson, Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, said that the service has no record of Flynn ever requesting permission before accepting any kind of “foreign employment” — something that Defense Department guidelines, separate from the Foreign Agents Registration Act — explicitly require when former officers work for a foreign government. The Pentagon's guidelines were established to comply with the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which states that no individual holding any office “of profit or trust” can accept any pay or gift from a foreign government or official without the permission of the U.S. government. It applies to retired officers and enlisted service members because they are subject to recall to active duty, according to a Defense Department assessment of the issue. Defense Department guidelines warn that the department's top financial officer, the comptroller, “may pursue debt collection” if they do not do so. Any debt collection due to an Emoluments Clause violation would be capped at no more than what an individual makes in retirement pay during a period of unauthorized employment. In Flynn's case, that is more than $35,000 for the three months of the Inovo project. The position of Defense Department comptroller is held on an acting basis by Andrew Roth, a former Obama administration official who was held over to help with budget issues. David Norquist, who served as chief financial officer in the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, was nominated last week as his replacement. The Defense guidelines do not specify whether representing the interests of a foreign government while paid by a private corporation is a violation of the rules. Violations of the Emoluments Clause also are rarely enforced. “This is not something that has generally been enforced, but I do think we are at a phase where people are thinking about the remedies for this issue a lot more carefully,” said William Baude, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. The issue comes as some lawmakers continue to press for information about whether Flynn violated any laws by accepting money to appear with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a gala dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization. Flynn received $45,000 for the December 2015 appearance, according to documents released recently by the House Oversight Committee. Jennifer Werner, a spokesman for Democrats on the committee, said the Army told committee members that it has found no documents suggesting that Flynn asked the service for permission to speak at the RT gala. But Kelner suggested that isn't so clear-cut: Flynn briefed members of the Defense Intelligence Agency about his trip to Moscow before and afterward, Kelner said Wednesday. Asked if he sought approval through Army Human Resources Command, as the guidelines stipulate, Kelner declined to comment. On Wednesday, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., its ranking member, requested that the White House, the Defense Department, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence furnish documents related to Flynn's foreign contacts. Chaffetz and Cummings said in a letter that the committee is reviewing whether Flynn “fully disclosed his payments from Russian, Turkish, or other foreign sources,” specifically mentioning the RT payment without limiting the request to it.

David Paul Morris / Bloomberg U.S. charges two Israeli residents with Mobileye insider trading How Israel's Hebrew University lost a Mobileye windfall Opinion Why men are terrified of the rise of driverless cars Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector’s other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups – more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs – has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016, from $2.4 billion in 2015, as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant’s purchase last week of Mobileye, which specializes in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. “A concern over the years has been that compared to the United States, Israel cannot produce outsized returns,” said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. “Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel, and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location,” he added. The price was about 21 times Mobileye’s expected 2017 revenue – or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the stock market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app that Google bought for $1.15 billion in 2013. That same year, Wix – an Israeli startup that helps people build websites – made its market debut on New York’s Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after its founding. Only a few – such as cybersecurity firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion – have succeeded in remaining independent. Defense tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli security reasons. Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signaled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. “It’s an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies,” said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors, including Samsung’s Catalyst Fund, bringing its total raised to date to $70 million. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of three to 10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage. Long known as Startup Nation, Israel is maturing into a “scale-up nation” believes Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success, since local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, Schoenfeld said. Mobileye now accounts for 16% of BlueStar’s Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8% so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6%. Schoenfeld pointed to Wix and software provider Amdocs as examples of other companies “going the distance” by staying independent for longer. Cybersecurity firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential. Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering, moving into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving. “All of these take time to build and time to get resources, and Intel already has these resources,” said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shashua. “If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product.” With more than 200 startups, Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Last year, startups in the sector raised $681 million – nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC. Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been “making the pilgrimage” to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Bessemer’s Fisher said. The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said. Potential buyers “will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either,” Fisher said. Bessemer has invested in depth-sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3-D imaging sensors. Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel’s most vibrant sectors – cybersecurity – helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked. Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon said the Mobileye deal could accelerate his company’s growth. “There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A,” he said. Carmakers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centers in Israel. Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D centers in Israel, including Intel. “Now they are moving into the autonomous space, and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level,” Kram said. “It’s a win-win for both companies.” Reuters Reuters Send me email alerts for new articles by Reuters Send Close Email * Please enter your email Reuters For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

The GPU company is flying high at the moment, but there are three potential problems investors should look out for. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Mar 23, 2017 at 9:16PM There's a lot for NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its investors to be optimistic about at the moment. The company grew data center revenue by three times in its fiscal second quarter; it retains the dominant position in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market against rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD); and it's quickly building on massive opportunities in both self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).  But it can be tempting to think that the good times will continue simply because that's what's happening right now. I've argued in recent articles that NVIDIA is in a great position to benefit from its endeavors, but sometimes it's also good to step into the contrarian role for just a minute in order to evaluate things more critically.  Image source: Getty Images. To do that, let's take a look at three pessimistic possibilities for the company: how AMD could gain market share against NVIDIA's GPUs; what Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) doing to take on NVIDIA in the AI space; and how Intel's proposed purchase of Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) could thwart NVIDIA's driverless car tech plans.  1. AMD's new Vega GPUs could help boost market share At the end of 2016, AMD had a market share of 29.5% in discrete desktop GPUs, and NVIDIA controlled the rest.. Obviously, NVIDIA is dominating here, but investors should be aware that just two years before, NVIDIA's GPU market share was more than 78%. Take a look: Data source: Jon Peddie Research and AnandTech. AMD has mainly made its gains in mid-range GPUs, but expect that to change in the second quarter of this year, when the company releases its new Vega GPU architecture. Admittedly, it's a bit early to know how well AMD's new GPUs will compete against NVIDIA's. But one recent move by NVIDIA -- it released a new, high-end GTX 1080 Ti with 20% to 45% higher performance than original version -- might be an indicator that the segment leader is preparing for serious competition. AMD has already managed to take significant market share away from NVIDIA over the past couple of years, and with Vega, it will go directly after NVIDIA's high-end GPU dominance. If Vega is even mildly successful in wooing some customers away from NVIDIA's GPUs, it will be a win for AMD.  2. Intel's Mobileye acquisition ratchets up the driverless car tech competition NVIDIA has a huge opportunity in the self-driving car space with its Drive PX 2 supercomputer. Drive PX uses machine learning and visual processing to interpret all of the things around a driverless car, giving it situational awareness. About 80 automotive suppliers and car companies are using variants of NVIDIA's Drive PX already, and the company expects the driverless car segment to be an increasingly important part of its business.  Image source: Intel. About a year ago, I wrote that Intel was aiming to take on NVIDIA in driverless cars, but that it wasn't doing enough to achieve its goal. That may have changed last week when Intel announced a deal to buy the Israel-based autonomous driving tech company Mobileye for $15.3 billion. Mobileye's self-driving technology consists of cameras, sensors, machine learning, and cloud software, and the company already has 70% of the worldwide market share for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The purchase will not only propel Intel toward the front of the self-driving car tech space, but also give the chipmaker more opportunities to embed its own processors in the hearts of autonomous cars -- and possibly hurt NVIDIA's push for GPU-based self-driving tech.  3. Intel is taking on NVIDIA's artificial intelligence business too NVIDIA's GPUs are also used in some of the most sophisticated AI and deep learning systems available right now, including its own Drive PX2 and DGX-1 supercomputers. Graphics processors are uniquely adept at processing AI information, and NVIDIA could end up being a big winner in this market. A recent investor note published by Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari said that NVIDIA's total addressable market in the AI and deep learning space could be as large $5 billion to $10 billion. Intel is easily the leader in the server chip space, with 99% market share, but its chips have not been the go-to components for the growing AI data center market. To change that (and to better compete with NVIDIA) Intel has been busy building out its own AI strategy. Image source: Intel. This year, the company will begin selling its new AI-focused chip -- the Knights Mill Xeon Phi processor -- which it says it can process deep learning data faster than NVIDIA's GPU (though NVIDIA has disputed that claim). And Intel recently acquired an AI company called Nervana Systems, which makes an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that it believes can increase AI computing power.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a blog post a few months ago, "We expect Nervana's technologies to produce a breakthrough 100-fold increase in performance in the next three years to train complex neural networks, enabling data scientists to solve their biggest AI challenges faster." Intel's AI capabilities are still behind NVIDIA's right now, but the company is clearly making this segment a priority, and NVIDIA investors should recognize that the massive potential size of the AI market means that competition in it is only going to increase. Should NVIDIA investors be worried? There's not much for NVIDIA investors to be worried about right now, but that doesn't mean they should take a hands-off approach to this stock. The company will need to continue dominating in the discrete desktop GPU space, and innovate faster in AI and driverless car tech to maintain its dominant positions. So far, NVIDIA has proven that it can do this well, but investors would be wise to keep a close eye on how NVIDIA's competitors are mounting their attacks.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Intel has its Core i5-7600K with 4C/8T at $239 right now on Amazon, meaning AMD offers 4 additional CPU threads with Ryzen 5 1600X at just $10 more - or, the cheaper Ryzen 5 1600 with 6C/12T and its lower price of $219.     AMD will be launching its Ryzen 5 family of processors on April 11, but some retailers are selling the CPUs early - with resellers in Europe already selling Ryzen 5 chips. Someone posted on Reddit, saying that someone purchased a Ryzen 5 1600 processor in Brazil. NEWS SOURCES:Reddit.com Recommended for You The first sign of Kaby Lake X: the Intel Core i7-7740K...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News Hardware Acceleration! Digiarty Builds Real Fastest WinX DVD Ripper Platinum Sichuan, China — (SBWIRE) — 03/23/2017 — Digiarty Software, a veteran application software developer, announces excitedly the biggest-ever update: WinX DVD Ripper Platinum 8.5.0 comes out on March 22 with a killer feature – Hardware Acceleration. On the version, Intel QSV and NVIDIA (CUDA) NVENC on users’ computers can be utilized to maximally accelerate DVD conversion speed. Specifically, the speed of DVD to MP4 (H.264) ripping can reach up to 500 FPS (with X32 DVD drive), and the whole DVD conversion takes as short as 5 minutes only. For whoever’s computer contains CPU/GPU hardware accelerator, it is the real fastest DVD conversion solution. Please download and feel the CPU and GPU based hardware encoder at: https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/ WinX DVD Ripper Platinum is a professional Windows-based program serving for ripping and converting DVD discs, ISO image files and DVD folders to hard drive, computer, and other devices supported files formats. The new version is the most fast-running and stable one. That is to say, both the kernel and interface are finalized thereon, and no frequent updates will be necessary thereafter. After beta testing, the official version comes out on Wednesday, March 22 and is believed to pack a punch. Hardware acceleration applying to video encoding/decoding is in vogue, mostly for the blossom of modern multi-core processor and concurrency-algorithm GPU, specifically for Intel QSV and NVIDIA NVENC techniques. By far, both four generations of Intel CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, such as Intel Core i5 / Core i7 processor and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, have supported encoding H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, as a result of which DVD to MP4 (H.264) video transcoding speed skyrockets by 300% now when using this updated DVD ripping software with hardware acceleration. Before hardware acceleration, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum is already distinguished for fast software transcoding speed, attributed to uniquely developed Super Encode Engine, Hyper-threading technology and Multi-core CPU utilization. It was especially reflected in the „DVD Backup” mode, namely, in copying DVD to MPEG2 file, ISO image file or DVD folder with original quality and intact movie content. Now with might doubled, the hardware encoding is added in as a spur to finish DVD ripping to MP4 within only 5 minutes at 300-500 FPS (depending on the speed of DVD drive and the configuration of computer). Digiarty Software this year seems to have an especially great variety of update plans. Taking Version 8.0.0 built on March 10 for instance, many vital enhancements were launched, including rebuilt DVD title analysis mechanism, new ISO system support and trouble shooting for 99-title and intractable discs. „We have been committed to creating the best software with fast speed, powerful decoding ability and ease of use,” said Jack Han, CEO of Digiarty. „We think that’s already where we are. Thank you everyone who has supported us over the past 10 years for making the product what it is today!” Pricing and Availability WinX DVD Ripper Platinum V8.5.0 is released on Wednesday. Any new user can download the trial version or get the full version at $39.95 from the Spring Discount at: https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/buy.htm About Digiarty Software, Inc.

While MBLY shot up 28% after it was announced that the company will be bought out for $63.54 a share, INTC stock fell 2% and closed below its 200-day moving average for the time since last June. Prior to Monday’s breakdown, Intel stock had been consolidating in a trading range with the 200-day (the red line) acting as support and the 50-day average (the blue line) as resistance. The breach of support came on double the average volume, which is a bearish sign that highlights the large number of sellers. Was Mobileye a Good Buy? The consensus on the Street is that Intel paid too much for Mobileye. That ultimately will be determined years from now, but what I found interesting was the fact that an Intel executive came out and highlighted the amount of data the company will be able to gather as a direct result of the acquisition. Think about it: Mobileye is a key player in the autonomous automobile industry, making the chips that are used in driverless and semi-autonomous vehicles. And all those chips control the sensors that map the road. The information that Intel will now be able to accumulate has the potential to be worth much more than the $15.3 billion it paid in the transaction. There has been a flurry of analyst moves since last Monday’s news, and Wednesday morning Credit Suisse jumped on the bandwagon, downgrading INTC stock to “Neutral” from “Outperform.” What’s interesting here, though, is that the Mobileye purchase was actually applauded. The downgrade was based on Intel being expensive. 10 Safe Dividend Stocks to Own During the Next Market Crash I don’t share that mindset, but I also do not see INTC stock as an overly attractive investment from a fundamental view right now. Its earnings growth is slowing, and the company needs to find more catalysts to boost its bottom line. Bottom Line on INTC Stock Perhaps the Mobileye acquisition is a step in the right direction. I like the potential that Intel’s 3% dividend yield represents, but I wouldn’t be a buyer just yet. If INTC stock weakens further but is able to hold price support near $33.50 in the coming weeks, I might consider opening a position in the $33.50-$34.50 area based on a combination of the acquisition and the potential within the chip sector.

"The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn, or anyone else in attendance, discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false. No such discussion occurred. Nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend, or afterwards," Floyd said in an emailed statement to The Hill on Friday. Earlier in the day, The Wall Street Journal reported citing former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director James Woolsey that Flynn held talks with Turkish officials while serving as an adviser to the campaign of US President Donald Trump, discussing ways to remove Gulen, who is suspected by Ankara of masterminding the July 2016 coup attempt, from the United States. Gulen has been living in the US state of Pennsylvania since 1999. He has denied the allegations of involvement in the military coup attempt in Turkey. The failed coup attempt in July 2016 left over 200 people killed and thousands wounded. Following the attempt, the Turkish authorities detained tens of thousands of people, the majority of whom were accused of ties to the Gulen movement. Ankara has repeatedly asked the United States to extradite Gulen. ...

 'You don't haul somebody overseas': Ex CIA director says Michael Flynn may have gone too far in a meeting with Turkish officials Natasha Bertrand Mar. 24, 2017, 6:42 PM 25,519 facebook linkedin twitter email print White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (C) arrives prior to a joint news conference between Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 13, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn discussed removing a controversial Muslim cleric from US soil in a meeting with Turkish government ministers in September, former CIA Director James Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal on Friday. Flynn disclosed the meeting to the Justice Department in his FARA (Foreign Agent Registration Act) filing late last month. The filing acknowledged that Flynn's lobbying group, Flynn Intel Group, conducted research that "focused on" the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, for Inovo — a Dutch consulting firm owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an appointee of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Flynn's firm was tasked with lobbying the US government to extradite Gulen — a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania who Erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year's attempted coup and generally fomenting dissent inside Turkey. Flynn raised eyebrows when he wrote an op-ed article for The Hill, published November 8, alleging that Gulen helmed a "vast global network" that "has all the right markings to fit the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network." At that point, Flynn's work for Inovo had not yet made news so the op-ed seemed out of place amid his work with the Trump campaign. Flynn's DOJ filing says the op-ed "was not written or published at the request of, or under the direction or control of, Inovo, the Republic of Turkey, or any other party." Woolsey, a Flynn Intel Group board member who was present at the September meeting, said that Flynn and the Turkish ministers went further than talking about how to lobby for Gulen's extradition, however, and discussed how they could physically remove Gulen from the country. The idea was “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away,"Woolsey said, adding that he thought it was "naive" of them to think they could bypass the US' "legal process" and people's constiutional rights. "You don’t send out folks to haul somebody overseas," Woolsey told The Journal. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, strongly denied that such a discussion ever took place, telling Business Insider on Friday that Flynn was contracted by Inovo, in part, "to gather information on Gulen and turn it over to legal authorities to take action." "At no time did they discuss anyillegal actions, nonjudicial physical removal or any other such activities," Floyd added. Reached for comment, Woolsey's spokesperson, Jonathan Franks, said that the former CIA director stands by his story. Franks confirmed that Woolsey had notified Vice President Joe Biden, through a mutual friend, of what he thought could be an illegal discussion. The Obama administration said it would not extradite Gulen until Turkey provided the necessary evidence of his complicity in the coup, but Trump has not said how he plans to address the issue, if at all. Alptekin, who paid Flynn's firm just over $500,000 for the four months of lobbying, told the Associated Press earlier this month that he did not agree with Flynn's decision to register as a foreign agent with the Department of Justice for his work with Inovo. "It would be different if I was working for the government of Turkey, but I am not taking directions from anyone in the government," Alpetkin said. Still, Flynn said in his filing with the DOJ that his work for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey."

In a blog post published Thursday (March 23), Rao said the Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG) would align resources from across Intel, including engineering, labs and software, as Intel builds on its Intel Nervana platform, a full-stack of hardware and software AI offerings. Naveen Rao Rao said Intel would also create an applied AI research lab. "We will be exploring novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to inform future generations of AI," Rao wrote. "This includes a range of solutions from the data center to edge devices, and from training to inference—all designed to enable Intel and its customers to innovate faster." "I think it's a good sign that Intel recognizes that AI is one of the most important challenges for the computer industry," Kevn Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, told EE Times. Krewell called the appointment of Rao to head the group rather than a long time Intel executive "another symbol of the changing Intel." Intel considers AI an important opportunity as the company continues to diversify itself beyond the PC and data center markets. At an Intel AI event last November, CEO Brian Krzanich declared Intel's goal of being the trusted leader and developer of AI, which he said would "transform most industries as we know it." Semiconductor players of all shapes and sizes are maneuvering to cash in on the market opportunity offered by presented by AI. Intel is a significantly larger company than GPU supplier Nvidia or programmable logic vendor Xilinx, with AI related hardware and software that has been housed in various business units.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing New DirectX 11 vs. DirectX 12 comparison shows uneven results, limited improvements New DirectX 11 vs. DirectX 12 comparison shows uneven results, limited improvements By Joel Hruska on March 23, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment For the last few years, there’s been an ongoing debate about the benefits and advantages (or lack thereof) surrounding DirectX 12. It hasn’t helped any that the argument has been bitterly partisan, with Nvidia GPUs often showing minimal benefits or even performance regressions, while AMD cards have often shown significant performance increases. [H]ardOCP recently compared AMD and Nvidia performance in Ashes of the Singularity, Battlefield 1, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Hitman, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Sniper Elite 4, and Tom Clancy’s The Division. Bear in mind that this was specifically designed as a high-end comparison that would compare the two APIs in GPU-limited scenarios at high resolutions and detail levels, and with a Core i7-6700K clocked at 4.7GHz powering the testbed. The GTX 1080 Ti was tested in 4K, while the less-powerful 1080 and RX 480 were tested in 1440p. Before you squawk about comparing the GTX 1080 and the RX 480, keep in mind that each GPU was only compared against itself in DX11 versus DX12. Sniper Elite 4 was a rare game with very strong results in DX12 versus DX11 on Polaris. Data and graph by [H]ardOCP.The answer to whether DirectX 12 was better or worse than DirectX 11 boils down to “It depends.” Specifically, it depends on whether you’re using an AMD or an Nvidia GPU, and it depends on the game itself. AMD GPUs were less likely to show a performance delta between the two APIs, while Nvidia cards still tended to tilt towards DX11 overall. [H]ardOCP notes in its conclusion that DX11 is still the better overall API option, but that DX12 support has improved from both companies, performance deltas between the two APIs have dropped, and in a few cases, DX12 pulls out strong wins. Why DirectX 12 hasn’t transformed gaming A few years ago, when low-overhead APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan hadn’t been released and even Mantle was in its infancy, there were a lot of overconfident predictions made about how these upcoming APIs would be fundamentally transformative to gaming, unleash the latent power in all of our computers, and transform the gaming industry. The truth, thus far, has been more prosaic. How much a game benefits from DirectX 12 depends on what kind of CPU you’re testing it on, how GPU-limited your quality settings are, how much experience the developer has in the API to start with, and whether the title was developed from the ground up to take advantage of DX12, or if its support for the API was patched in at a later date. And the components you choose can have a significant impact on what kind of scaling you see. Consider the graph below, from TechSpot, which compares a variety of CPUs while using the Fury X. Data and graph by TechSpot Intel’s Core i7-6700K barely twitches, while the Core i3-6100T has an average frame rate 1.14x higher and a minimum frame rate less than half as high. AMD’s FX-6350 and FX-8370 both see average frame rates rise by nearly 27%, but, again, minimum frame rates drop severely. A similar point is demonstrated below, with a graph of Hitman results. The 6700K is capable of driving the Fury X almost as fast in DX11 as it is in DX12, while the FX-8370 improved enormously. One reason why we see things playing out the way they do is because the goal and performance-improving functions of low-overhead APIs have been misunderstood. It’s been known for years that Nvidia GPUs are often faster with lower-end Intel or AMD CPUs (pre-Ryzen) than AMD’s own GPUs are. Part of the reason for this is because Nvidia’s own DX11 drivers implement multi-threading, whereas AMD’s do not. That’s one reason why, in games like Ashes of the Singularity, AMD’s GPU performance skyrocketed so much in DX12. But fundamentally, DX12, Vulkan, and Mantle are methods of compensating for weak single-threaded performance (or for spreading out a workload more evenly so it isn’t bottlenecked by a single thread). This article from Eurogamer is older, but it still makes an important point — the improvements to performance shown by Mantle and DX12 come from allowing the CPU to process more draw calls per second. If the GPU is already saturated with all the processing it can handle, stuffing more draw calls into the pipe isn’t going to improve anything. Now, having said all this, was there any point to DirectX 12 at all? Absolutely yes. Games, as a category of applications, have been among the slowest to embrace and benefit from multi-core processors. Even today, the number of games that can scale above four cores is quite small. Giving lower-end CPUs the freedom to utilize their resources more effectively can absolutely pay dividends for consumers on lower-end hardware. DirectX 12 is also still fairly new, with just a handful of supporting titles. It’s not unusual for a new API to take several years to find its feet and for developers to begin supporting it as a primary option. Game engines have to be developed to work well with it. Developers have to become comfortable using it. AMD, NV, and Intel need to release drivers that use it more effectively, and in some cases, may make hardware changes to their own GPUs to make low-latency APIs run more efficiently. Neither the fact that DX12’s gains against DX11 are less dramatic than many would prefer nor its limited adoption at this point in time are unusual for a new API that makes as many fundamental changes as DX12 makes relative to DX11. How those changes will shape games of the future remains to be seen.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | March 24, 2017 -- 17:40 GMT (10:40 PDT) | Topic: Data Centers Stevenson will oversee the infrastructure side of the group, including the Lenovo's core datacenter products and solutions portfolio. (Image: Intel) Lenovo has hired former Intel CIO Kim Stevenson to serve as the SVP and general manager of its struggling datacenter group. As part of its third quarter earnings report last month, Lenovo revealed sales from its datacenter group were down 20 percent from a year ago to $1.1 billion. cloud tv How ethics migrate to the cloud Cloud migration: Dipping in a toe before diving all in Secure your clouds across AWS, Azure, and more Cloud computing will be key for autonomous driving Lenovo built its datacenter group in large part by acquiring IBM's commodity server business, and today, the segment includes servers, storage, software, and services. The company has forged enterprise partnerships with key players such as SAP, but the segment still lacks in terms of sales and channel infrastructure. In a statement, Lenovo said it's realigning the datacenter group under five market segments: datacenter infrastructure, the software-defined datacenter, high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications, "hyperscale" systems, and datacenter services. Stevenson will oversee the infrastructure side of the group, including the Lenovo's core datacenter products and solutions portfolio. Lenovo has also shifted three executives into other leadership positions within the datacenter group. Paul Ju has been named VP and GM of hyperscale; Madhu Matta has been appointed VP and GM of high-performance computing and AI; and Radhika Krishnan has been made executive director and general manager of software-defined datacenter. Newly appointed segment leaders will report directly to Kirk Skaugen, the current EVP and president of Lenovo's datacenter group. "Kim (Stevenson) is a widely respected and highly accomplished technology leader, and we're honored to have her join our team," said Skaugen in a statement. "Lenovo is attracting some of the industry's best talent as we continue to expand our capabilities and breadth of solutions as a datacenter company."

(TIF) Stock Be a Diamond in the Rough? Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Still Not a Buy, Mobileye NV (MBLY) or Not Charles Payne on Snap Inc: Be Prepared to Lose View All Posts Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF), a designer and retailer of fine jewelry, was off to the races last Friday after reporting fourth-quarter results that beat the Street, with strong guidance with “meaningful growth” acting as the icing on the cake. The rally was great for those who already own a position in the stock, but I have some concerns at current levels. Source: Shutterstock Let’s look at the numbers first. Adjusted earnings of $1.45 a share were down a penny from last year but bested expectations of $1.38 a share. Revenue grew 1.6% to $1.23 billion, which was also better than estimates of $1.22 billion. TIF stock same-store sales were unchanged while analysts had been looking for a decline of more than 1%. TIF Stock Shows Strength For fiscal 2017, management forecasted a mid-single-digit increase on the bottom line. The Street had anticipated guidance of $3.85 a share, which implies 2.7% growth. The solid fourth-quarter results were driven by strong sales in the Asia-Pacific region, which gained 9% thanks to the opening of new stores. New, cheaper and higher-margin products also boosted results. At the same time, though, the company experienced domestic weakness due to sluggish tourism spending and continued struggles in brick-and-mortar retail. In fact, sales at Tiffany’s flagship store in New York City declined 7% in the quarter. They were down 11% in the full year and 14% during the holiday season. Some of this was due to slower tourism, but it also has to do with the fact that the store is located next to Trump Tower, which has undergone increased security measures. TIF stock climbed as much as 4.5% following Friday’s release to hit a new 19-month high, and I believe the strength was thanks in part to low expectations and better sales outside the United States. But as I mentioned, I still have concerns here. Click to Enlarge First, the flagship store has been a perennial disappointment — the company stopped breaking out its numbers not long ago, which underscores the issue — and I would love to see a major renovation that would make it more modern and an overall better shopping experience. It’s also time for new designers — and on that note, it’s worth mentioning that the lower dollar is great news for the company. I’ve certainly had success buying TIF stock after sell-offs in the past, and the majority of the disappointments I’ve had have been the result of buying too soon and thinking the worst was already over. But I wouldn’t be a buyer here. Technically, the stock is at a two-year double top, which is bearish. So while I wouldn’t chase Tiffany at the moment, I do see ways the company can justify higher valuations in the future as long as management makes some changes and becomes more consistent in its execution.

The company says these boards are aimed at content creation professionals, and the just-announced Z270X-Designare ATX motherboard should fit that bill easily. Like most high-end motherboards, it's covered in fancy features. It's also fully validated for use with Nvidia's Quadro graphics cards. This board isn't quite as out-there as the X99-Designare EX that we reviewed last November. That's mostly because this model is based on Intel's Z270 desktop chipset rather than the X99 high-end platform. With the Z270X-Designare, you still get four DDR4 DIMM slots supporting transfer rates up to 3866 MT/sec, M.2 and U.2 sockets with PCIe 3.0 x4 connectivity, and a trio of USB 3.1 ports. One of those ports is an internal header that can be used for a front-panel USB 3.1 connector, while the other two are standard Type-A and Type-C ports located on the rear panel. Like other companies have been doing lately, Gigabyte's moved to ASMedia's 2142 USB 3.1 controller to let users run two devices at up to 8Gbps simultaneously. Curiously, Gigabyte also included two SATA Express connectors. The Z270X-Designare includes all of Gigabyte's usual builder conveniences including my favorite feature, the "G Connector" front-panel header sleeve. All five of the Z270X-Designare's fan headers are "hybrid" headers that can intelligently adapt to run a CPU fan, a case fan, a water pump, or whatever else you plug into them. All of the memory slots and PCIe x16 slots are heavily reinforced with stainless steel, too. The board supports Gigabyte's newly-redesigned RGB Fusion application for controlling its onboard RGB LEDs, as well as RGBW light-strips and the lighting on Gigabyte graphics cards. Onboard audio is provided by Realtek's top-end ALC1220 codec and includes Gigabyte's custom-designed headphone amplifier. Meanwhile, an Intel chip offers Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. It doesn't look like Gigabyte's latest effort has hit online retailers yet, but don't expect it to be cheap when it does.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Nunes cancels open Russia hearing, Schiff blasts his ass In Politics by Maggie Serota / March 24, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @maggieserota On Friday morning, Congressman Devin Nunes (R-CA) abruptly canceled an open hearing regarding the House Intelligence Committee’s probes into Trump’s ties to Russia. Several former Obama staffers, including former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Sally Yates, the former Acting Attorney General famously fired by the Trump administration after questioning the legality of the president’s Muslim travel ban, were schedule to testify in the public hearing Tuesday. Nunes, the current House Intelligence Committee chair, claims that the open hearing was nixed to schedule a private meeting with FBI Director James Comey and NSA head Michael Rogers, but Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the Intel Committee, wasted no time putting Nunes on blast. BREAKING: Chairman just cancelled open Intelligence Committee hearing with Clapper, Brennan and Yates in attempt to choke off public info. — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) March 24, 2017 In addition to accusing Nunes of canceling the hearing to deliberately “choke off” public information, Schiff is calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan to decide if Nunes needs to be removed as intel committee chair. There was already a case for that when Nunes ran and told Trump about surveillance he wasn’t even sure took place before informing his fellow committee members. Schiff appeared before reporters and appealed for the Russia probe to be handled by an independent committee “untainted by political considerations.” “I’m deeply discouraged by this week’s events,” said Schiff, “I think the public is discouraged by this week’s events, and I think at this point, it would give the public more confidence if we didn’t stop what we’re doing, but we established a truly independent body quite separate from Congress just as we did after 9/11.” Rep.

Gigabyte AMD A320 motherboards In other Gigabyte motherboard news today it has been noticed that the firm has added two AMD A320 chipset motherboards to its lineup. There's the full ATX GA-A320-DS3, and the micro-ATX GA-A320M-HD2. As these feature AMD's entry level Ryzen compatible chipset they of course offer fewer features than the higher-grade boards but at a reduced cost to the consumer. Among the snips applied to this chipset are; no support provided for CPU overclocking, and a single PCI-Express 3.0 x16 slot. Comparing the models, other than the obvious differences in size and PCI slot allocations, the micro-ATX model offers a back panel HDMI port that the larger model lacks (D-Sub and DVI-D only). Both these motherboards are likely contenders for Bristol Ridge APU pairing. In such a setup the ATX model can work in CrossFire config with integrated APU graphics. Pricing is likely to be around $80 or lower for either model.

Nunes also said that he had canceled what was to be an open hearing with Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Former CIA Director John Brennan and Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. The Hill reports: Nunez also said Friday he has asked Comey and National Security Agency (NSA) head Mike Rogers to brief the Intelligence Committee in a closed session. Nunes cautioned that he does not expect to receive documentation from the NSA regarding his claims that Trump campaign associates were possibly monitored  by the Intelligence Community on Friday. But he categorically denied that his decision to make public the information on the issue that he does have was coordinated by the White House. Nunes would not discuss the source of the surveillance that he improperly and breathlessly delivered to Donald Trump at the White House earlier this week, would not say who was swept up in it, and says he is still the only lawmaker who has seen it. Nunes also said “there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower,” a statement he hasn’t made categorically before. “There was no wiretapping of Trump Tower.

Devin Nunes announced on Friday. Nunes, who chairs the committee, said that Manafort made the offer on Thursday. He said that whether Manafort testifies in a closed or open setting is up to him. Carter Page, a former policy adviser for the campaign, also offered on Thursday to testify, though Nunes did not mention that offer. Manafort has been a central figure in the theories that the Trump campaign had improper relations with the Russian government during the campaign. Brought onto the Trump team last March to help wrangle delegates for Trump, Manafort has worked as a consultant for Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Manafort has also partnered with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who is close to Putin. The 67-year-old operative is one of several Trump advisers who are subjects of an FBI investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Kremlin. FBI director James Comey confirmed on Monday that an investigation is being conducted, but he did not specifically name Manafort. The White House has recently downplayed Manafort’s involvement with the campaign, calling him a “volunteer” who was not an influential member of the campaign. Carter Page, an energy consultant who had a small role on the Trump foreign policy team, also offered to testify to the committee, he told The Daily Caller. “I would eagerly welcome the chance to speak with the Committee to help finally set the record straight following the false evidence, illegal activities as well as other lies distributed by certain politically-motivated suspects in coordination with the Obama Administration, which defamed me and other Americans,” Page wrote in a letter to Nunes and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee’s top Democrat, on Thursday. In the letter, which Page shared exclusively with TheDC, Page asserted that Schiff made false claims about him in Monday’s hearing. In the hearing, Schiff cited the uncorroborated 35-page dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele to claim that Page made a deal with Russian oil giant Rosneft during the campaign. “Is it a coincidence that the Russian gas company, Rosneft, sold a 19 percent share after former British intelligence officer Steele was told by Russian sources that Carter Page was offered fees on a deal of just that size?” Schiff asked in the hearing. Page calls the assertion “complete lies.” “Amongst many other complete lies, this excerpt from the highly inaccurate dossier concocted by the political consultant Mr. Steele remained one of the primary false allegations against me throughout much of last year,” wrote Page, who notes that the Rosneft stake was purchased by Glencore, a commodity trading company founded by Marc Rich, the billionaire fugitive who was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton. “I have never received any transactions fees, financial compensation, equity stake or related offers from Rosneft — in 2016 or at any point in my life,” added Page, who told TheDC that he has not received a response from the committee. Page has also offered to testify to the Senate Intelligence Committee. And earlier this week, Roger Stone, another Trump adviser who is a target of the FBI probe, said that he hopes to testify as well. Asked whether Manafort plans to testify in a public setting or in private, a spokesman referred TheDC back to a statement issued earlier in the day.

(Seeking Alpha) Recent checks in the Asia PC supply chain point toward a “systemic turnaround” at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD), backed by higher responsiveness, better execution, enthusiasm for the Zen Desktop MPUs and positive expectations for Zen Server, Jefferies’ Mark Lipacis said in a report. While reiterating a Buy rating and price target of $16 for Advanced Micro Devices, Lipacis wrote, “The checks give us higher conviction in our above consensus estimates.” Higher Responsiveness, Better Execution Recent checks indicate a significant change in the company’s process and execution since CEO Lisa Su took over 2.5 years ago. Advanced Micro Devices seems to have become “more responsive to PCODM questions and issues,” and there appears to be “a higher level of trust in AMD's ability to execute,” the analyst mentioned. Positive Zen Desktop Reception The new Zen Desktop MPU benchmarks favorably versus Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s MPUs. Positive Zen Server Expectations “Our sources view a positive Zen Desktop launch as leading indicator for the Zen server launch, given that the DT and server MPU architectures are similar,” Lipacis said. He added, however, that a mid-year launch of Zen Server would likely not translate to a significant ramp until fourth-quarter 2017.

It’s hard for Lancaster (Texas) High cornerback Jordon Austin to step on a football field right now. Still recovering from a torn ACL suffered in October, it’s a reminder of what he’s not quite able to do at the moment. http://www.scout.com/player/191770-jordon-austin?s=73 That was on full display earlier this month when Austin was at The Opening regional in Frisco, Texas, but not going through drills. Instead, on the sidelines decked out in Oklahoma apparel as the OU commit didn’t have a chance to compete. The physical grind has been tough for Austin, now ranked No. 29 cornerback in the nation, but it pales in comparison to the mental comeback. “Definitely mental,” said Austin about what’s been tougher. “I went through a mad phase. I went through a sad phase. I went through all the phases of an injury. I feel perfect, but my doctor says I’m not there yet. “Not being able to do spring ball and go through everything my team and be in the trenches, it’s the little stuff like that.” All Austin can do is shake his head about how he was injured. His leg wasn’t 100 percent to begin with when his competitive mentality took over during pregame drills. In a defensive back drill where you’re supposed to catch the ball at its highest point, Austin came down hard on his leg. He knew immediately something was wrong. He couldn’t put any pressure on it and his junior season was cut short. Austin is on the road back. He said he is expected to miss 6-8 months, which is pretty common for an ACL tear, but his doctor said he’s closer to the six-month timetable than the eight-month one. “Physically? I feel ready,” Austin said. “I look perfect and feel like I’m where I should be. I feel like I can go, but my doctor is trying to make sure I don’t push it. I feel ready, but I’m not. All those pieces aren’t connected together yet.” Austin has a strong support system. He has his teammates and coaches at Lancaster. He has his family, including former OU cornerback Dakota Austin. But this battle has been something Jordon has opted to try to combat alone. It’s almost as if it’s a sign of weakness in Jordon Austin’s eyes to ask for help or to admit how tough the process has been. It’s one reason why the only time he has been to OU during this stint was for senior day at Bedlam for Dakota to watch OU’s 38-20 win vs. Oklahoma State. “I try to keep it to myself because I don’t anybody to know what I’m going through when those doors are closed,” Austin said. “There have been some hard, hard days. I mean you just don’t understand how badly I want to play. “The therapist keeps asking why I’m going so hard, attacking it so hard. I just miss it.” Austin was offered by OU at last year’s spring game and then committed to the Sooners later in the summer. He said his relationship with defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks is good but admits he hasn’t talked to Cooks as much because he wants to prove he’s 100 percent again. That’s the motto right now for Austin, who was ranked in the Scout 300 last summer. He wants to prove to everybody he will come back the same player or even a better player than he was before. The recruiting trail has gone cold for Austin since the injury. No real junior film to show people, it has been a lot of wait-and-see. “Every school I go to, they hit with the line of they would love to offer but have to wait,” Austin said. “I want them to just be honest and say they want to know if I’m the same guy.” OU could be in the same spot. No signs of wavering, the Sooners will have to see if Austin can return to his form as well. OU has stood by his side throughout this process, but it’s a cutthroat business and Austin understands that. Austin has added some offers but nothing to the level of the Sooners at this point. Austin is anxious to return to Norman, but he wants to do it on his terms when he’s able to compete. He said he felt like he was cheating last December when he was at OU for Bedlam because he wasn’t 100 percent. He said he felt like he was lying because he was walking around looking normal but not actually being normal. He wants that to change. He wants to be normal. He wants to tell Cooks and the rest of the coaches he’s back to 100 percent. “I don’t want him (Cooks) to know the process,” Austin said. “All he knows to know is that I’m as good as I ever was. “I’m not going to be timid. I want to go hard. I want to sweat hard. I want complain because it’s hard. You know how badly I want to do a ladder right now? I want to do any drills so much right now. I’m going to be back.”   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout 'Pledge(r) of allegiance' -T.J. commits to OU OU coach Bob Stoops favors Big 12 CCG Bell Rings Ducks to Final Four Video: Baker Mayfield addresses arrest OU spring photo gallery: First practice Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Breaking News 'Pledge(r) of allegiance' -T.J. commits to OUOU lands another major commitment in Scout 100 running back T.J.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print HOUSE WILL VOTE ON OBAMACARE REPEAL TODAY – Trump daring GOP lawmakers to vote against him – SCHUMER READIES FOR SUPREME COURT SHOWDOWN – Nunes apologizes over Trump intel report 03/24/17 07:47 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) PUT UP OR SHUT UP — Come hell or high water, House Republicans will vote on the GOP plan to repeal Obamacare today. That’s the message White House officials delivered to the rank-and-file in a closed-door meeting Thursday night after a day of negotiations with both rock-ribbed conservatives and moderates left GOP leaders short of the 215 votes they need for passage. Will the repeal pass? Anyone who tells you they know for sure one way or the other is lying. It will be a nail biter. Story Continued Below Pulling the Trump card: President Donald Trump is going all in on this repeal bill and daring Republicans to vote against him. If the repeal effort fails today, Trump is prepared to move on and leave Obamacare in place, OMB Director Mick Mulvaney warned lawmakers last night. Rachael, Kyle and Josh Dawsey with the state of play heading into today: http://politi.co/2njyUXn What’s at stake: A loss on the floor today would be a real gut punch for Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of the White House’s ambitious legislative agenda (tax reform, trade, infrastructure). But a win would be a much-needed shot of momentum for Trump and Ryan and could significantly scuttle the Freedom Caucus’ power to dictate the House agenda. Y’all ready for this? GOP leadership has been itching for a showdown with the Freedom Caucus since they sent House Speaker John Boehner packing 18 months ago, Rachael and Bres report. For Freedom Caucus members, they’re at a crossroads. “They can vote for a repeal bill they once dubbed ‘Obamacare Lite.’ Or they can stick together and block the president’s first major legislative initiative.” More: http://politi.co/2njBLQb BAD NEWS BEARS — The Congressional Budget office delivered bad news for House Republicans in the middle of Thursday’s chaos: the latest iteration of their repeal bill scored by the nonpartisan office would cost billions more without covering more people, Sarah Ferris reports. CBO estimates the bill would cost $186 billion more over the next decade compared to their initial proposal and would still leave 24 million people uninsured compared to current law. The latest CBO score doesn’t include a last-minute change added to the bill to please conservatives that would nix minimum coverage requirements for insurance companies. And, as Burgess and Jen Haberkorn report, senators in both parties are already signaling that the latest bag of conservative goodies will have a hard time surviving in the Senate. In short: Trump and GOP leaders are asking members to hold their nose and cast a vote today on a career-defining bill without first knowing the full political ramifications. ** A message from the Coalition to Protect America’s Health Care: The current bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act could slash the number of Americans that are able to afford or maintain health coverage. Speak up today and tell Congress: Don’t support the ACA replacement bill. http://politi.co/2nJDiMQ ** PLEASE SEND MY REGRETS — No matter what the outcome of today’s vote, Trump is already regretting letting House GOP leaders dictate the legislative agenda in his budding presidency. “Trump has told four people close to him that he regrets going along with Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s plan to push a health care overhaul before unveiling a tax cut proposal more politically palatable to Republicans,” Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman report. “Until this week, Mr. Trump was slow to recognize the high stakes of the fight, or the implications of losing. He approved the agenda putting health care first late last year, almost in passing, in meetings with Mr. Ryan, Vice President Mike Pence and Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff.” The New York Times: http://nyti.ms/2ne0HqA OMG, FRIDAY, YES. Welcome to March 24 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. It’s been a long week. You have Huddle’s permission to have a margarita (or three) after it’s all said and done today. THURSDAY’S MOST CLICKED: The latest story on the Obamacare repeal saga from Kyle, Rachael and Bres dominated the clicks THE SCHUMER SHOWDOWN — Chuck Schumer is prepared to go nuclear. “In an extensive interview with POLITICO Thursday, the Senate minority leader made his most definitive statement to date that Democrats will deny Neil Gorsuch the 60 votes he needs to clear a Senate filibuster and ascend to the Supreme Court,” Burgess and Elana report. Rejecting the idea of a deal to confirm Gorsuch floated by some Democrats this week, Schumer “all but declared that Donald Trump's nominee will not receive the requisite eight Democratic votes — and that it will be up to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as to whether to try to blow up the filibuster to get Gorsuch through. ‘There’s been an almost seismic shift in the caucus [against Gorsuch],' Schumer said as the Senate Judiciary confirmation hearings wrapped up Thursday.” Don’t miss it: http://politi.co/2ndZcJh --Supporters and critics of the SCOTUS nominee make last-ditch pleas. Seung Min and Josh Gerstein’s dispatch from the last day of confirmation hearings: http://politi.co/2ndWSlk ALL APOLOGIES — House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes apologized Thursday for not first briefing the panel’s top Democrat before going public with allegations that communications from the Trump transition team were inadvertently intercepted by U.S. spy agencies. Intel ranking member Adam Schiff called Nunes’ actions “wholly inappropriate” on NPR Thursday. Austin and Nolan McCaskill with more: http://politi.co/2necHZs Nunes, while privately apologetic to committee members, publicly defended his “judgment call” to go to the president and the press first. "I felt I had a duty and obligation to tell [Trump] because as you know he’s been taking a lot of heat in the news media,” Nunes told Sean Hannity Thursday night. Cristiano Lima: http://politi.co/2ndUTxn Happening today: Democrats on the Intel panel expect to be briefed today on the same information Nunes was privy to earlier in the week. Nunes still hasn’t released details about the report he viewed or even its source, saying through a spokesman Thursday that he doesn’t know “for sure” if the intel actually involved communications from Trump’s team or was just mentions of their names. The Wall Street Journal’s Byron Tau and Siobhan Hughes: http://on.wsj.com/2niUBqB HUNTER UNDER DOJ INVESTIGATION — The Justice Department is investigating California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter over alleged campaign finance violations, the House Ethics Committee announced Thursday. Hunter spent thousands of campaign dollars on questionable expenses in 2015 and 2016, including everything from a hotel in Italy to flying his pet bunny across the country. Hunter has repaid his campaign about $60,000. Bres reports on the DOJ probe: http://politi.co/2niQmvp HEAD-TO-HEAD IN THE HOOSIER STATE — “Hoosier politicos call it the ‘Wabash mafia.’ And now two graduates of the tiny, all-male college in Indiana are likely to face off in the Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in 2018,” Simone Pathé reports for Roll Call. “GOP Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita graduated from Wabash College just one year apart. And while neither has officially entered the race, they’re both making moves that suggest this cycle’s primary could again feature member-on-member theatrics.” More: http://bit.ly/2ndQNFK THE GLOBAL POLITICO PODCAST: The Man Who Would Beat Bibi: Donald Trump wants to team up with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make the deal of the century between Israel and the Palestinians.

The health care bill could also limit benefits for current Medicaid enrollees and harm programs for our most vulnerable Americans — including children, the elderly, and the disabled. And these health care changes could affect us all by reducing our community hospitals’ ability to provide essential quality care. A decrease in health coverage and continued cuts to hospital funding will impact patient access to care and hospital services. Tell your senators and representative: Protect patients and access to care.

Coren Obsession The Office March 24, 2017 Googlers are mad as hell. (Twitter) Share Written by Michael J. Coren Obsession The Office March 24, 2017 Conversations on the campuses of Google, Facebook, and other tech giants in Silicon Valley are pushing an idea labor experts once dismissed as outlandish. Hundreds of well-paid engineers and product managers at some of the world’s most powerful companies are talking about unionizing. No group of technology employees at the tech giants have filed for formal recognition yet, according to interviews with the AFL-CIO. Facebook, Uber, and Google would not comment on union-related discussions with staff. Yet groups born out of resistance to US president Donald Trump are aggressively advancing the idea. “In the last few weeks, interest and curiosity in unions and labor organizing has definitely ramped up,” said an organizer of the Tech Workers Coalition, a grass-roots activist group founded in 2015, with members from Silicon Valley’s largest companies. “Tech CEOs will be cozy with Trump until it affects their bottom line, or ability to keep employees,” she said. Silicon Valley’s attitude toward unionizing has vacillated between disdain and outright hostility. Robert Noyce, co-founder of Intel, once argued “remaining non-union is essential for survival for most of our companies. If we had the work rules that unionized companies have, we’d all go out of business.” Atari workers tried but failed to unionize in 1982 and 1983, and Apple’s retail stores’ employees never saw their union take shape (although won wage concessions). Recent efforts by blue-collar workers to unionize at technology companies, while successful, have not inspired their professional peers. But tech workers’ opposition to Trump’s agenda, especially his allusion to building a Muslim database in the US, spurred a nascent movement to organize as a way of delivering their message to Silicon Valley’s boardrooms. Tech Solidarity, a grass-roots organization for tech workers, founded last November, has made it one of their core objectives. “Our goal is collective action by employees,” says Tech Solidarity founder Maciej Ceglowski who asserts employees’ ability to walk out the door (and into one of the 223,000 open job positions for software engineers in the US) is their most powerful weapon against companies collaborating on dubious government polices from immigration to surveillance. Hundreds of people have flocked to Tech Solidarity’s meetings held in more than a dozen major cities across the country. Ceglowski has called for management to “fear” their employees, and is actively recruiting managers from Google and Facebook. The software developer and Pinboard founder is embarking on a long-term effort to force social and economic reforms within the tech industry. “So far, we have been totally silent and acquiescent,” he said. “We want people to be afraid of the political power of their employees.” A voice to oppose Trump Silicon Valley seems a world away from organized labor’s strongholds in factory towns like Chicago and Detroit. Unions emerged in response to individual workers’ inability to negotiate better “wages, hours and working conditions” with owners of the industrial economy. Tech workers, by contrast, enjoy more leverage over their employers than almost any other class of worker. The difference is simple supply and demand. There are far fewer experienced software engineers than job openings, and most command salaries about triple the US median on average. Training and replacing developers is as difficult as finding them, so companies go to extraordinary lengths to keep them. Hence the open bars, posh recreational rooms, and hot tubs on many tech campuses (as well as illegal collusion by Google, Apple, Intel and others to cap wages by not hiring away each others’ staff). A Silicon Valley union, by contrast, would probably not put wages as its center. Tech Solidarity and others see unions as a way to achieve their real goal: a right to decide if their company is living up to the ethical standards of its workforce. Inevitably, those values translate into politics. The second reason why Bay Area elites could prove ripe for unionizing is the culture. Silicon Valley techies bring their politics in their work like nowhere else. Generous salaries are only the first gambit to attract the best talent. To win, companies must sell themselves, in Valley parlance, as the place you go to make the world a better place. From Google’s “Don’t be evil” to Tesla’s mission to slow climate change, tech workers often demand their employers’ ideals, at least officially, match their own. “We live in this place where we want to save the world,” says Optimizely software engineer Brad Taylor, whose Facebook post urging tech workers to organize went viral in late January, leading to the formation of Tech Against Trump. “But it’s very disheartening to see our leaders who we look up to not stick up for the same values they talk about. Eventually, you’ll see engineers vote by who they work for.” Tech campuses have seen waves of protests in recent months. Trump’s unpopularity before the election (workers at tech giants sent 97 cents of every dollar in political donations to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton) has only intensified. Tech workers who never attended a political rally in their lives are now speaking out, protesting, and even quitting to oppose corporate collaboration with parts of Trump’s agenda. Incredible scenes at Google headquarters today. Thousands came to #GooglersUnite protest on less than 1 day notice #NoBanNoWall #NoMuslimBan pic.twitter.com/pBaIWmluoD — Tolu Thomas (@ToluThomas) January 31, 2017 So far, the resignations have only trickled in. Oracle and IBM have both seen employees publicly depart over their executives’ accommodations to Trump, although not in any great numbers. Shopify lost one developer who cited its willingness to permit the right-wing news site Breitbart to use its service for online shopping. I’m leaving Shopify. Cognitive dissonance got too loud. Looking for software dev job, exp in mostly js & ruby. 👋 — Tessa Thornton (@tessthornton) February 13, 2017 The blowback was most intense at Uber. CEO Travis Kalanick was pilloried for the perception that he was giving tacit support to the Trump Administration. His role on a Trump economic and policy advisory council (along with other executives such as Tesla’s Elon Musk), as well as the charge that he undermined a taxi strike protesting Trump’s initial immigration ban, prompted a #DeleteUber campaign on social media. The fallout triggered a company-wide meeting at which employees told the CEO about the “personal cost” of working at Uber given the stigma attached to Kalanick’s perceived support for Trump, according to The New York Times. “What would it take for you to quit the economic council?” at least two employees asked at the Jan. 31 meeting. Kalanick stepped down on Feb. 2. A professional approach to organizing Silicon Valley unions are already scoring victories, at least among blue-collar workers. Three thousand security guards at Facebook, Cisco, and Genentech led the largest private sector organizing effort in the Silicon Valley in January, said the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West. That followed a string of successful organizing campaigns by janitors, food service workers, and bus drivers at tech companies like Apple. Even Tesla employees are talking to the United Auto Workers to unionize the company’s Fremont electric vehicle factory. Will it work for software engineers? “I think it’s not only not crazy, it makes a lot of sense,” says Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor think tank in Washington DC. Although labor union membership peaked in 1954 at 35% of US workers, sinking to just 10.7% of the workforce today, there is a bright spot in the data: professional workers. More than 6 million professional and technical workers are now in unions, more than half of them in computer-related professions such as software development, information technology, and computer science, according to Census Bureau Current Population Survey data compiled by the AFL-CIO. Professional unions are now the fastest growing segment of the AFL-CIO, approaching 6% of the total US workforce. “We’ve seen the trend lines for last 15 years and they’re going up,” says Paul Almeida, the head of the AFL-CIO’s professional employee department. Unions are now starting to resemble the workforce itself. The US has shed 7 million manufacturing jobs in the last four decades. The need for workers who operate computers has eclipsed those who need to manage heavy machinery, especially in factories where automation is ascendent. White-collar priorities like workplace flexibility and decision-making are rising concerns alongside wages for unions, report AFL-CIO member surveys. Union workers have fought for their members’ politics before: the AFL-CIO lent support for the Vietnam War (before backing away), and unions marched regularly with Martin Luther King Jr. who considered many of them allies. That said, convincing a meritocracy-minded band of engineers and technologists in Silicon Valley to sign up for an institution designed for 20th-century assembly lines seems far-fetched. But Stan Sorscher disagrees. A physicist and former Boeing engineer, Sorscher represents 22,650 professionals in SPEEA, an aerospace union. He sees parallels between Trump’s roiling of Silicon Valley and Boeing engineers’ decision to strike in 1999 over wages and working conditions, the longest, biggest white-collar strike in American history. “That was a radicalizing, transformative experience for most of the members,” he said. It’s something the protests against Trump may be doing for California’s tech community. “If workers can get organized somewhere in Silicon Valley, they can bring a legitimate view to the table and claim political power,” said Sorscher. “The most thrilling thing an organizer can do is get people out in the street, and then convert that into real power.” No one knows if there’s enough momentum. But Trump’s first executive order banning immigration, an affront to Silicon Valley’s global workforce, unified it against the White House in a matter of days. CEOs spoke out at protests on company’s headquarters and joined demonstrators at the airport. Tech companies rushed en masse to sign amicus briefs opposing the orders. To turn this into concerted action, says Sorscher, tech workers will need to find an organizational structure and be willing to act collectively. Trump has shown the latter. Finding an organizing model appealing to everyone is less certain. Sorscher says a union was right for SPEEA when it started in the 1940s, but a different association may be right for Silicon Valley. Regardless, he said, political power rests in a group’s ability to articulate its demands, coordinate members and deliver a message. The results will follow. As Trump’s policies force the workforce to confront its own role in building tools for US surveillance and technology to enact other policies, a nascent sense of common identity is emerging. Something may have to give. Pressure is quietly being exerted on executives by some of the most powerful employees inside companies, says Valerie Aurora, an activist who signed on to the NeverAgain.tech pledge with 2,843 signatories in the technology industry data. “They are the people who, if they aren’t doing their job in minutes or hours, the company starts losing vast amounts of money,” she said. “These are the people with pagers. These are people who are saying, ‘Hey, Mr. CEO, we’d like you to know what what our opinions are.'” Most Popular A Stanford psychologist just disproved the oldest love advice in the book Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 Mac Mini Refresh: Will It Happen? Posted: Mar 24 2017, 5:35am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, Updated: Mar 24 2017, 9:34am CDT, in News | Apple     Intel Kaby Lake processors seem a shoe-in for an updated Mac Mini When the Apple Store was down earlier this week for the unveiling of the slightly refreshed iPhone SE and new iPads. Many were hoping that Apple would also make some changes to its cheapest Mac computer, the Mac Mini. while no 2017 Mac Mini was unveiled, pricing on the current Mac Mini has fallen to some of the lowest pricing we have ever seen at $399. Don't Miss: MWC 2017 Highlights The current Mac Mini has been on the market for a long time and the last update seen for the computer was back in 2014. The machine currently has a fourth gen 1.4GHz Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM, 500GB 5,400 rpm hard drive under the hood. It's powerful enough for basic tasks, but certainly not up to modern standards of similarly priced Windows machines. The big question is what sort of upgrades will a 2017 Mac Mini bring, assuming that Apple doesn't completely abandon the platform. I think Apple will continue to make the mini, after all there are lots of people who want into the Mac ecosystem, but certainly don't want to pay the price a Mac Pro costs and don't want a MacBook. A refreshed 2017 Mac Mini would get the latest generation processors under the hood, perhaps something in Intel Kaby Lake flavor. Upgrades would also have to include storage, likely going to larger capacity 7,200 rpm hard drives with the option for a SSD on higher-end models. More RAM would be a safe bet as well, most modern machines today have at least 6GB of RAM and people prefer more when available. Options for more RAM would certainly be offered. Availability for those Kaby Lake processors appropriate for the Mac mini could account for the delay in refresh according to MacWorld UK. Appropriate Kaby Lake processors in enough bulk could still be months away. With Kaby Lake supporting things like Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, and DisplayPort 1.2 along with 4K video, it would be a safe bet that any upgraded Mini would offer that connectivity. An updated graphics card could make the Mac VR ready, but with VR still mostly tied to gaming, something that Apple isn't big on for its computers, this one might be a bit of a stretch. New and more power efficient hardware that also generates less heat could mean a smaller 2017 Mac Mini. There is also the chance that Apple will simply discontinue the Mac Mini, the line is certainly neglected and Apple appears to be gearing up to shed the mini moniker. Apple really only wants to sell high end products to maintain those all-important margins. That said, I still think the Mini will continue on, but Apple has never seemed keen on making the machine a priority.

Styling by Joanna Hir.   | Photo Credit: Lykasz Suchorab Tsering Dolma March 24, 2017 15:44 IST Updated: March 25, 2017 11:49 IST more-in The Hindu Weekend Bionic pop artiste, Viktoria Modesta, is breaking stereotypes of disability, fashion and entertainment with her multi-media performances and advanced prosthetics Earlier this month, at a special exhibition at the Paris Fashion Week, silks and sequins gave way to cutting-edge designs in fashion technology. Like Chromat’s Adrenalin Dress, with a carbon-fibre skeleton powered by Intel’s Curie computing module, which expands depending on how ‘pumped up’ the wearer is feeling; CuteCircuit’s Kinetic Dress outfit, with microLED illumination, that reacts to the surroundings; and even one that displays tweets in real time. However, the showstopper at the Tumblr event (to celebrate Scarlett Johansson’s cyber-enhanced role in the upcoming Ghost in the Shell) was Viktoria Modesta, the real-life bionic woman. Dressed in a white leather ensemble and a prosthetic leg that lit up, the Latvia-born English pop star performed her single, ‘Prototype’ (currently a few clicks away from hitting eight million views on YouTube), which reportedly also inspired “elements of the show through its exploration of fashion, art and technology”. Spike in the conversation Modesta’s life is a testament to breaking the shackles of limitations and creating new possibilities, which, in her case, is striking synergy between technology, fashion and human expression. In fact, the singer-artiste, who made it to Marie Claire Belgium’s list of global female changemakers this month, doesn’t subscribe to the title ‘disabled’ (“We are no longer living in the forests where a person with a physical body issue cannot reach their highest potential as a human being through other achievements,” she once told the UK newspaper, The Independent). Instead, and unsurprisingly, she identifies herself as a ‘prototype’ and is passionate about sparking new conversations about the future of fashion and technology. Last year, the 30-year-old teamed up with neuroscientists, coders and fashion designers for a multi-media performance at Berlin’s Music Tech Fest — sporting 3D-printed nails that triggered an LED skin interface (to create shifts in lighting on her body) and sensors on her wrists (to activate sound effects). She also collaborated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, where she is a Director’s Fellow, to showcase a high-tech artificial leg (The Spike) at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibition, titled #techstyle, showcased futuristic garments from renowned brands like Alexander McQueen, Viktor&Rolf, and Ralph Lauren. The first leg Technology and medical devices, she believes, complement fashion, as she has proved. But the struggle to get to where she is today has been tough. Born in erstwhile USSR, complications at birth left Modesta with a dislocated hip and leg. Reconstructive surgeries (15 of them, from the age of six) did not help. At 12, her family migrated to the UK. “We came with $100, essentially asking for asylum. We did not speak the language; it was very tough. In school, I became an easy target for bullying because I looked different and was also rebellious. But I could see the huge vastness of options that London had to offer. It became more of a playground,” says Modesta, who quit school at 14 to befriend like-minded people in the city’s alternative club scene. After a voluntary amputation at 20 (“one of the best decisions I’ve made in life”), and several modelling assignments for alternative fashion labels, she shot into the limelight performing at the 2012 London Paralympics closing ceremony — where she wore a prosthetic leg covered in Swarovski diamonds. Now, the face of British media house, Channel 4’s Born Risky disability initiative, she is guest starring in a sci-fi TV show that’s due to air internationally this summer. “The entire production is inspired by my work. I mostly play myself in the show, but it is also a slightly more fantasy me from the future,” says Modesta. Excerpts from an interview: Do international fashion and the music industry have a conducive environment for people with disabilities? I honestly don’t think we are quite there. There is still so much work to be done, it is still a novelty. It is the very beginning stages of what happened with ethnicity and sexuality. The reason I say that is because, even after millions of views and hundreds of thousands of people that know about my work, I operate outside of those industries. The place where I thrive is the newly-emerging community of artistes that work in innovative performance, tech fashion, and have a more futuristic approach. How do you think technology has helped artistes like you in advancing freedom? I think technology is beginning to be more integrated into human function and expression. We will not be emotionless robots; using technology can showcase the subtleties we haven’t learned to express yet. You’ve spoken about how Aimee Mullins, the American athlete and model who walked the ramp with prosthetic legs, inspired you. Aimee’s work was an anomaly at the time, the world just wasn’t ready. Even though the creative work was executed by Alexander McQueen and Matthew Barney, it was fascinating for me to see that it’s possible to turn your body and identity into an art concept, especially a female body. Of course, the option of different legs and the things you could do with them, was super cool, too, especially as I was about 14 at the time. I really wanted to be the creative brain behind all my imagery and creative direction. You exude positivity and drive, despite all challenges. How do you face criticism? When I was a little girl, so many elders who had barely achieved anything at the time, were trying to dim my enthusiasm. Even though I was young and susceptible, I also realised early on that if I followed their fears, I would die. So I chose to believe in myself and my story. Everyone's uniqueness and dreams are worthy. Could you speak about your current experiments with technology? The latest one was during Art Basel (last December), where I did a project called Sonifica with Anouk Wipprecht, Monad Studios and LIM Innovations. I wore a 3D-printed musical instrument, in the shape of tusks, and a bustier with sensors, so I could play music accompanied by a mini 3D-printed orchestra. You’ve spoken about how medical devices can be used in fashion. I think anything medical, which needs to be worn on the outside, can have design implemented. Historically, people hid braces and prosthetics under clothes, but I think they can be worked into objects of design and desire. How do you see the integration of technology and fashion evolving? It will be everywhere. The biggest thing will be how much invisible tech can be integrated into normal clothes — from temperature control to keeping an eye on health, to fabrics mixed with biological organisms. Your musical inspirations? I am a fan of Disney! It's my love for doing the unimaginable, the magical and the dramatic that is at the core of me as an artist. I enjoy performing live, because I also get to direct every show and create outfits. It's the creation of an alternative reality that I enjoy, a full hyper-reality moment, so the viewer can follow me on that journey for a moment and experience my energy. Tell us about your upcoming projects. There will be more advanced tech/art performances, more music releases and videos, some futuristic product designs, and a few surgical procedures, too. I am also planning my own line of wearables.

Google's "Fizz" is another Kabylake-based Chromebook. Support for this device was added yesterday to mainline Coreboot Git. The Chromebook Fizz is similar to the Poppy device with various internal differences. Fizz isn't libre but as with all recent generations of Intel hardware, will continue to rely upon proprietary blobs for the firmware support package, etc. But at least it's nice seeing Coreboot used by Chromebooks still and with the latest-generation Kabylake CPUs. Those wishing to explore it more can find all the Coreboot Fizz code via the Git repository. 9 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The web-based interface is accessible to all enterprises, offering information on how to digitally transform their business with resources explaining the proposition and benefits to using Dell EMC's cloud platform. They are then able to use filters and search terms to find the best service provider to meet their needs, then contact a right fit directly from the hub. Service providers have a dedicated area too, where they are able to identify hot leads through LeadPool demand generation and resources to help them promote their services to enterprise customers. Dell EMC explained it will also offer service providers co-marketing support including marketing-as-a-service to help service providers promote their own marketing assets, a campaign builder to create their own assets and access to Everyone Social. “Historically, vendors have failed to support Service Providers in their campaigns and the Dell EMC Cloud Ecosystem represents a game-changing development for both Service Providers and customers alike,” said Eric Velfre, senior vice president, Compute and Networking Sales Dell EMC EMEA. “By simplifying access to the Dell EMC Cloud value proposition and offering content and support for co-marketing projects, we can generate awareness and enable new capabilities to achieve greater profitability for our partners.

For those who came in late, Intel bought Nervana in the firm belief that the next big thing will be AI powered IT innovation and machine learning. Writing in his bog, Rao outlined how the Artificial Intelligence Products Group will work across multiple units. Part of the group’s remit will be to bring AI costs down and forge standards. Rao said the group will combine engineering, labs, software, and hardware from its portfolio. Intel is building an AI lab and a centralised organisation, reporting directly to CEO Brian Krzanich, to make it all work. This is classic organisational strategy, accelerating delivery by creating  a cross-product group directly reporting to the CEO.

Trump responded to the healthcare chaos with an ultimatum. He sent Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to announce that either Republicans hold a vote on the bill Friday, or he would move on and they would be stuck with ObamaCare. The "Art of the Deal” business mogul prides himself in being a skilled negotiator and has been working behind the scenes to whip up votes for the health legislation. But after throwing his support behind the bill, Trump found himself pinned between Republicans who find the bill does not do enough to repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Democrats and some moderate Republicans who are worried about the expected rise in the number of uninsured people and the rollback of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion.  Trump suggested earlier in the week that Republicans who vote against the bill could suffer in the next elections. Two of Trump’s closest White House advisers, his chief strategist Steve Bannon and top economic adviser Gary Cohn also reversed their position on the healthcare bill, first favoring it, and then deciding they did not like the compromise version coming out of meetings this week, the Times reports.  The Times reports Trump did not realize when he agreed to the agenda late last year just how intense of a fight healthcare would be until this week, following harsh criticism and Congressional Budget Office estimates that showed millions more would be uninsured. This realization has led him to pine about the tax cut plan he should've pursued instead.

Critical Link announced a Linux-driven “MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit” for automation, robotics, motion control, and vision applications based on its Intel Cyclone V based MitySOM-5CSx COM and baseboard. The latter has been upgraded with an add-on board designed to connect with Basler’s BCON dart embedded area scan cameras. The MitySOM-5CSx baseboard plugs directly to a DisplayPort monitor with no need for a PC intermediary. MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit (left) and MitySOM-5CSx (click images to enlarge) The SODIMM-style MitySOM-5CSx module was originally announced as the MityARM-5CSX back in 2013. The 82 x 38mm COM is based on Altera’s Cyclone V SX-U672 ARM/FPGA SoC, now owned by Intel. The Cyclone V SX provides a “Hard Processor System” (HPS) with dual 800MHz Cortex-A9 cores, as well as an FPGA on par with Altera’s Stratix V. MitySOM-5CSx block diagram (click image to enlarge) Both subsystems share 1GB of DDR3 RAM, and the FPGA can draw upon an optional 256MB of DDR3. The module provides two GbE controllers, 4x PCIe lanes, and up to 145 GPIO lines. General purpose MitySOM-5CSx Development Kit detail view (does not show camera add-on board) (click image to enlarge) The COM’s 314-pin MXM 3.0 edgecard connector connects with the 177.8 x 101.6mm baseboard that forms the basis of the MitySOM-5CSx Development Kit. The baseboard provides a GbE port, a micro-USB 2.0 OTG port, and a USB Blaster-II. There’s also a SATA connector, a console port, and dual isolated CAN ports, among other I/O shown in the diagram above. An SD slot is located on the back of the board. The MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit uses the same board, but adds an adapter board for the Basler BCON dart cameras. BCON is the name of Basler’s custom LVDS-based interface, which is offered as a leaner, more affordable alternative to the cameras’ USB 3.0-based USB3 Vision Standard compliant interface. MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit block diagram (click image to enlarge) The imaging kit’s baseboard hooks up to the BCON interface via its FPGA linked HSMC transceivers. There also appears to be a new DisplayPort adapter linked to the FPGA. The Basler BCON dart cameras start at 99 Euros ($107, and come in S-mount, CS-mount, and bare-board variants. The latter measures only 27 x 27mm and weighs 5 grams, while the S- and CS-mount versions are 29 x 29mm and 15 grams. The cameras available on Critical Link’s imaging kit use e2v and ON Semiconductor CMOS sensors with resolutions of 1.2- to 5-megapixels and up to 60fps video. To develop on the MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit, you can draw on the module’s Linux BSP, as well as Intel/Altera’s VIP Suite and OpenCL tools. Basler’s “user-friendly pylon” Camera Software Suite is included for free. Later this year, Critical Link plans to launch a 2nd gen imaging kit with “out-of-the-box synching of up to 4 darts,” said a company spokesperson.   Further information The MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit for Basler’s BCON dart cameras will ship early in the second quarter. Critical Link will demonstrate the product at Automate, April 3-6 in Chicago at booth #2666. The demo shows an edge detection application featuring real-time image processing and leveraging of IP Cores from Altera’s VIP Suite.

In 2016, India and China are still positioned as the leaders of software outsourcing industry. In spite of their dominance in market share, Vietnam is considered as an emerging software outsourcing destination. [ClickPress, Fri Mar 24 2017] The Growth of Vietnam Software Outsourcing in Recent Years Offshore software development nowadays is becoming a smart approach of global companies. In 2016, India and China are still positioned as the leaders of software outsourcing industry. In spite of their dominance in market share, Vietnam is considered as an emerging software outsourcing destination. The Vietnam software development market is recognized as a high quality and low price software development market. Vietnam software outsourcing services are about 90% cheaper compared to Western rivals and 40% cheaper compared to competitors from India and China. According to a report from Vietnam Software Association (VINASA), in the IT home market, there was a decrease in the number and scale of clients (in two segments: state-owned agents and private businesses) because of budget cuts for IT services. Meanwhile, the export markets growth rate increased by 30 to 40 percent per annum, and the US and Europes growth rates were stable at 20 to 30 percent. Some domestic software developers are optimistically expecting that North America will become the second largest Vietnamese outsourcing market, after Japan. Vietnam was ranked among the top 10 most attractive software outsourcing spots of the Asia- Pacific region by Gartner, a reputed US market researcher. The Advantages of Vietnam Software Outsourcing Many multinational electronics corporations such as Intel, Samsung, LG, Renesas, Fox, Canon, and, Panasonic have already been optimistically growing their manufacturing operations in Vietnam for decades. Foreseeing the markets potential, HP, CSC, Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Avaya, NTT, Toshiba, NEC, Panasonic, Sony, Sharp, Hitachi, Boeing, and Deutsche Bank also have Research & Development to further investigate the Vietnam market. Vietnam is seen as a large pool of talent and an emerging high tech center. Every year there are about 40,000 graduates, from 290 universities across the nation, who are well trained and equipped with the technical skills needed for the industry. The flourishing of skilled manpower and low labor costs contribute to a competitive advantage with regard to service quality and price. In addition to the stable and secure economy, the Vietnamese government has also established tax incentives, encouraged heavy high-tech zones, built software parks, and implemented human resource development strategies. Some Challenges of Vietnam Software Outsourcing In spite of Vietnams favorable conditions for IT product development and outsourcing services, some domestic IT firms are facing financing shortages and poor market strategies. To some extent, IT engineers have not satisfied the international market demands. The Ministry of Information and Communications is looking for solutions for the developing IT sector by promoting competition; building mechanisms to support IT and IT startup companies; offering more FDI for IT in general, and particularly for software outsourcing; and workshops for business matching between Vietnamese and IT foreign companies. Top 10 Vietnam Software Outsourcing Companies According to statistics from Vietnam Software Association (VINASA), Vietnamese companies specialized in outsourcing and software solutions have revenue accounting for a high proportion of total sales, more than 1/4 of software industry and digital content in 2015. The top 10 companies in Vietnam software outsourcing are: 1. FTP software 2. TMA Solutions 3. Harvey Nash Vietnam 4. Global Cybersoft Vietnam 5. KMS Technologies Vietnam 6. LogiGear Vietnam 7. Phu Si Computer Network (FUJINET) 8. Sunrise Software Solutions 9. IVC / ISB Vietnam 10.

Courtesy of Jayanthi Raman Putting together a multi-layered dance performance with international artists is never easy. There’s the travel, logistics and airfare — to say nothing of navigating the paperwork to obtain work visas. Hillsboro-based choreographer Jayanthi Raman, of the dance studio Rasika, has aced it many times over the years. But this year was different. Raman came to Portland from India nearly 30 years ago when her husband took a job at Intel. She’d spent her days in India as a doctor, but had danced her entire life. Over the years, she built up an entire second resume for her movement work. “All the validity that was there, the press and everything,” Raman said. But in the States, “you have to rebuild yourself. It took over 10 years to reestablish as a choreographer, to tell people to come and see my work, and actually know that I’m good.” She ultimately retired from medicine and started a dance school. Raman has created, choreographed and starred in some 25 performances here. Many feature local dancers as well as artists from India. A scene from "Duality: A Ballet of India." Courtesy of Jayanthi Raman Two years ago, Raman won a Creative Heights grant from the Oregon Community Foundation for a show called, “Duality: A dance ballet of India.” The show blends theater and dance to tell the story of an Indian woman who gets married to a man from Portland and emigrates to the U.S. It is about the challenges she faces as a dancer, as an engineer, as a woman, and as an immigrant. With an international cast of professional dancers from Delhi, Chennai and the U.S., the performance features Indian dance forms Bharatanatyam and the martial arts-based Chhau, as well as local dancers in an elegant contemporary dance production. Raman weaves a story that, in a way, tells her own tale of migration and integration in America. “Thirty years ago, there were not so many Indians [in Portland]. There was nothing to hold you and make you feel like this was home,” she said. “It took a long time. That is the story.” The Indian dancers were supposed to arrive in the beginning of March. But then, President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily stopping immigration and travel from seven Middle Eastern countries. Visas for the international “Duality” dancers were delayed and couldn’t make it in time for the March 19 performance. India is not one of the counties on the list, but Raman speculates the bureaucratic backlog is to blame. “I’ve been doing this for over 25 years. I’ve been working and hiring professional dancers from India to work on my projects,” Raman said. “This is the first time ever that I’ve had a delay or a change due to visa issues.” When Raman wrote the grant, she had no idea the show would end up being remotely controversial.  “I never created this to be a political art. If I had wanted it to be a political theme, and if I had started it that way, it would be an extremely controversial thing. I could have put so much suffering into it. I did not. I wanted to send a message of hope, and celebration, and a positive message, and to me, art has to be that. If we lose that hope, we’ve lost ourselves and this is the greatest place in the world to be, this country.” The dancers all arrived this week, and rehearsals are underway. Working with the Newmark Theater and other sponsors, Raman was able to reschedule the performance for April 1.  arts dance oregon portland india More Radio Crossed Swords Lead To 'Classical Crossroads' Concert See Art, Win Money, Make A Difference With 2 New Portland Programs How Can Workplaces Better Serve Employees With Autism?

Requested lifting the policy that limits the number of air strike casualties, after U.S. drones killed over 85 in Syria and as many as 200 in Mosul. The Telegraph reported that on Tuesday, a "suspected US air strike on a school being used as a shelter by families displaced from the Isil-held Syrian city of Raqqa killed at least 33 people on Tuesday, in the latest high civilian casualty raid by the coalition." "On Thursday [March 16], a U.S. Reaper drone struck a gathering in a rebel-held village in Aleppo province, killing as many as 49 people. Monitoring groups say most of the dead were civilians who had gathered at a mosque to pray, while the Pentagon claims the gathering was a meeting of al-Qaeda members," Democracy Now reported on Monday. It's also been reported that "the number of civilian casualties in U.S. airstrikes has been escalating since Donald Trump took office two months ago." And in Mosul: "The American-led military coalition in Iraq said Friday that it was investigating reports that scores of civilians — perhaps as many as 200, according to local residents — had been killed in recent American airstrikes in Mosul, the northern Iraqi city where Iraq’s security forces have been waging a monthslong offensive," reported The New York Times. 3.

And for the first time in three years, toy-maker Lego is no longer the company with the best reputation among U.K. consumers. One company that made big strides was Volkswagen, which saw its reputation score rise from 55.3 in 2016 to 68.3 in 2017. That wasn’t enough, however, to move the automaker back into the 150 companies on the list developed by the Reputation Institute. In the institute’s earlier listing of the companies with the best reputations globally, Volkswagen eked in at number 100 with a score of 64.73. According to the Reputation Institute, there are seven key rational dimensions of reputation: products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship, leadership and performance. The Reputation Institute collected about 40,000 ratings from U.K. respondents who are either “somewhat” or “very” familiar with the companies they rated and who have completed at least 75% of the rating survey. The 10 companies and their reputation scores are: Dyson: 86.8 Aston Martin: 85.4 Lego: 85.0 Michelin: 84.0 Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE): 83.7 Waitrose: 83.5 Intel Corp. (NYSE: INTC): 83.5 PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) Samsung: 83.0 Rolls-Royce Aerospace: 82.3 In the global survey, Rolex finished at the top, followed by Lego and Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS). Sony, Intel and Rolls-Royce also finished in the top 10 globally. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google finished in 11th place and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) ranked 74th, a rather long way behind smartphone competitor Samsung, irrespective of Samsung’s fiasco with its Galaxy Note 7 device.

We’ve collected a group of the industry’s leading analysts to give their outlook on the hot topics in the wireless industry. Why spectrum sharing? Commercial access and use of spectrum has traditionally been authorized in two ways: either through individual licenses or in accordance with license exempt (unlicensed or “commons”) rules. It is believed much of that spectrum is lightly used or even not used. At a time when most observers believe people, organizations and businesses will need vastly more internet and communications capacity, that is a waste of scarce resources. To move incumbent users to a new frequency band is also a very costly and time consuming proposition. Thus, spectrum sharing offers a cheaper and quicker way to maximize use of scarce resources. Shared spectrum is likely to be used in several ways in the U.S. market first to support 4G, and then likely in more-intensive forms as “5G” technology is introduced. There is a misunderstanding of spectrum sharing according to Federated Wireless. Spectrum sharing will be applied to bands that are not licensed by a carrier today. The bands being explored are underutilized bands – like those controlled by the military. The navy uses only about 1% of the spectrum available in the 3.5 GHz band at any given time. There is 150 megahertz of spectrum available in this band – more than any single U.S. operator controls at this point. As global demand for spectrum intensifies, regulatory strategies such as these are attracting considerable interest. Defining spectrum sharing: “Spectrum sharing is the simultaneous usage of a specific radio frequency band in a specific geographical area by a number of independent entities, leveraged through mechanisms other than traditional multiple- and random-access techniques.” Which bands are primary candidates? Among the U.S. bands where spectrum sharing will be key is about 500 megahertz of capacity in the Wi-Fi 5 GHz band, as well as about 150 megahertz in the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service band. It is hard to see deployment happening commercially until 2018, with the likely first deployments in the United States at 3.5 GHz. When the U.S. demonstrates that spectrum sharing works, many other countries are looking at how to implement the same technology and tiers. Japan already uses the 3.5 GHz band, so we expect quick activity there. In Europe, the 2.3 GHz band will be where shared spectrum first is tried. For the 2.3 GHz band, the situation in Europe is complex. Even though this band has been globally identified for mobile broadband at the international level and standardized at the Third Generation Partnership Project, nonmobile incumbents remain the main users of this spectrum. Spectrum sharing is also expected around the 60 GHz band, where seven gigahertz is available for sharing in the frequency ranges between 57 GHz and 64 GHz, and where an additional seven gigahertz of capacity is being considered for shared use. It is also being evaluated in the licensed 71 GHz to 76 GHz band and 81 GHz to 86 GHz bands, which have in the past been used for point-to-point radio links. Who is responsible for developing spectrum sharing? The organizations developing spectrum sharing are led by government entities (National Telecommunications and Information Administration and Federal Communications Commission in U.S.; Ofcom in U.K.) and private entities (Google, Intel and Qualcomm for example), instead of “standards bodies.” The CBRS Alliance is the organization that takes the standards set by the Wireless Innovation Forum and commercializes them, developing the ecosystem and a certification program. All four nationwide U.S. carriers now belong to the CBRS Alliance. How does spectrum sharing work? The CBRS example Licensing traditionally has used spatial division (different frequencies or geographies) to prevent interference. Spectrum sharing enables new deployments to use spectrum while protecting usage by existing incumbents, such as the military or satellite communication. According to the CBRS alliance “it enables two kinds of new deployments: those that pay for a slice of the spectrum at a certain location (referred to as priority access license or PAL) and those that opportunistically use available spectrum (referred to as general authorized access or GAA). The addition of this ‘third-tier’ of general authorized deployments, where you are not required to pay for a license, means that users can employ this spectrum when it is not being used by the higher tiers.” According to Federated Wireless, operators will be able to apply for 10-megahertz PAL licenses in this band, which are location-specific. They will get second priority. That leaves 80 megahertz of spectrum available for general use, and more if no incumbent or PAL user is using the spectrum. Think of GAA spectrum like unlicensed spectrum: carriers can use it like Wi-Fi, but so can enterprises, property owners, venue owners, etc. CBRS radios are being added to most small cells today, and will be able to deliver LTE services over this unlicensed band, with no contention with Wi-Fi or licensed carrier spectrum. Access and operations will be managed by a dynamic spectrum access system, conceptually similar to the databases used to manage television white spaces devices. The three tiers are: incumbent access, priority access and general authorized access. CBRS is a bold experiment in regulation with implications beyond 3.5 GHz and beyond the U.S. A CBRS spectrum access system controls channels/frequency resources in same geographic area and time. FCC certification requires the SAS-to-SAS interoperability demonstrated by suppliers. SAS’ can exchange the information required to protect interference free operation by commercial and federal incumbents in the CBRS 3.5 GHz shared spectrum band. Incumbent access users include authorized federal and grandfathered fixed satellite service users currently operating in the 3.5 GHz band. At the end of 2016, the FCC approved seven spectrum access system administrators in the 3550-3700 MHz band: Amdocs, Comsearch, CTIA, Federated Wireless; Google, Key Bridge and Sony Electronics. Spectrum convergence The other important development in spectrum sharing is the convergence of licensed with unlicensed bands through the bonding of mobile and Wi-Fi spectrum. Significant spectrum sharing of this type is expected to be a key feature as most devices combine both Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity. The advent of 5G mobile networks, for example, will feature the use of “bonded spectrum” approaches such as license assisted access to aggregate across spectrum types; LTE Wi-Fi aggregation to aggregate across technologies; CBRS/license shared access to share spectrum with incumbents; and other deployments. In addition, there will be new platforms such as “MulteFire” designed to provide quality-assured services exclusively in the 5 GHz band. What are the biggest challenges to spectrum sharing? Challenges are partly regulatory and partly technological. In the U.S., The FCC and Department of Defense needed to know that technology could be put in place to securely share spectrum while still giving access to the incumbent users (navy and satellite) when needed, added Federated Wireless. Success here is likely to open up other bands in the U.S. and across the globe, but some resistance can also be expected from regulators who will see spectrum sharing as lost tax revenue. All of these developments represent a revolutionary approach to spectrum usage, moving away from command-and-control to more-dynamic allocation processes. Spectrum sharing represents a revolution in spectrum policy, a challenge to business models based on spectrum scarcity and an opportunity for business models based on sustainability for the benefit of billions of consumers. The WBA is developing in a white paper an early-stage analysis of coordinated shared spectrum programs. It provides some historical background on both LSA and CBRS; contemplates the service offerings and business models that such approaches will enable; and contrasts anticipated CSS solutions with existing solutions based on traditional methods of spectrum management. Finally, the paper will suggest areas where the WBA might decide to participate as CSS solutions move from the conceptual stage into commercial reality, with a focus on identifying industry, standard development organization and industry trade organization “gaps” that will need to be addressed.

(AMD) Stock If You Hate Money AMD stock is up 600% from early 2016 lows. Some experts wrongly think that will prevent it from going even higher.

(AMD) Stock If You Hate Money Recent Posts: Count Out Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock If You Hate Money 3 Reasons Sprint Corp (S) Stock Has Even MORE Upside Why Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) Stock Has Staying Power View All Posts I’ll be honest: I never understood the optimism toward Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock. While AMD stock languished in the $2 range for much of the past few years, I thought the bullishness toward the stock was simply too optimistic. Source: AMD Advanced Micro Devices was a distant second to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in CPUs. It lagged behind Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in gaming. Its balance sheet wasn’t exactly spectacular, and AMD consistently lost money and burned cash. Obviously, I missed the huge run in AMD stock, which has gained almost 700% from early 2016 lows. At the risk of joining the party too late, I think there could be more upside, even after a modest breather in those gains over the past few weeks. Advanced Micro Devices has some risk at current levels, to be sure. But there remain a number of catalysts that can continue the run. The Ryzen CPU Can Push AMD Stock Higher AMD’s Ryzen chips already have driven some of the optimism toward shares of late — but they might have more to contribute. Jefferies recently upgraded AMD stock based in large part on the competitive boost from the new chips. In fact, the firm said revenue could potentially double in a best-case scenario. The rollout of Ryzen 7 has hit an early speed bump, with the CPU leading computers to lock up. But Advanced Micro Devices appears to have a fix and issues aside, reviews seem positive. Ryzen 5 will be launched soon, to likely be followed by lower-cost desktop CPUs and laptop and server chips later this year. And Ryzen’s impact goes beyond its sales and profit contributions. It positions AMD as once again a worthy competitor to Intel, not just a second source of supply for lower-cost, lower-performance processors that drive lower-end desktops and notebooks. And its early reviews bode well for Vega, which AMD hopes will allow to target Nvidia in gaming the way Ryzen has improved its competitive position in CPUs. The Numbers Still Work It is worth pointing out that AMD still isn’t profitable, and still isn’t really growing – yet. Advanced Micro Devices lost almost $500 million in 2016. Revenue did increase 9% year-over-year … but sales remain 20%-plus below 2014 levels. But higher-priced Ryzen chips can reverse substantial pressure on gross margin: AMD’s gross profit dollars declined a stunning 46% between 2014 and 2016, with both lower sales and lower margins. Cost-cutting has brought down marketing and G&A spend, and Advanced Micro Devices still has room for improvement on that front. Meanwhile, the balance sheet has improved, with both debt and interest expense declining of late and likely again in 2017. There’s a substantial amount of earnings leverage to be unlocked over the next few years. Higher pricing will improve gross margins; those incremental dollars will fall to operating income at a high rate due to a fixed-cost model. Cost-cutting should keep opex increases in check. Add in lower interest expense, and AMD’s recent losses can reverse quickly. Analysts expect an 8-cent profit in 2017 and 30 cents in 2018. A reinvigorated Advanced Micro Devices could beat those estimates … which would drive AMD stock higher still.

Intel buyout announcement By Times of Israel staff March 24, 2017, 8:07 pm Tweet Email Print Share A man walks under the Mobileye logo in Jerusalem, March 13, 2017.

According to a Reuters report citing the complaint by the SEC, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman bought Mobileye shares shortly before the company’s purchase by the Silicon Valley-based giant was announced on March 13. Darvasi made $427,000 and Waldman made $4.5 million from the trades, the SEC said. According to a complaint filed on Thursday in US District Court in Manhattan by the SEC, both Darvasi and Waldman made their moves suspiciously close to the date when the Mobileye deal was announced. The Mobileye stock jumped by slightly more than 28 percent in a single day after the buyout was unveiled. Both Darvasi and Waldman were linked to people inside the company, through their connections from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where the technology was first developed, according to the SEC. Darvasi, of Mevasseret Zion, Israel, is a genetics professor at the university, while Waldman, of Yarqona, Israel, is a self-employed engineer, Reuters quoted the SEC as saying. At least 11 directors and officers at Mobileye, developer of camera-based road safety technology, hail from the Hebrew University. Neither of the two Israelis was available for comment and it was not clear whether they hired lawyers. Neither Intel nor Mobileye commented on the charges. The companies are not accused of any wrongdoing. US District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan froze the defendants’ assets temporarily in two accounts at Interactive Brokers LLC, finding “a basis to infer” they violated US insider trading laws, court records obtained by Reuters showed. Waldman, the SEC said, conducted most of his Mobileye trading starting on the day when Mobileye and Intel signed a non-disclosure agreement. He generated a 1,883% return on his stocks. Darvasi began buying Mobileye stock less than two weeks before the merger was announced, after selling 40,000 Teva shares, the only securities in his account, the SEC said.

The dump, dubbed "Vault 7," contains documents on a number of CIA projects which sought to infect Apple firmware, developed by the CIA's Embedded Development Branch. A fortnight prior to this dump, WikiLeaks published thousands of CIA documents, which detailed attempts to spy on foreign leaders among other shocking revelations. The DarkMatter" set is far more focused, consisting of but 12 documents. RELEASE: CIA #Vault7 "Dark Matter" https://t.co/drdaVhtb53 pic.twitter.com/wZUspTsJ4c — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 23, 2017​ These documents expose the "Sonic Screwdriver" project, a "mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices" while a computer is booting, which would allow CIA attackers to launch hacking software via USB drives and the like even when a firmware password was enabled. "Sonic Screwdriver" was an infector stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter. RELEASE: CIA #Vault7 "Dark Matter" https://t.co/pgnfeODXVB pic.twitter.com/vkI16f3vMD — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 23, 2017​ Likewise, "DarkSeaSkies" was an implant consisting of "DarkMatter" "SeaPea" and "NightSkies" —respectively EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants. Also included in this release is the manual for the CIA's "NightSkies 1.2" — a "beacon/loader/implant tool" for iPhone, which allows attackers to retrieve files such as contact lists and call logs, and execute commands. NightSkies had already reached version 1.2 by 2008, and was expressly designed to be physically installed onto box-fresh iPhones. In essence, US intelligence services have been implanting hacking software on yet to be bought iPhones for almost a decade at the time of the documents' release.  © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes Assange Comments on Latest Wikileaks 'Vault-7' Release, 'the Largest Intel Publication in History' Moreover, the documents describe techniques for rewriting devices' firmware in ways that would afford a hacker access even if a user restored a phone or computer to factory settings. A "hard reset" would remove all apps and a device's operating system, installing a clean version — an extreme measure typically employed by users to deal with technical problems, but also a precaution the security-conscious may take when buying a new phone. The CIA has consistently refused to comment on the authenticity of documents released by Wikileaks, with the Agency merely stating it complies with legal prohibitions on electronic surveillance that targets individuals on US soil, and US citizens abroad — this set of exposures is no exception. Matthew Hickey, security expert and founder of Hacker House, said questions remained over how the CIA installed these programs on electronic devices, but potential methods — such as infecting a targeted organization's supply chain, by interdicting mail orders and other shipments leaving the United States or other countries — were "extremely troubling." "The NSA has previously intercepted devices in the mail and manually installing malicious software before they are delivered to companies. This should be a major cause for concern for companies purchasing equipment in bulk from suppliers like Apple," Hickey told Sputnik. This said, Hickey said the documents suggested the CIA targeted devices on an individual level, rather than entire shipment — unlike the methods detailed in Edward Snowden's NSA leaks — the CIA, he noted, are more interested in "personal spying," while the NSA was focused on "corporate attacks." "There's been little research into how "firmware" can be removed, although one tip suggested by these documents is users could move their device's clock forward 180 days, causing the firmware to deinstall itself. Security solutions and scanning tools for detecting the presence of such software are very much in their infancy — at the moment, determining whether your computer or phone is compromized could necessitate physically opening it," Hickey continued.  WikiLeaks' #Vault7 shows that the CIA has developed a huge range of attacks against iPhones since at least 2008.https://t.co/neRkgWFzcA pic.twitter.com/QFnh0WJ3kA — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 23, 2017​ "Everyone needs to be concerned about this. We need to take a lot more responsibility for our own personal security and understanding, our use of technology and how it can be taken advantage of by the intelligence services. This isn't business meetings being bugged, this is about individual's personal devices being targeted. We need to be vigilant and aware, and engage with cyber security services as part of our daily lives." ...

There was never a time in IT history---or social history, for that matter---that it was ever clever to put ALL your personal finances, ALL your social contacts and ALL the details of your life on public display. There are now specialist consultants who do nothing but "de-IT" business management facilities through moving several basic digital functions to analof and real-world for the sole sake of boosting worker efficiency whilst turning down the workplace friction. What the article is really about is the CIA putting everyone on notice that---surprise!!---they are losing control so they have decided to tighten the screws a bit...to the sound of everyone's resounding laughter.

We are almost at the close of March of the Machines on Siliconrepublic.com. This past week, we have been feverishly following the near-future of technology and, particularly, how it will impact our lives. From artificial intelligence (AI) to the internet of things (IoT) and the future of work and industry, this conversation will inevitably continue on Siliconrepublic.com and across the sci-tech world. We hope you continue to follow along with us, but we also recommend you keep tabs on the diverse perspectives from these influencers at the frontier of this discussion. Elon Musk Silicon Valley superstar Elon Musk is undoubtedly one of the most influential voices in the commercial sci-tech world right now. When the Tesla and SpaceX founder spoke out about his reservations around the development of AI, technologists the world over took note. These days, Musk has the ear of the current US presidential administration as a member of its business advisory council. Sherry Turkle MIT’s Prof Sherry Turkle has been driving discussion around what new technologies mean for human relationships since the 1980s and continues to be a leading voice on these matters. The founder and director of MIT’s Initiative on Technology and Self, Turkle has dedicated her research to human behaviour in the digital world, probing the impact of technology such as AI and robotics on users’ emotional lives. Mady Delvaux-Stehres For those of us in the European Union, European Parliament member Mady Delvaux-Stehres is putting robotics on the agenda as part of the EU Working Group on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Earlier this year, the Luxembourgish politician proposed a groundbreaking piece of legislation that would consider autonomous robots as “electronic persons” entitled to certain rights and accountable for their actions. Tell us what you think about #Robotics and #AI! Public consultation open until April &available in all EU languages:https://t.co/GTjstyPQgZ — Mady Delvaux (@mady_delvaux) March 24, 2017 Mike Schroepfer The name might not be as well known as Mark Zuckerberg but, as CTO of Facebook, Mike Schroepfer is the technical architect of the online lives of more than 1.2bn daily active users worldwide. It’s a mammoth task and even Schroepfer isn’t entirely certain where Facebook’s 10-year roadmap to tackle new technologies such as AI and virtual reality (VR) will take them. Genevieve Bell This week has been about the intersection of humans and technology as our lives become increasingly digitised. Technologist and anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell has been sitting on this intersection for years, formerly as head of sensing and insights at Intel, and now returning to her native Australia as a professor in Australian National University’s College of Engineering and Computer Science. Bell will remain a senior fellow at Intel and a key figure in this ongoing discussion. Linda Doyle This highly connected future we speak of will require a communications infrastructure more powerful and robust than ever before. That’s the subject of research ongoing at the Connect centre, a Science Foundation Ireland-funded research centre based at Trinity College Dublin. Prof Linda Doyle leads Connect as director and has continually advocated for a combination of arts and STEM thinking to ensure a well-designed future for all. Marcus Weldon While Doyle guided the ‘STEAM’ train on the Inspirefest stage in 2015 and 2016, Marcus Weldon continues the conversation this summer in Dublin. As president of Bell Labs and CTO of Nokia, Weldon leads the technical strategy of an institution integral to the evolution of IT and communications. He is looking ahead to a networked future for the IoT. To discover the future of human comms, add the A to STEM (= STEAM). @BellLabs collaborating with pioneering artists @beatiewolfe & @Reeps1 pic.twitter.com/nicgXTbFHu — Marcus Weldon (@MarcusWeldon) March 9, 2017 Joy Buolamwini What use is a high-tech future if it’s not for all of humanity? Some of the most important questions to answer with AI and emerging technology are around inclusion and diversity – some of which were posed by MIT grad student Joy Buolamwini. While working on a facial recognition project, she found that the tech being developed couldn’t recognise her features because darker skin tones were not taken into consideration when programming. Buolamwini took these concerns to the TEDx stage and continues to question the validity of AI and new technology developed by homogeneous teams. Conor Walsh A fascinating new area in technology is soft robotics, introduced to the Inspirefest audience by Dr Dónal Holland last summer. Holland is a graduate of the Harvard Biodesign Lab founded by Prof Conor Walsh, who was named as one of Popular Science’s ‘Brilliant 10 of 2016’. Walsh has been recognised at home and abroad for his work leading the development of soft robotics and wearable robotic exoskeletons for enhanced performance and people with disabilities. Prof Conor Walsh (left) and a colleague assemble an exosuit on a mannequin. Image: Rolex/Fred Merz Robin Chase One tech advance that seems increasingly imminent is the arrival of autonomous vehicles, but there are still many considerations to be addressed before the roads are taken over by robotic drivers. Robin Chase, a sharing economy pioneer and transport entrepreneur, had been ruminating on this before it became the hot topic of the moment and recently joined Osmosys, a multi-sector alliance lobbying for this transition to be sustainable and human-centred. Andrew Ng Until very recently, Andrew Ng was leading AI research at Baidu, known in shorthand as ‘China’s Google’. Ng has been the author, or co-author, of more than 100 papers on machine learning and robotics and, though his next professional steps are yet to be revealed, we can be certain that his contributions will continue to count towards AI’s future development. I will be resigning from Baidu and opening up a new chapter of my work in AI.

Creative director of VR studio Framestore, Sidhu was recently named by IBM Watson as one of the AI Influencers of 2017. Framestore has contributed visual effects for blockbusters such as Gravity, The Dark Knight and the Harry Potter universe, and Sidhu is pushing for a future of good VR and smart storytelling, so that our future selves can be thoroughly entertained.

(MU) Stock Is More Than Just a Memory Memory maker Micron's run has just begun By Louis Navellier, Editor, Blue Chip Growth  |  Mar 24, 2017, 11:43 am EDT     Popular Posts: 7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your Portfolio 7 Small-Cap Tech Stocks on the Cutting Edge Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock: Your Time Is Running Out Recent Posts: 7 Consumer Stocks That Will Lead Your Portfolio Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Continues to Impress Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Is More Than Just a Memory View All Posts Micron Technology, Inc. (NYSE:MU) is just about the biggest thing to come out of Boise, Idaho, besides the potato. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr Begun in 1978 in the basement of a dentist’s office, four partners began building what would become one of the largest and most well-respected memory chip makers in the world. The success that they have brought into being has been a function of their ability to adapt and pivot. Many hardware makers have come and gone over those four decades, but MU has continued to grow. MU Stock Is an Innovator This is a firm that built its first DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chip in 1981, long before the advent of the internet, online gaming, content streaming, digital cameras and mobile phones. But MU kept innovating, and it has paid off handsomely. Over the past decade, MU has easily doubled the performance of competitors Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC). And in the past year, the outperformance has been even more impressive — MU is up 175%, almost tripling WDC’s return, and beating INTC by an order of magnitude. Some of its recent fortunes have turned on the fact that the DRAM and NAND (named after a type of gate in a circuit) markets are in a boom cycle right now. These memories are key to modern-day electronics, everything from mobile phones to Big Data servers. There’s no doubt that this sector is volatile. And Micron’s ability to thrive in these feast-or-famine, dog-eat-dog business cycles is testament to the company’s ability to find next solutions before customers even have a significant need. Also, the thing to remember about some of these tech cycles is that many are changing duration due to the leapfrogging of technologies. The better they make chips, the more demand for chips there is and the longer the upcycle lasts. For instance, in the case of memory, as speeds increase, there is increasing demand from hardware makers to get as close to 0 latency as possible (i.e., no delay between the action and the command). It also requires display makers to eliminate what’s known in the industry as the ‘screen door effect’ or SDE. This is when viewers can see fine lines separating the pixels. Getting rid of SDE is going to be especially important as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets become more common. VR and AR are far more than new ways for gamers to entertain themselves. They are a way for all of us to interact with our world — both real and imaginary — in a totally immersive experience. And to get there, it’s going to take huge leaps in DRAM technology, especially in mobile devices, which are used in the current generation of VR goggles. Micron is already stepping up to the challenge. Another important fact to bear in mind is, while MU has benefited from DRAM pricing and demand, no one is taking into account the growing demand for NAND devices. Analysts anticipate a bull market for NAND to continue for at least another year. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Add road show. That's my open definitely probably would have brought that's my old. Query where you don't know what you're stupid. Brad broad show. That's delicious. Another addition of Brad show up here with a third base coach or infield instructor. Patriots. Number one fan Brian Butterfield and I was thinking of who would be the next person I'm on the preferential podcasts and I know that water your decision making and your instincts are probably at this point Keener than anybody. So what who who would you like to see. On this part with a I think it would be droop over its without ego oh you're your wishes are net. Making its first appearance on the right foot so that means for teacher congratulations drew Palmer and here at jetBlue park drew gradually since not only be in the podcast but being married this offseason. Think it is a big big off season for me. This is this is an every offseason where you get married. You go to Australia aren't being briefed on truly private islands off ostrich. The a lot of fun in married and in a couple different spots in Austria lost because of so. Take me through the end of the ads starting at the end of the season you have. You you pitch in the playoffs you've thrown only six miles an hour you get married you go to Australia. Com is that it was it in and all the sudden you have a stem cell watch yet the stem cell injection before you got married right. Today. Done matches season and then decides them. Knowing that some relaxing time coming out of his deputies here a couple of months after there is no better. Wedding present that happening themselves successor immediately after. The playoffs where you knew that you were gonna get this stem cell injection. And take me through if you can't get we've talked a lot about the process he took. To heal your elbow. Take me through that decision was made in September and then. These him to do this in October. And then I'm gonna go to Australia. We again talked about it towards the end of the year. So definitely do a few years to oh. The partners in recovery for the next season knowing that I had some you know the doctors had to take some time off and lots and like on. I developed and lights anyways those as the perfect situation for and I know we've talked about this before but we haven't talked about it here. Why stem cell why not PRP played in platelet rich plasma which is usually the way it the last few years anyway. That's the way a lot of guys are gone when the instead of having surgery. To heal your Opel wise and so. It's this Intel's previous month. More experimentally colleges because the yet to use like those who are harder begin. If that take him out of the body in my own body and my case. That your hip yeah from about them. Big hit bone in my become lower back area they journal on there and extracted it and spun it kind of the same as Pierre. And and then just then injected it into the clincher. Again this is not on something you know enough to worry about getting married you have to grow in your you have to take your mind off giving the China patterns in the and they in the guest list and everything. Yeah. I didn't have much to do and in my life my elected miss the planning so just. And zipped off to LA for a couple days had it done and then came right back in the mean you know their radio get married. That's weird that's like when when you my wife asked me when viewing induce the child before your house or after you run the marathon. So today her how long did it hurts or when you're when you're exchanging vows to do you feel your elbow healing or did it was it's still a little bit in pain or how does that. Happened so little. It was two Bennett and it was it was so little sore for awhile after. You know I guess that's part of the healing process. I felt that. You know for about 22. And a half months after that prime pro about two months after that after had a done and then from there to kind of progressively get better. So when was the moment where you said this works this feels like it actually work. When a first it's Roland. You know I was still little soreness from. You know all the dealing going on there probably use this kind of tightness from from resting. What's got their own throwing very passively in the beginning just to see in my arm movement and get things on for a really started you know thrown the ball put some force effort into it. Probably. Had a it. It's sort of film way better we'll probably take two weeks ago to be honest. They say it takes about three months anyway it's three months wouldn't let me like. I guess late. January sometime and then affiliate hit a few different points where it's gotten better and kind of broke through and got better better. And right now it's pretty. So two weeks ago you said it's a return wasn't in the bullpen wasn't just throwing wasn't like oh my goodness. This feels a lot better than that hasn't long long time the out of a fierce and from where everything feels maybe everything's just tell us you know all that stem cells that are. That it just feel a little tighter rules. A little stiff. We've been doing our normal treatment just kind of loose and stretch him. Loan sizes. And I don't know I threw he tacked on Monday Croats play catch and it just felt better so I don't know if against them good blood flow in and broker giving up through. It was effectively use difference to review some stem cells about five different types of spring training. When did you feel the worst last year so obviously when you go down this road. They had to fell in and when you were moved to the bullpen the end of the year there was a reason why you word in jeweler drawn back when did it. When did a start hurting and be really feel like no this isn't good. Who's got an ongoing thing for her. Probably over half the year she says everyone knows something you know and in on my mind there was anything those nonstop mail us here seven best years ever it's you know my career was clear on things now. You know it's just one of those things you got to figure out how to make work go off there and you know feel good enough team did its job done every once or five days that's a lot of pressure though I mean just because you make the all star team you get traded. You come to a new team and anybody can Boston in the middle pennant races. This is a lot of pressure than there was then having to deal with that must've been pulled onto yeah I mean. Like instead everyone's deal with something and in. You know. And most the time where they'll where the ones that know what's going on you know wherever it's no no announcement and knows what we're doing when. Like I said I just you know our. Come on mine right to pitch every five days and you know it was recovered enough to to feel good enough to pitch every five days and go out there. And that still feel good. It can be tough it's it's you know. It's in the dailies in itself it's tough enough where especially when you things going on but he just can't stay focused and not let any you know anything. You think you know yourself so you have to stay within yourself. Dude you know you're capable of doing and step and not worry about the rest of any point in the resides in the uterus is uniform and when you came over did you feel. As good as you did. When you were cruising to the Ulster mean. You know I know listen I know you were her I you know making excuses this is degree in farther in this question goes to the reality of looking back at last. The I don't know some players said it was an ongoing issue for. A lot of most of the year so. I don't members you know. My thoughts up to display a fill up an announcement did then but also threw a lot of things and you know whatever about a foot feels strong right now. And right now it's just me feed my you know find in my delivery none of them driving the ball and you know after that. Breakthrough couple weeks ago. And this. You know trying to trying to you know get my rhythm down through them. Key for me that's the thing you do you go through all of that into as you said two weeks ago. On the triceps thing aside as we see here right now you must have some sense of gratification. Thing what I did and worked back in terms of how it feels. And does it feel like you did like to say at this time last year because I would imagine you felt OK last year this time. I feel great and I'm lost here you know as the situation. Had thrown a lot for him came in spring training because it's. I was going until went starters job but this year I had to take it easier and you know. Counted. You know let that come to nothing you know since I've come always every bearer of the events already come and then I've never had to do this before some kind of some of the things that I had to figure out before I get spring training room figure experience. If anything so that's the that's another. You know obstacle itself. In from here and like I say title goes along with last year and I. Thought there and pitch now and I'm not too much focus on results I am mean. You know no one's okay with going out there it's about spring training volunteers you know. What they tell you but. You wanna do we should also understand where you're at in the process and if you know if it was just yeah if I gave up five runs. It felt good and it was a step up for a figure something out that's a win for spring training is and I think if you're out there. It's giving unit itself to run you know what it's going on that's not. But that's not a woman in profits that that's not a good thing did you did you sense or ruin freaked out the other day. Probably you know I'd. And you know I it's and I tried to make a point to say you know I I don't think he was inning serious you know it's. This does that still part of me trying to find my mechanics down and find some inputs and a lot of effort into throwing. Really driving the ball of the played. It's just you know I was searching for that feeling in morrow mr. Graham I'm a little bit and that's. You know you're gonna feel stuff when your buddies in the wrong position especially when you get out of slot sort of put pressure on. Others your body. Wasn't that wasn't a big deal something and I went watch video of that night and next day and fear level is on. Takes effect today and yet been perfected the next day of figured out what I need to do announced it's not repeat that. Was a human nature because you know you don't know like if ones connected to the other and everything else 41 sack him feeling days. I don't want any sort of hiccups. Use something I knew wasn't related to the other so it's kind of Ali's. It was more frustrating for me because. You know everything that I did last year felt great you know everything I did you know took care of assaults is it felt great. And it was just another you know finally we think those two minutes this this is like insists that annoying little thing. You know what if the next morning and I didn't feel anything resting so wasn't like I was throbbing son knows this little thing that. So that I felt much support mama behind my body. And so I was really worried about it's. You know this is probably good thing crummy me in there and what the heck was going on and I kind of honed in on one. That some of the things and delivered in the it to him to polish. The one thing I think last year where you take away from last year there's confidence there's unity we've talked before about. Getting a chance probably getting your chance to start. Coming getting them making the most of that opportunity. Making the all star team and if I would imagine for you it's just about oh. I did this I proved they can do this in the major leagues it doesn't matter what part what division one league. If I'm healthy I can do this is that is that something that you having your back pocket that maybe you hadn't had your back pocket for his entire career. It's instant play nice. They years to think about but at the same time not she was last year and this year I need to focus on doing my job. Every time out like I did luster. Could duo. Draw on the past too much you know really. That does nothing Bashir. You know why go there and get shelled for five things and thank you would think that less here the other guy who gives a (%expletive) you know service. It's just the way goes. I you if you think about it you you try and take your pick was. What was what made me do well let's hearing panel ruled that over trying to roll that over into this year antenna can pick up where you left off and continued that on throughout the season. But did it's it's useful which can't you can't rely on the. It's you noted this is a thing is that when we look at this rotation. For Salem. David Price and the Cy Young award winner. Stephen Wright you all started at water re use you know great stuff for most it's a no hitter in all star in all star troops farmer. Then and this is I would imagine that one of the next up for you is being. Not helping people remind people all star drew pom rants is just being lumped in with the other guy com. You know it's it's. Great to be around those yeah it's. You know I mean this account learn from. You know the way they go about things everyday on their bus some. On and off the field there and here. Take care what they need to take care very thing you learn from being being this spring training him. Maybe there's learned so from the U I don't know by presenting you the picked up because these are pretty. Accomplished. Today kiss. It's more their preparation known you know Billy guys' preparations they have they have the preparations. To go into each start they know they wanna do it and make an excuse that's what makes them leave you know I. Sometimes do you know smeared anyone can agree on profanity dismiss this they give this guy out he knew how to get her gal but if you can't excuses that you're not going to be. Successful those guys are really good at that the sitting down on paper this this I know how to get this guy out this guy out this guy out they go out there and do it and you know we're gonna great position every time out. Yeah let's say it's not a lot of guys can do that some guys even going like going off scouting report trade via you know. And it knowing what's your round a little while yeah it's you remember how. And you start to learn how to get guys out there and you know when you're on even longer hitter knows we're trying to do it and it's about executioner. You know you can. Maybe maybe not execution and notes you're trying to do any message you get amount that's just based on notes that's. If that a definite thing you know they're the best game plan world. And executed. And still you have to Iran's analysis that way you know sometimes you don't you retire by human nature and human nature about the about wanting to impress coming to Boston and all that. The fire was rated one of the things that from my humiliation would be following the guy who has traded lower. Have you Google leaders just in Mosul and now on the ice ice I still follow. Him on the on Twitter you ought. Then at five team for five teens now so I've followed the suppose and that's what are some things that I see your stuff that pops up because it's you know. And treated three cup four times and there it is so. He's Celsius guys via trade or have popped up and you panel don't look around now I don't know with this situation has. In niners get pictures we have a give me the power rank of guys who treated for our youth who loses and who are some of the guys these that we know Anderson Espinoza last year. Anniversary goes straight to you bother menace from Colorado. And then I think I'm ready for Brett Anderson. And then. Oh and then Yonder Alonso was San Diego. It's news that first time your traded which was the ball little mantra remember that that was a big deal because a Red Sox are actually. There was some thought that they might try to trade for menace and the union stepped and when the when that first happened was it was at the shark tournament was that night and day compared to when you retreated last year because he had gone through it. Yeah now's a crazy actually. I was in Dublin after I was warming up for the gained house fits in and night. And you know it's the gains in ten minutes on the out compliments you know. From being ready to go in the game and its phone rings the bullpen then coached like they. You'd then take it and went with ten minutes before the game starts some walking across the field in some earlier starts throne warm up. I'm walking across to some homeless for decades centuries it's a missed. I just slow again remember the slow walk across the whole field stadiums full everyone's aaron's time thinking like. What the hell does this mean Mike what's going on that first year playing. I I didn't really it was crazy knows crazy so that the first your first professional years. That was my first year Provo 2011 for sites get adjusted to those and Simon did play. And then those efforts you're playing well. On 31 against a fuel it forever ago that does lots of squeeze them between NC times there between that first one. Filling us ten minutes when he hears film also. Very rich and it was there a time in that time because you had just sort of morphed into were reliever was ever a time. Where you felt like I'm not gonna get my chance to do what you end up doing last year. I didn't you know. I'd bounce around them. You know idol always known I could be a good starter. And you're not always Clinton situation I didn't really have choice and fifty mile from the bullpen. Our bullpen was doing very well and I got a heard ninja who is there wasn't really. You know. They didn't raises a demotion for his yes we need help down there and we think you can do it didn't move it much here. You know. Do you wanna do you wanna be the guy down there so I went down both men's. Pretty much. The first guy out every you know there's so if I was up that day and some snow on on boom Europe the matter when it was seventh 89 whatever. I was. But I I always in my head you know I always news that. I can be successful. As the star and decide to figure out how to get myself back there and kind of simplifies things. Just consume my mind all. On base audiences on my own time anyway offseason doesn't matter they united you know that's that's all I think about this ways to improve. It was always an honor because you know else you know if yes shouldn't be the best. Anywhere than you know and you lose your edge. Live with the so if that's the case then last argues in September and October. Must've been a complete mind you know why. Right I mean if if you're seeing there. They are in the ceiling thinking about baseball typically then when you're thinking about my elbow I think and about impressing people in Boston with a lot of generates that must have been. Like how I don't I can't imagine them. I was autos a lot like going on. I had some good games in there it's bagged games he nearly you can expect to be perfect every time mountain discount. It's part of us to this offseason time. Don't think about like whoa what was different between when I got traded on the games that I didn't do very rural. You know I mean I think there's there's a few things. Just execution wise sewer by playing going into the gains did a little different. You know supposedly stuff going on to its does that and to be you know it's going to be like it's right in a can have a you know it's not going to be in no pressure situation ever you know baseball is always. You know in a position to get out of things that. We've just got to slow the game down and the biggest thing I'm the tart brokerage and Boston and president is that if you had to look back and everything. And where the world when they went through last year is that just something as simple as this is slow everything down. Is that one of the biggest things where you said media didn't do that it's much issue and it's a big fan I think it. I just went a different direction and some of the things that may be good. You know a syndicate curve ball. Good. You know good forcing fastball. I didn't I don't think it through my two seamer it suited to some changes in their couple games that begin. You know it's it's I had a really good. You know game playing going and saying most of us that game to San Diego I had some bad means obviously. You're gonna have ups and downs of offseason. And video search teams are more times and but. In had a lot of good games you know I think you learn a line about. It's you know me sometimes you have some good gains from new going to connect Augustus and then. Doesn't go away one what the hell happened city cast analyzed. You know you know. He goes a little fuel to be going in today those little aggressive for me stand back when I don't say about him in trouble. And when I feel good offensive jam him at the front. And Carolina did there is a guy I realize that can. That's recess this. It slowed it down a little bit you know the law came comeback album is suffering is to stay back tonight some Ford when you have. I don't know when you can win but friendly parcel will be different industrial park the FBI wouldn't say that it was you know. Too much pitching there it was different you know as a a lot more innings and me. You know you know whatever it is seen on a hike is on the line can't find one specific thing wide I didn't you know. It's like I would have liked to. But it's a different league to increase in the studio and it's a fix it and certainly to. That right now. Do. It's.

Saudi exports to U.S. to fall by 300,000 barrels per day in March – official → NSA To Provide “Smoking Gun” Proof Obama Spied On Trump Posted on March 24, 2017 by # 1 NWO Hatr Zero Hedge – by Tyler Durden Yesterday, Republican Devin Nunez Nunes held an explosive press conference outside the White House in which he told reporters that communications from the Trump team were picked up and disseminated within the government during the 2016 campaign. Not surprisingly, the comments ruffled some liberal feathers and the mainstream media launched an immediate smear campaign calling for Nunes to resign his post immediately.   Now, according to Fox News sources, congressional investigators expect that a potential “smoking gun” from the NSA establishing that the Obama administration spied on the Trump transition team, and possibly the president-elect himself, will be produced to the House Intelligence Committee as early as tomorrow. The intelligence is said to leave no doubt the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on President-elect Trump, according to sources. The FBI hasn’t been responsive to the House Intelligence Committee’s request for documents, but the National Security Agency is expected to produce documents to the committee by Friday. The NSA document production is expected to produce more intelligence than Nunes has so far seen or described – including what one source described as a potential “smoking gun” establishing the spying. Classified intelligence showing incidental collection of Trump team communications, purportedly seen by committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and described by him in vague terms at a bombshell Wednesday afternoon news conference, came from multiple sources, Capitol Hill sources told Fox News. The intelligence corroborated information about surveillance of the Trump team that was known to Nunes, sources said, even before President Trump accused his predecessor of having wiretappedhim in a series of now-infamous tweets posted on March 4. The key to that conclusion is the unmasking of selected U.S. persons whose names appeared in the intelligence, the sources said, adding that the paper trail leaves no other plausible purpose for the unmasking other than to damage the incoming Trump administration. Because Nunes’s intelligence came from multiple sources during a span of several weeks, and he has not shared the actual materials with his committee colleagues, he will be the only member of the panel in a position to know whether the NSA has turned over some or all of the intelligence he is citing. If true, of course, this could put a ‘slight’ taint Obama’s claim of a “scandal free” eight years in the White House. * * * For those who missed it, here was Nunes’s press conference from yesterday: The FBI is not cooperating with the House of Representatives’ investigation into the NSA’s surveillance of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, the chairman of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee, Devin Nunes said in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon. In the aftermath of today’s most stunning news report, namely the confirmation that Trump may have been right all along following the admission of House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes that the communications of Trump’s aides and the president himself had been “incidentally” monitored, Nunes held an explosive press conference outside the White House in which told reporters that communications from the Trump team were picked up and disseminated within the government during the 2016 campaign. Nunes said sources within the intelligence community presented him with the information. He spoke to the press after briefing the administration. Nunes said that he had briefed the president about his concerns over the “incidental” collection of data, adding that the president “needs to know” that these intel reports exist, and adding ominously that “some of what I’ve seen seems to be inappropriate.” Nunes also said that Trump, others in the transition team were put into the intelligence report and asked if Trump should be in these “normal” reports. But what was perhaps most troubling in Nunes presser is that in the aftermath of Monday’s Congressional hearing with James Comey in which the FBI director said on the record there had been no surveillance of Trump, is the House Intel Commission chair’s statement that the FBI is not cooperating with the investigation. “We don’t actually know yet officially what happened to General Flynn,” Nunes said of how communications from Gen. Flynn’s calls were leaked to the press. “We just know that his name leaked out but we don’t know how it was picked up yet. That was one of the things that we asked for in the March 15th letter, was for the NSA, CIA, and FBI to get us all the unmasking that was done.” “And I’ll tell you, NSA is being cooperative,” Nunes continued, “but so far the FBI has not told us whether or not they’re going to respond to our March 15th letter, which is now a couple of weeks old.” Nunes also reported that as of now, he “cannot rule out” President Obama ordering the surveillance. Finally, and contrary to earlier media reports, Nunes clarified that the surveillance was not related to the FBI’s investigation into possible collusion with Russia. This surveillance, he emphasized to reporters, does not “have anything to do with Russia.” As a reminder, this has been the strawman argument proposed by much of the liberal media, which has said that a wiretapping of Trump or his aides, would only confirm that his relations with Russia were suspect and thus prompted a FISA warrant. If Nunes is correct, and Trump was being wiretapped for reasons having nothing to do with Russia, that entire narrative falls apart, and the press will now have to spend the next few weeks building up an entirely new narrative to “justify” why Trump was being wiretapped on Obama’s watch. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-23/nsa-provide-smoking-gun-proof-obama-spied-trump Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Download application note. ADLink 3U VPX board suits mil applications Rich Nass, Embedded Computing Brand Director This one actually occurred a month or so before Embedded World, but it wasn’t until the show that I actually got a chance to take a peek. So, I’m including the ADLink Technology 3U VPX3010 series in my Embedded World post-show coverage. The rugged processor blade is designed with a 12-core Intel Xeon Processor D-1500 SoC to enable the server-level performance. Applications that are suited for this board include those in the military, such as radar, digital signal processing, unmanned aerial/ground vehicles, and electronic…Continued... Five Minutes With…Zachary Smith, CEO, Packet Rich Nass, Embedded Computing Brand Director Wouldn’t it be great to developing your embedded system without actually having any hardware in your hand (or on your desk)? That’s what you get when you work with Packet, a relatively new player in the embedded systems space. In this week’s Five Minutes with…segment, I spoke to Zachary Smith, CEO of Packet , and asked him to explain just how this phenomenon works, and how it can benefit an embedded systems developer. It’s a relatively new concept, but one that could take you…Continued... Low-power ARM-based MCU adds security features Rich Nass, Embedded Computing Brand Director The growth of the IoT has propelled the growth of attacks, malicious and otherwise. To that end, Microchip has developed the CEC1702 hardware cryptography-enabled microcontroller (MCU) which addresses this need for increased security. The CEC1702 is a low-power, full-featured 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4-based MCU that offers easy-to-use encryption, authentication, and private and public key capabilities. The CEC1702 defends against attacks in myriad ways, including: Pre-boot authentication of system firmware: Providing an immutable identity and a root of trust to ensure that the firmware is untouched…Continued... Defining (artificial) intelligence at the edge for IoT systems Brandon Lewis, Technology Editor Merriam-Webster defines intelligence as “the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations.” By that definition, “intelligent systems” on the Internet of Things (IoT) require much more than just an Internet connection. The Inside Story: How the IIC’s Connectivity Framework Guides IIoT Connectivity Selection Sponsored by: RTI April 11, 2pm ET Big data for engineers and scientists, part 1: Introduction Dave Oswill, MathWorks Working with big data is fast becoming a key step in the process of scientific discovery and engineering. This is happening as technologies such as smart sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) are enabling the collection of vast amounts of detailed data from scientific instruments, manufacturing systems, connected cars, and aircraft. There is significant value to this data, as it may show important physical phenomena or provide information on the operating environment, efficiency, and health of a system. With the proper tools and…Continued... Xilinx Zync stack enables machine-learning applications Rich Nass, Embedded Computing Brand Director Our readers, who I believe are a great representation of the embedded community, have told us that they really like the Xilinx Zynq programmable processor architecture . It’s useful in a wide array of applications, particularly those in the IoT and Industrial IoT spaces. So, I was a little surprised when I visited with the Xilinx folks and they explained how they were going all in on vision applications. Not that vision isn’t very important, but it is limiting. After hearing the complete story,…Continued... The advantages of a SOM platform for IoT devices Mike Rohrmoser, Digi International There has been an increase in the number of commercially available development platforms offered to embedded designers seeking to cut development times for Internet of Things (IoT) devices to bring these new connected devices to market much more efficiently and cost-effectively. With advances in chip design, the availability of highly efficient, advanced processors is no longer an issue. Gone too are concerns about memory limitations, given the increasing availability of memory interfaces on these compact platforms that can accommodate increasing chip densities. With these…Continued... Thoughts from Embedded World Michael Barr, Barr Group I'm just getting back to work today after attending last week's Embedded World trade show in Nuremberg, Germany—and I still have a lot on my mind. This was my first visit to Embedded World and I have to say I was considerably impressed by the turnout and overall level of industry activity there. Of course, I'd heard for a decade that "EW" was the place to go for an embedded systems conference in Europe. Still, I had not realized just how much I needed…Continued... Give me a human programmer over an automated compiler Colin Walls Mentor Graphics Embedded Systems Division Traditionally, embedded software was always written in assembly language. This is no longer the case and C and C++ are the dominant languages favored by most embedded developers. However, if code needs to be totally optimal, should assembly language still be used? The obvious and intuitive answer is yes. A skilled human programmer, with a good knowledge of the target chip’s architecture, capabilities, and assembly language must always be able to do better than a compiler. How can it be otherwise? Modern compilers are…Continued... Assigning an ID to ‘things’ with secure SD cards Hubertus Grobbel, Swissbit AG IT security professionals know that identification, authentication and authorization are the three steps to access a "secure channel". Clear identification of individuals is the first step to safeguard communication. Encryption is the second. Today these processes are taken for granted by human users within the IT network. But this is quite different for the "things" within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Here, sensors, actuators and their gateways as well as machines, IT systems, etc. still mostly communicate without adequate security measures in place.…Continued...

Well, for political artists, the array of choices is so impossibly tantalizing that a la carte has become a la cartoon. Health-care legislation in limbo? Check. Potential Gorsuch filibuster? Check? The Trump wiretapping accusations? Check, please! But at the moment, many cartoonists are finding their richest fodder in the confusion over whether there was collusion between Team Trump and Mother Russia. On any given day at Chez Intel, your server might be named Comey or Nunes or Schiff. So what political art is emerging to serve up with a nice vodka?

Whenever possible, own the company that owns the "standard." You know what I mean. Back in the 1990s, Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) Windows software and the Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) processors combined to create the "Wintel Standard." Owning the companies that owned the standard paid off - and paid off big. Throughout the 1990s, the shares of all three companies performed as the "must own" stocks that they were: Microsoft's shares rose more than 9,000%, while Intel's soared 10,000%. Here's why I'm telling you this. We just found a company that's angling to "own the standard" in a newly emerging business that will be worth $42 billion in just eight years. Best of all: This is just one of the businesses this tech firm plays in. And the others are already successes. This is premium content for Private Briefing subscribers only. As the executive editor of Money Morning, Bill Patalon has perfected a secret investment strategy that could help you put an extra $125K into your portfolio - this year. To date, Bill has used this strategy to pick 257 winning investments, including 192 double- and triple-digit peak gains. Once you see the secret, you'll immediately understand why it works so well. (3) COMMENTS FACEBOOK COMMENTS TAGS Robert J Karp | March 23, 2017 I just looked up the three top stocks listed: PCYC – Doesn't exist. No listing, I use TD Ameritrade for my stock research. AMBA – is declining. CLDX – has severely declined. I stopped looking any further. Those big gains that are being boasted since 2011, if they were ever true are no longer valid. This is an attempt to buy up those stocks to get those prices to climb a little bit so they can dump theirs. Reply Robert J Karp | March 23, 2017 Fact is one of the ones I just listed was recommended to dump that stock according to the reporting agencies in TD Ameritrade. Reply Dave Zeiler | March 24, 2017 Robert, Thanks for reading Money Morning. Several points need to be made here. First of all, Bill doesn't buy or own the stocks he recommends. As for the peak gains, Bill advises his readers to use trailing stops to lock in their gains. If a stock falls further after that, they won't see those losses. PCYC (Pharmacyclics) isn't showing up on your search because it was bought out by AbbVie in 2015, leaving Bill's readers with gains of 818%. Hope this clarifies things. -Dave Zeiler, Associate Editor, Money Morning Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. Your email address will not be published.

Deep learning, the most widely used type of AI, is already enhancing cloud services by Tencent’s American and Chinese competitors, cloud giants like Google, Microsoft, Baidu, and Alibaba. The company has been ramping up investment in AI in a big way; Ma Huateng, its founder and chairman, views AI innovation as a matter of life and death for the business. In the data center, Nvidia’s Tesla GPUs, based on the chipmaker’s Pascal architecture, are currently state-of-the-art hardware for deep learning. Cloud giants pack as many as eight of these high-power units onto a server motherboard along with Intel CPUs, using them to teach computers to do things like predicting search results, identifying objects in photos, and serving targeted ads. See also: This Data Center is Designed for Machine Learning The amount of resources cloud giants have been investing in AI are driving a surge in demand for hardware like Nvidia’s. “We’ve been working with a lot of the hyper-scales – really all of the hyper-scales – in the large data centers,” Rob Ober, Tesla chief platform architect at Nvidia, told Data Center Knowledge in an interview earlier this month. These companies are also using GPUs to provide AI-enhanced cloud services to their enterprise customers, and some of them let customers rent “bare-metal” GPUs the same way they rent virtual machines in the cloud to run their own deep learning workloads. “Tencent Cloud GPU offerings with Nvidia’s deep learning platform will help companies in China rapidly integrate AI capabilities into their products and services,” Tencent Cloud VP Sam Xie said in a statement. Tencent’s deployment of Tesla P100 and P40 GPUs and Nvidia’s deep learning software is focused primarily on such enterprise cloud services. The Chinese company has been offering cloud services running on earlier-generation Tesla M40 GPUs since December. It expects to integrate cloud servers with up to eight GPUs each by mid-year.

By John Ribeiro Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 24, 2017 3:26 AM PT Credit: Magdalena Petrova More like this Facing sexism charges, Uber says Eric Holder will investigate Uber orders probe into employee's charge of sexual harassment Uber to investigate female engineer’s ‘abhorrent’ sexual harassment claims Video Mingis on Tech: Videoconferencing arrives, and what's up with 'digital... Uber Technologies has agreed to provide next month its diversity data, which it had earlier declined to make public. Representatives of the ride hailing company will disclose the information at the PUSHTech2020 summit on April 19 in Silicon Valley. The move comes at a time when the company has run into a number of controversies, including sexual harassment charges leveled by a former employee, the exit of some key executives and a lawsuit from self-driving car rival Waymo. The announcement follows a meeting Thursday between Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the Rainbow Push Coalition, which has been demanding higher representation for minorities in tech companies. Rainbow Push Coalition Uber CEO Travis Kalanick with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on March 23, 2017 Jackson has prodded a number of companies including Google, Apple and Intel to reveal their diversity data, which have shown that women, Blacks and Latinos are underrepresented in tech companies in Silicon Valley. Uber’s figures are unlikely to be radically different. The company said last month that 15.1 percent of its employees in engineering, product management and scientist roles are women. “Creating a more diverse and inclusive company is a top priority and it starts with releasing our demographic data, which we will do very soon,” Kalanick said in a statement released by Rainbow Push. Uber could not be immediately reached for comment after business hours. That the company had changed its mind over releasing a diversity report became evident after the crisis around the sexual harassment charge. Liane Hornsey, the company's chief human resources officer, said this week during a press call that a diversity report was on its way by the end of the month, while Kalanick had earlier said that he and Hornsey were working on a diversity report but did not specify a date for its release. The ride-hailing company said last month that it would appoint former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to a panel that would investigate allegations by a former engineer at the company that it mishandled her complaint of sexual harassment. The employee, Susan J. Fowler, had alleged in a blog post that women in the group she worked in had quit because of discrimination against women and organizational chaos. “Uber has taken a critical and important first step in directly confronting troubling claims of sexual harassment and other systemic issues that have cast a dark shadow on the company,” Jackson said in a statement. Besides diversifying its workforce, Uber should start at the top with its board of directors and executives, he added.

Devin Nunes, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee investigating connections between the Trump campaign and Russia, tipped off Trump about information he had obtained. Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on March 24, 2017 at 6:36 AM, updated March 24, 2017 at 7:23 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The unsubstantiated, classified information Rep. Devin Nunes leaked this week does not vindicate President Donald Trump's twitter claims that Barack Obama had Trump Tower wiretapped while he was president.   It does, however, show that Nunes is Trump's lap dog and should be removed as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating potential connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Nunes should be removed as chairman for tipping off Trump on the information he received; not sharing that information with the ranking committee member; leaking the classified information; damaging the committee's credibility and for having served as member of the Trump transition team.   He can no longer be trusted to be impartial. Wednesday, Nunes called a press conference to say he "recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community  incidentally collected information about US citizens involved in the Trump transition."    He then went to the White House and briefed President Trump on the information.   Nunes said a source had given him documents detailing legal surveillance of targets of FISA warrants.  The Trump associates were picked up in the surveillance incidentally.  That happens when the target of the warrant is talking on the phone with the individual, or simply mentions the persons name when talking to someone else.     In his press conference, Nunes objected to the Trump associates names being improperly unmasked in the documents.  But the House Intel committee's ranking member, Rep Adam Schiff, said Nunes had told him most of the names were in fact masked, and that Nunes said he was able to deduce who they were having served on the transition team. Nunes complained about leaks, but then turned around and leaked classified information. Nunes did not name his source or provide any proof of his claims.  Before holding his press conference and briefing Trump, Nunes never shared the information with the ranking member of the committee, as he is required to do. Schiff said Nunes "will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he is going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.  "It was my hope that our investigation could be conducted properly," Schiff added. "It's still my hope that this investigation should be conducted properly, but unfortunately the actions of the chair throw that very much in doubt. Senator John McCain said Nunes' actions were "very disturbing" and that he had "not seen anything like it."    "It's a bizarre situation.  I think  this back and forth and what the American people have found so far is that no longer does Congress have the credibility to handle this alone," said McCain while calling for an independent commission. Former CIA chief of staff Jeremy Bash said "the job of the committee is to do oversight over the executive branch --not to bring them in to their investigation or tip them off to things they may have been looking at."   Rep. Nancy Pelosi charged that "by being a stooge of the president of the United States, (Nunes) has demonstrated very clearly that there is no way there can be an impartial investigation under his leadership on that committee." Thursday, Nunes apologized to committee members, but he still did not provide them or the ranking member, Schiff, the information he provided Trump.  Democrats on the committee have demanded to see it by today. When asked if he felt vindicated by Nunes' revelations, Trump said, "I somewhat do. I must tell you I somewhat do.  I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found."    The White House, right-wing and Russian media, quickly promoted Nunes' comments as supporting Trump's claims that president Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, when in fact they don't. Nunes failure to inform the committee and reaction from the White House just fed the suspicion that Nunes' actions were a planned stunt to give Trump cover on his wiretap claims, cloud the waters and distract from James Comey's testimony before the committee. In addition to being a member of Trump's transition team, Nunes was approached by Reince Priebus last month and urged to "knock down" stories about the Trump campaign and Russia, and Nunes then proceeded to try and do so in press interviews. The disturbing stories  coming out about Paul Manafort's financial ties to Russia and Ukraine and Nunes' behavior, further demonstrate the urgent need for an independent commission to be appointed.

The Asus SOG Strix GD30 gaming desktop has the "power for any games you throw at it," with the optionon of high-end components from Intel and Nvidia plus lashings of memory and storage. However, Asus ROG looks to differentiate the GD30 on style, with its "Sci-Fi- and cyberpunk-inspired design," said to look just the part in a Star Wars themed gaming room. Appearance and visual customisation is important to the appeal of the GD30, and Asus ROG concentrates on the design for the first few paragraphs of its press release. A particular attraction of the GD30 is said to be the two fitted white front panels which can snap on and off the chassis for "a total of six different styles". In other design choices there is a triple section side window and Asus uses an iron honeycomb screen for its looks and EMI shielding benefits. The Asus SOG Strix GD30 also packs in Aura RGB lighting over the central motherboard section. Asus SOG Strix GD30 desktop key tech specs: Processor: Intel Core i5-7400 or Intel Core i7-7700 CPU Memory: up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM (4 slots) GPU: from Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 2GB up to GTX 1080 8GB Storage: various SATA HDD, SSD and M.2 options plus an ODD Connectivity: wired and wireless LAN plus Bluetooth 4.1 Ports: four USB 2.0 ports, and seven USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (one is a reversible Type-C connector with 15W fast-charging (3A/5V)) Front panel access: two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.1 ports, a memory card reader, and both microphone and headphone jacks. Plus power and reset buttons. Size and weight: 230 x 550 x 540mm, 17Kg Cooling considerations are discussed by Asus ROG in its press release. The chassis design is said to feature large air vents at the front and underside plus an isolated power supply chamber. There is room inside for up to five fans, and a water-cooling system but the GD30 comes equipped with just one rear 120-mm system fan with red LED lighting. Users can monitor system performance, and temperatures plus control fans and lighting via the Aegis III software from Asus. This software tool also provides XSpilt Gamecaster recording access and Sonic Studio III audio tweaking. Asus ROG hasn't released any pricing and availability details.

Posted by EvilCycle - Fri 24 Mar 2017 10:48 Disappointed in the case design to be honest, it looks like one of those budget gaming pc cases you see for around £40 but with an asus logo stamped onto it….. Posted by Phage - Fri 24 Mar 2017 10:54 Yes - less would be more. Who was it who had the signature about ‘gamer’ cases looking like epileptic frogs ? Posted by scaryjim - Fri 24 Mar 2017 11:13 Wouldn't the SOG Strix GD30 be a water-cooled version…? ;) (over-enthusiastic auto-correct, maybe?) Posted by Nobull - Fri 24 Mar 2017 11:43 Ugly and laughable that they only offer Nvidia, especially at 1050 level where the 460 offers better value IMO and up to 1060 where again, the 480 seems to be pulling ahead as drivers mature. Posted by Valantar - Fri 24 Mar 2017 12:00 I like the white-on-black aesthetic with both white panels attached (kinda-sorta Portal-ish), but with them detached it looks just like what it is: the ugly plastic backing that's meant to be hidden behind cosmetic panels. Also, do you have to remove the white panel to use the ODD? That's a … weird concession. Is the Venn diagram overlap of ODD users and people who dislike cheap-looking black plastic really that small? Also, the fact that the styling _only_ affects the front, leaving the side panels to look like standard cheapo gaming case fare is disappointing to say the least. How hard would it be to follow this up along the sides? Say they made magnetically attached plastic panels to go on the sides? How much would that cost them?

Sign up now Menu ARN Uber finally agrees to reveal diversity data Uber finally agrees to reveal diversity data Uber CEO Travis Kalanick met Thursday with civil rights leader Jesse Jackson John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 24 March, 2017 17:32 - - - - print email Comments IDG Uber Technologies has agreed to provide next month its diversity data, which it had earlier declined to make public. Representatives of the ride hailing company will disclose the information at the PUSHTech2020 summit on April 19 in Silicon Valley. The move comes at a time when the company has run into a number of controversies, including sexism charges leveled by a former employee, the exit of some key executives and a lawsuit from self-driving car rival Waymo. The announcement follows a meeting Thursday between Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the Rainbow Push Coalition, which has been demanding higher representation for minorities in tech companies, according to a statement issued by the coalition. Rainbow Push Coalition Uber CEO Travis Kalanick with Rev. Jesse Jackson March 23, 2017 Jackson has prodded a number of companies including Google, Apple and Intel to reveal their diversity data, which have shown that women, Blacks and Latinos are underrepresented in tech companies in Silicon Valley. Uber’s figures are unlikely to be radically different. The company said last month that 15.1 percent of its employees in engineering, product management, and scientist roles are women. “Creating a more diverse and inclusive company is a top priority and it starts with releasing our demographic data, which we will do very soon,” Kalanick said in a statement released by Rainbow Push. Uber could not be immediately reached for comment after business hours. The ride-hailing company said last month that it would appoint former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to a panel that would investigate allegations by a former engineer at the company that it mishandled her complaint of sexual harassment. The employee, Susan J. Fowler, had alleged in a blog post that women in the group she worked in had quit because of discrimination against women and organizational chaos. “Uber has taken a critical and important first step in directly confronting troubling claims of sexual harassment and other systemic issues that have cast a dark shadow on the company,” Jackson said in a statement. Besides diversifying its workforce, Uber should start at the top with its board of directors and executives, he added.

To be sure, it has served us wonderfully well. Its underlying technologies delivered the World Wide Web (still a young adult at around 28 years old) and our global communications network. Even as its user base has swelled to 3.4 billion, these technologies have scaled admirably. Today, however, all of those users demand a level of performance that the Internet was never designed to deliver. The authors of the original Internet protocols, who began their pioneering work in the late 1960s, designed them for a network to be used mainly for sending electronic mail from one computer to another. Now, though, people spend far more time streaming Netflix movies. Oftentimes, one piece of content must be distributed to hundreds of thousands or millions of users simultaneously—and in real time. With its growth and shifts in usage, the Internet is being severely strained. That’s why you’re often stuck watching a “buffering” message when you’re trying to watch a viral video. Increasingly, network engineers find themselves scrambling for patches to improve performance or searching for ways to squeeze slightly more capacity from this creaky infrastructure. Looking ahead to what it hopes will be a golden era for the Internet, Cisco Systems expects global traffic to grow by 22 percent per year through 2020. It’s hard to imagine that happening, however, if the original framework remains in place. What we really need is an Internet that can provide more bandwidth and lower latency to many users at once—and do it securely. Along with our colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), in California, we’ve developed a better Internet architecture. We call it content-centric networking, or CCN. Our approach fundamentally changes the way information is organized and retrieved and improves network reliability, scalability, and security. After a decade of development, we’re now testing our concept: In January 2016, PARC released the open-source code for CCN software. Since then, more than 1,000 copies have been downloaded by individuals, universities, and industrial-research organizations. Companies including Alcatel-Lucent (now part of Nokia), Huawei, Intel, Panasonic, and Samsung have also had substantial R&D efforts focused on one or more aspects of CCN in recent years. In February, Cisco announced that it had acquired the CCN platform that we originally developed at PARC. As the Internet stretches to its next billion users, all of whom will want to stream videos and upload content to their heart’s content, it’s time for us to rethink the way the Internet was built. Although we don’t expect CCN to completely replace the Internet’s protocols, we are convinced that an alternative architecture can offer better performance and security in many cases. The origins of the modern Internet were largely patterned on technologies that support the public telephony system. Just like the telephone system, the early Internet needed a set of addresses to identify users and instructions to spell out how information should be routed and protected throughout the network. Over time, many of the same methods that had been used to make telephone calls reliable and secure, and which enabled the telephone system to scale up, were reproduced in the Internet. That strategy wasn’t perfect, though, because early telephones relied on circuit-switched networks. In such a network, users sent a stream of information over a single connection established at the start of a call. The Internet is a packet-switched network, which means it separates the many bits that make up a piece of content into smaller pieces (packets) of data. On the Internet, packets can be sent over different paths on the network and are reassembled into the original piece of content at its destination. Each piece of online content is stored on a user’s server (known as a host), often that of the content’s creator. To retrieve the content, other users must navigate to that server with their requests. Then the packets must be sent back to the requestor. Along the way, routers must constantly juggle these packets. To help routers direct packets, the Internet’s founders came up with a clever system of assigning a unique IP address to every computer or server. The IP address is similar to a phone number. Routers move information along by reading bits on an incoming content packet that indicate its intended destination, looking up the recipient’s IP address in routing tables, and forwarding the packet in the recipient’s direction. Whenever an Internet user types in a URL or email address, a Domain Name System translates those characters into the matching IP address. The DNS system is basically a phone book for the Internet. Through these servers, a URL, such as http://spectrum.ieee.org/, becomes an IP address, such as 23.197.245.16. To enable packets to travel between hosts once a user has the correct IP address, the Internet’s founders also built a shared network architecture. It has four basic layers, each with a distinct function. The first layer is the physical link over which information is sent, such as copper wires, fiber-optic cables, cellular towers, and home routers. The second and third layers are governed by common rules known as protocols that define how information is named and routed. Here, the main protocols are the Internet Protocol, which manages addresses for packets and hosts, and the Transmission Control Protocol, which describes how information is transferred. The upper layer has to do with specific applications, with more protocols that translate information for display within different Internet browsers and other programs. Illustration: QuickHoney A New Way to Route To retrieve an IEEE Spectrum article in a content-centric network, a node issues an interest packet [yellow] for content labeled with the routable prefix of spectrum.ieee/2017. Nearby nodes [blue] forward the request [orange] until it finds a content packet [green box] with a matching label. Then, the nodes return that content to the requester by retracing the same path [green arrows]. Along the way, any node may copy and store a popular piece of content in its content store [purple] for future requests. These basic protocols have supported the Internet for more than four decades of growth. But they do have some shortcomings. For example, they don’t always organize content in the most efficient way. Nor do they incorporate security prescriptions such as encryption by default. While these functions can be accomplished by adding more protocols, doing so can increase latency and further burden the network with additional traffic. With CCN, we’ve developed a new architecture based on how information is organized within the network, rather than the IP addresses of hosts. That’s why it’s called content-centric networking—it’s based on how content is named and stored, instead of where it is located. We’ve designed new protocols that can find and retrieve content from wherever it happens to be in the network at a given time and also perform many additional tasks that could make networks faster, more resilient, and more secure. To understand how all of this works, we’ll walk you through how a CCN network finds and retrieves a content packet for a user who is interested in reading an article or watching a video on the Web. In today’s Internet, there is only one kind of data packet—one that carries both content and requests for content between users. But in a CCN network, there are two types: content packets and interest packets. They work together to bring information to users. Content packets are most like traditional data packets. The bits in a content packet may specify part of an ad on a Web page, a piece of a photo in an article, or the first few seconds of a video. Interest packets, on the other hand, are like golden retrievers that a user sends out onto the network to find a specific content packet and bring it back. When you visit a Web page, your computer needs to fetch about 100 pieces of content on average. A piece of content could be a block of text, a photo, or a headline. With CCN, when you navigate to a website or click on a link, you automatically send out interest packets to specify the content you would like to retrieve. Typing in a single URL, or Web address, can trigger a user’s browser to automatically send out hundreds of interest packets to search for the individual components that make up that page. Both interest and content packets have labels, each of which is a series of bits that indicate which type of packet it is, the time it was generated, and other information. The label on a content packet also includes a name that designates what bits of content it holds, while the label on an interest packet indicates which content it wishes to find. When a user clicks on a link, for example, and generates a flurry of interest packets, the network searches for content packets with matching names to satisfy that request. The name on a packet’s label is called a uniform resource identifier (URI), and it has three main parts. The first part is a prefix that routers use to look up the general destination for a piece of content, and the second part describes the specific content the packet holds or wishes to find. The third part lists any additional information, such as when the content was created or in what order it should appear in a series. Suppose a Web surfer’s browser is using CCN to navigate to this article on IEEE ­Spectrum’s website. The network must find and deliver all the content packets that make up the complete article. To make that process easier, URIs use a hierarchical naming system to indicate which packets are needed for the page, and in what order. For example, one content packet might be named spectrum.ieee/2017/April/ver=2/chunk=9:540. In this example, spectrum.ieee is the routable prefix for the second version of the article, and the specific packet in question is the ninth packet of 540 that make up the complete article. Once a CCN user has clicked that link or typed it in as a Web address, the user’s machine dispatches an interest packet into the network in search of that content, along with other interest packets to search for packets 10 and 11. As the interest packet for number 9 travels along, each router or server it encounters must evaluate that interest packet and determine whether it holds the content packet that can satisfy its request. If not, that node must figure out where in the network to forward the interest packet next. To do all of this, every node relies on a system known as a CCN forwarder. The forwarder operates on components that are similar to what you’d find in a traditional router. A CCN forwarder requires a processor, memory, and storage to manage requests. The forwarder also runs a common software program called a forwarding engine. The forwarding engine decides where to store content, how to balance loads when traffic is heavy, and which route between two hosts is best. The forwarding engine in a CCN network has three major components: the content store, the pending interest table, and the forwarding information base. Broadly speaking, CCN works like this: A node’s forwarding engine receives interest packets and then checks to see if they are in its content store. If not, the engine next consults the pending interest table and, as a last resort, searches its forwarding information base. While it’s routing information, the engine also uses algorithms to decide which content to store, or cache, for the future, and how best to deliver content to users. To understand how that system improves on our existing Internet protocols, consider what happens when a new interest packet arrives at a node. The forwarding engine first looks for the content in the content store, which is a database that can hold thousands of content packets in its memory for quick and easy access, like the cache memory in a conventional router. But CCN has a key difference. Unlike the traditional Internet protocols, which permit content to be stored only with the original host or on a limited number of dedicated servers, CCN permits any node to copy and store any content anywhere in the network. To build its own content store, a node can grab any packet that travels through it, keep a copy of it, and add that copy to its store to fill future requests. This ability means that content isn’t stuck on the server where it was originally created. Content can move throughout the network and be stored where it’s needed most, which could potentially enable faster delivery. Currently, large companies such as Netflix pay a lot of money to store extra copies of their most popular content on content delivery networks built from regional data centers. With CCN, the entire Internet could act like one big content delivery network. Any server with available memory—not just the servers that Netflix manages—could store the first 3 seconds of a popular Netflix film. Later, we’ll explain how special security precautions built into the most basic layer of CCN make it possible to securely copy and store content in this way. Illustration: QuickHoney Power to the Node Servers and routers can find content packets located anywhere on a CCN network by consulting two specialized tables: the pending interest table and the forwarding information base. The FIB lists where content is currently stored, while the PIT traces how past requests were forwarded. Nodes can also pluck content packets they’ve cached in their own content store (CS) to satisfy requests. To return to our example, if the forwarder finds the content it’s looking for in the node’s content store, the system sends that content packet back to the user through the same “face,” or gateway, by which the interest packet entered the system. However, when an interest packet arrives, that node might not hold a copy of the needed content in its content store. So for its next step, the forwarding engine consults the pending interest table, a logbook that keeps a running tally of all the interest packets that have recently traveled through the node and what content they were seeking. It also notes the gateway through which each interest packet arrived and the gateway it used to forward that content along. By checking the pending interest table (PIT) whenever a new interest packet arrives, the forwarding engine can see whether it has recently received any other interest packets for the same—or similar—content. If so, it can choose to forward the new interest packet along the exact same route. Or it can wait for that content to travel back on its return trip, make a copy, and then send it to all users who expressed interest in it. The idea here is that these PIT records create a trail of bread crumbs for each interest packet, tracing its route through the network from node to node until it finds the content it’s seeking. This is very different from conventional networks, where routers immediately “forget” information they’ve forwarded. Then, that forwarder consults the PIT at each node to follow the reverse path back to the original requester. Suppose, though, that an interest packet arrives at a node and the forwarding engine can’t find a copy of the requested content in its content store, nor any entry for it in the pending interest table. At this point, the node turns to the forwarding information base—its last resort when trying to satisfy a new request. Ideally, the forwarding information base (FIB) is an index of all the URI prefixes, or routable destinations, in the entire network. When an interest packet arrives, the forwarding engine checks this index to find the requested content’s general whereabouts. Then it sends the interest packet through whatever gateway will move it closer to that location and adds a new entry to the pending interest table for future reference. In reality, the FIB for the entire Internet would be too large to store at every node, so just like today’s routing tables, it is distributed throughout the network. In a traditional network, routers perform a similar search to find the IP address of the server that holds the bits of information a user wishes to retrieve and figure out which gateway to send the request through. The difference here is that with CCN, the forwarding information base finds the current location of the information itself on the network rather than the address of the server where it’s stored. By focusing on the location of content rather than tracking down the address of its original host, a CCN network can be more nimble and responsive than today’s networks. In fact, our studies indicate that the CCN model will outperform [PDF] traditional IP-based networks in three key aspects: reliability, scalability, and security. CCN improves reliability by allowing any content to be stored anywhere in the network. This feature is particularly useful in wireless networks at points where bit-error rates tend to be high, such as when data is transmitted from a smartphone to a cell tower, or broadcast from a Wi-Fi access point. Current Internet protocols leave error recovery to higher levels of the protocol stack. By keeping a copy of a content packet for a short while after sending it along, a CCN node reduces the upstream traffic for packets that need to be retransmitted. If a packet fails to transmit to the next node, the previous node does not need to request it again from the original host because it has its own copy on hand to retransmit. The pending interest table can also make it easier for networks to scale. By grouping similar interest packets together, it can reduce the bandwidth needed to satisfy each request. Instead of sending a new request back to the original host for each identical interest packet that arrives, a node could satisfy all those requests for interest packets with identical copies of the content it has stored locally. If the record shows that there has been a lot of demand for a viral cat video, the algorithms within that node may prompt it to keep an extra copy of all those packets in its content store to more quickly satisfy future requests. Boosting reliability and making it easier to scale networks are two important benefits. But to us, the most important advantage of CCN is the extra security it offers. In traditional networks, most security mechanisms focus on protecting routes over which information travels (similar to the strategies used in early ­circuit-switched telephone networks). In contrast, CCN protects individual packets of information, no matter where they flow. Currently, two users can establish a secure connection through established Internet protocols. The two most common of these are HTTPS and Transport Layer Security. With HTTPS, a user’s system examines a digital certificate issued by a third party, such as Symantec Corp., to verify that the other user is who she claims to be. Through TLS, users negotiate a set of cryptographic keys and encryption algorithms at the start of each session that they both use to transfer information securely to each other. With CCN, every content packet is encrypted by default, because each content packet also comes with a digital signature to link it back to its original creator. Users can specify in their interest packets which creator they would like to retrieve content from (for example, Netflix). Once they find a content packet with that creator’s matching signature, they can check that signature against a record maintained by a third party to verify that it is the correct signature for that piece of content. With this system in place, creators can allow other users to copy and store their content, because packets will always remain encrypted and verifiable. As long as users can verify the signature, they know that the content packet originated with the creator and that users can securely access the content—a motion picture, say—from anywhere it happens to be. This security feature brings another bit of good news: Distributed denial-of-service attacks—in which hackers send a large volume of requests to a website or server in order to crash it—are more difficult to execute in CCN. Unusual traffic patterns are easier to discern in a CCN network and can be shut down quickly. On the other hand, clever attackers may just try to figure out a way to flood the network with interest packets instead. This security challenge would have to be solved before CCN could be widely adopted. Another significant challenge [PDF] is figuring out how to integrate CCN’s protocols into routers running at the speeds used on current networks. Analysts are especially concerned that routers in a CCN system would have to store rather large FIB and PIT tables to track the many moving content objects on the network, which will present major computational and memory-related challenges. However, researchers are now working on this problem at Cisco, Huawei, PARC, and Washington University in St. Louis, which have all demonstrated prototype routers supporting various elements of the CCN protocols. Meanwhile, researchers elsewhere are drawing up their own protocols for alternative versions of CCN. These groups have built similar architectures called CCN-lite and Named Data Networking, with the support of the University of Basel, in Switzerland, and the National Science Foundation. All of these projects, along with the PARC software, are part of the broader field known as information-centric networking (ICN), which includes other research not directly related to CCN about redrawing the Internet’s architecture. One project worth mentioning is the GreenICN research program, led by Xiaoming Fu of the University of Göttingen, in Germany, in conjunction with more than a dozen universities and companies. That program explores the use of new technologies, including PARC’s open-source CCN software, to create more robust networks to be rapidly deployed following a natural disaster. Fu and his colleagues took advantage of CCN’s ability to operate independently of any private network and better manage limited energy resources. The group demonstrated a prototype network in early 2016. From its earliest days, no one could have predicted what the Internet would become. Now that we have more than 45 years of knowledge about how people behave online, we want to build the next generation of the Internet to be even better than the last. We believe that early commercial deployments of CCN will be carried out, probably next year, on private networks meant for video distribution or financial transactions, where the numbers of users, forwarders, and caches can be carefully controlled. It is hard to predict the future of today’s Internet at its middle age. But consider this: In 1876, Western Union passed up the chance to purchase all of ­Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone patents and, in an internal memo, stated that [PDF] “the ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.” The pace of technological change has accelerated dramatically since the early days of the telephone, so it’s hard to imagine a 125-year run for our current Internet technologies. With CCN, the Internet could begin its evolution into a faster and more secure service that billions more users can rely on for decades to come.

Back in January, Volvo announced the integration of Skype for Business into its 90 Series cars, as well as a proposition to include Microsoft's Cortana in its upcoming vehicles. The quest for Microsoft services integrated into smart cars does not stop there, with Nissan also in talks about a project involving Cortana, and Microsoft's recent collaboration with BMW. Microsoft held a press conference this week to announce a deal that will see Microsoft license its patents for Internet-connected cars over to Toyota. The deal will enable Toyota to use a handful of Microsoft's patents such as Wi-Fi, voice recognition software, motion sensors, operating systems, and tools to store and transfer files. Granting access to this trove of services should allow Microsoft to splash in the same pool that other companies such as Google and Intel have been comfortably swimming in for quite some time now. According to Erich Anderson, Corporate Vice President at Microsoft's Intellectual Property Group, the company appears very hopeful with this strategic move: We don’t make cars, but we have a long history of working with our partners in the automotive industry to deliver great products and services that power the automotive sector. For example, our Azure service is the leading cloud platform for the auto industry. Who can blame them? Microsoft sees an opportunity to be snatched amid huge growth in demand for connected car services. According to Gartner Research, new vehicles equipped with data connectivity will rise from 12.4 million per year in 2016 to 61 million per year in 2020. While technically these are just predictions, Gartner also believes the total cumulative shipments of smart cars equipped with data connectivity will be 250 million by 2020. Connected Car Production by Connectivity Mode, Worldwide (Thousands) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Embedded 2,174 4,914 11,097 21,394 33,928 42,949 Tethered 4,681 7,519 9,971 12,374 14,995 17,994 Total 6,855 12,433 21,068 33,768 48,923 60,943 Microsoft's pending licensing deal follows a prior tie-up with Toyota in April of last year to create a data analytics company with the means to bring new Internet-connected services to automobiles without overwhelming the driver. Dubbed Toyota Connected, it was one of the first to adopt Microsoft's Azure-powered service.

Twitter Facebook Uber finally agrees to reveal diversity data Uber CEO Travis Kalanick met Thursday with civil rights leader Jesse Jackson IDG John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 24 March, 2017 17:32 - - - - print email Comments Uber Technologies has agreed to provide next month its diversity data, which it had earlier declined to make public. Representatives of the ride hailing company will disclose the information at the PUSHTech2020 summit on April 19 in Silicon Valley. The move comes at a time when the company has run into a number of controversies, including sexism charges leveled by a former employee, the exit of some key executives and a lawsuit from self-driving car rival Waymo. The announcement follows a meeting Thursday between Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the Rainbow Push Coalition, which has been demanding higher representation for minorities in tech companies, according to a statement issued by the coalition. Rainbow Push Coalition Uber CEO Travis Kalanick with Rev. Jesse Jackson March 23, 2017 Jackson has prodded a number of companies including Google, Apple and Intel to reveal their diversity data, which have shown that women, Blacks and Latinos are underrepresented in tech companies in Silicon Valley. Uber’s figures are unlikely to be radically different. The company said last month that 15.1 percent of its employees in engineering, product management, and scientist roles are women. “Creating a more diverse and inclusive company is a top priority and it starts with releasing our demographic data, which we will do very soon,” Kalanick said in a statement released by Rainbow Push. Uber could not be immediately reached for comment after business hours. The ride-hailing company said last month that it would appoint former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to a panel that would investigate allegations by a former engineer at the company that it mishandled her complaint of sexual harassment. The employee, Susan J. Fowler, had alleged in a blog post that women in the group she worked in had quit because of discrimination against women and organizational chaos. “Uber has taken a critical and important first step in directly confronting troubling claims of sexual harassment and other systemic issues that have cast a dark shadow on the company,” Jackson said in a statement. Besides diversifying its workforce, Uber should start at the top with its board of directors and executives, he added. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Today, the company has launched another deal on a Dell device, and like the Inspiron 13, it's also got one of Intel's latest seventh-generation 'Kaby Lake' processors. From today until March 28, Microsoft is offering $200 (24%) off the Dell Inspiron 15 5578, the larger sibling of the Inspiron 13. It's also a 2-in-1 Windows 10 machine with a display that can fold over 360 degrees, turning the notebook into a (fairly chunky) tablet. Its key specs include: 15.6-inch LED-backlit touchscreen with Full HD (1920x1080px) resolution 2.70GHz Intel Core i7-7500U processor 8GB DDR4 RAM 1TB hard drive SD card reader 2 x USB 3.0 1 x USB 2.0 1 x HDMI 802.11ac Wi-Fi with Miracast support Bluetooth 4.0 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo port Integrated webcam Precision touchpad TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0 382 x 253 x 20.2mm; 1.99kg If you're looking for something a bit more compact, and more affordable, than the Inspiron 13 or Inspiron 15, there is another deal available at the Microsoft Store that may pique your interest. Microsoft is currently offering 29% off the ASUS Transformer Mini, a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet. It's now available for just $249, which includes a detachable keyboard, pen, and Windows Hello fingerprint recognition.

Representatives of the ride hailing company will disclose the information at the PUSHTech2020 summit on April 19 in Silicon Valley. The move comes at a time when the company has run into a number of controversies, including sexism charges leveled by a former employee, the exit of some key executives and a lawsuit from self-driving car rival Waymo. The announcement follows a meeting Thursday between Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president of the Rainbow Push Coalition, which has been demanding higher representation for minorities in tech companies, according to a statement issued by the coalition. Rainbow Push Coalition Uber CEO Travis Kalanick with Rev. Jesse Jackson March 23, 2017 Jackson has prodded a number of companies including Google, Apple and Intel to reveal their diversity data, which have shown that women, Blacks and Latinos are underrepresented in tech companies in Silicon Valley. Uber’s figures are unlikely to be radically different. The company said last month that 15.1 percent of its employees in engineering, product management, and scientist roles are women. “Creating a more diverse and inclusive company is a top priority and it starts with releasing our demographic data, which we will do very soon,” Kalanick said in a statement released by Rainbow Push. Uber could not be immediately reached for comment after business hours. That the company had changed its mind over releasing a diversity report became evident after the crisis around the sexism charge. Liane Hornsey, the company's chief human resources officer, said this week during a press call that a diversity report was on its way by the end of the month, while Kalanick had earlier said that he and Hornsey were working on a diversity report but did not specify a date for its release. The ride-hailing company said last month that it would appoint former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to a panel that would investigate allegations by a former engineer at the company that it mishandled her complaint of sexual harassment. The employee, Susan J. Fowler, had alleged in a blog post that women in the group she worked in had quit because of discrimination against women and organizational chaos. “Uber has taken a critical and important first step in directly confronting troubling claims of sexual harassment and other systemic issues that have cast a dark shadow on the company,” Jackson said in a statement. Besides diversifying its workforce, Uber should start at the top with its board of directors and executives, he added.

BAZ RATNER/REUTERS U.S. charges two Israeli residents with Mobileye insider trading Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli startups Opinion Why men are terrified of the rise of driverless cars Every week, Prof. Amnon Shashua convenes his class on the Givat Ram campus of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. A computer science professor and newly minted billionaire, Shashua teaches an advanced seminar on deep learning. The class is theoretical, but he could tell them a thing or two about turning theory into fact, and how much their research could change the world one day. That is what Shashua aims to do with Mobileye, which he founded over 17 years ago with Ziv Aviram. Mobileye developed driving-aid systems and today its technology is being used to develop autonomous cars. That’s why Intel just offered to buy it for $15.3 billion. Shashua came from MIT, where he did his PhD in brain and cognitive sciences, and post-doc in biological and computational learning, then joined the Hebrew University in 1996 – three years before establishing Mobileye. Mobileye’s technology is based on his research, which raised questions about intellectual property at the company’s beginning. The norm at universities is that IP developed during research doesn’t belong only to the researchers but to the institution employing them. But though some of the development of Mobileye’s technology began at Hebrew University, it’s not getting much from the company’s meteoric growth and imminent sale in the biggest takeover in Israeli history. Compare that with the Weizmann Institute of Science, which over the years enjoyed large royalties from Copaxone, a proprietary drug made by Teva for multiple sclerosis. What happened? “Mobileye wasn’t exactly a Hebrew University venture. It started as a private venture by Shashua and Aviram, and there was an argument to what degree the university had a part in it,” says Prof. Menachem Magidor, the university’s president at the time. Complicated “That’s because much of the venture was done outside the university. Shashua claimed some of the research had been done while he was at the Technion [in Haifa], some on sabbatical and some at Mobileye itself. It was complicated.” Universities protect their intellectual property through in-house technology transfer companies. Tel Aviv University has Ramot; Weizmann has Yeda; and Hebrew University has Yissum to commercialize research. Transfer companies may operate by royalties, which is often the model used with drug development – the university keeps the patent and sells usage rights, in exchange for say 30% or 40% of sales. Or the university may hand over its technological rights in exchange for shares. In Mobileye’s case, the Hebrew University elected for shares – though not before a dispute over its stake, which was settled by arbitration in the early 2000s. The compromise left Hebrew University with only a few percent. But the university didn’t want to battle on and sue its own staffer; they held Shashua in the highest regard and wanted him to stay on, Magidor says. And the shares they got were diluted over time because the university didn’t invest more in the company. He adds that the university isn’t in the business of making money, but of conducting research and teaching, and that the academic consideration must prevail. Hebrew University commented that the controversy is long over. Mobileye declined to comment. How many percent the university actually got isn’t known; it also may have sold shares some before Mobileye floated in New York. Anyhow, it arrived at the IPO owning 0.6% of the company. From the flotation to date, Hebrew University has made $40 million from selling shares. Prof. Shmuel Peleg, Shashua’s colleague in the computer science and engineering department, says Hebrew University is very supportive of its researchers founding companies, certainly compared with other universities. When a researcher founds a company – as he himself has done twice – he negotiate with the university over its share in it. When selling a drug patent to a company, the scientist simply shares the income with the university. Technology is different. “In such cases, the researcher invents a mathematical formula, which is useful mainly for publishing a paper,” says Peleg. “Somebody else comes along and suggests using the formula in automated driving, for example – a new technology of unproven demand; even the formula’s ability to solve a problem hasn’t been proved. A company is set up, it applies the formula to the problem and persuades the world to move to automated driving. The argument will be over the university’s part in its success, what is its part in the idea, the implementation and the marketing.” Some investment formulae tie stakes to future investment in the company’s research: if the future investment is high, then the technology is based less on know-how gained at the university and its share will be smaller. “Some universities demand 40% of any company and no companies get set up there,” says Peleg, who advocates negotiation. Granted, arguments ensue, but the fact is that Hebrew University people produce a lot of companies, showing it’s on the right track, he says. Furthermore, income from intellectual property rights is a tiny fraction of any university’s total budget, adds Magidor. Most universities that made anything from IP did it through two or three blockbuster successes, and Hebrew University is in a very distinguished position from that perspective – though Magidor admits that Weizmann beats it hand over fist. “In principle, as a proportion of the budget, the return on the investment in research is usually far from covering it,” says Magidor. “It doesn’t pay, economically speaking. Hebrew University owns thousands of patents that it doesn’t try to commercialize. It isn’t good at it and that isn’t its relative edge. We try to commercialize a few dozen things that we believe may proffer commercial potential. Sometimes you miss. It’s like a venture capital fund. In Mobileye’s case, it’s hard to say we were confident.” Secret agreement The university uses such income to improve labs, etc. Some years ago, a dispute arose between the computer science school and the university administrtration. The school claimed the administration owed it tens of millions of shekels and some senior teachers at the school took an unusual step: They sued. The case was settled out of court in secret. It’s well documented that technology giants also fund the school. “We’re very strong in computer vision. The company that’s invested the most in us is Intel, but Google also gives research grants,” says Peleg. And what do they get in return? “From the perspective of IP, they don’t get anything,” responds Peleg. “Intel’s condition is that everything developed will be open to the public and everyone can use it – meaning developments can’t be patented. The companies do get access to the researchers who give lectures, and to the students, who join then afterward.” They’re not contractors, he notes, but researchers. The companies can’t just ask them to develop projects, says Peleg, “because we’d refuse to do it for them.” Hagai Amit Haaretz Contributor Hagai Amit Send me email alerts for new articles by Hagai Amit Send Close Email * Please enter your email Hagai Amit For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

It's irresponsible to do otherwise,” added conservative Rep. Justin AmashJustin AmashObamaCare gets new lease on life Top Republican: The healthcare bill is dead House GOP abandons ObamaCare repeal effort in stunning defeat MORE (R-Mich.) in a tweet Thursday night. Republicans on Thursday night announced that they would make some significant changes to the bill, known as the American Health Care Act, with the intention of winning over conservatives. The most prominent of those changes is to repeal ObamaCare’s essential health benefits, which mandate which health services an insurance plan must cover, including areas like mental health, prescription drugs, and maternity care. The GOP will also add $15 billion to a “stability fund” to the bill in order to provide mental health and maternity coverage, which will be paid for by keeping ObamaCare's 0.9 percent Medicare tax on high earners for six years. Repealing the essential health benefits could have far-reaching consequences for the legislation and for the U.S. healthcare system, but the CBO will not have time to release an analysis of the change before the vote on Friday. “With these amendments, no,” House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyTrump, GOP look to tax bill for lifeline The right approach to promoting competition in the health care marketplace GOP rushes to vote without knowing full impact of healthcare plan MORE (R-Texas) told reporters Thursday night when asked if there would be a new CBO report. He defended moving forward, though. “We will continue to ask the CBO for a score,” Brady said. “We anticipate that they'll have to look at the coverage issues. The stability fund is pretty straightforward so we don't anticipate major changes that way.” Asked about releasing changes the night before the vote, Brady pointed to comments from White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who said President Trump is finished negotiating and is threatening to leave ObamaCare in place if the bill doesn't pass Friday. “We've been discussing these solutions with members for several days now and so has President Trump,” Brady said. “Mr. Mulvaney made it clear the president is done negotiating, that this is a conservative package that lowers healthcare costs, and so at his request and the leadership's, we're moving forward with the vote tomorrow.” Some Republicans downplayed the importance of a full nonpartisan analysis of the bill’s effects before voting on it. “I know this will all make the deficit better,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a leadership ally. Pressed on how he knows that if there’s no CBO score, Cole said: “Because it doesn’t take the CBO — because I know the range, what the initial CBO score was, and I know the range of changes that they’re talking about.” Members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus who have been opposed to the legislation say leadership shouldn’t rush the process. “We’ve been saying for a while that we need to slow down,” said Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho). “Let’s get it right. It’s better to get it right than to get it fast.” The House voted late Thursday night to fast-track consideration of the GOP healthcare plan. The procedure approved on a largely party-line vote waives a House rule that requires lawmakers to wait a day before considering a measure produced out of the Rules Committee, which determines parameters for how legislation is considered on the floor. That means the Rules Committee will be able to tack on an amendment, known as a "manager's amendment," to the repeal-and-replace bill with a litany of changes that haven’t all had time to be reviewed by the CBO. Four Republicans broke with their party to oppose adoption of the waiver: Reps. Amash, Thomas Massie (Ky.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and David Young (Iowa). All four have come out against the legislation. The House Rules Committee is expected to meet early Friday morning to tack on the last-minute changes to the legislation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Thursday night the floor vote on passage of the bill could wrap up by the afternoon.

GOP leaders plan to bring up the legislation meant to fulfill a seven-year campaign pledge on Friday, even though they are struggling to win over enough votes after marathon negotiations and dealmaking behind closed doors.  The House normally has to wait a day before considering a measure produced out of the Rules Committee, which determines how legislation is considered on the floor. ADVERTISEMENT The fast-track procedure approved in a largely party-line vote Thursday night waives that requirement and speeds things up. This way, the House can consider a rule establishing parameters for floor debate on the same day it comes out of the Rules Committee. Four Republicans opposed to the GOP healthcare plan voted against the rule in an unusual break with leadership on a procedural vote. GOP Reps. Justin AmashJustin AmashObamaCare gets new lease on life Top Republican: The healthcare bill is dead House GOP abandons ObamaCare repeal effort in stunning defeat MORE (Mich.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and David Young (Iowa) have all come out against the bill. "We must have the opportunity to read and understand the final bill before we vote. It's irresponsible to do otherwise," Amash tweeted. Lawmakers typically vote by party lines on procedural votes even if they might defect on the underlying legislation. That’s because procedural votes are viewed by leadership as a referendum on how they run the floor. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said on the floor late Thursday that it’s expected the vote could wrap up by Friday afternoon. The House Rules Committee is expected to meet Friday morning to add an amendment to the legislation that, among other provisions, would eliminate ObamaCare’s minimum insurance coverage requirements. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued an updated analysis earlier Thursday based on proposed changes unveiled earlier in the week. Those provisions will also be added to the bill by the Rules Committee. But it’s not expected to have time to issue another analysis in time for Friday’s vote to assess how repealing the minimum insurance requirements will affect the nation’s healthcare system. Democrats blasted the GOP for rushing ahead with a major healthcare overhaul without waiting for the CBO’s full analysis. “The rules are there are no rules. It’s Lord of the Flies day here in the House of Representatives. They want to make us vote on a bill that no one’s even read. No one can find it. Anything goes,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said.

Military Military: The Intel Obsession, jealousy: Navy SEAL embroiled in rape court-martial Navy SEAL insignia Navy SEAL insignia ( ) Navy SEAL insignia ( ) Jeanette SteeleContact Reporter A rare general court-martial taking place this week includes allegations of rape, violence and adultery in a community usually known for its discipline: the Navy SEALs. A married SEAL is on trial in Norfolk, Virginia, on four counts of rape, four counts of sexual assault and single counts of aggravated assault and battery. Other charges are violating a general regulation and making a false official statement. Prosecutors allege that the longtime affair Chief Petty Officer Stephen Varanko III was having with a woman in his unit exploded into jealous violence when the SEAL discovered the woman had dated someone else. Defense attorneys are arguing that the alleged victim was simply gunning for automatic reassignment and for revenge after Varanko refused to leave his wife for her. The two had been carrying on an affair for two years, including during an Afghanistan deployment and prior to the SEAL’s marriage. Welcome to The Intel, a blog examining the hot military news of the day The alleged events occurred in February 2015 while Special Reconnaissance Team Two was in Fort Knox, Kentucky, for training, according to coverage of the trial by the Virginian-Pilot and Navy Times. The woman is an analyst who worked with the Little Creek, Virginia-based SEAL unit. She hasn’t been named, as general media policy is not to identify people who report sexual assault. The group was returning to their hotel from a Kentucky strip bar when Varanko used the woman’s cell phone and saw texts revealing a sexual encounter with another man eight months prior. When the pair went to Varanko’s room, he exploded. Prosecutors allege that the SEAL threw the woman against the wall with his hands around her neck, nearly choking her. He also put her in a “submission hold,” with her arm behind her and his knee in her back. The SEAL reportedly admitted to investigators that he “lost a little bit of control,” but he maintained that he didn’t hit the woman. The disagreement ended in two rounds of sex, which is where the rape allegations come in. The woman testified that she only went along with it because she feared further violence. Varanko’s attorneys deny it was rape. The defense touted an estimated 1,000 text exchanges between the two after that night to bolster the SEAL’s side of the story. “I stayed because I still love you,” she texted him the next day. Two weeks later, the woman allegedly sent Varanko a video in which she appeared in uniform and held up cards with a written message professing her love for him. On the other hand, the SEAL texted her afterwards that he was “embarrassed and ashamed” and that what he did “terrified” him. If convicted, Varanko could face a life sentence without parole. The court-martial is not being handled as a jury trial and will be decided by a military judge, Cmdr. Heather Partridge. The proceedings are expect to continue through Friday.

 'What the hell is Nunes doing at the White House?': Former top CIA, NSA lawyer stunned House Intel chair shared info with Trump Allan Smith Mar. 23, 2017, 8:13 PM 33,078 facebook linkedin twitter email print Rep. Devin Nunes. Getty Images A former top lawyer for the CIA, the National Security Agency, and the Department of Defense expressed shock in an interview with Business Insider that the House Intelligence Committee chair, Devin Nunes, went to the White House to share information with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, even as Nunes' panel had been looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Robert Deitz, who held those posts in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and of President George W. Bush, said Nunes' Wednesday trip to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was "unbelievable." "What the hell is Nunes doing at the White House?" Deitz, who is now a professor at George Mason University, said. "The idea that a person working in a committee that down the road at least is supposed to be looking into Russian influence in US elections ... would go racing to the White House — and to do what? Get his tummy rubbed? I just find unbelievable. "Moreover, he could well be disclosing information that is of course highly classified," he continued. "Of course, not that Mr. Trump doesn't have the proper classifications — by definition he does — but, you just don't pass that information on willy-nilly. So I don't get that scene at all." Nunes, a California Republican, caused a stir Wednesday when he told a press gathering that the intelligence community had "incidentally collected" information on the Trump transition team during the transition period. He went on to say the collection occurred on "numerous occasions" and was not related to the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. "Details about US persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting," Nunes said, adding that the information he spoke of was collected legally, in his view, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Trump administration was not aware of what he was describing to the press at that point, so he then went to the White House immediately following the press briefing to discuss his findings, a situation that many observers found odd. A member of Trump's transition team, Nunes finds himself leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's effort to manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. It was during a hearing Monday in front of Nunes' committee that FBI Director James Comey confirmed that the bureau had been investigating potential ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government since late July. Comey also said the FBI and the Department of Justice could provide no evidence to back up Trump's explosive Twitter claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped him, an item that Nunes insisted Wednesday his new revelations did not prove. President Donald Trump. Evan Vucci/AP Images Following his meeting at the White House, Nunes told the press he found nothing wrong with briefing the president on information that could be related to an ongoing investigation into members of his administration and campaign team. "Because what I saw had nothing to do with Russia and the Russian investigation," Nunes said. "It has everything to do with possible surveillance activities, and the president needs to know these intelligence reports are out there, and I have a duty to tell him that." Nunes hadn't shared the information he was discussing publicly and with the White House with his fellow intelligence committee members. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, blasted him in a press conference early Wednesday evening, saying Nunes' moves compromised the independence of the investigation the committee was attempting to conduct. Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat on the committee, told CNN on Thursday that Nunes apologized at their Thursday meeting. Speaking with reporters Thursday, Nunes said it was a "judgment call" to deliver the information to the president. He later said he would not do things differently if he had a second chance. "There was a lot going on yesterday," he said. "It was a judgment call on my part. Sometimes you make the right decision, and sometimes you make the wrong decision, but you’ve got to stick by the decisions you make." Late Thursday, in a reversal, a spokesman for Nunes told ABC News that the congressman did not know "for sure" whether Trump or members of the transition team were caught up in the communications he cited Wednesday. Deitz told Business Insider that he didn't think the episode would lead to something such as Nunes having his intelligence clearances revoked. But, as Deitz put it, intelligence officials may be "less than wholly forthcoming about information" they share. "Once Mr. Nunes does something like this, people in the intel community might be reluctant to, for example, share the true crown jewels," he said. Vindication? Following his meeting with Nunes, Trump told reporters he felt "somewhat" vindicated by Nunes' revelations, as the president has spent the better part of March defending his earlier claim that Trump Tower was wiretapped by Obama. He's backed away from the claim slightly, saying he meant wiretapping to mean more broad surveillance, but he has not distanced himself from the original claim, which was rebuked by many across the political spectrum. Deitz said the revelation was "far from a vindication." "In some ways it's almost the reverse," he said. "That is, if, and let's assume for a moment that someone getting [intelligence] collection from overseas [and] is getting a Trump person on the other line. It can be totally innocent. On the other hand, it could completely validate the notion that Trump people are talking to Russians." "So I don't get the partial vindication argument at all," he said. "To me, it raises more questions than it resolves." He added that "nobody" had claimed that members of Trump's circle hadn't been captured on such surveillance before, naming Michael Flynn, the ousted national security adviser, specifically. "And so why it's somehow 'good news' for Mr. Trump that some of his people have been captured in collection," he said. "I don't see how that is ever good news."

In case of abuse, click here to report. A few years ago, the Canadian federal government asked me to explain the dismal performance of venture capital in the country. The 10-year average return of VC funds in Canada for the period 1995-2005 was 2.5%, compared with 20.7% for US funds — the various Canadian government-sponsored funds made even lower returns. In 2007, while almost US$30 billion was invested in US ventures, only about $2 billion was invested in Canada (bearing in mind Canada’s population of almost 33 million then, about 1/10th of the US). Not much changed during the last 10 years. Median Canadian VC has delivered a 4% internal rate-of-return (IRR) versus comparable US returns of 12%, and the five-year numbers are 11% and 20%, respectively. This despite the mantra from all Canadian governments, federal and provincial — “innovations, innovations.”  The word appears 212 times in the 280-page federal budget tabled this week by the Trudeau Liberals, with generous taxpayer-funded spending promised in the hope that something might stick. How come not much ever did? The answer is not rocket science. First, you need a culture of disciplined, wide-ranging debate, and it’s better to start early – and certainly not prohibit it at universities. Innovation is a departure from customary ways of thinking and of doing things. Its execution is a matter of trial and error. But how do you recognize that you should go ahead with an idea and when to stop digging a deeper hole? This is best decided through debate on the merits of an idea as trials continue and debates with suppliers and potential suppliers about funding. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Asian countries can learn from repeated mistakes made by Canadian governments and institutions: drastically cutting the number of diverse sources of capital within Canada and with ill-conceived tax policies (capital gains taxes and high income taxes in particular), that reduce incentives to invest in Canadian startups. Avoid these mistakes and the countries will thrive. By taxing incomes heavily, Canadian governments helped lower the experimentation necessary for startups. High taxes prevent people from accumulating enough savings from discretionary income to become “angel investors” to whom budding entrepreneurs could turn for funding. The National Angel Capital Organization reported that in 2015 its members invested Cdn$134 million, whereas in the US the number was $24 billion. No government officials, research centers and certainly not academics can stand in for “business angels,” private investors with experience in corporate settings, as entrepreneurs, or both. Along with capital, they offer the advantages of “smart money.” They are capable of vetting and improving ideas and plans entrepreneurs put forward. They evaluate the entrepreneurs: Do they listen to advice? How disciplined and determined are they? Can they delegate so that the business can grow?When “angels” take an interest in entrepreneurs, they bring their networks of contacts as well as their managerial, operating, and mentoring experience to the table on a daily basis — something bureaucrats and the vast majority of academics do not have. Canada’s misguided tax policies prevent the emergence of a critical mass of “angels,” preventing the diverse sources of capital for startups. This doesn’t necessarily mean that brilliant young Canadian won’t become entrepreneurs. It only means they will likely move to the United States to realize their dreams. And with fewer startups and diminished financial incentives there are fewer opportunities to use venture capital and expand. Indeed, total VC investment in Canada in 2016 was $1.7 billion, the same as 2015. To put VC numbers in context: Israel, with roughly the same population as Quebec (just over eight million), saw VCs invest $4.43 billion in startups in 2015. Taxes, regulations and Canadian federal and provincial governments’ misunderstanding of the “democratization of capital” and what roles governments could — and should — play are part of the problem. The other part is the shallow debate in the Canadian educational system — universities in particular — a consequence of decades of throwing money at schools and universities while these institutions were giving up on proper selection of students and, in universities, faculty as well. Jonathan Medved, one of Israel’s main VC investors in high-tech, noted that in his meetings in “India, China, [and] Japan, Israel is a top brand — BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israeli handling of the Palestinian dispute) is important on college campuses, NGOs and some part of the church, but not in business … I was sitting with one of [the] top US hedge-fund managers and I asked him about BDS. His response? “Anyone with a brain cannot support BDS. If you do: get off Google, Facebook, your laptop, anything with an Intel chip.” Intel, Cisco, Apple, Facebook, Google, Paypal and Microsoft operations in Israel are major contributors to their companies’ product lines. The dean of the faculty I am associated with recently told faculty members they “are free to criticize the university and publish your articles in any media outlet as you see fit. I am also free not to publicize it.” It appears that while business-school faculty is encouraged to do critical analyses of Wall Street, Main Street, the rest of academia (and this particular dean) are happy to publicize them. But this dean will not publicize research critical of universities — not something you would expect from the dean of a business school in a commercial society. Her statements stand in sharp contrast to a former principal of McGill University, David Johnston, now governor-general of Canada, who is aware of the flaws in academia and universities concerning debates in particular. He has encouraged research on academic decline and has widely endorsed articles and debates on the subject both within and outside McGill. But that was 15 years ago. True, the current McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, issued a memorandum on Thursday emphasizing that disciplined debate is “the foundational principle of McGill University, as enunciated in our …statement of academic freedom.” The statement declares that: “The scholarly members of the university have the freedom to pursue research and artistic creation and to disseminate their results, without being constrained by political or disciplinary orthodoxies, monetary incentives or punitive measures as a result of their academic pursuits. They may exercise this freedom in the service of both the university and the wider society.” But as her own communication attests, the faculty dean appears never to have read or thought about the stated principle as it applies to business education in particular. What do “foundational principles” imply? And if those principles are flouted what will Fortier and the McGill board of governors do? Doing nothing or mouthing platitudes signals a further decline in much-needed debates, with repercussions far beyond already weakened universities.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 March 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry. ASML’s guiding principle is continuing Moore’s Law towards ever smaller, cheaper, more powerful and energy-efficient semiconductors. This results in increasingly powerful and capable electronics that enable the world to progress within a multitude of fields, including healthcare, technology, communications, energy, mobility, and entertainment.

DeepScale raises $3 million for perception AI to make self-driving cars safe Posted Mar 21, 2017 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Pit.ai puts a financial twist on reinforcement learning to outperform hedge funds According to the World Health Organization, human error causes more than 90 percent of traffic accidents across the globe. Some 1.25 million people die in crashes, and 20 to 50 million people are injured each year. Automakers are scrambling to develop cars with advanced driver-assistance systems that are so good they’re “crash-proof,” or fully autonomous vehicles, each safer than the next. But the automakers are somewhat limited by the computational resources onboard their vehicles. Now, a startup out of Mountain View, Calif. called DeepScale has raised $3 million in seed funding to help automakers use industry-standard low-wattage processors to power more accurate perception. Alongside sensors, mapping, planning and control systems, perception, (sometimes referenced as “computer vision”) enables vehicles to make sense of what’s going on around them in real time. DeepScale co-founder and CEO Forrest Iandola previously attained a doctorate at UC Berkeley working on deep neural nets and computer vision systems. His work there focused on, among other things, making AI systems learn to do something new in just a day instead of months of training. Iandola said, “Lots of deep neural network software out there is tied to processors like Nvidia’s. They make really good libraries for running neural net stuff quickly. We built our own libraries for fast, deep neural net computation on a variety of affordable processors, Qualcomm, Intel and the like. We’re using a lot of what we learned in academia on the commercial side now.” While he did not have permission to name the companies, he said DeepScale is already working on pilot projects with some major original equipment manufacturers in automotive. With the market for automotive systems, data and services forecast to reach $70 billion in revenue annually by 2030, DeepScale is focused strictly on automotive for now. But, the CEO said, the technology could be adapted over the long term for use with unmanned drones or robotics, which also need to accurately understand and respond to changes in their environment. DeepScale’s seed investors included: Bessemer Venture Partners, Greylock, Auto Tech Ventures, Andy Bechtolsheim (who was the first investor in Google) and Jerry Yang. A partner with BVP, Alex Ferrara, said, “Cars are moving from systems today where they have a large number of small computers, called ECUs, in them, to working with smaller more powerful computers for perception. But you have all these little sensors, lidar, radar, ultrasound, and each one brings its own view of the world. There’s a really interesting opportunity here for DeepScale to pull everything together and use info from all those sensors to make computer vision accurate and efficient.” DeepScale is competing for a share of this burgeoning market versus some 800-lb. gorillas in automotive tech, like Mobileye, now owned by Intel, or Bosch, but also other funded startups like Comma.ai, Argo and Drive.ai, which are trying another approach of building their own, fully autonomous vehicles or retrofit systems.

This week, former Trump advisers Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Carter Page all informed the committee of their desires to testify to the committee. All three have been identified in news reports as subjects of an FBI investigation of potential Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government. In testimony to the committee earlier this week, FBI director James Comey confirmed an ongoing investigation but did not name the Trump associates who are targeted in the probe. The trio deny colluding with the Kremlin, but news reports have showed a variety of connections between the aides and people who work for the Russian government. Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, has worked as a consultant for a former Ukrainian president allied with Vladimir Putin. Page, who served as a junior policy adviser on the campaign, has business interests in Russia and gave a speech at a Moscow university in July, while he was still with the campaign. Both are named in a dossier compiled by a retired British spy alleging coordination between the campaign and Russian government operatives. The dossier is largely uncorroborated and several inconsistencies in the document have been discovered. Nevertheless, Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, including the ranking Democrat, California Rep. Adam Schiff, cited it as fact during Monday’s hearing. Paul Manafort, August 17, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri Stone has claimed that he communicated through an intermediary with WikiLeaks, the group that released Democrats’ emails during the campaign. U.S. government officials believe that the emails were hacked by the Russian government. But the advisers appear eager to explain what they claim is a massive witch hunt. In a letter to the Intelligence Committee shared exclusively with The Daily Caller, Page said he “would eagerly welcome the chance to speak with the Committee” in order to “set the record straight” regarding allegations made against him. Manafort reached out to the Intelligence Committee through his attorneys on Thursday, chairman Devin Nunes announced on Friday. (RELATED: Trump Campaign Advisers Offer To Testify To House Intel Committee) Stone released an open letter to reporters earlier this week saying that he is eager to talk to Congress. “I am anxious to rebut allegations that I had any improper or nefarious contact with any agent of the Russia State based on facts, not misleading and salacious headlines,” wrote Stone, who is a longtime friend of both Trump and Manafort and who was an informal adviser during much of the campaign. (RELATED: Trump Adviser Roger Stone Wants To Testify To Congress And ‘Spank’ Democrats ‘Like Children) Contrast that with Clinton aides who resisted cooperating with Congress and federal investigators looking into the potential mishandling of classified information on Clinton’s server. Bryan Pagliano, the Clinton State Department staffer who set up the secret email server, infamously ignored a subpoena from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to appear at a hearing in September. Former State Department staffer Bryan Pagliano arrives for a closed hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington Sept. 10, 2015. (REUTERS/Gary Cameron) Pagliano also invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to several other congressional requests to testify. He pled the Fifth during a Sept. 10, 2015 meeting with the House Select Committee on Benghazi. He only spoke to the FBI after receiving limited immunity from prosecution in the case. Paul Combetta was another person on Clinton’s payroll who refused to talk to Congress. Combetta worked for Platte River Networks, the IT company that managed Clinton’s server after she left the State Department. The technician lied to the FBI during at least one of his interviews, but he nonetheless received immunity from the bureau to discuss his work on Clinton’s server. (RELATED: Paul Combetta Pleads The Fifth) Combetta appeared at the Oversight Committee hearing in September but repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment rights. Platte River Networks technician Paul Combetta appears at a House Oversight Committee hearing, Sept. 13, 2016. (Youtube screen grab) Other Clinton aides stymied other investigations. Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, Clinton’s two closest aides at the State Department, did testify in a closed setting in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi. But the pair refused to talk to the State Department’s inspector general ahead of a report it issued on Clinton’s server in May. They also may have given inconsistent statements to the FBI about when they became aware that Clinton was using a private email server to store her work related emails. (RELATED: Clinton Aides Said They Didn’t Know About Email Server, But Emails Suggest Otherwise) Mills and another Clinton aide, Heather Samuelson, received immunity in exchange for their full cooperation with investigators. As for the Trump advisers, the Intelligence Committee has not set a date for when their testimony will be heard. A representative for Manafort did not say whether he would speak in a public setting or in private. Nunes said the decision is up to him.

NCAA March Madness Live app, managed by Turner Sports in partnership with CBS Sports and the NCAA, generated an all-time record 69.1mln live streams through the first Sunday of the tournament, an increase of +24% over last year. “We aren’t seeing any real cannibalization of linear because of digital or vice versa. We see people consume more because this great tournament is everywhere a fan is,” said Hania Poole, vp, gm NCAA Digital at Turner Sports. Latency is always important with online streaming, but it’s even more critical with sports. When Poole stepped into her position four years ago, she estimates that video was behind a minute to a minute and a half on some devices. “Now I feel like it’s shortened to about 30 seconds. Maybe 45,” she said. TV has set the benchmark for streaming, Akamai CTO John Bishop told CFX. “There’s always been that 45-60 second behind line. That’s just been kind of the nature of the Internet. When you look at why, it’s largely because the pieces were fragile and immature in the supply chain. Every little element that was touching a lot of the bits created its own little safety net—and safety net in our world means buffer,” Bishop said, adding that as Akamai has expanded its investments the system has become more cohesive. “We put a line in the sand a few years ago to say let’s cut the gap from 45 seconds down to sub 20. Last year was the first year we started seeing some line of sight that it was possible. I think this year we’re getting better than television on the OTT side. In some cases, we can get a signal faster to you now than a cable TV infrastructure will.” That’s always been the goal—to get to the point where there’s parity between linear and digital. Bishop believes streaming has achieved that already in resolution and audience size. “It’s no longer a scary proposition to see millions of people concurrently come in to join a basketball game or an episodic or a debate,” he said. And on resolution, the Internet is starting to surpass TV with tech such as UHD, VR and 4K. Indeed, the March Madness app will offer enhanced VR games powered by Intel. At CSG, one big focus with its Ascendon platform is monetization of digital services. With that monetization goal in mind, CSG is keen to improve delivery of sports content as it moves into more true OTT scenarios, said Sean Casey, director of product management at CSG. ESPN is among its clients, with CSG working with the programmer on both premium sports content and premium media to be delivered directly to the consumer. Casey agrees with Bishop that delivery is getting even better, helped in part by adaptive bit rates. “It tests the user’s network speed and delivers a stream that’s best suited for that speed,” he said. “Instead of trying to deliver a big screen experience on your iPhone, it’s going to see if you’re in a poor coverage area and provide a lower quality experience but one that doesn’t buffer.” Back to March Madness, this year marks the first that Turner has used iStreamPlanet as the streaming provider for the series—a tip to Turner’ acquiring a majority stake in the company in 2015. It previously had used MLBAM. In Turner’s command center, Poole and team monitor how video is performing with the help of video optimization service Conviva, looking at how viewers are experiencing the video, network quality, what bitrate is being served, etc. Anecdotally, she’s taken note of fans posting photos on social media of them watching a game one big screen with a line of devices standing next to it showing the NCAA March Madness Live app. While most streaming is focused on mobile, it’s worth noting that March Madness is a different animal with so much viewing taking place during work hours. With that in mind, Turner Sports updated the desktop viewing experience this year. “We completely redesigned it and took it out of flash and made it into an HTML5 player. I think we’re one of the first live sports platforms to do that,” Poole said. “We made it responsive so it sizes to whatever setting your browser is on, and it has a shot chart that you can expand and some other cool features.” Turner also expanded this year to 15 platforms for the tourney from 13, adding a skill on Amazon’s Alexa (its first foray into voice) and joining its first game console through Xbox. share this article previous storyMobile Drives Ad-Supported VOD Viewing next storyEvolving to Distributed Access Architectures Featured Stories <   > Featured Stories Technology Arris Investor Day Technology WEC Wrap-Up Technology Arris at Retail Technology Road to Better Performance Technology Cablefax: The Magazine Multiscreen Issue Technology Survey Says Education May Curb Piracy Related Stories Technology Arris Investor Day Technology Evolving to Distributed Access Architectures Technology Streaming Sports: All Signs Point… The Latest Technology Trump’s Day: Before Healthcare Bill… Technology Netflix Dominates Original SVOD Content Technology Snapchat Surgery Technology Privacy Repeal: Senate Gets Ball… Technology Celebrating Cablefax’s Top Lawyers Technology Evolving to Distributed Access Architectures Technology Streaming Sports: All Signs Point… Technology 4K Baseball Get cable industry news in your inbox, daily!

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Former national security advisor Mike Flynn discussed how to move a Turkish dissident from his residence in the United States while bypassing the extradition process, The Wall Street Journal reports. In September, Flynn, a retired Army Lt. General acting as an unpaid advisor to President Donald Trump's campaign, met with high-level members of the Turkish government to talk about Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey have accused of organizing the attempted military coup that took place last summer, according to former CIA Director James Woolsey, who attended the meeting. "It seemed to be naive," Woolsey said of the discussion. "I didn't put a lot of credibility in it. This is a country of legal process and a Constitution, and you don't send out folks to haul somebody overseas." Woolsey added that the discussions were entirely hypothetical, and that he would have objected if they had talked specific plans for removing Gulen from his home. Though Woolsey describes the idea discussed as "a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away." The former director claims to have not said anything during this discussion, and that some in attendance advised against any attempt to remove Gulen that would violate U.S. law. Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told the Post that "at no time did Gen. Flynn discuss any illegal actions, nonjudicial physical removal or any other such activities." He also said that "Gen. Flynn did discuss the Flynn Intel Group's work for Inovo that included gathering information that could lead to a legal case against Mr. Gulen." The Turkish Embassy said in a statement to the Journal that although the meeting did take place, they could not confirm the discussion. "We are not in a position to comment on any engagement between a U.S. consultancy firm and a private company owned by a Turkish businessman," the statement read.

Feinstein’s Anti-Corporation Rhetoric Doesn’t Square with Her Corporate Campaign Donations Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Austin Yack March 24, 2017 4:31 PM @AustinYack During this week’s Supreme Court nomination hearings, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, portrayed Judge Neil Gorsuch as a biased judge who has consistently ruled in favor of corporations. If Gorsuch is not for the “little guy,” Feinstein’s line of questioning went, how could he be an acceptable nominee for the Supreme Court? Gorsuch vehemently denied having some sort of pro-corporate agenda, explaining that as a judge his “job is to apply and enforce the law,” regardless of who the parties are in a particular case. Solely ruling based on the law and facts in question — and not allowing his personal beliefs to influence his ruling — sometimes results in outcomes that he, too, does not necessarily like. This answer wasn’t sufficient for Feinstein. She continued to question whether he would be a justice for “the big corporations” throughout Gorsuch’s nomination hearing. Feinstein’s implication was that she, by contrast, is a true champion of the “little guy,” who stands opposed to the interests of large corporations. But a glance at her campaign donations from 2011 to 2016 suggests otherwise, as she has accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate employees and lobbyists. Feinstein’s campaign committee has accepted large campaign donations from employees of and lobbyists representing Edison International, PG&E, Wells Fargo, Time Warner, DISH Network, Intel, Sony, Oracle, Comcast, Chevron, and JPMorgan Chase & Co, to name a few. Edison International employees, for example, donated almost $100,000 to Feinstein’s campaign committee from 2011 to 2016; its lobbyists donated $18,000. Over at General Dynamics, a global defense and aerospace company, its lobbyists donated a total of $33,750, while its company’s employees donated $28,750. It is perfectly permissible for Feinstein to accept campaign donations from individuals representing big corporations.

To qualify for EntrePass, start- ups, if registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, must be less than six months old on the date that they apply. Mr Sekar said: "Our company was registered as soon as we had the idea and we chose to register it here. We knew it would be here." The trouble is that his co-founder, United States citizen Radhakrishna Hiremane, has found it difficult to get a long-term visa and is thus US-based. The pair started SeeChat in November 2014, when Mr Hiremane was still working with Intel here. "Having him back here would be very crucial for us," said Mr Sekar. "So changing that legacy criterion to one that defines a start-up by its funding stage might be better." Nevertheless, the lengthening of the EntrePass validity period from one year to two after the first renewal is "perfect", Mr Sekar. said "Typically, a software business will take two years to mature - all the research and development will make one year very short." SeeChat helps directories like Yellow Pages start digital directories with chat and payment functions.

Wilson - 03/24/17 04:12 PM EDT 1,031   © Getty Images Michael Flynn, President Trump’s former national security adviser, reportedly discussed ways to take a man wanted by the Turkish government out of the United States without going through the legal extradition process, according to The Wall Street Journal. The conversation, which took place during the presidential race while Flynn was serving as an unpaid adviser to Trump, centered around Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen.  The Turkish government has long wanted to take custody of Gulen, 75, who has been exiled in Pennsylvania since 1999.  ADVERTISEMENT Among other things, Turkey blames him for orchestrating the deadly and unsuccessful military coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last year. The country has pressed the U.S. for his extradition. The Journal report cites former CIA Director James Woolsey, who attended the meeting with Flynn and high-level Turkish officials, and others with details on what happened. Woolsey and the sources said the ideas that were discussed for dealing with Gulen were hypothetical. However, one plan was “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away,” Woolsey told the Journal. He said he had walked into the middle of the conversation and reportedly “found the topic startling and the actions being discussed possibly illegal.” A spokesman for Flynn on Friday pushed back on the accusation and the Wall Street Journal report. "The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn, or anyone else in attendance, discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false. No such discussion occurred. Nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend, or afterwards," Price Floyd said in an emailed statement to The Hill. Earlier this month, Flynn filed paperwork with the Justice Department retroactively disclosing work he did last year that may have benefited the government of Turkey. From August through mid-November, the Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 from a Dutch consulting firm run by a Turkish businessman, according to the disclosure forms. Flynn shut down his firm in November. The filings, signed by Flynn himself, say the three-month contract included conducting “investigative research” and retaining “an experienced filming and production crew in order to develop a short film piece on the results of its investigation, and a public affairs firm to utilize for public affairs as needed.” The documentary, which focused on Gulen, was reportedly never finished or distributed.  On Sept. 19, Flynn’s firm met with a “group of government officials from Turkey for the purpose of understanding better the political climate in Turkey at the time, as background for the project.” It was on that day that Flynn made the suggestion to take Gulen to Turkey from the United States, the Journal article says. One of the officials in the meeting was Erdogan’s son-in-law, disclosure forms reveal. In November, Flynn penned an op-ed article in The Hill that called Gulen a “radical Islamist” who “portrays himself as a moderate.” Justice Department forms say the op-ed came from the research he did for the consulting firm. Flynn was fired from his White House post last month for allegedly misleading Vice President Pence and other senior officials about his communications with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. after the presidential election.  Flynn also made contradictory statements to FBI investigators about whether he discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy, according to The Washington Post.

(YouTube) (Newser) – A science phenom known for impressing President Obama with his marshmallow air cannon at the 2012 White House Science Fair faces crushing debt after being diagnosed with a mental illness. Joey Hudy, now 20, is undergoing treatment for schizophrenia at a live-in facility in Tennessee that costs his family $25,000 per month, says AZCentral. According to Hudy’s mother, Julie, their insurance will not pay for the in-center assistance because they believe he can be treated at home. "It’s not that we don’t want him home,” she asserts. “I want that more than anything, but it’s not the right place for him unless we hired a psychologist to come live at our house." Hudy began showing symptoms of his illness while working at an electronics manufacturing company in China. Experiencing paranoia and psychosis, Fox 10 reports he believed that he was being bugged by the Chinese government. After undergoing a mental episode, his parents brought him home earlier this year. After his White House moment shot him to fame, Hudy became Intel’s youngest intern at 16 and a staple and speaker at technology events. "He kind of became the poster boy for young makers and kids making," says Maker Faire cofounder Sherry Huss. This community has begun rallying around its young star after Hudy’s family set up a GoFundMe page to help offset his healthcare costs. At the time of this writing, it had raised more than $36,000.   View 1 image My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   3% Hilarious 10% Intriguing 63% Depressing 4% Brilliant 9% Scary 11% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 47 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 47 comments SS BdM Fuhress 'Savannah Mar 25, 2017 5:29 PM CDT I hope he gets okay as I am an inventor of a thing to hold the door open so the cats can come and go, that's a thing you toss pancakes with, you just put it between the door and frame and it works as long as the cats don't hit the door and it falls out.

It won’t work The federal government is trying to centrally plan innovation. It won’t work The Trudeau government’s 2017 federal budget talks a big game about innovation policy, but it misunderstands how firms actually implement change Mar 24, 2017 Jason Kirby   0 Finance Minister Bill Morneau, left, shakes hands with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Sean Kilpatrick/CP) The very first table you come across when reading the Trudeau government’s 2017 budget isn’t about tax changes, spending measures or the Canadian economy at all. Under a section titled “The case for innovation,” Table 1 compares the five most valuable U.S. companies in the years 2001 and 2016. The biggest companies back then were mostly stuffy giants like General Electric, Exxon, Walmart and Citi—the budget’s authors managed to refrain from labeling them “old economy” companies, but that was clearly the intent. The “new” economy, then, is a digital one, as characterized by the big five in 2016: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. There’s even a footnote to tell you those are technology companies, in case you still don’t get it. Canada’s 2017 federal budget isn’t very innovative about driving innovation The accompanying message: the world is changing fast, but fear not, this government knows “what Canadians need to succeed in an evolving economy.” From that point on, budget 2017 more or less unfolds as a central planner’s instruction manual For Make Benefit Glorious Digital Economy of Canada. Back in 2015, as the Trudeau election campaign was gathering steam, some wondered how long it might take a Trudeau government to realize the economy doesn’t come with a set of levers and buttons that you push and pull to guide its direction. But the budget released Wednesday was a full-on embrace of 1970s-style industrial policy—a verboten term for decades in federal politics—reflecting just how deeply the Trudeau team believes those levers and buttons exist. In the budget there are bold vows—oddly reminiscent of China’s annual edicts for economic growth rates—about boosting exports by 30% in the next eight years (even though exports have climbed just 2.9% from eight year ago). It calls for clean technology to become a bigger share of GDP. The government even set a target for its “innovation and skills plan” of creating 14,000 new, high-growth companies by 2025. And how shall all this come to pass? Specific industries were name-checked as priorities for government attention: advanced manufacturing, agri-food, clean technology, digital industries, health/bio-sciences and clean resources. Hundreds of millions will go towards creating a “venture capital catalyst initiative.” The government’s many varied and overlapping innovation programs will be streamlined to better assist the busy entrepreneur on the go. Canada’s cleantech industry is bigger than you think Meanwhile Ottawa’s economy planners want to guide the creation of “innovation superclusters” across Canada—areas with a high concentration of businesses focused on particular industries (see the list of Chosen Ones above), situated alongside universities and overflowing with talent. Think Silicon Valley, the go-to region that every government the world over, including this one, believes can be replicated at home, if they just put their minds and enough resources to it. It’s easy to draw a line between this strategy and the lads and lasses at McKinsey & Co. The global consulting giant makes its living telling other companies, governments and organizations how to be more innovative, and right now McKinsey is run by a Canadian, Dominic Barton, who also heads Ottawa’s Advisory Council on Economic Growth. Indeed, from the budget’s highly-produced cover—complete with a suitably diverse array of Canadians and overlaid with hand-drawn illustrations—down to the innovation jargon slathered throughout its pages, the budget could easily be mistaken for one of the firm’s high-priced consulting reports. The word “superclusters,” for one, might almost require a trademark symbol beside each mention. In last year’s budget the concept of targeting specific regions to encourage innovation was introduced, but back then they were simply referred to as  “clusters.” But McKinsey consultants have spanned the globe preaching the gospel of superclusters with great urgency. Just this past December McKinsey produced a primer—no doubt required reading at Innovation Canada—on how to spur the region between Toronto and Waterloo to “global technology supercluster status” like, you guessed it, Silicon Valley, but also Berlin and Tel Aviv. (Budget 2017 uses the same cities as examples.) “The opportunity is there,” the McKinsey report notes, “but the window could be closing quickly.” Act fast, this great offer won’t last long. The previous Harper government shares some responsibility for what the Trudeau government is embarking on now. It had already played footsie with industrial policy. It perfected the art of doling out taxpayer money to favoured sectors, and used the language of levers and buttons in its own budgets. The Trudeau government simply picked up the thread and put some serious (borrowed) coin behind it, with its big-innovation, big-infrastructure plan racking up $145 billion in deficits over six years. Want to build a truly innovative economy? Get a good barista There are any number of reasons why Canadians should be wary of the government’s central planning approach to the economy, aside from the obvious question of whether we can afford it. Given that McKinsey’s fingerprints are all over the budget, it’s worth remembering that when it comes to dishing out advice, the firm has a less-than-stellar track record. A few years ago U.S. investor and highly-regarded author Barry Ritholtz summarized the multitude of instances where McKinsey strategists were embroiled in financial messes around the globe—the firm was once described as “the company that built Enron” and its advice has been connected to numerous corporate failures. “Indeed,” Ritholz wrote, “wherever there has been a financial disaster in the world, if you look around, somewhere in the background, McKinsey & Co. is nearby.” Another problem is the challenge governments have always faced when they try to select winning companies and industries while avoiding losers. It’s incredibly difficult and there’s an overwhelming likelihood that you’re going to get it wrong. For instance, there’s a section in the budget about creating a supercluster around artificial intelligence, one of the brightest and shiniest sectors going at the moment. Yet lines from the budget like this, “Activity needs to remain in Canada to harness the benefits from artificial intelligence,” embody the problem with the industrial policy approach. You can deploy the force of government to try to build a domestic industry that develops the raw tools of artificial intelligence, but there’s no certainty of success, and in doing so you risk squeezing out entrepreneurs and companies who might otherwise have imported those tools from abroad and used them in ways you can’t now even imagine. That table about company market caps referred to above is another case in point. You’ll note the government chose 2001, after the giant tech bubble of the late 1990s had imploded, as its starting point, thereby overlooking a period when the biggest companies in the land were all tech firms. Go back just one or two years earlier and Cisco and Intel would have made the cut, too, yet both technology companies are now worth half of what they were back then. It’s a reminder that many of yesterday’s winners are today’s losers, just as many of today’s winners will turn out to be losers tomorrow. But we don’t know—can’t know—which they will be, and trying to stage-manage the economy as if you do is dangerous. Jim Balsillie on how Canada is doing innovation wrong—and how to fix it For all the talk of fostering superclusters and creating new companies, it should be noted that there’s very little in the way of new financial resources to back that up in the budget—despite the big deficits. For instance, the government says it will invest $950 million over five years to support “superclusters,” but the vast bulk of that money is repurposed from last year’s budget, with the remainder scraped from “public transit and green infrastructure” funding allocated in the 2016 fall economic statement. In that way, what mattered more on Wednesday than the dollar figures in the budget, was the government’s unabashed commitment to trying to direct the economy from above—and the absolutism with which it believes these policies will pay off. At least, that’s the plan.

Still short on votes for the American Health Care Act, the White House and GOP leadership issued an ultimatum Thursday evening to those who have yet to support the bill, informing them that the time for negotiating is over: they can either vote for the first GOP repeal measure which stands a prayer of passing, or allow the Affordable Care Act to remain in law for the foreseeable future. President Trump is no healthcare ideologue—in a 2000 book he called for universal coverage—so he is more comfortable than House leadership with moving onto the next agenda item and saying "I tried" on Obamacare. If the vote passes, it'll undoubtedly be a significant victory for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Trump, setting the stage for a continued partnership on the President's agenda. The big question is what happens if today's vote fails. At very least it will strain the alliance of convenience between Ryan and Trump. The pair disagree on a host of policy issues and couldn't be more different stylistically. What's united them has been a common goal, but absent that things could devolve fast. Trump, who passed on a lot of the work of legislating to Ryan, ultimately came to embrace the bill, lobbying various constituencies to try to get it across the finish line. He will certainly own some of the blame for failing to get it done, but he won't go it alone. Trump will have to choose whether to tie failure to Ryan, or to the House Freedom Caucus, the conservative faction which leadership and the White House have called "absolutists" who "can't get to yes" and "moved the goalposts" on the negotiations. Trump took a swing at the Freedom Caucus on Twitter Friday morning, which may be an indication of where he'll go. The Russia fallout continues for Paul Manafort, who has agreed to testify before the House Intelligence Committee. Trump gets a new tech whisperer.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Features, Release Date And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Mar 26 2017, 1:32am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple has updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. There is not a single evidence that this is going to happen, but the anticipation grows. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! Apple is under fire for neglecting the desktop since a while now. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. 3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac ideally would have powerful graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Apple just unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The iPhone Plus Red went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. Read the latest Apple News.

Here is what incidental really means, the secret interpretation – if they are after drug dealers, money launderers, criminals of any kind, international or even domestic, or terrorists and things like that – and they know they are in the communications line – they have the right to take the entire line, all of the lines, and store it and keep it there and mine it and look at it for as long as they want.” What this means, Binney explained, is that fundamentally they can collect anything and everything in the fiber network in the United States. He mentioned that people in the NSA have frequently used this resource to look in on their lovers to see if they are cheating despite it being unconstitutional and illegal, and that this is how the information leaked about General Michael Flynn was obtained. Binney also stated that if this program went to court, it would be ruled unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. “It’s obviously unconstitutional to collect emails and listen to and transcribe phone calls of US citizens without a warrant. That’s on everybody, not just President Trump,” Binney said of the program. “That’s how they had General Flynn, that is how they have got material on many different people.” © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite House Intel Chair: Some Surveillance of Trump Team 'Appears Inappropriate'He explained that since the NSA data cannot be used in a court of law, they will find what they need, then find other legal means to make their case, calling it a “subversion of our constitutional process.” The most recent NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, has also expressed a similar sentiment about Trump’s wiretap allegations. “If Donald Trump wants to take this seriously, he needs to fix the problem that everyone in America's communications are being collected right now, without a warrant, and they're going into the bucket, and they're protected by very lax internal policy regulations, and this simply is not enough,” Snowden said earlier this month through a livestream at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas. “The problem is not, 'Oh, you know, poor Donald Trump.' You're the president. You should be asking questions about, 'Why was this possible in the first place,' and, 'Why haven't I fixed it?'" ...

Greg Abbott and Reed Cordish Friday, March 24, 2017, outside the White House after meeting with President Donald Trump. Rutledge became the latest business leader to use an Oval Office visit to tout previously announced job creation. (Alex Wong/Getty Images ) Print Email Los Angeles Times By Los Angeles Times The Oregonian on March 24, 2017 at 11:01 AM, updated March 24, 2017 at 11:30 AM comments WASHINGTON -- The chief executive of Charter Communications committed in a meeting with President Trump on Friday to invest $25 billion on broadband infrastructure while joining a trend of business leaders touting previously announced job creation at the White House. In the case of Charter, Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge said he expected to hire 20,000 new U.S. employees over the next four years. The company had made the hiring promise in 2015 when it was purchasing Time Warner Cable. The new development was the time period in which it will occur. Nevertheless, Trump indicated the job creation was triggered by his election. "We are really in the process of announcements and you're going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs and companies and everything coming back into our country," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, flanked by Rutledge and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. "They're coming in far faster than even I had projected." Charter is the nation's second-largest cable-TV and Internet provider. It serves roughly three-dozen Oregon communities, including Roseburg, The Dalles, Bandon, Cottage Grove, Lincoln City, Astoria, Cannon Beach, Medford and Ashland. The large investment in broadband infrastructure was a new commitment from Charter. Rutledge signaled that it was made because of the policies of Trump and congressional Republicans, who have promised to cut corporate taxes and reduce regulations. Rutledge said the company was "excited about the opportunity in the right regulatory climate and the right tax climate to make major infrastructure investments." A good portion of that investment could be in California because of the company's large presence there. Rutledge also renewed an earlier promise to bring all of Time Warner Cable's call centers back to the U.S. About 50 percent of Time Warner Cable's customer service calls are handled offshore, he said. Intel disputes Trump role on Arizona factory Trump said that Charter's announcement followed companies such as Exxon Mobil and Intel Crop. that had "recently announced billions in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory." But, like Charter, some of those companies were simply renewing or amplifying earlier commitments. For example, Exxon Mobil's promise to invest $20 billion and create more than 45,000 jobs in the Gulf Coast region was part of an initiative that began in 2013. - Los Angeles Times  Video of the Day Nominate your company for a Top Workplaces award Most Read Business Briefing The top business headlines of the day delivered to your inbox.

It drew criticism for a lack of women in the room. A lack of women in a photo of negotiations over the Republicans' health care bill that was tweeted out by the vice president is drawing criticism from Democrats and other critics concerned over the bill's repercussions for women's health. The photo shows Vice President Mike Pence at the center of a conference table during negotiations with the House Freedom Caucus. About two dozen men can be seen in the photo and not a single woman. Now What? Options for Consumers as Health Law Drama Fades Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray drew attention to the absence of women in the room by retweeting the photo and sarcastically adding, "A rare look inside the GOP's women's health caucus." A repeal of a maternity care requirement is among the concessions the Freedom Caucus is demanding in exchange for support of the bill. Trump Urges Bipartisan Effort on 'A Better Bill' Following the withdrawal of a Republican-backed health care bill, President Donald Trump on Friday urged Republican and Democratic lawmakers to work together on "a better bill."(Published Friday, March 24, 2017) There were more sources of outrage for supporters of government funding for women's health care on Thursday. A Republican senator had to apologize for a comment about the possibility the bill would ease federal requirements on coverage of basic services like mammograms. Arrests, Clashes at 'Make America Great Again' Rallies "I wouldn't want to lose my mammograms," said Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas when asked about the bill's potential changes in an interview with a reporter for Talking Points Memo. He later tweeted an apology: "I deeply regret my comments on a very important topic. Mammograms are essential to women's health & I never intended to indicate otherwise." Ryan: 'This is a Disappointing Day for Us'  House Speaker Paul Ryan speaks on Friday, March 24, 2017, after Republican pulled the health care bill meant to replace the Affordable Care Act.(Published Friday, March 24, 2017) The comment had drawn flak on social media, as did another on women's health issues by White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

Jim Morrill jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com Bill Mitchell Jim Morrill 1 of 2 i By Jim Morrill jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Ever since riding that golden escalator into the presidential race, Donald Trump has found few fans like Bill Mitchell. The silver-haired Charlotte businessman could be Trump’s most loyal defender, an online avatar with more than 205,000 Twitter followers, including the president’s sons and adviser Kellyanne Conway. Trump himself has taken notice. He re-tweeted Mitchell again this week. President Trump retweeted me. That&#39;s nice. :-) TWICE.&mdash; Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) March 23, 2017 “President Trump re-tweeted me. That’s nice. :-),” Mitchell tweeted Wednesday. “TWICE.” As Trump made his improbable rise to the White House as a political novice, Mitchell built a national following of his own – 140 characters at a time. The Weekly Standard called him Trump’s “unofficial Twitter mascot.” MIT’s Media Lab ranked his Twitter feed the 26th most influential of the campaign, ahead of Politico and The New York Times. Last month CNN said Mitchell’s “meteoric rise over the last year has been nothing short of remarkable.” From his home in northeast Charlotte, Mitchell, 56, has begun an online radio show that he hopes to syndicate while building an audience like that of the king of conservative talk, Rush Limbaugh. “Right now I’m building a brand for the show,” he says. “‘Yuge.’ We want to be ‘yuge,’ as Trump would say.” The internet and social media might give Mitchell a platform to do that. “This is the new media world,” says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center. “In fundamental ways this phenomenon is like talk radio. Rush Limbaugh did the same thing with talk radio.” Mitchell caters to an increasingly polarized audience. Last November Gallup found that 32 percent of Americans trusted the mainstream media. Among conservative Republicans it was 14 percent. “Trump has kind of paved the way for this in that he’s sowed distrust of the regular media,” says Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University. “So his followers are searching for information they can trust.” Mitchell, a former executive recruiter, is 6-foot-5 with a square jaw and swept-back hair. He’s personable, smooth and self-assured. Last September, when polls and conventional wisdom pointed to a Hillary Clinton victory, he tweeted that Trump had a “100 percent chance of winning.” “People say I’m an optimist. I disagree,” he says. “I just like being right.” “A lot of Trump people conflate being lucky with understanding politics, and he certainly is one of those people,” Republican strategist Rick Wilson told the Observer. Last fall GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson told Buzzfeed that Mitchell fits the “post-fact environment.” “If you don’t like the polls,” she said, “having somebody who tells you they’re wrong makes you feel good.” Since the election, Mitchell’s audience of Trump loyalists has only grown. He wears his own loyalty on a finger in the shape of a gold, Super Bowl-size ring. “President Trump” is engraved on top, with “Deplorables” on one side and “Make America Great Again” on the other. Mitchell calls it his “Trump championship ring.” 5 million Twitter views Mitchell, the son of an Army colonel and a college professor, was born in Germany. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in accounting and finance and an affinity for theater. He lived across the country before moving to Charlotte five years ago with his executive search firm. He’s a lifelong Republican but says Trump was the first presidential candidate he got excited about since Ross Perot in the 1990s. When Trump rode down the Trump Tower escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy, Mitchell counted his Twitter followers by the dozens. As Trump took off, so did he. “How many people spend decades yelling at their TV set and nobody hears them?” he says. “I get on Twitter, I can say pretty much anything and millions of people see it. It’s a great feeling. And it’s a great responsibility.” Mitchell says his tweets are popular because he has the ability to paint visual pictures with words. “Jesus was perfect,” he tweeted last year, “and the media of his day had him crucified.” The tweets that got the president’s attention this week came after the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, said Trump and members of his team may have been under inadvertent surveillance after the election. Trump has claimed to have been wire-tapped by former President Barack Obama, though FBI Director James Comey told Congress this week that “no information” supports that. “EXACTLY AS I SAID - House Intel Chair: We Cannot Rule Out Sr. Obama Officials Were Involved in Trump Surveillance,” Mitchell tweeted and the president re-tweeted. A little later, Trump re-tweeted Mitchell again: “Trump always ends up being right. It’s almost a little freaky.” Trump always ends up being right. It&#39;s almost a little freaky.&mdash; Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) March 22, 2017 Mitchell claims to have around 5 million views a day of his Twitter feed, along with some 50,000 re-tweets. Daniel Levitin, author of “Weaponized Lies,” a book about the “post-truth era,” says Mitchell’s tweets match social media with a receptive audience. “Millions of Americans don’t trust scientists and experts and the elite,” he says. “They’re mad and they’re reaching for something different. They’ve given the establishment a chance and it hasn’t helped them.” Lies or ‘puffery’? Mitchell spares no opportunity to defend Trump. Despite critics who say he’s breaking campaign promises by supporting the House Republican health care plan, Mitchell says it’s part of Trump’s “master plan.” “It doesn’t make sense to us because we’re seeing the individual pieces,” he says. Like Trump, Mitchell dismissed last fall’s “Access Hollywood” tape as “locker room talk.” And he rejects polls such as Monday’s Gallup survey that showed Trump with just 37 percent approval. “It’s a bull---- poll,” he says. Last year he dismissed polls that showed Clinton ahead, saying they were based on faulty assumptions about the electorate. And he takes issue with suggestions that the president lies. “Do human beings lie?” he asks. “Does Trump say things sometimes that I call marketing puffery? You could say that… Trump says outrageous stuff … ..because it gets the press’s attention.” Mitchell isn’t sure where his new career will take him or how long it will last. But he’s enjoying it. “I mean, how many people get an opportunity like this?” he says. “To come from nowhere to becoming a known person. I’m just going to see what happens, go forward and see how it turns out.” Today has been a pretty good day, but you know, they&#39;re all pretty good on the #TrumpTrain. 20 months of winning!&mdash; Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) March 23, 2017 Or, as he tweeted one night this week: “Today has been a pretty good day, but you know, they’re all pretty good on the #TrumpTrain. 20 months of winning!” Jim Morrill: 704-358-5059, @jimmorrill Related content Bill Mitchell: Supporting Trump 140 characters at a time LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Politics & Government Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:08 Brutus and Wimpy visit McDonalds Pause 3:02 Black Political Caucus voices its opposition to Senate Bill 306 2:22 Katy Perry says she 'prayed the gay away' as a youth, learning later to stand for equality 1:16 Lockers obsolete?

By Julia Horowitz WASHINGTON (CNNMoney) -- Tech stocks are booming. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin thinks they might be too expensive. "I don't understand these valuations," he said Friday in an interview with the news site Axios in Washington. Apple and Facebook stock are each up more than 20% this year. Amazon is up 13%, and Netflix more than 15%. The secretary was asked for his thoughts on Silicon Valley. He wouldn't comment on specific investments, but he did shrug at the concept of Snapchat, which went public in a splashy IPO this month and has a higher market value than Target and CBS. Mnuchin said he doesn't use Snapchat but his kids do. "They use it all the time, so that's why, I guess, it's as big as it is," he said. He conceded he could be wrong about tech stocks: The skeptics were mistaken about Intel decades ago. "I think we're in the fifth or sixth inning, not the eighth or ninth inning," he said. Mnuchin's boss, President Trump, has feuded with Silicon Valley, most recently over the president's travel ban. The broader stock market, meanwhile, has been on a tear since the election, setting one record after another. Mnuchin attributed the run to one factor: "The president." And if stocks drop? "It's Congress," he laughed. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It hasn't always been that way, but since revamping the XPS line, starting with the XPS 13 back in 2015, Dell’s premium laptops have been leaders in the ultrabook market, especially in the 15 and 13-inch formats. The XPS 13 and its new 2-in-1 variant make great and highly portable workstations to tote around, but their smaller frames and relative horsepower may not be for everybody. That’s where the crossover to a 15-inch machine might make for a worthy trade-off. For a little more heft, the XPS 15 of yesteryear boasted a discrete GTX 960M onboard with a Skylake quad-core processor, to the XPS 13 line’s integrated graphics on a dual-core chip. As we showed, this allowed the XPS 15 (9550) to brush shoulders with some entry level gaming notebooks, while still looking at home with a business suit. Now the XPS 15 is back and ready to rumble with even more guts in the same alluring chassis. While its looks have not changed, the XPS 15 (9560) has traded up to seventh generation Kaby Lake processors and Pascal graphics, by way of NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050. Pascal GPUs, in particular, have made for impressive performance gains this year, over last year’s Maxwell architecture. While the move from a GeForce GTX 960M to a GTX 1050 may sound like a step back in model numbering to some, the later is much more capable in reality for folks that like to game. How much better? Check out Dave's impressions in the video here with respect to just gaming, and read on ahead for more detail on the rest of the story...  Our review unit is kitted out with Intel’s Core i7-7700HQ, the aforementioned NVIDIA GTX 1050 with 4GB GDDR5, 16GB of 2400MHz dual-channel DDR4 memory (2 x 8GB), a 512GB Samsung PM961 NVMe SSD, Killer Wireless 1535 802.11ac 2x2 networking, a 4K Ultra HD (3840 x 2160) InfinityEdge touch display, 97WHr battery, and Windows 10 Home x64 for a premium pricetag of $2049.99. However, this rings in nearly $200 cheaper than the comparable configuration we scoped out last year. Check out the full specs below.

As such, we will only provide a brief refresher here, mechanically, but you can check out last year’s review as well, for all the gory details. The XPS line’s machined aluminum chassis and carbon fiber lined interior still feels every bit as premium as when the style was first introduced. Curiously lacking is a rose gold color option as can be found on the smaller XPS 13, maybe the coming months will bring us this choice? One has to have goals. We find our AC Power-in, a USB 3.0 Type-A port with PowerShare, an HDMI 1.4 port, a Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port, and headset jack along the left edge. On the right we have a Kensington Lock slot, battery gauge button and indicator, another USB 3.0 Type-A port with PowerShare, and a very welcome full-size SD card slot. Inside, we see the same, nearly unrivaled, 4K InfinityEdge touchscreen panel from last year. Really only Dell's own OLED displays have left us more impressed and we would love to see that option brought to the XPS line. Regardless, all is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass NBT for extra durability against scratches and greater strength - hopefully keeping your display in top condition longer. Of note, we actually could not scratch it with the screwdriver or keys we have on hand, but we caution not to try that at home. The display also does a fair job of mitigating reflections, though not as perfectly as a matte display. Still, the unit’s 350 nits of brightness helps it power through any condition short of directly reflecting the sun - at which point it serves as a very nice mirror. Below the display, and to the left of the Dell logo, the 720p webcam remains. This is a victim of the near bezel-less InfinityEdge display, but that doesn’t help ease the pain felt by users who frequently rely upon it. If you do fall into that group, you may want to consider a USB webcam. Also sometimes controversial is the XPS 15’s keyboard. The keys are very low profile with minimal travel, though they do at least provide decent tactile feedback with near-zero board flex. It does generally take an adjustment period to grow accustomed to, but does eventually feel quite comfortable. This year’s XPS 15 also offers an optional fingerprint reader for $25. This would sit just below the arrow keys, but our unit does not have it included. The fingerprint reader is Windows Hello compatible for enhanced security.

But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin thinks they might be too expensive. “I don’t understand these valuations,” he said Friday in an interview with the news site Axios in Washington. Apple and Facebook stock are each up more than 20% this year. Amazon is up 13%, and Netflix more than 15%. The secretary was asked for his thoughts on Silicon Valley. He wouldn’t comment on specific investments, but he did shrug at the concept of Snapchat, which went public in a splashy IPO this month and has a higher market value than Target and CBS. Mnuchin said he doesn’t use Snapchat but his kids do. “They use it all the time, so that’s why, I guess, it’s as big as it is,” he said. He conceded he could be wrong about tech stocks: The skeptics were mistaken about Intel decades ago. “I think we’re in the fifth or sixth inning, not the eighth or ninth inning,” he said. Mnuchin’s boss, President Trump, has feuded with Silicon Valley, most recently over the president’s travel ban. The broader stock market, meanwhile, has been on a tear since the election, setting one record after another. Mnuchin attributed the run to one factor: “The president.” And if stocks drop? “It’s Congress,” he laughed.

Join For Free Build APIs from SQL and NoSQL or Salesforce data sources in seconds. Read the Creating REST APIs white paper, brought to you in partnership with CA Technologies. The GNU Toolchain is a collection of programming tools produced by the GNU Project. The tools are often packaged together due to their common use for developing software applications, operating systems, and low-level software for embedded systems. This blog is part of a regular series covering the latest changes and improvements in the components that make up this Toolchain. Apart from the announcement of new releases, however, the features described here are at the bleeding edge of software development in the tools. This does mean that it may be a while before they make it into production releases, and they might not be fully functional yet — but anyone who is interested in experimenting with them can build their own copy of the Toolchain and then try them out. GLIBC Version 2.25 of the GNU C Library is now available. In this version you will find: Provisional support for ISO/IEC TR 24731-1:2010, which provides replacement versions of many of the memory allocation functions that include bounds checking. Provisional support for ISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010, which provides replacement versions of many of the memory allocation functions that use dynamically allocated memory to ensure that buffer overflow does not occur. Provisional support for some of the new features that are defined in ISO/IEC TS 18661-4:2015, which is an implementation of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 floating point standard. Full support for ISO/IEC TS 18661-1:2014 standard, which implements support for binary floating-point arithmetic conforming to ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011. This does not cover decimal floating-point arithmetic, nor does it cover many of the optional features of IEC 60559. Glibc can now be built with the stack smashing protector enabled. This means that distributions can build glibc with –enable-stack-protector=strong defined and expect it to work. The function explicit_bzero, from OpenBSD, has been added to glibc. It is intended to be used instead of memset() to erase sensitive data after use; the compiler will not optimize out calls to explicit_bzero even if they are “unnecessary” (in the sense that no _correct_ program can observe the effects of the memory clear). On ColdFire, MicroBlaze, Nios II and SH3, the float_t type is now defined to float instead of double. This does not affect the ABI of any libraries that are part of the GNU C Library, but may affect the ABI of other libraries that use this type in their interfaces. On x86_64, when compiling with -mfpmath=387 or -mfpmath=sse+387, the float_t and double_t types are now defined to long double instead of float and double. These options are not the default, and this does not affect the ABI of any libraries that are part of the GNU C Library, but it may affect the ABI of other libraries that use this type in their interfaces if they are compiled or used with those options. The getentropy and getrandom functions and the <sys/random.h> header file has been added. The buffer size for byte-oriented studio streams is now limitedto 8192 bytes by default. Previously, on Linux, the default buffer size on most file systems was 4096 bytes (and thus remains unchanged), except on network file systems, where the buffer size was unpredictable and could be as large as several megabytes. GDB pretty printers have been added for mutex and condition variable structures in POSIX Threads. When installed and loaded in gdb these pretty printers show various pthread variables in human-readable form when read using the ‘print’ or ‘display’ commands in gdb. A tunables feature has been added to allow tweaking of the runtime for an application program. This feature can be enabled with the –enable-tunables configure flag when glibc is built. The GNU C Library manual has details on usage and README.tunables file has instructions on adding new tunables to the library. Meanwhile, in the mainline development sources of glibc, you can also find these new features: Unicode 9.0.0 support. Character encoding, character type info, and transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 9.0.0. The rpcgen, librpcsvc, and related headers will only be built and installed when glibc is configured with –enable-obsolete-rpc. This allows alternative RPC implementations, like TIRPC, to be used by default. Applications needing features missing from TIRPC should consider the rpcsvc-proto project developed by Thorsten Kukuk (SUSE). GDB GDB 7.12.1 has been released. This is a point release over 7.12 and so it only contains bug fixes rather than new features, but if you have been using 7.12 then it is worth upgrading to 7.12.1. Version 5 of the DWARF debug standard has now been officially released. This has improvements in many areas, such as better data compression, separation of debugging data from executable files, improved descriptions of macros and source files, faster searching for symbols, improved debugging of optimized code, as well as numerous improvements in functionality and performance. If you want to read the new standard, it is here. Meanwhile, in the development sources: GDB can now access to the PKU register on x86_64 GNU/Linux. The register is added by the Memory Protection Keys for Userspace feature, which will be available in future Intel CPUs. Python scripts can now start, stop, and access a running btrace recording. GDB now supports recording and replaying rdrand and rdseed Intel 64 instructions. Newlib Newlib is another GNU C library.  Unlike GLIBC however, newlib is intended mainly to be run on top of either bare-metal or small-OS machines — it is not expecting a Linux environment. Newlib 2.5.0 has been released. The main change in this release is that: The ctype and string functions are now locale-aware and will behave correctly according to the current locale. In addition, the current development sources have another new feature: The locking routines can be retargeted at link time, allowing applications the ability to override the lock functions. GCC GCC version 6.3 has been released. This is a bug fix release and does not contain any new features. GCC 7.0 is still undergoing regression fixing and is tentatively scheduled for an April release. Meanwhile, in the development sources, a new feature has been added: It is now possible to add the column number into source locations in DWARF debug information, alongside the regular file name and line numbers. This feature has to be explicitly enabled however by using the new command line option: -gcolumn-info. Binutils Binutils 2.28 has now been released. Most of the new features in this version have already been reported, but there is one significant addition: This version of binutils fixes a problem with PowerPC VLE 16A and 16D relocations, which were functionally swapped. For example, R_PPC_VLE_HA16A performed like R_PPC_VLE_HA16D while R_PPC_VLE_HA16D performed like R_PPC_VLE_HA16A. This could have been fixed by renumbering relocations, which would keep object files created by an older version of gas compatible with a newer ld. However, that would require an ABI update, affecting other assemblers and linkers that create and process the relocations correctly. It is recommended that all VLE object files be recompiled, but ld can modify the relocations if –vle-reloc-fixup is passed to ld. If the new ld command line option is not used, ld will ld warn on finding relocations inconsistent with the instructions being relocated. Plus in the development sources we have: Add –merge-notes options to objcopy to reduce the size of notes in a binary file by merging and deleting redundant notes. PowerPC gas now checks that the correct register class is used in instructions. For instance, “addi %f4,%cr3,%r31” warns three times that the registers are invalid. That is it for now!

Here’s what you need to know to nab one. Welcome to March of the Machines! This week on Siliconrepublic.com, we were examining in great depth some of the emerging technologies – such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR, VR) and machine learning – that will be shaping our future. Over on Careers, we looked at how those same emerging technologies can shape your future. We started at the speculation stage, providing advice for those who want to work in robotics or with the internet of things (IoT). We looked at some of the jobs that you can get in these areas. Hays told us about some of the jobs that are going to be exploding over the next 12 months, and we did some digging and found out about the range of work you can do in AI development. We also heard from Kevin McGuinness, a research fellow at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, who told us what it’s like to work in deep learning. Once you’ve found the job of your dreams, the next important thing is to find someone willing to pay you to do it. We listed five companies who are hiring in emerging technologies right now. And, if at any point in this process you’re looking for some guidance, or just want to make sure you’re on the right track, we also did some Twitter research and found 10 AI experts you should be following. Of course, you can’t talk about emerging technologies without also talking about the fallout, so we covered off the one issue that has a lot of people worried: should we be handing over the reins to robots and AI quite so quickly? Many people are concerned about the impact of robot workers on human employment. Will robots – or AI – fill our jobs and leave us penniless? According to a PwC report released this week, that could certainly happen in the UK, with robots expected to take 30pc of jobs in the next 15 years. We heard from a number of different sources this week, each of whom tackled the issue from a different angle. Margot Slattery, president of Sodexo Ireland, discussed the future of work at length, and told us how AI and robotics could change the face of business – literally. Three’s Nicola Mortimer spoke to us about how machine learning can augment business practices, rather than replacing them outright. Splice Machine CEO Monte Zweben talked to us about how his work – and general advancements – in machine learning and AI mirrors the change that was wrought over the steel industry in the late ’80s. Hiring Now Always at the cutting edge of new innovation 2016 Graduate Employer of the Year Be part of a globally successful team Help develop the future of sales and trading And finally, Accenture’s Marc Carrel-Billiard gave us some answers for the big question: will AI steal our jobs? As always, for more on any of these stories, follow the links below. 1. Do you want to build a robot? Want to design and create the robots of the future? Here’s what you need to know to become a professional robotics engineer. 2. An IoT career will give you the ability to move and learn Want to work in the exciting world of IoT? We spoke to senior software engineer Cliodhna Ni Scanaill about her career at Intel. 3. 8 emerging technology jobs that are going to explode this year As emerging technologies become further entrenched in our day-to-day lives, certain jobs are growing in popularity. James Milligan, IT director at Hays, gives us an overview of some of the jobs set to explode this year. 4. What kind of job can I get in AI development? AI is seeping into every part of society, which means a huge number of job opportunities. 5. Deep learning is about more than AI – it has unified research Kevin McGuinness, research fellow at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Dublin City University, tells us about what he’s doing with deep learning and how the area is changing. 6. 5 surprising companies hiring in emerging technologies We take a look at some surprising companies hiring in emerging technologies such as IoT, AI and machine learning. 7. 10 people to follow if you want a career in AI Want a career in AI and robotics? One of the best ways to enrich your knowledge about the sector is to follow these AI influencers. 8. Could robots actually take up 30pc of all jobs? Another day, another report of how machines are coming to take away your employment. Is it true? 9. Data is ‘absolutely essential’ to the future of work From machine learning to AI and robotics, the very fabric of the workforce and the workplace may be on the cusp of a dramatic change. We spoke to Margot Slattery, president of Sodexo Ireland, to find out how she envisages the future of work. 10. Machine learning: Should we be excited or fearful for our jobs? Nicola Mortimer, head of business products, marketing and operations at Three Ireland, on how machine learning can drive efficiency rather than drive people out of their jobs. 11. What does machine learning mean for the future of work? As Monte Zweben’s company aims to build a hybrid machine learning infrastructure that would vastly improve on what is already out there, is there a fear that such systems – and AI in particular – will lead to a murky era in which humans in data science are left behind? 12. Will the AI-powered workplaces of the future need humans? In the first in a new series exploring the future of work with thought leaders, we ask Accenture’s Marc Carrel-Billiard if AI will steal our jobs.

provided by Research and Markets Mar 24, 2017, 06:45 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Industrial IoT Market by IIoT Technology, Device, Software, Application, Industry Vertical, and Geography" report to their offering. This is by far the most comprehensive IIoT research available. With hard data, keen insights, detailed qualitative analysis, and forecasts, Industrial IoT Market by IIoT Technology (5G, APIs, Databases), Device (Sensors, RFID, Robots, Smart Meters), Software (Controls, Data Management, PLM), Application (3D Printing, Industrial Analytics, Process Automation, Smart Workplace, Teleoperation), Industry Vertical, and Geography is must reading for anyone within the manufacturing, industrial, and/or enterprise IoT space. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is poised to significantly improve reliability, production, and customer satisfaction. Initially focusing on improving existing processes and augmented current infrastructure, IIoT will rely upon as well as integrate with certain key technologies, devices, software, and applications. Unlike LTE /4G, the fifth generation (5G) of wireless will represent a purpose-built technology, designed and engineered to facilitate connected devices as well as automation systems. In many ways, 5G will be a facilitator and an accelerator of the next industrial revolution, often referred to as Industry 4.0. There is a need to look beyond smart factories, intelligent products and services towards enterprise as a whole and the unique benefits of high capacity urban wireless applications. IoT APIs will support IoT Operations in many regards including interoperability between IoT Platforms, Devices, and Gateways. Moreover, IoT APIs will become a critical part of major IoT application and service developer programs. There is an emerging opportunity for IoT database infrastructure services to support inter-working and access to IoT related resources, most notably data associated with IoT events gathered from IoT Devices and sensors. Sensors are used for detection of changes in the physical and/or logical relationship of one object to another(s) and/or the environment. Physical changes may include temperature, light, pressure, sound, and motion. Logical changes include the presence/absence of an electronically traceable entity, location, and/or activity. Within an IoT context, physical and logical changes are equally important. IoT will be a driver of substantial software development in infrastructure, platforms, devices, security, applications and services. Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) represents an important go-to-market aspect of IoT for early distribution and as a value-add to IoT product capabilities and/or service offerings. IoT also raises Importance of Value-added Resellers (VAR), Systems Integrators (SI), and Independent Software Vendors (ISV).

AI development is the future. According to Accenture’s Technology Vision 2017 report, 85pc of executives plan to invest extensively in AI-related technologies in the next three years. Based on the findings of its report, Accenture predicts that, in five years, more than half of companies’ customers will select their services based on AI instead of a brand. With this in mind, it’s natural to expect companies to start pouring investment into building on their AI and, in turn, more jobs in AI development will appear. However, while AI is advancing rapidly, it’s still relatively new and the jobs in AI development are only starting to develop themselves. For those interested in a career in this field, it can be hard to know where to look, or even what kind of jobs there are in the sector. Where are the AI jobs? Accenture itself is a good place to start in terms of companies offering AI careers. Accenture Labs in Dublin aims to put the most innovative technologies to work, and it is constantly on the lookout for AI researchers, consultants and analysts. Online retail giant Amazon is also investing in AI through its machine learning platform and Amazon Echo. Apple, Google, Salesforce and Twitter have all acquired several AI start-ups, highlighting their increasing interest in this sector. Hiring Now Always at the cutting edge of new innovation Help develop the future of sales and trading Be part of a globally successful team 2016 Graduate Employer of the Year As one of the leaders in AI and machine learning, IBM is another good place to look for research positions. In 2015, Intel foresaw AI coming down the pipeline and bought Saffron Technology in 2015. Now, there are frequent positions available in AI development within the Saffron AI solutions group. Earlier this year, AI firm InsideSales announced that it was coming to Ireland and is expected to hire as many as 120 people. What are the jobs like? When it comes to the jobs themselves, an AI or machine learning researcher would be expected to seek improvements to algorithms and find ways to apply it to new domains. In AI software development, you would have to develop the systems that can apply machine learning to an input data set. AI development is so broad that, depending on the kind of work you want to do, there are several layers you can approach. Do you want to be a programmer? A software developer? A data scientist? A robotics engineer? If you want to chase the latest trends in AI for your career, data and machine learning should definitely be your first search. From a business point of view, AI development is veering towards data mining and analysis, in order to help companies identify key patterns. Machine learning is a key skill for almost any career in AI development. That means you will probably need a computer science degree or equivalent qualification, a knowledge of probability and statistics, and programming or data science experience.

Story highlights Trump and Ryan are pushing legislation that would repeal key aspects of the Affordable Care Act Trump has made cracking down on undocumented immigration one of his signature issues Trump's executive order imposing a travel ban has garnered global attention (CNN)From his travel ban to his plan to repeal Obamacare, President Donald Trump's policy proposals are already affecting some Americans but have the potential to change the fabric of the US. To what extent his policies will affect individual Americans is up for debate. The administration, for instance, disagrees with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's report that estimates his health reform plan would see 24 million additional Americans go without health insurance within 10 years. Here's a look at some estimates of how his policies will affect Americans. Health care Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan are pushing legislation that would repeal key aspects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Read More Changing the health insurance marketplace is a complicated business, and there is no universal agreement on how any legislation would affect coverage. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on Capitol Hill, released its best guess -- the official score of the legislation -- on Monday, and some of the numbers are quite large. Immigration From the day he announced his campaign, Trump made cracking down on undocumented immigration one of his signature issues. He pledged to round up and deport the millions of men, women and children who live in this country without documentation. He pledged to build a wall with Mexico and make the country pay for it. He also pledged to build a "big, beautiful door" in that wall to facilitate legal immigration. Shortly after taking office, Trump issued a broad executive order enforcing immigration law that calls for an end to sanctuary cities and a robust increase in resources to the Department of Homeland Security to increase the level of deportations. These moves could affect the more than 11 million estimated undocumented immigrants in the US. However, Trump has signaled a willingness to respect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that Obama started to offer legal status to people who came to the US as children and still live there. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has touted a major decrease in recorded illegal Southwest border crossings as evidence that the President has quickly changed the situation at the border. Federal hiring freeze The number of executive branch employees has floated around 2.7 million since the mid-1990s. With a goal of reducing that workforce, Trump imposed a freeze on new hires, which could cut the number of employees while increasing reliance on contractors. The White House said the freeze did not apply to the military, and Trump has called for an increase in defense spending. Trump took another action on immigration enforcement, and DHS guidance on that action said it would request 10,000 additional employees for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and 5,000 new employees for Customs and Border Protection. The travel ban Trump's executive order imposing a so-called travel ban has garnered global attention. The original order suspended the refugee program and temporarily halted travel to the US by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries. People caught in the air during the rushed implementation of the order were detained at airports and some were flown back to the countries they flew in from. All in all, 746 individuals nationwide were detained, including green-card holders. According to Pew, people from these countries made over 900,000 entries to the US since 2005. A government lawyer said more than 100,000 visas had been revoked though later the same day, the State Department disputed the number, saying it was closer to 60,000. Revised US travel ban Trump signs new travel ban How this ban is different Muslims in Congress blast new order Will this impact the court cases? Travel ban: Read the full executive order Instant backlash to new travel ban This time around, ban offers wiggle room The executive order was halted in the court system, and after one ruling, Trump tweeted, "SEE YOU IN COURT!" Trump issued a new executive order targeting six Muslim-majority countries and putting in place a temporary ban on all refugees. The new ban doesn't include Iraq and specifically exempts green-card holders and those with valid visas. The order, issued on March 6, is due to take effect on March 16. Even with the changes, aimed at avoiding legal challenges and smoothing implementation, the new order would affect millions directly. Wall Street Stocks have been on a tear since Trump was elected, climbing more than 14% since September in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq is up more than 11%, and the S&P 500 is up more than 10%. The Dow has risen from less than 18,000 points on Election Day to a peak of more than 21,000. It has since fallen below that marker, but it's clear that Wall Street likes what it hears from Trump -- both his promises to roll back regulations on businesses and his promise to reform the tax rate. That's good news for anyone in the market -- and with so many Americans reliant on IRAs and 401Ks to fund their retirement plans, that's a large portion of the population. A little more than half of Americans -- 52% -- said they invest in the stock market, according to a Gallup survey in April 2016. That's a large portion of the country but down from the high of 65% in Gallup's surveys from 2007, before the Great Recession. Transgender students The Trump administration rescinded guidance from the Obama administration that protected the right of transgender students in public schools to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identities. In 2016, the Department of Education said there were 50.4 million students in public schools, but as The New York Times noted, the number of transgender children has been "elusive" -- in that no official data or agreed-upon measure exist. The Williams Institute at UCLA released a study in 2016 that found about 0.6% of US adults identified as transgender; another study from the institute in January 2017 estimated 0.7% of people ages 13 to 17 years old identified as transgender. However, these estimates may not be reflective of the population of transgender children in public schools. Private prisons Then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates last August directed the Bureau of Prisons to restrict its use of private prisons, a formal shift away from their use in federal incarceration. Quickly within his tenure, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed the Obama administration's shift away from private prisons. The federal and state private prison populations have increased over the years, experiencing a small dip in the latter portion of the Obama administration. However, people incarcerated in private prisons make up only a tiny fraction of the federal and state prison populations. The guidance to the Bureau of Prisons would only affect federal prisoners. Although its impact on the overall prison population would be relatively small, Trump's election ushered in a reversal of fortunes for the private prison industry. Following his election, CoreCivic -- previously known as the Corrections Corporation of America -- and the Geo Group saw their stocks rocket upward. The Yemen raid Just days into office, Trump greenlighted a major raid in Yemen with the stated goal of targeting al Qaeda. The raid has since become more controversial than most operations because of the death of Navy SEAL William "Ryan" Owens and reports of many civilian deaths, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki. Drone strikes under Obama had previously killed Awlaki, a US citizen and al Qaeda spokesman, as well as Awlaki's 16-year-old son. The US government said several other service members were injured in addition to Owens' death. It also claimed to have killed 14 al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula fighters in the raid. Human Rights Watch has said at least 9 children were killed along with five other civilians. However, as Buzzfeed noted, confirmation of the total number of deaths and who they were does not yet exist -- and may never exist. The United States has since executed dozens of strikes, saying that it did more than 30 in Yemen in one week. Pipelines Trump moved to expedite the process holding up two major oil pipeline projects that have earned blowback from environmentalists and the communities affected by their construction. One is Keystone XL, a major project to transport oil from Canada through the US. Environmentalists railed against the project for years, while Big Oil and labor groups united in support of the project. Obama ultimately opposed the pipeline, but Trump reversed course. The other project is the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has enraged the Sioux Tribe at the Standing Rock reservation in North and South Dakota. The company working to build the pipeline has said the tribe will not be affected, but the tribe has said the pipeline poses a direct threat to their lives. A non-Native American community had successfully blocked the pipeline from being constructed through its territory. According to the pipeline's site: "The Dakota Access Pipeline project will result in an estimated $156 million in sales and income taxes during construction, and $55 million in property taxes annually." The Sioux tribe numbered about 8,500 people in 2015, and it stood in staunch opposition to the project, attracting protesters from around the country. At the peak of protests, the camp's population climbed to as many as 10,000 people. TPP The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a proposal among the governments of 13 Pacific-facing countries that sought to establish one harmonious free trade zone. The deal would have brought a plurality of the global economy under one umbrella, pointedly excluding China from coordination with many of its neighbors, and it built on North American Free Trade Agreement extensively. If the deal were ratified and to take effect, it could have been one of the most influential policy changes of the Obama administration. However, Obama faced steep resistance to the deal within his own party, and during the presidential election, both contenders for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination -- free trade skeptic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who once called TPP "the gold standard" of trade deals -- came out against it. While support for the deal crumbled within the Democratic Party, the largely pro-free trade Republican coalition began to rally around Trump, who has for years railed against free trade deals and cited the US trade deficit as a cause for concern. Quickly after taking office, Trump pulled the US out of the deal. Several member countries said in turn that they would have to abandon the TPP on their end as well, and Trump has said he will pursue bilateral trade agreements as well as a review of NAFTA. Bringing jobs back Trump has leaned into a few companies since the election, saying he is using his position to stop companies from off-shoring jobs and getting contractors to cut back on their prices. Trump said a Carrier worker reminded him of a promise he made to stop Carrier's Indiana factory workers from being outsourced to Mexico. Alongside then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence -- now Trump's vice president -- Trump announced that he had saved the jobs. However, the workers' union said Trump didn't save all the jobs, just under 800. Trump attacked the union chief for speaking out, and some of the jobs are still on track to be outsourced or eliminated. Trump publicly aired grievances with the cost of some F-35 flight variants, and Lockheed in turn lowered the cost slightly of three of the joint strike fighters. All told, Lockheed said Trump had caused them to save the US $700 million on what is already the most expensive weapons project ever. Dow Chemical said it would create 100 new jobs and "repatriate" 100 others. Trump and his White House have also touted planned moves by GM, Ford, SoftBank, FiatChrysler, Amazon, Walmart, Intel and ExxonMobil. Some companies have credited Trump's agenda for their plans while others haven't commented on Trump at all. CNNMoney has a running fact check on these announcements. Other Obama-era rollbacks Republicans had for years protested Obama's executive orders and regulatory actions as overreach, even warning of the specter of an "imperial presidency." So newly empowered with control of both houses of Congress and the White House, Republicans in Washington moved swiftly to roll back Obama-era rules. Some were undone with the Congressional Review Act, a rarely invoked law that allows Congress to undo executive actions permanently. And other policy changes have come either from Trump's pen or his administration's agencies, many of which are now headed by people with radically different visions from their predecessors. Here is a list of rules either eliminated or under review: Stream protection rule This rule was meant to prevent waste materials from coal mines entering water sources. It had originally gone into effect on January 19, according to the Department of the Interior. Trump signed a bill ending the rule on February 16. Oil payment disclosure The SEC adopted the Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers rule on July 27, 2016. The rule required oil, natural gas and mineral companies to tell the SEC if they made payments to foreign governments. Supporters saw it as an anti-corruption measure while opponents, particularly in the energy sector, said it put US energy companies in a bad position relative to companies from other countries. Congress passed a bill blocking the rule in early February, and Trump signed it into law on February 14. Fiduciary rule -- under review The Department of Labor unveiled the fiduciary rule, also known as the fiduciary standard, in April 2016 with an applicability date of April 10, 2017. It would require retirement advisers to always act in the best interest of their clients, regulating potential conflicts of interest for retirement advisers. Trump signed an executive order putting it under review on February 3. Mortgage rate cut One of the very first actions in the Trump administration was wiping out a Housing and Urban Development rule issued in the final days of the Obama administration. The rule creating a mortgage rate cut for people with low incomes would have gone into effect on January 27. On Inauguration Day, HUD issued a letter stopping it. Waters of the US -- under review The EPA enacted a rule, effective on August 28, 2015, under the Clean Water Act that gave the government regulatory authority over waterways throughout the country. Trump signed an executive order reviewing the economic impact of the Waters of the United States rule at the end of February. Gun measure The Obama administration implemented a rule on December 19, 2016, aimed at preventing Americans with a mental illness from getting guns by sharing information with the national background check system. It said the rule would be effective January 18 with compliance not required until December 19, 2017. Trump signed a bill to eliminate it on February 28. Mexico City policy Implemented by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City policy, or Global Gag Rule, blocks US funding to non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions. Since Reagan instituted the rule, it's ping-ponged in and out of existence depending on the political party of the President. Obama rescinded the rule, and on January 23, Trump reinstituted it. Kaiser Family Foundation has a guide that outlines the history of the policy. Voting Rights Act lawsuit Under Obama, the Department of Justice battled rules it believed were in violation of the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court ruled against in part. On February 27, Sessions' DOJ shifted away from a legal battle against Texas SB 14, a voter ID law. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, now Trump's energy secretary, signed the bill into law on May 27, 2011. The move offers an early sign of the wide gulf that could emerge between the DOJ under Obama and Trump. For example, the DOJ is not expected to pursue major civil rights suits against cities and their police departments as the Obama administration had done in Fergson, Missouri, and other locations.

But its effort to obtain permission to rewrite contributors' rights runs the risk of alienating the community that sustains it. The software is licensed under the OpenSSL License, which includes its own terms and those dating back to the preceding SSLeay license. Those driving the project announced plans to shift to a new license in 2015 and now the thousand or so people who have contributed code over the years have started receiving email messages asking them to grant permission to relicense their contributions under the Apache Software License, version 2. Theo De Raadt, founder of OpenBSD, a contributor to OpenSSL, and creator of a LibreSSL – forked from OpenSSL in 2014 – expressed dissatisfaction with the relicensing campaign in a mailing list post, criticizing OpenSSL for failing to consult its community of authors. "My worry is that the rights of the authors are being trampled upon, and they are only being given one choice of license which appears to be driven by a secret agreement between big corporations, Linux Foundation, lawyers, and such," he explained in an interview with The Register via phone and email. For years, OpenSSL went largely unappreciated, until the Heartbleed vulnerability surfaced in 2014 and shamed the large companies that depend on the software for online security to contribute funds and code. The planned licensing change comes with the endorsement of Intel and Oracle, among the companies that pledged $3.9 million to the Linux Foundation as atonement. A portion of that funding transformed OpenSSL into something more than the shoe-string operation it had been for years. Rich Salz, a member of the OpenSSL development team and senior architect at Akamai Technologies, in a phone interview with The Register, said that in the year before Heartbleed, two people were responsible for almost all of the changes being incorporated into OpenSSL. Now there are at least 150 contributing and making pull requests, he said. Salz cited several reasons for seeking a new license for OpenSSL. "If you read the SSLeay license carefully, it says among other things you cannot distribute this code under any other license," he said. "What that means is for people who make derivations and want to license their changes, as long as their changes are derived from SSLeay license, they can't." The license also includes advertising credit clauses, which Salz characterized as "obnoxious." He said, "We want to move to a license that's completely standard and well-known and widely accepted by the community, by the industry." A source familiar with software licensing, who asked not to be named because of lack of employer authorization, echoed Salz's concerns, describing the SSLeay license as a contractual freak and a compliance nightmare. The license states that the code cannot be placed under another license, which makes it incompatible with some popular copyleft licenses because they stipulate additional terms can only ease restrictions, the source said. The advertising clause mentioned by Salz, according to the source, requires that any mention of software including OpenSSL comes with attribution. "This does not say when you distribute, it says when you talk about it," the source said. "That's a restriction on use, which runs very contrary to the spirit of what the community has worked towards."

But a few lucky individuals already got their hands on the processors, thanks to some retailers that started selling the products ahead of its official launch. News of AMD Ryzen 5’s early release broke on Reddit, with one user posting photos of a fellow Brazilian’s recently bought processor. The post didn’t reveal much, but author marcosmcc claimed the product came from Paraguay. Apparently, some retailers worldwide which have already begun receiving shipments of Ryzen 5 processors have not received a memo from AMD about its official launch. Based on the interaction on the Reddit thread, there were a few folks from Mexico, Peru, and Brazil who have also managed to walk into some local stores and buy their Ryzen processors. Some of them have even promised to benchmark their CPUs and publish the results within the next few days. Reddit So far, we’ve only seen an AMD Ryzen 1600 from the forum, but more should come in the next few days if the early roll out in select retailers continues. In the meantime, here’s an idea of how the new chips are going to perform for those who are still having doubts whether to buy them or not. AMD Ryzen 5 Family At this point, AMD has formally introduced four different Ryzen 5 processors that will debut come April 11. First on the list is Ryzen 5 1600X, the flagship of the Ryzen 5 lineup which is a six-core, 12-thread CPU with a 3.6GHz base clock and a 4.0GHz boost clock. WCCFTech describes it as a Ryzen 7 1800X mainstream alternative that is also expected to be a great performing gaming chip. Interested buyers can purchase this one for $249, just $10 over its Intel counterpart, the Core i5 7600K. Next, we have the Ryzen 5 1600 which is also six core, 12 thread SKU with identical cache amount of 16MB and TDP of 95W as the 1600X. Its only difference from the flagship chip is its slightly lower clock speeds of 3.2GHz base and 3.6GHz boost. Tagged at $219, 1600 has an unlocked multiplier for overclocking. The other two chips in the Ryzen 5 family include the Ryzen 5 1500X and Ryzen 5 1400—both featuring four cores and eight threads. Similar to the other Ryzen products, these two products come with unlocked multipliers for overclocking. The former, however, has a base clock of 3.5GHz and boost clock of 3.7 GHz, while the latter boasts 3.2 GHz base and 3.4 GHz boost clock speed. Both 1500X and 1400 have 8MB cache and 65W TDP. They will be available for $189 and $169 respectively.

The EliteBooks from the 800-series are premium business notebooks from HP. There are two more expensive EliteBooks with the additional Folio designation , but they have a bigger focus on the mobility. The EliteBook 840 with its 14-inch display is already the fourth generation , but there are only minor changes compared to the previous EliteBook 840 G3. More precisely: You only get a new processor from Intel’s current Kaby Lake generation. Our test model carries the designation Z2V49ET ABD and is a mainstream model from the 840 G4 lineup when you have a look at the available components.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 24 March 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Here starts courting app makers Change of ownership: Once part of Nokia, Here was purchased by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015. — AFP Relaxnews Here, the automotive industry-owned mapping and location services company is launching a new set of tools that will let any developer easily build and launch an app that needs location-specific features. It means that if a small company or individual wants to build an on-demand delivery business or launch a ride-hailing feature, for example, they can now turn to Here instead of Google Maps. "Congestion, roadworks and bad addressing are a constant headache for companies operating in a complex market where every single minute makes a difference. Our new toolkit brings together a set of advanced location capabilities to help developers address these challenges and make their app stand above the rest," said Leon van de Pas, head of Internet of Things at Here. If developers choose to simply use the full suite of Here tools and host their service within the company's existing consumer app, they can literally bring their app from idea to reality in a matter of days. All of the complex calculations, from figuring out where a delivery point or a customer really is, to navigating the most efficient route and building in contingencies for traffic flows, is taken care of. Once part of Nokia, Here was purchased by BMW, Audi and Daimler in 2015 in an attempt to put space between the auto industry and Google's mapping and location services. Over the past 18 months Intel has also come on board and the company has started developing next generation 3D maps that will be crucial for autonomous vehicles. However, cars are just one element and the company wants to expand into all aspects of location and mobility, making connections between internet-enabled things as we enter a future of smart homes, connected cars and on-demand services. This wider view is also why car companies from Audi and VW to BMW and Ford are starting to reposition themselves as mobility service providers as much as car builders. VW expects to have 100 million customers by 2025 that are patrons of its connected services and apps rather than VW group car drivers. Even connected cars being built today are opening up 10 times as many potential revenues streams for carmakers than other vehicles that don't have latest-generation infotainment or web services on board. Therefore the launch of this new developer kit should be seen as a very big first step towards this long-term goal. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Amazon sellers can get insured by Lloyd’s for getting kicked off WikiLeaks releases CIA hacks of Apple Mac computers China's ZTE posts Q4 net loss after US sanction case fine Iranian immigrant rose to building Google’s business, leading Twitter’s board Staying connected through social media Is technology ruining your relationship?

Our testing shows that may well be the case. By: Chad Sebring | CPU Liquid Coolers in Cases, Cooling & PSU | Posted: 2 days, 13 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 97%Manufacturer: NZXT Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Packaging] Page 3 [NZXT Kraken X42 Liquid CPU Cooler] Page 4 [Accessories and Documentation] Page 5 [Installation and Finished Product] Page 6 [NZXT CAM Software] Page 7 [Test System Setup, Thermal Tests, and Noise Results] Page 8 [Final Thoughts] Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing     By now, most of us in the real-world have tried some form of liquid cooling, whether it be a fully custom setup, or opting for one of the many sealed loops on the market today. Up to now, when it came to AIOs, there has been one way to make them work well, and that was done by changing the fans used on the radiator portion of the cooler, which allowed companies to opt for static pressure, more airflow, and in the best-case scenario, fans which were great at doing both. Older generations of these coolers tended to be somewhat limited in their pump speeds, and many would complain that the older pumps were noisy, and could even be heard over the fans, when they were running at lower speeds.     It seems that now, there is a drastic change in the AIO market, and NZXT is the first to show off what the latest generation of AIOs is capable of. Rather than depending so much on the fan speed of their systems, there is a new pump in charge of the flow rate, which is where much of the magic happens. The new pump translates to a more efficient system, which increases the rate in which the coolant moves through the radiator, and can then reduce the fan speed, obtaining optimal performance without the need to make your ears bleed. What you are about to see, will change the way you look at closed loop coolers, and a new day is dawning in the AIO market.   NZXT has sent over the Kraken family for us to have a look at what is new, and we have decided to look at them, smallest first, on up in size as we look at the three coolers. The first of this trio is named the Kraken X42, and while similar in name to previous designs that NAZXT has had in the past, that is just about all that is shared between this and previous offerings. We are impressed with what NZXT is doing in the realm of sealed water cooling, and with all the new technology and features added in this time around, there is not a major price hike associated with it, which makes buying anything else at this point a bit pointless.     We took this chart from the Kraken X42 product page, and it does tell us much about this cooler. First off, we are given the size of the radiator, and this single 140mm radiator is 175mm tall, 143mm wide, and without the fan, it is 30mm thick. The head unit on the X42 is larger than most, as it is a cylindrical shape that is 80mm across the top, and it stands 52.9mm high. In this product, there is aluminum used in the radiator and the cover on the head unit. Copper is used in the base plate, plastic is used for the fittings and the clear cover on the head unit, and there are over fifteen inches of ultra-low evaporation rubber tubes, which have nylon sleeve on them.   All told, without the hardware included, it weighs in at 890 grams. Compatibility is wide, as it fits anything since AM2 for AMD, and all Intel sockets after LGA775. There is a RAM height clearance shown too, and we believe this is the height under the swivel fittings. This 35mm may come into play, but you will see later, that the X42 did not encroach on them.   NZXT offers CAM software to control the X42, and this is where you can set modes, for both the fan and the pump, as well as a place to tinker with the RGB LED system. The pump in this system is shown to spin at a maximum of 2800RPM with a margin of error, and the fan cooling the other end of the cooler is an Aer P140 fan. Only one fans ships with the X42, but it is capable of 1800RPM, at a noise level of 38db(A). Along with the model number at the bottom of the chart, we also see that the new Kraken coolers are backed by a six-year warranty; the longest we have seen to date.   Since we were on the product page to get the chart, we looked around as we always do, and found that the MSRP of $129.99 is right there in bold print. From what we can recall in the past, single 120mm AIOs release at $119.99, so an extra $10 to make the move to 140mm is reasonable. Looking around for other places to grab the Kraken X42, we see that Newegg is sticking tight to the MSRP, with their listing at $129.99 as well. Amazon, they are a tad higher, as they are asking $132.58 for this cooler currently. Of course, as time passes by, sales will pop up eventually, but at $129.99 we feel that not only are you getting the latest generation of AIOs to start off with, but you are also getting the most feature rich AIO we have seen to date.

Greg Abbott, R-Texas, left, and Reed Cordish, assistant to the president for intragovernmental and technology initiatives, talks outside the White House on Friday after a meeting with President Donald Trump. Evan Vucci Associated Press i By Jim Puzzanghera Los Angeles Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The chief executive of Charter Communications committed in a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday to invest $25 billion on broadband infrastructure while joining a trend of business leaders touting previously announced job creation at the White House. In the case of Charter, Chief Executive Thomas Rutledge said he expected to hire 20,000 new U.S. employees over the next four years. The cable-TV and Internet service had made the hiring promise in 2015 when it was purchasing Time Warner Cable. The new development was the time period in which it will occur. Nevertheless, Trump indicated the job creation was triggered by his election. “We are really in the process of announcements and you’re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs and companies and everything coming back into our country,” Trump said in the Oval Office, flanked by Rutledge and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. “They’re coming in far faster than even I had projected.” After buying Time Warner Cable, Charter, which uses the Spectrum brand name, is the dominant cable provider in Charlotte. Earlier this month, it began rolling out its new brand to consumers. The large investment in broadband infrastructure was a new commitment from Charter. Rutledge signaled that it was made because of the policies of Trump and congressional Republicans, who have promised to cut corporate taxes and reduce regulations. Rutledge said the company was “excited about the opportunity in the right regulatory climate and the right tax climate to make major infrastructure investments.” A good portion of that investment could be in California because of the company’s large presence there. Rutledge also renewed an earlier promise to bring all of Time Warner Cable’s call centers back to the U.S. About 50 percent of Time Warner Cable’s customer service calls are handled offshore, he said. Trump said that Charter’s announcement followed companies such as Exxon Mobil and Intel Crop. that had “recently announced billions in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory.” But, like Charter, some of those companies were simply renewing or amplifying earlier commitments. For example, Exxon Mobil’s promise to invest $20 billion and create more than 45,000 jobs in the Gulf Coast region was part of an initiative that began in 2013.

Contact me: bcovert@thinkprogress.org Mar 24 Trump announces 20,000 jobs that were planned a year and a half before his election Charter Communications pledged to add 20,000 new American jobs as early as June 2015. Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Reed Cordish, Assistant to the President for Intragovernmental and Technology Initiatives, at the White House on Friday. CREDIT: AP Photo/Evan Vucci After a meeting at the White House with Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge, President Trump announced that the company told him it will hire 20,000 more people and invest $25 billion in the U.S. “Today I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has just committed to investing $25 billion…here in the United States and has committed further to hiring 20,000 American workers over the next four years,” Trump bragged on Friday. He also noted that Charter committed to close all its offshore call centers. But Trump was bragging about something that was in the works long before he took office. Charter made this hiring goal public in the spring of 2015. Charter announced its plans to acquire Time Warner Cable in May of 2015 and then spent a year trying to get it approved by regulators. To sweeten the deal, as early as June 2015 the company pledged to hire 20,000 more Americans if it went through. The FCC explicitly mentioned this promise when it approved the merger in May of 2016. “The Applicants commit to increase customer care through domestic investment and in-sourced jobs, and claim that New Charter would bring thousands of overseas Time Warner Cable jobs back to the United States,” the agency wrote. “They explain that many, if not most of the overseas jobs would be brought in-house, where the Applicants would provide significant training, benefits, and opportunities for advancement, which would add to the skill level and economic fabric of local communities.” When asked if this was the same as the announcement made today, a Charter spokesperson told ThinkProgress, “We have spoken about our plans to hire 20k before but it wasn’t a commitment. Today we committed to a time frame of four years for those hires.” Trump just bragged about jobs he didn’t create In his address to Congress last night, Trump listed a number of companies that were already planning to add jobs this…thinkprogress.org The FCC document appears to dispute this. “Charter commits that New Charter would continue this in-sourcing strategy with respect to field technician positions within the Time Warner Cable and Bright House footprints,” it reads. Although the FCC concluded that Charter’s promise to create more jobs wasn’t specific enough to be counted as a verifiable benefit of the deal, it did note that job creation is a consideration factor for whether deals are greenlighted. On Friday, Trump said that other American businesses have created jobs specifically after his election to the White House. “You’re going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, and companies, and everything coming back into our country,” he promised. “They’re coming in even far faster than even I had projected.” Yet nearly all of the deals he’s bragged about have had nothing to do with him or his election. The 45,000 jobs Exxon said it would add were in the works as far back as 2012. The 8,000 from Sprint and SoftBank are part of a deal announced before he won. Intel’s 3,000 jobs were first announced alongside President Obama. Ford’s CEO said the 700 new jobs had nothing to do with Trump, and Fiat-Chrysler said the same thing about its 2,000 new jobs. General Motors insisted its 1,950 jobs were planned long before the election. The increase in production that led to Lockheed Martin’s 1,800 jobs has been in the works for years.

TC Heartland unsuccessfully requested a transfer of the case to the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The Indiana-based company then appealed against the decision to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. But the appeals court handed down a judgment denying TC Heartland’s petition for a writ of mandamus in April last year.  TC Heartland had urged the court to set aside a 26-year-old ruling, VE Holding Corp v Johnson Gas Appliance, which said patent suits can be filed in any district where the defendant sells its products. On Monday, the Supreme Court will answer the question of whether 28 USC, section 1400(b) is the sole and exclusive provision governing venue in patent infringement actions and is not to be supplemented by 28 USC, section 1391(c). The patent venue statute, section 1400(b), provides that patent infringement actions “may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides”. The statute governing “venue generally”, section 1391, contains a subsection (c) that, where applicable, deems a corporate entity to reside in multiple judicial districts. In February, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) submitted a second amicus brief asking the court to change the rules in a bid to limit the number of lawsuits being filed at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, a popular destination for patent claims. Although the Texas court was not part of the proceedings, it had been brought into consideration as part of the argument put forward by the EFF.  That same month, other associations and companies, including the American Bar Association, Dell, Intel and the American Intellectual Property Law Association, also filed amicus briefs.  That’s not all—the attorney general of Texas, along with 16 other state attorneys, urged the Supreme Court to end the Texas court’s hold on patent litigation. Ken Paxton’s brief asked the court to reverse rulings by the Federal Circuit which have “allowed forum-shopping by patent holders who are seeking to influence the outcome of their cases with their venue choices”.

Join For Free Evolve your approach to Application Performance Monitoring by adopting five best practices that are outlined and explored in this e-book, brought to you in partnership with BMC. This is the first post in a series about JIT compilers. The plan is to take a simple input language and develop some interpreters and JITs for it, in a roughly increasing degree of complexity. It's my hope that by the end of the series, readers will have a good understanding of what it takes to develop a JIT compiler and of some of the tools available to assist with this task. The input language will be Brainf*ck — or BF, as I'll be referring to it from now and throughout the series. I think it's a good language for the purpose since it really boils programmability down to the essentials. Even though it's very tedious to program in, BF is fairly "mainstream" as far as programming languages go, with some concepts like memory pointers and loops mapping directly to familiar C constructs. As the implementation language, I'll be using C++. This is, perhaps, not the most commonly used "starter" language; that said, most compilers I know are written in C++ (or C), and hence many of the most popular low-level code generation libraries in existence are in these languages. In later parts of this series, we'll be using some C++ libraries, and this is by far easiest to do from C++ itself. Besides, I try to keep my code straightforward throughout the series; there is very little use of advanced C++ features here. The BF Language The BF language is simple to describe, but I don't do this here. Please take a look at the spec, read the Wikipedia page, or see one of the other existing resources. An in-browser interpreter such as this one can be very useful. I'll just give an example to develop a taste for the language. The following BF program prints the numbers 1 to 5 to the screen: ++++++++ ++++++++ ++++++++ ++++++++ ++++++++ ++++++++
>+++++
[<+.>-] Here's what it does: Line 1 initializes memory cell 0 to the value 48, which happens to be the ASCII code for 0. Line 2 initializes memory cell 1 to 5, which is our loop counter. Line 3 is a loop that, at each iteration, increments cell 0 and prints its value out, then decrements cell 1 and checks if it has reached the value 0. A Simple Interpreter To get an initial feel for the language and to have a reliable reference implementation, we'll start with a simple interpreter that processes one BF character at a time and does what's necessary to "execute" it. One of the reasons for my choosing BF as the source language is its simplicity. You'll find a lot of tutorials online that purport to develop interpreters or compilers but end up focusing 90% of their time on writing the parser. I think the later stages of compilation are much more interesting, so my "parser" for BF looks like this: struct Program {
  std::string instructions;
};

Program parse_from_stream(std::istream& stream) {
  Program program;

  for (std::string line; std::getline(stream, line);) {
    for (auto c : line) {
      if (c == '>' || c == '<' || c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '.' ||
          c == ',' || c == '[' || c == ']') {
        program.instructions.push_back(c);
      }
    }
  }
  return program;
} Note that this is a valid implementation according to the BF spec. All characters except the 8 supported ones are to be treated as comments and ignored. This parser is going to serve us throughout the series. With that out of the way, here's the actual interpreter: constexpr int MEMORY_SIZE = 30000;

void simpleinterp(const Program& p, bool verbose) {
  // Initialize state.
  std::vector<uint8_t> memory(MEMORY_SIZE, 0);
  size_t pc = 0;
  size_t dataptr = 0;

  while (pc < p.instructions.size()) {
    char instruction = p.instructions[pc];
    switch (instruction) {
    case '>':
      dataptr++;
      break;
    case '<':
      dataptr--;
      break;
    case '+':
      memory[dataptr]++;
      break;
    case '-':
      memory[dataptr]--;
      break;
    case '.':
      std::cout.put(memory[dataptr]);
      break;
    case ',':
      memory[dataptr] = std::cin.get();
      break;

    // [...] All these cases are rather trivial. The more interesting ones are the control flow ops: [ and ]. We'll start with [ - jump forward if the current data location is zero. This op makes it possible to skip a loop or implement a simple if-like condition. case '[':
  if (memory[dataptr] == 0) {
    int bracket_nesting = 1;
    size_t saved_pc = pc;

    while (bracket_nesting && ++pc < p.instructions.size()) {
      if (p.instructions[pc] == ']') {
        bracket_nesting--;
      } else if (p.instructions[pc] == '[') {
        bracket_nesting++;
      }
    }

    if (!bracket_nesting) {
      break;
    } else {
      DIE << "unmatched '[' at pc=" << saved_pc;
    }
  }
  break; The most important thing to note here is that the [ and ] brackets in BF can be nested; therefore, when figuring out where to jump, we have to find the matching bracket. If this seems like something wasteful to do at run-time, you're right. Keep reading! For ], we do something very similar. In BF, ] is jumping to an earlier [ if the current data location is not zero. This is how loops advance to the next iteration (or stop). case ']':
  if (memory[dataptr] != 0) {
    int bracket_nesting = 1;
    size_t saved_pc = pc;

    while (bracket_nesting && pc < p.instructions.size()) {
      pc--;
      if (p.instructions[pc] == '[') {
        bracket_nesting--;
      } else if (p.instructions[pc] == ']') {
        bracket_nesting++;
      }
    }

    if (!bracket_nesting) {
      break;
    } else {
      DIE << "unmatched ']' at pc=" << saved_pc;
    }
  }
  break; And that's it! The interpreter loop concludes with:   default: { DIE << "bad char '" << instruction << "' at pc=" << pc; }
  }

  pc++;
} The full code for this simple interpreter can be found in simpleinterp.cpp. Measuring the Performance of BF Programs Whenever we develop something like an interpreter or compiler, execution speed is a paramount concern. Therefore, it's common for compiler writers to have benchmark suites they refer to for measurements. For BF, I'll be using a couple of programs throughout the series to measure how fast our implementation is. One is a Mandelbrot generator; another is a factorization program invoked on the large-ish prime 179424691. The simple interpreter shown above takes 38.6 seconds on mandelbrot and 16.5 seconds on factor. Now let's see how we can greatly improve these numbers. Optimized Interpreter: Take 1 The most obvious optimization opportunity for the simple interpreter is to avoid laboriously looking for the matching bracket every time a [ or ] is encountered. Imagine a realistic program with a hot inner loop (by "hot" here, I mean it runs many, many — possibly billions — of times throughout the execution of the program). Is it really necessary to scan the source to find the matching bracket every single time? Of course not. We can just precompute these jump destinations ahead of time since the BF program doesn't change throughout its execution. This is the idea behind optinterp.cpp, our first optimized interpreter. Much of the code is the same as for the simple interpreter, so I'll just highlight the differences. A crucial addition is this function, which is run before the actual interpretation happens: std::vector<size_t> compute_jumptable(const Program& p) {
  size_t pc = 0;
  size_t program_size = p.instructions.size();
  std::vector<size_t> jumptable(program_size, 0);

  while (pc < program_size) {
    char instruction = p.instructions[pc];
    if (instruction == '[') {
      int bracket_nesting = 1;
      size_t seek = pc;

      while (bracket_nesting && ++seek < program_size) {
        if (p.instructions[seek] == ']') {
          bracket_nesting--;
        } else if (p.instructions[seek] == '[') {
          bracket_nesting++;
        }
      }

      if (!bracket_nesting) {
        jumptable[pc] = seek;
        jumptable[seek] = pc;
      } else {
        DIE << "unmatched '[' at pc=" << pc;
      }
    }
    pc++;
  }

  return jumptable;
} It computes the jump destinations for all the [ and ] ops in the program. Its operation is essentially identical to the scanning forward or backward for a matching bracket in the main loop of the simple interpreter. The result is the vector jumptable, where for every [ and ] at offset i in the program, jumptable[i] holds the offset of the matching bracket. For any other op at offset i, jumptable[i] is simply 0. The actual main loop of optinterp is the same as in simpleinterp, except for the clauses for brackets, which become simply: case '[':
  if (memory[dataptr] == 0) {
    pc = jumptable[pc];
  }
  break;
case ']':
  if (memory[dataptr] != 0) {
    pc = jumptable[pc];
  }
  break; As you'd expect, optinterp is quite a bit faster; it takes only 18.4 seconds to run mandelbrot and 6.7 seconds to run factor — an improvement of more than a factor of 2! Optimized Interpreter: Take 2 The optimization applied in the previous section was very beneficial, but it's also fairly trivial. We avoid completely unnecessary work at run-time if we can just precompute it at compile time. To make our interpreter even faster, we'll have to get more creative. The first step in optimizing anything is measuring and profiling the current code. Some past experience helps avoid needless steps in this process. For example, it's fairly clear that almost 100% of the run-time of the interpreter will be spent in the single function that interprets the program; therefore, function/call profiling won't be of much help. The main loop is fairly small, however, and there doesn't appear to be much to optimize at first glance (disregarding micro-optimizations, which I won't worry about here). Well, except that this loop runs for every BF instruction encountered in the source program, so it can run tons of times. So, what we'll do is get a breakdown of the ops that execute during a typical program run. The code for optinterp already has this tracing included. It's protected with the BFTRACE preprocessor macro because it's costly and we want to avoid doing it in "real" runs. Here's the execution profile we get from a typical run of the factor benchmark on the prime 179424691. On the left is the operation, and on the right the number of times it was executed by the interpreter for the program at hand: .  -->  21
,  -->  10
+  -->  212,428,900
]  -->  242,695,606
<  -->  1,220,387,704
-  -->  212,328,376
>  -->  1,220,387,724
[  -->  118,341,127
.. Total: 3,226,569,468 A couple of immediate observations: The total number of operations is huge. Over 3 billion times around the main interpreter loop. It's a good thing we're using C++ for the interpreter — running 3 billion iterations of anything in a higher level language would be painful! The ratio of pointer movement instructions to loops is suspiciously high. There's something like 242 million loop iterations executed (the count for ]) but a total of 2.4 billion pointer moves: < and >. We'd expect and hope for the hot loops to be short and tight. Why is every loop doing so much? A cursory glance at the source of factor.bf provides a clue. Here's a representative snippet:   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<[<<<<<<<<<<]>>>>>>>>>>

These are necessary to get anything done because we want to be able to get from cell to cell to update data. Now let's think what it means to execute a sequence such as <<<<<<< in our interpreter. Our main loop executes 7 times, each time doing: Advance PC and compare it to program size. Grab the instruction at PC. Switch on the value of the instruction to the right case. Execute the case. That's quite expensive. What if we could compress all the long sequences of <<<<<<<? After all, what we do for a single < is: case '<':
  dataptr--;
  break; So, for seven <s, we could do: case ... something representing 7 <s ...:
  dataptr -= 7;
  break; This is easy to generalize. We can detect any consecutive sequence in the BF source and encode it as a pair: the operation, and the repetition count. Then at execution time we simply repeat the op the required number of times. The full code for this interpreter is optinterp2.cpp. Previously, we kept a separate jumptable correlated to the [ and ] instructions in the input program. Now we need extra information for every BF instruction, so we'll just translate the Program into a sequence of ops of the type: enum class BfOpKind {
  INVALID_OP = 0,
  INC_PTR,
  DEC_PTR,
  INC_DATA,
  DEC_DATA,
  READ_STDIN,
  WRITE_STDOUT,
  JUMP_IF_DATA_ZERO,
  JUMP_IF_DATA_NOT_ZERO
};

// Every op has a single numeric argument. For JUMP_* ops it's the offset to
// which a jump should be made; for all other ops, it's the number of times the
// op is to be repeated.
struct BfOp {
  BfOp(BfOpKind kind_param, size_t argument_param)
      : kind(kind_param), argument(argument_param) {}

  BfOpKind kind = BfOpKind::INVALID_OP;
  size_t argument = 0;
}; The interpretation happens in two steps. First, we run translate_program to read the program and generate a std::vector<BfOp>. This translation is pretty straightforward; it detects repetitions in ops like < and encodes them in the argument field. A slightly tricky aspect here is handling the jumps, since the offsets of all ops in the program change (a run of seven consecutive <s turns into a single DEC_PTR, for example). Take a look at the code for the full details. As planned, the main interpreter loop becomes: switch (kind) {
case BfOpKind::INC_PTR:
  dataptr += op.argument;
  break;
case BfOpKind::DEC_PTR:
  dataptr -= op.argument;
  break;
case BfOpKind::INC_DATA:
  memory[dataptr] += op.argument;
  break;
case BfOpKind::DEC_DATA:
  memory[dataptr] -= op.argument;
  break;
// [...] etc. How fast is it? The mandelbrot benchmark now takes 11.9 seconds and factor takes 3.7 seconds — another 40% reduction in run-time. Optimized Interpreter: Take 3 Our optimized interpreter now runs the mandelbrot benchmark more than 3x faster than the original, naive interpreter. Can we do even better? First, let's take a look at instruction tracing for optinterp2, repeating the previous experiment: .  -->  21
]  -->  242,695,606
,  -->  10
+  -->  191,440,613
<  -->  214,595,790
-  -->  205,040,514
>  -->  270,123,690
[  -->  118,341,127
.. Total: 1,242,237,371 The total instruction count went down almost 3x. Also, now the number of BF loop executions is more comparable to the number of other instructions, meaning that we don't do too much work in every iteration. This was our goal with the optimization of repetitions, after all. In fact, this execution profile is annoyingly flat. Performance gurus don't like flat profiles because there's nothing in particular sticking out that one could optimize. This usually means we should measure and trace something else as well. An interesting question worth answering is, what is every BF loop doing? In other words, what are the hottest loops we are running, and can we spend some more specialized effort to optimize them? This would require more sophisticated tracing machinery, which I've already included in the code of optinterp2. This machinery traces loops and records the instruction sequence executed by each loop iteration in the program. It then sorts them by the number of appearances and shows the most common (hottest) loops. Here is the result for the factor benchmark: -1<10+1>10      --> 32,276,219
-1              --> 28,538,377
-1<4+1>4        --> 15,701,515
-1>3+1>1+1<4    --> 12,581,941
-1>3+1>2+1<5    --> 9,579,970
-1<3+1>3        --> 9,004,028
>3              --> 8,911,600
-1<1-1>1        --> 6,093,976
-1>3+1<3        --> 6,085,735
-1<1+1<3+1>4    --> 5,853,530
-1>3+2<3        --> 5,586,229
>2              --> 5,416,630
-1>1+1<1        --> 5,104,333 What do these traces mean? The first, most common one says: Decrement current memory cell. Move 10 cells to the left. Increment current memory cell. Move 10 cells to the right. The loop doing this was executed 32 million times! Similarly, a loop doing the simple "decrement the current cell" was executed 28 million times. If you look in the source of factor.bf, these loops are easy to spot. The first one is [-<<<<<<<<<<+>>>>>>>>>>]; the second one is just [-]. What if we could optimize these loops entirely away? After all, they are doing something that is much easier to express in a higher-level language. [-] merely sets the current memory cell to 0. [-<<<<<<<<<<+>>>>>>>>>>] is more involved, but not much more: all it does is add the value of the current memory cell 10 cells to the left. The trace shown above features many loops of this kind, along with another; loops like [>>>] move to the right in jumps of 3 until encountering a non-zero cell. In optinterp2 we've added higher-level ops to the interpreter. We can add some even higher-level ops to optimize away these loops. optinterp3.cpp does just that. It adds a few more operation kinds for encoding common loops: enum class BfOpKind {
  INVALID_OP = 0,
  INC_PTR,
  DEC_PTR,
  INC_DATA,
  DEC_DATA,
  READ_STDIN,
  WRITE_STDOUT,
  LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO,
  LOOP_MOVE_PTR,
  LOOP_MOVE_DATA,
  JUMP_IF_DATA_ZERO,
  JUMP_IF_DATA_NOT_ZERO
}; The new ops are LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO, which replaces [-], LOOP_MOVE_PTR for loops like [>>>] and LOOP_MOVE_DATA for loops like [-<<<+>>>]. We'll now need a slightly more sophisticated translation step that detects these loops in the input program and emits the proper LOOP_* ops. For an example of how it's done, here's the translation for [-]: std::vector<BfOp> optimize_loop(const std::vector<BfOp>& ops,
                                size_t loop_start) {
  std::vector<BfOp> new_ops;

  if (ops.size() - loop_start == 2) {
    BfOp repeated_op = ops[loop_start + 1];
    if (repeated_op.kind == BfOpKind::INC_DATA ||
        repeated_op.kind == BfOpKind::DEC_DATA) {
      new_ops.push_back(BfOp(BfOpKind::LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO, 0));

  // [...] This function is called when translating the BF program to a sequence of ops. loop_start is the index in ops where the most recent loop starts. The code shown above detects the case where the only contents of the loop is a single - (or + since in BF memory cells hold unsigned values with wrap-around). In such cases, a LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO op is emitted. When the interpreter itself runs into a LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO, it does just what you'd expect: case BfOpKind::LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO:
  memory[dataptr] = 0;
  break; The other loop optimizations are a tiny bit more involved, but all follow the same basic idea. We expect this optimization to be very significant. We've just taken some of the hottest loops the program runs and folded them into a single, efficient instruction (or a sequence of efficient instructions for pointer-movement loops). And indeed, optinterp3 is very fast: 3.9 seconds on mandelbrot and 1.97 seconds on factor. The overall speedup is dramatic. optinterp3 is almost 10x faster than simpleinterp on our benchmarks. While we could certainly make it even faster, I think these optimizations are sufficient for our needs; let's talk about what we can learn from them instead. On Compilers, Bytecode, and Tracing JITs It turns out there's a surprising amount of insight to be gained from the exercise this post went through. First, let's start with the distinction between compilers and interpreters. According to Wikipedia, a compiler is: a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. GCC would be the canonical example of this; it transforms source code written in C (or C++) into assembly language for, say, Intel CPUs. But there are many other kinds of compilers: Chicken compiles Scheme into C; Rhino compiles JavaScript to JVM bytecode; the Clang frontend compiles C++ to LLVM IR. CPython, the canonical Python implementation compiles Python source code to bytecode, and so on. In general, the term Bytecode refers to any intermediate representation or virtual instruction set designed for efficient interpretation. Based on this definition, while simpleinterp is indeed just a BF interpreter, the optimized interpreters described here are more like compilers + bytecode interpreters. Consider optinterp3, for example. The source language is BF; the target language is bytecode with the following instruction set: enum class BfOpKind {
  INVALID_OP = 0,
  INC_PTR,
  DEC_PTR,
  INC_DATA,
  DEC_DATA,
  READ_STDIN,
  WRITE_STDOUT,
  LOOP_SET_TO_ZERO,
  LOOP_MOVE_PTR,
  LOOP_MOVE_DATA,
  JUMP_IF_DATA_ZERO,
  JUMP_IF_DATA_NOT_ZERO
}; ...where each instruction has a single argument. optinterp3 first compiles BF to this bytecode, and only then executes the bytecode. So if we squint a bit, there's a JIT compiler here already - with the caveat that the compilation target is not executable machine code but rather this specialized bytecode. Worry not - we'll get to a real JIT in the next part of the series. Finally, I'd like to point out that the loop optimizations performed in optinterp3 are the static version of a tracing JIT. We used tracing to observe which loops occur most commonly in our benchmarks, and optimized these loops. While the loops we optimized were very generic and surely appear in most large BF programs, we could take it further. We could optimize even more of the hottest loops, but with time we'd get into more specialized paths in our particular benchmarks. To be fully generic, we'd have to defer this optimization to run-time, which is what a tracing JIT does. A tracing JIT interprets code in the source language and keeps track of the hottest loops (and for dynamic languages, of the actual run-time types of values flowing through the loops). When the same loop goes over some threshold (say, invoked more than a million times) the loop is optimized and compiled into efficient machine code. Parting Words for Part I In this post, we've seen an interpreter for BF being gradually refined from a naive approach to a compile-to-optimized-bytecode approach, speeding it up 10x in the process. Hopefully, this provides a good feel for the source language, as well as some of the tradeoffs involved in optimizing for it. In the next part of the series, I'll present an actual JIT for BF - compiling BF into tight x64 machine code and invoking it, all at run-time. I'll show how to construct such a JIT compiler entirely from scratch (using nothing but the standard system libraries) and also how to use assembly encoding libraries for easier development.
