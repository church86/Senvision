		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: HP More like this Intel's Kaby Lake chips will include integrated 4K graphics processors Kaby Lake starts strong as Intel retools PC strategy Move over Skylake: An Asus PC with Intel's Kaby Lake chip is coming in Q3 Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles HP may have tried, but it couldn't hold the secrets of Intel's unreleased Kaby Lake and Apollo Lake CPU chips close to its chest. Some details on the new chips were unintentionally shared by HP in the maintenance documents of an unannounced PC, the Pavilion x360 m1. PCs with Kaby Lake -- called 7th Generation Core chips -- are expected to ship this quarter. It is a highly anticipated successor to Intel's Skylake chips, with performance and multimedia improvements. Asus announced the Transformer 3 tablet PC with Kaby Lake in June but didn't share specific chip details. Lenovo and Acer will announce new Kaby Lake PCs at the IFA trade show starting at the end of the month. The Pavilion x360 m1 convertible PC  -- which means it can be a laptop or tablet -- can be configured with the dual-core Core i3-7100U running at 2.40GHz. The chip draws 15 watts of power and has 3MB of cache. The Core i3-7100U chip details provide basic insight into the capabilities of other Kaby Lake chips. The chip has an HD Graphics 620 processor, which is capable of DirectX 12 gaming, and has high-definition video decoding built in. Intel has already said Kaby Lake chips will be capable of running 4K video. The Pavilion x360 m1 can also be configured with an upcoming Pentium or Celeron chip code-named Apollo Lake. Both the Apollo Lake chips are surprisingly power-efficient and draw only six watts of power, which means long battery life. The Apollo Lake chips are based on the Goldmont architecture, which was originally designed for Atom chips. The Apollo Lake chip options for the Pavilion x360 m1 include Pentium N4200, which runs at 1.1GHz, but can go up to 2.5GHz, or the Celeron N3350, which can go up to 2.4GHz. The chips have 2MB of L2 cache. Other specifications point the Pavilion x360 m1 to being a low-cost PC. It will have an 11.6-inch screen that displays images at 1366 x 768-pixel resolution, and will support DDR4 and DDR3 DRAM, depending on the chipset. It will support hard drives or SSDs. Surprisingly, it'll include only 802.11n Wi-Fi, not the latest 802.11ac. It will have USB 3.0 and 2.0 slots, not a Type-C port.

View Latest Posts >>> Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia (Part IV) By Preston James, Ph.D on August 12, 2016 Your mind is always the main target of the Top Command of the Khazarian Mafia, then your assets and then your very life... Your Brain interfacing with Wifi (Artist’s representation) by Preston James Without the Earth shattering disclosures made by Gordon Duff at the International Counterterrorism Conference in 2014, you would never be reading about the Khazarian Mafia by name anywhere on the Internet, even here. Gordon Duff representing the US delegation final report at the Damascus counter terrorism conference… Dec 02. 2014 It was VT Chairman Gordon Duff that first disclosed that the root cause of so-called “world terrorism” was actually the world’s largest organized crime syndicate. Gordon Duff did not specifically name this world’s largest organized crime syndicate in the first part of his speech which was unclassified and made public. Within minutes of its delivery, this historical ground-breaking speech was scrutinized by every major government and Intel agency, and sent shock-waves around the world. A short time later it was VT’s Financial Editor and Talk Show host Mike Harris that named this world’s largest organized crime syndicate publicly for the first time ever, and referred to it specifically by its proper name as the Khazarian Mafia.  Without these bold first-time disclosures of Gordon Duff and Mike Harris, VT readers would not have been able to connect the dots and begin to understand what the Khazarian Mafia (KM) is or how it has parasitized America and most of the world. Nor would they be able to understand what the KM has done to rise to such world power and where it is within striking distance to take down the whole world and complete its evil Globalist NWO one-world agenda. And without these bold disclosures you would continue seeing and feeling the negative effects of this world’s largest organized crime syndicate the KM everywhere in your daily life, but you would not know its name, its history, its composition, what empowers it. Nor would you understand what the overall agenda of this world’s largest organized crime syndicate is. And this syndicate’s agenda just happens to be asset stripping, induced death, war and destruction for profit, power, and world domination, all intended to produce Globalist NWO one-world government end-state run by this world’s largest organized crime syndicate. And it is now pretty clear that without the emergence of some very high level, very informed and very disgusted Intel Cowboys from all over the world, there would be no major leaks of the secret evil that the Khazarian Mafia (KM) has been perpetrating all over the world and in America, their home economic and military base. The KM has always known that if various renegade Intel disclosed their secret evil this could be a serious threat to their syndicate’s power. That is why they set up so many advanced procedures to compartmentalize all areas of Intel — the higher you go, the more narrow the scope. Mike Harris, host of the radio show “The Short End of the Stick,” on the Freedom Slips radio network, is interviewed by Syrian TV This has all been done in an effort to keep high ranking Intel from connecting the dots and understanding that they are working as part of system to destroy their own nation, their own families and humankind itself. Because when some Intel gain too much information about the KM crimes committed under the cover of invoked “national security” a certain percentage will secretly rebel. That secret rebellion can take the form of sandbagging (working hard but producing little) or leaking damaging information through various complex means. In recent years Intel Cowboys from all over the world have rebelled because they could not accept the big picture they discovered in their jobs. Some have organized into groups which have become such powerful factions that are able to openly speak out and resist the evils of the KM. It is now known beyond any shadow of a doubt that the KM Top Chieftains who sit at the top of the pyramidal Establishment Hierarchy are the top policy-makers in America and maintain a set of Core Edicts upon which they base their policy mandates on. These are reflected in USG Laws and most large corporate policies. Part I, Part II, & Part III have disclosed many of their Core Edicts. It’s a fact that the Top Chieftains of the KM control the CIA and other Intel agencies and use so-called “National Security” as cover for their crimes. You can read about Bohemian Grove anywhere now The KM cannot continue to exist without their ability to maintain abject secrecy and everyday the Internet, the world’s New Gutenberg Press is eroding that secrecy. Use of National Security as cover for these serious RICO and International crimes by the KM is itself a most serious crime against the USA, We The People and the World. The KM is the biggest RICO crime syndicate in America and commits the most serious US and International crimes ever. Some of these crimes are so serious that they are almost unimaginable such as engineered staged wars with millions of dead and wounded with many are innocent civilians, women and children. Right now the main Intel agency used by the KM inside America is the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA is bifurcated and employs many innocent analysts and agents who collect Intel by various means but do not engage in evil, anti-human covert operations. But there is an evil covert part of the CIA which engages in frequent wetwork, abroad and inside the USA, massive mind-kontrol operations against We The People using super high tech Psychotronics, working with the US Military to traffick in trillions of dollars of illegal narcotics and weapons to raise “off the books” black ops money. Limitless off-the-books Black Ops money underwrites synthetic terror and advances fascistic agendas But the most important function that the CIA and the other Intel agencies that are completely controlled by the KM are the covert operations deployed to create synthetic terror, fake enemies, which are needed to start wars and justify huge military deployments. Mercenaries are hired for this, but there are even more sinister methods used. Saudi Arabia has always provided a great deal of funding to pick up young orphans off the street and place them in special schools to raise them and mind-kontrol them to function as crazed, suicidal terrorist bombers, painted as Islamic extremists. These mind-kontrolled subjects can then be triggered anytime they are needed to sacrifice themselves and produce the mass terror needed to start wars and justify more and more centralization of KM power exhibited as invisible Secret Shadow Government (SSG) power and visible USG power. The KM Top Chieftains love to consolidate institutions, and industries in order centralize power and make it much easier for themselves to exert control over the USG and We The People. That is why they used their Gladio-style, inside-job false-flag attack on America on 9-11-01 as an excuse to consolidate all American Alphabets and Law Enforcement into one centralized hierarchy they labelled Homeland Security (DHS). The name “Homeland Security” itself a mockery of the US Constitution and everything our Founding Fathers fought for in the Revolutionary War. This new Centralized hierarchical control of all such agencies by the KM’s Top Chieftains makes it easy for the KM to implement their Core Edicts as USG policies (many remaining secret, some made public). These Top Chieftains of course installed perverted, deeply compromised doofuses at the head of DHS to run it, soulless dupes who will do whatever the KM Top Chieftains mandate, no matter the US Constitution and common decency. Anyone who crosses them significantly gets whacked by their soulless wetboy teams, usually “arkencided”, a term that arose because of all the Dixie Mafia murders for the CIA surrounding the Mena operation and the Clintons. The term “arkencide” is when the CIA wetboys murder a whistle-blower or someone deemed as a potential threat for knowing too much that they could become an unnecessary risk later on, or someone who has stepped outside allowed parameters. Jesse Ventura interview on Youtube with Dr. Robert Duncan, mind control expert In the typical arkencide, it is customary for local police to stand-down at the request of Intel and for a crooked coroner and mortuary to be used. Absurd circumstances are knowingly created to serve as a warning message to anyone else who might be tempted to step outside of allowed parameters. Here is the bottom line of the Core Edicts of the KM Top Chieftains: To foment large criminal operations to make vast fortunes by which they plan to buy up the whole world and run it themselves, step by step. These operations include: massive counterfeiting (their own private Fiat Currency rented out to the American users); massive illegal drug trafficking; massive illegal and legal arms trafficking; massive money laundering; bust out schemes against the American People using color of law like the S&L scam, the Enron Scam, the Mortgage Bubble/MERS scam, and the “Bailouts”; Wall Street Plunge Protection Street scam where the USG has acquired about 1/2 of all US stocks through proprietaries, thus driving the stock prices up synthetically; sophisticated eugenics programs to promote obesity, disease and mass death in order to thin the herd by 90%; a secret space war program and secret alliances with certain Alien ET groups; electronic weather control and warfare; and last but the most important operation, large scale psychotronic mind-kontrol. This Jesse Ventura interview with Dr. Robert Duncan can not be embedded in this article, but for the time being can be watched here. _________ Conclusion The bottom line is that the KM is driven by an unimaginably evil inter-generational Globalist NWO Agenda to create a one-world government run by them alone. Their power is gained and exercised through their counterfeit FIAT Money Power. They have been able to capture most of the world in their spider web of fake money which is nothing but printed and issued debt notes. And the rest of the world is now catching on, especially the Russian Federation and China. Khadafy caught on, and the KM murdered him and plundered his nation through US Dept. of State doofus Cutouts. Assad and Syria have caught on and the KM is working overtime trying to depose Assad and destroy Syria’s infrastructure and Putin and the Russian Federation have now completely checkmated the KM in Syria and have decimated the KM/Israeli/USG created ISIS mercenaries. Iran has caught on and you can bet that the Russian Federation will also protect this ally from KM destruction like they have Syria. The whole world is now closing in on the KM, and it’s going to be a battle to the end; the KM is going to go down hard, but it will go down. The KM’s game has always been to take over the whole world and rule it themselves as kings running a feudal kingdom, with everyone else their serfs and slaves – at least those remaining 10% who have not all been mass murdered by the time they plan to exercise complete world control. To complete their evil Globalist NWO one-world Agenda, the KM must continue creating massive wars and running large scale international organized crime scams. They must control the lives and hearts and minds of We The People and convince us that our serfdom is desirable, or at least we are powerless to do anything about it. Every day the KM’s control is waning, as more and more of their Colossal lies are revealed. We are now all in a race to the finish point, there is only room for one victor, We the People or the Top Chieftains of the Khazarian Mafia. You can be sure of this one thing however. If the KM wins and complete their agenda they will whack all their doofus Cutouts because they will no longer need them. None of these folks will ever expect such a result, but it’s a given if the KM wins this battle for Planet earth. Yes, it’s now a major race between the KM’s efforts to control the American People and the American People’s public activism to expose these large scale KM crimes and stop them before they mass-murder most of us. If We The People lose this battle, darkness will descend completely over America and the rest of the world. Putin and the Russian Federation and the Chinese are now hip to this KM evil Agenda and have created a major financial firewall against the KM consisting of the BRICS Nations, the AIIB and new Chinese money wire system and the coming silk road railway and commerce lanes. In time, this will likely produce an end to the US Petro Dollar as the world’s exchange currency, and may push America over a financial cliff. That alone could mean the end of the KM hegemony. How much better it would be if We The People rose up at every level and organized to take control of our government before that happens. — Diane Birch is an up and comer well on her way to becoming a superstar.

This person is an astounding lady, a fearless truth warrior supreme. nawlins  August 16, 2016 at 7:29 am Let there be no misunderstanding. If the KM loses, they will destroy the planet. They are already doing it, but before they go they will literally lay waste to the earth. This attitude is actually quite common among criminals in power, to destroy that which they cannot control. The samson option is no joke, and no bluff. These “people” are truly evil on a level that is difficult for a rational mind to comprehend. The very idea makes the senses reel. Log in to Reply Dave Johnson  August 14, 2016 at 6:15 pm The KM relies on the continued acceptance of the military-alien complex.

But this of course is a closely guarded secret. Like I keep saying, VT readers are bright, insightful and remarkably well informed. They are aware of how things really are, far beyond most Members of Congress and the CMMM who are Cutouts and bought and owned dupes and live by engendered illusions dictated by the KM Top Chieftains. ayelyahbenjamin  August 14, 2016 at 5:15 pm altering the course of a History pre-written for our destruction… resting in the best of men, standing up, stepping forward and taking lies by the throat, squeezing hard…. they dropped in full view of the world, represented there in Dec 2014 Counter Terrorism Conference in Damascus … eyes opened along with a new path, as new vision emerged of a better future for all humanity, with all the means in our hands and hearts to materialize Log in to Reply darrelld  August 14, 2016 at 5:13 pm Dr James would have more credibility if he left out the E.T.- alien rubbish. UFOs are not occupied by E.T.s, they are preternatural manifestations by demons from hell and are meant to confuse us and weaken our faith in Jesus Christ and in the Church he founded, which happens to be the Catholic Church – despite all its warts and wrinkles and having been infiltrated by jews and freemasons who seek to destroy it from without and from within. Log in to Reply jensingr  August 15, 2016 at 4:32 pm Darelld, It is a very complex area to comprehend and even harder to write about. Preston James does a tremendous job trying to present an explanation of these beings and their agenda. Either way, the demonic world and the negative ET’s are working together to bring down civilization as we know it. I agree with you about the Catholic Church being infiltrated with those who seek to destroy it from within. Preston James, Ph.D  August 16, 2016 at 5:42 am In the past I used to think this Alien ET stuff was psyops thus fake and used as a cover for many new US secret defense projects and new high tech weapon systems. And that was true to a large extent. However when someone has a real witnessed encounter with a real Alien ET then this changes everything. Many including myself have had such encounters which are witnessed by at least one other person and cannot be written off as fantasy or psyops/false cover. When that happens it changes one’s mindset and one can then seek out others who have dealt with these matters inside certain sectors of Intel who are willing to disclose. Jade  August 14, 2016 at 11:46 am Dr. James and all that can see this, I’ve personally been working on a project, partially inspired by your work, that solves A LOT of the problems with the KM et al. end game.

Lisa Sperling  August 14, 2016 at 10:47 am Please read BEHIND THE DICTATORS by Leo Lehmann. The Jesuit Society, which runs the Roman Catholic Church/Holy See/SS and the entire fiat money system worldwide: the IMF, all central banks, BIS, IMF, has been behind the Nazis and the Ustachi, and all murderous regimes. In 1873, their “devout” Catholic Renan publicized the Khazar accusation. The great evil behind the world system is central banking. And central banking is controlled by the Jesuits for the RCC. Log in to Reply darrelld  August 14, 2016 at 5:00 pm It’s amazing how often one hears the absurd claim that the Jesuits control this and that and are behind all these evils in the world. Such claims have their origin in Jewish, Freemasonic, as well as Protestant sources. In reality, the Jesuits are not very powerful, and are, since the 1960s after Vatican II, by and large non-Catholic in their thinking and serve the interests of the diabolical ruling elite (KM), and when historically they did have a lot of influence, as in the 16th-18th C., they were probably the principal force opposing The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit (see E Michael Jones’s magisterial book of that title) and did more good for Europe and the Americas and beyond than we can ever imagine. Keep in mind who writes the history books. Go to alternative sources such as Warren Carroll’s “History of Christendom.” jonnbrown  August 13, 2016 at 4:55 pm GREAT article as always Dr. James. Thanks. Log in to Reply jensingr  August 13, 2016 at 12:57 pm It seems right after Gordon Duff and members of the U.S delegation revealed the true “organized crime syndicate” at the counter terrorism conference in Damascus…. they started hatching a plan to take down Assad. Log in to Reply eileenkuch  August 13, 2016 at 11:06 pm Thank God, Gordon Duff and the members of the US delegation revealed the true “organized crime syndicate” at the counter-terrorism conference in Damascus. The KM had just started hatching a plan to take down Bashar al-Assad when these revelations were made. Furthermore, thank God you’ve been informing many of us through your writings the evil plans and deeds of this most evil syndicate in world history – both in the VT website and in the VT magazine, Professor James. You have been a light within the darkness, awakening millions of people worldwide. The Internet isn’t known as the new Gutenberg Press for nothing. Just as the Gutenberg Press did for Europe’s population back in the early 16th Century, the Internet is doing for the world’s population. You and your colleagues at VT are a Godsend; and without your articles, none of us would’ve been able to connect the dots. Thank you so very much. Spiritual Warrior  August 14, 2016 at 7:15 am They visited Syria in 2014..the fake “civil war” started in 2011. jensingr  August 16, 2016 at 4:38 pm “the fake civil war started in 2011”, and there has always been a plan to cause the destruction of that country… order out of chaos, so that the Israeli’s can go in and take over. They want all the land around them. They create the turmoil in every country. They want Christians fighting Muslims, and killing each other so they don’t have to do it. They did however, step up the plan to get rid of Assad aggressively after the meeting in Damascus and used the CMMM to do their bidding and get Americans behind it. The military wasn’t having it. jensingr  August 13, 2016 at 12:39 pm “Bohemian Grove” – now a household phrase! Everyone lets meet there next year for family vacations… show up by the thousands and camp all around the area and do a little “disrupting”! btw, Is that Bush getting 30 lashes from Jesus?

I mean it they can put a program in somebody that activates say twenty years later, it is pretty daunting stuff that could become like a pandemic in years to come as subliminal a get all the more sophisticated down to minute details.

Trakkath  August 13, 2016 at 8:17 am Lately they shot one of this CIA-chemtrail planes down near the chinese border with containers of bird-flu. Must look for the link of that story. Trakkath  August 13, 2016 at 8:19 am Yes, Israel has them too and has also protests against them by normal people in Israel. Most of them are hostage taken by the RKM as human shield.

Why would any particular country be exempt from chemtrails? This is not human against human warfare. It’s non-human against human. jensingr  August 13, 2016 at 12:29 pm right CG… the filth they are spraying including lithium which triggers violent behavior in some, nano-filament fibers which cause morgellons and various flu viruses along with all the other chemical poisons toxic to humans, plants and water, is meant to kill us ALL off. Hybrids will be immune to the toxins. This is what the stupid NWO psychopaths don’t get! They will be terminated when their usefullness is dissipated. Trakkath  August 14, 2016 at 10:18 am @jensingr as far as I remember is that lithium is core element of most tranquillizers so no wonder none wants to rebell against this system and fell asleep instead. jensingr  August 15, 2016 at 4:21 pm Trakkath: yes, they have been using lithium to treat bipolar disorder, manic depression, aggression, rushed speech, and many other conditions. However, if anyone is like me, it would have the opposite effect and CAUSE these symptoms. ( If any cold medication says it will make me sleepy, it makes me stay awake and vice versa. ) I absolutely do not even feel nitrous oxide at the dentist. I have heard of some studies with people who have bipolar or depression that wanted to get off of celexa, or cymbalta, etc that were given lithium to help with the withdrawals. Then the lithium actually caused very negative reactions in these case studies. So they of course know this from their studies and started dropping it on the population knowing that certain people will react violently. jensingr  August 15, 2016 at 4:46 pm Trakkath: yes, they have been using lithium to treat bipolar disorder, manic depression, aggression, rushed speech, and many other conditions. However, if anyone is like me, it would have the opposite effect and CAUSE these symptoms. ( If any cold medication says it will make me sleepy, it makes me stay awake and vice versa. ) I absolutely do not even feel nitrous oxide at the dentist.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Re-examining the unusual frame time results in our Radeon RX 470 review by Jeff Kampman  1:33 PM on August 12, 2016 It's never fun to admit a mistake, but we made a big one while writing our recent Radeon RX 470 review. That piece was our first time out on a new test rig that included an Intel Core i7-6700K CPU and an ASRock Z170 Extreme7+ motherboard. Once we got that system up and running, it delivered some weird-looking frame time numbers with some games. For example, the spikiness of the frame-time plot below didn't match any test data we had ever gathered before for Grand Theft Auto V, and we puzzled over those strange results for some time. We decided to go ahead and publish them anyway after doing some extended troubleshooting without seeing any improvement. Compare that to a more typical GTA V result from our Radeon RX 480 review, as demonstrated by three GeForce cards running on an X99 testbed: The spikiness caused by what turned out to be high deferred procedure call (or DPC) latency didn't seem to affect average framerates much (save one major exception), but it did worsen our 99th-percentile frame time numbers considerably. Given how much we use those 99th-percentile numbers in formulating other parts of our conclusions, especially value plots, the error introduced this way had considerable negative effects on the accuracy of several key parts of our review. The net effect of this error led us to wrongly conclude that the Radeon RX 480 8GB and the Radeon RX 470 were closely matched in performance, when in fact they're quite different. Upon reflection, we should have stopped the RX 470 review at that point to try and figure out exactly what was going on, but the pressure of deadlines got the better of us. When these weird frame-time plots appeared once more in the preliminary testing work for our review of the Radeon RX 460, however, we had to acknowlege that something unusual was going on. Of course, that also meant that our published RX 470 review had problems that we had to deal with. We believe that in the interest of full transparency, it's important to explain exactly what happened, be clear about how we messed up, and resolve not to make the same mistakes in the future. The issue While I was testing the Radeon RX 460 and tearing my hair out over the wild frame time plots our cards were generating, TR code wizard Bruno "morphine" Ferreira brought the possibility of high DPC latency to my attention. DPC latency is usually of interest to musicians running digital audio workstations, where consistently minimal input lag is critical. Bruno pointed me to the LatencyMon app, which keeps an eye on DPC performance and warns of any issues, as a way of figuring out whether DPC latency was the root cause of this problem. LatencyMon thinks something is up with my main desktop. I'll have to look into it soon. I didn't capture any screenshots during my frenzied troubleshooting, but LatencyMon did show that our test rig wasn't servicing DPC requests promptly. Wireless networking drivers are generally considered the first place to look when troubleshooting DPC issues, and I use an Intel Wireless-N 6205 card in our test system. Oops. Even after disabling that wireless card, however, the issue persisted. After killing every potential bit of software that might have been causing the problem without getting any improvements, I took Bruno's suggestion of updating our motherboard's firmware. "The BIOS can't possibly be the cause!" I thought to myself smugly. Pride goeth before a fall, of course, and the DPC latency issue vanished with the new ASRock firmware installed. The frame-time plots for GTA V began to resemble the flat, tight lines we've come to expect with modern hardware. I had to quash the urge to drive over the motherboard a few times and burn the remains before coming to grips with the fact that I would have to throw out large amounts of testing data. So what happened? You see, ASRock sent us its Z170 Extreme7+ board during a brief period in which the company was promoting its ability to overclock locked Intel CPUs with a beta BIOS. I had hoped to explore that possibility with some ASRock motherboards and cheap CPUs, but Intel swiftly put the kibosh on the concept. We got busy with other work, and the beta firmware remained on the motherboard through our first attempts to test graphics cards with it. I don't know precisely what was wrong with this beta firmware that was causing it to wreak havoc on DPC latency, but updating the firmware did fix it, so Occam's razor suggests something weird was going on. The fallout Having solved the underlying problem, I now had to contend with the fact that I had published a very public and widely-read review that contained what seemed like reams of contaminated data. To see just how wrong I had been in my conclusions, I retested every title we had slated for our RX 470 and RX 460 reviews on our ASRock test rig, using the same settings we had initially chosen for our reviews. As it turns out, high DPC latency doesn't affect every game equally, or at least not in a way that shows up in our frame-time numbers. While GTA V, Hitman, and Rise of the Tomb Raider all showed significant changes in average FPS and 99th-percentile frame times after a retest on the updated hardware,  Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 did not. That second trio of games certainly felt more responsive to input after the critical firmware update, but the data they generated wasn't meaningfully different. We're talking fractions of milliseconds of difference in before-and-after testing, and those deltas are almost certainly imperceptible in real-life gaming. Given that behavior, we're confident that the numbers we generated for Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 are representative of the performance of the Radeon RX 460, the Radeon RX 470, and the other cards we tested in those reviews.  The resolution Given the large differences in performance we saw with GTA V, Hitman, and RoTR, the only acceptable way to fix our mistake was to retest all of the cards in our Radeon RX 470 review from the ground up with those games. We've done that now, and as a bonus, we did that retesting with the same data-collection methods we just premiered in our RX 460 review. As a result, we now have Doom Vulkan and OpenGL numbers for the RX 470 and RX 480, plus DirectX 12 numbers for Rise of the Tomb Raider and Hitman. We've also extensively re-written the conclusion of our Radeon RX 470 review to account for this new data, much in the same way that we crunched our results for the Radeon RX 460 and friends. We've accounted for the differences in our results there, so I'd encourage you to go read up on what changed. If you read our original Radeon RX 470 review, we're deeply sorry to have misinformed you. We also extend our sincerest apologies to everybody at AMD and Nvidia for presenting incorrect information and misguided conclusions about their products. In the future, we'll strive to be both correct and swift with our reviews, but we also won't hesitate to delay a piece when clear warning flags are evident. We hope this clarification reinforces your trust in The Tech Report's reporting. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a comment below or email me directly.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Here’s Why NVIDIA is the Next Intel August 12, 2016 2:14pm NASDAQ:NVDA ShareTweet Chipset maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making a case to become the most important name in the microchip world — even surpassing its behemoth rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The reason is simple: NVIDIA’s technology is being used in far more game-changing devices, which puts it at the forefront of technological innovation for the next several years. From CNBC: Nvidia’s semiconductors are powering innovation in some of the world’s fastest growing industries. Its core graphics processing units (GPUs) enable popular video games like “Battlefield 4” and “Call of Duty: Black Ops III.” And as computing rapidly evolves in the cloud and Internet of Things, Nvidia’s technology is being adopted by companies focused on big data, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. Brian Alger, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, has been bullish on the stock for a while. “They’re in several massive growth markets where they have differentiated solutions, very few competitors and are executing extremely well,” Alger said. Massive growth markets and very few competitors? That’s how people were talking about Intel in the late 90s, when the company went from an unknown to one of the faces of the technological revolution. When it comes to what remains of its competition, well, NVIDIA investors shouldn’t be worried. AMD no longer poses much of a threat. That company has lost money each of the past four years and, when it comes to Nvidia’s newer businesses, there aren’t many rivals. Again, this sounds exactly like Intel when it first began taking off. Back then, a company called Cyrix was making processors too. But they fizzled and went out of business entirely, leaving Intel as the only game in town. When it comes to artificial intelligence, NVIDIA isn’t just the clear leader. They’re the only name anyone of consequence in the space even thinks about. Nvidia is selling its technology into data centers, which are rapidly moving towards machine learning and artificial intelligence. Within data centers, Nvidia has gained traction in recent years helping businesses process mounds of data coming from all the devices connected to the Internet. The next step is training those machines through algorithms to learn like humans. … Nvidia “anticipated the emergence of these applications and invested in these applications and helped develop them, whereas their main competitor AMD was more constrained and resource challenged,” said Ian Ing, an analyst at MKM Partners. He has a buy rating on the stock and a $64 price target. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said in a podcast last month that Nvidia has “seemingly overnight” become the market leader in chips used for artificial intelligence. “Every sharp AI software entrepreneur that comes in here is now building on top of Nvidia’s chips,” Andreessen said. Automakers, too, are using NVIDIA’s technology in their audio/video systems. And NVIDIA leads the way in autonomous driving chips as well. That’s a niche market now, but will explode tenfold in the coming years, say analysts. Once upon a time, the only people who’d heard of NVIDIA were PC gamers looking to max out the high-resolution graphics performance of their gaming rigs. Now, the company has made it to the big time, and seems to have a date with destiny: a seat at the table next to Intel as microchip royalty. NVIDIA shares rose $2.54 (+4.25%) to $62.24 in Friday afternoon trading. NVDA has gained 89% year-to-date, making it the second best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Dan Heilman. Updated August 12, 2016 10:42AM SHARE ALSO SEE Microsoft Windows 10 Windows 7 Windows 8.1 Intel Skylake Kaby Lake AMD Operating System Upgrade Enterprise IT Top Tech News Perhaps bowing to popular demand, Microsoft this week backed off a previous announcement that it would end support for some machines running its Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems next year. On its blog, Microsoft said it will patch those two operating systems on PCs that run Intel’s Skylake chip until 2020 in the case of Windows 7 and 2023 in the case of Windows 8.1. However, in January, Microsoft said it would end most support on the two operating systems next July if they were running on machines equipped with Intel's Skylake line of processors. "We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates," wrote Shad Larsen, a director of Windows business planning, on a Microsoft blog. "We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes [to Windows 10]." Exempt List Microsoft referred to the deadline extension as a clarification of its previous announcement. Microsoft initially attributed the decision to end support to Windows 7 because of its age and the headaches that that Microsoft and original equipment manufacturers would face ensuring that Windows 7, which debuted in 2009, was running on Intel's latest architecture. The company backed off that announcement in March, saying that it was extending the support exit date by a year, to July 18, 2018. After that date, the company and its computer-making partners would not guarantee that they would revise device drivers to support Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer hardware. The end-of-support dates are now January 14, 2020 for Windows 7 and January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1. After the new deadlines, Skylake-powered PCs on a list of exempt devices compiled by Microsoft will only get patches for the most serious flaws.

Managing Migration The curtailing of support hasn't been popular with computer makers, either. Earlier this year, Lenovo suggested that it didn’t agree with the deadline, possibly sensing that customers would hesitate to buy new computers knowing that they would have to migrate to Windows 10 by mid-2017. Microsoft still plans to support only Windows 10 on Intel's Skylake successor, an architecture called Kaby Lake, and on AMD's next-generation Bristol Ridge chip.

That appears to mean that improving the hardware for older operating systems will eventually make less sense.

On its blog, Microsoft said it will patch those two operating systems on PCs that run Intel’s Skylake chip until 2020 in the case of Windows 7 and 2023 in the case of Windows 8.1. However, in January, Microsoft said it would end most support on the two operating systems next July if they were running on machines equipped with Intel's Skylake line of processors. "We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates," wrote Shad Larsen, a director of Windows business planning, on a Microsoft blog. "We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes [to Windows 10]." Exempt List Microsoft referred to the deadline extension as a clarification of its previous announcement. Microsoft initially attributed the decision to end support to Windows 7 because of its age and the headaches that that Microsoft and original equipment manufacturers would face ensuring that Windows 7, which debuted in 2009, was running on Intel's latest architecture. The company backed off that announcement in March, saying that it was extending the support exit date by a year, to July 18, 2018. After that date, the company and its computer-making partners would not guarantee that they would revise device drivers to support Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer hardware. The end-of-support dates are now January 14, 2020 for Windows 7 and January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1. After the new deadlines, Skylake-powered PCs on a list of exempt devices compiled by Microsoft will only get patches for the most serious flaws. Skylake devices not on that exempt list won’t receive those patches. The initial end-of-support dates were decried by many computer users who felt Microsoft was using them to force customers into moving to the Windows 10 operating system.

Spend it on essential IP Seagate Nytro M.2 card 12 Aug 2016 at 16:02, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp, Dell Recent Articles Intel punches out data centre flash cardlet NYSE halts trading in Violin Memory shares Datto launches backup and disaster recovery technology to combat ransomware Analysis As well as launching several new flash products, Seagate revealed the four pillars of its flash product strategy at the August 9-11 Flash Memory Summit in Santa Clara. These were: Foundry independence Essential IP for system-wide use of flash Portfolio expansion Top-level cloud supplier Let's have a waltz around the Seagate flash dance floor to explore these four areas. The foundry independence point confirms that Seagate has no interest in integrating a foundry-level, NAND chip-making business into its existing operation. As has been pointed out many times before, this vertically integrated disk drive manufacturer sees no benefit to it of becoming a vertically integrated flash drive supplier. Its number-crunchers must have pushed numbers through their spreadsheets to explore the financial implications and, we presume, concluded that Seagate can make more money by deploying its capital and credit resources in building disk drives rather than by siphoning some off into setting up a vertically integrated NAND business by, for example, buying SK- Hynix, or partnering Intel/Micron or Samsung. It will buy NAND chips on the open market or via supply deals with flash fabbers such as Micron, with whom it has a relationship. A partnership with Toshiba is ruled out because WD got there first by buying Toshiba’s foundry partner, SanDisk. We assume here that Seagate’s flash strategy is actually its general non-volatile memory strategy and includes post-flash technologies such as XPoint in its scope. System-wide flash IP Pillar two is gaining essential IP for the system-wide use of flash. This is interesting. Let’s see what it might mean. Flash can be deployed in servers in: NVDIMM format, PCIe card format, Standard 2.5-inch or, 3.5-inch disk bay format with SATA, SAS or NVMe connectivity, Disk drive caching use, In storage arrays in a proprietary card format as used by DSSD, Pure Storage’s FlashBlade or Violin Memory. Flash use in storage array controllers is pretty much the same as its use in servers, so we’ll ignore that. Providing proprietary memory card designs to individual OEMs doesn’t seem like a viable business for Seagate so we’ll forget that, which leaves us with five areas of system-wide use. NVDIMM It does not produce NVDIMM-F flash, and that might be an area where it could provide expertise, if it has something both Netlist and Diablo don't have. But Micron might prefer to go straight to QuantX (XPoint) NVDIMM-F products from its existing battery-backed NVDIMM-N products rather than devise its version of Diablo/Netlist NVDIMM-F technology. 2.5-inch disk bays This is a hotly contested area, the sweet spot of the SSD industry, with mature products using SATA, SAS and NVMe interfaces and getting regularly refreshed as as planar NAND shrinks and 3D NAND adds layers. There's little change of Seagate getting a significant edge here, unless perhaps it builds XPoint SSDs using Micron QuantX technology. This seems a pretty safe bet. 3.5-inch disk bays The general use of flash in disk bay slots as pseudo-disk using SATA, SAS or NVMe is standard stuff but Seagate has its ClusterStor and DotHill storage array business and has just demonstrated 60TB SSDs in the 3.5-inch disk bay format. It could sell 60TB SSDs to cloud storage providers and hyper-scalers who want faster-than-disk access to large amounts of data and build systems from the component level upwards. It could also sell drive arrays populated with 60TB SSDs to managed service providers and not so big hyper-scalers. The management of such arrays to minimise wear and provide consistent QoS could provide an IP opportunity to Seagate. SSD controller provision is another matter. Seagate has disk drive controller IP, some of whose aspects it might be able to re-use with NAND. The ClusterStor and DotHill arrays might get NVMe over fabrics-class interconnects added to them to radically lower network access latency, particularly any forthcoming flash versions of those arrays. The operation of Lustre software on all-flash arrays is another area where someone could add IP value, although that is an open source area. The wild card here us Seagate's Kinetic disk business, the development of direct, Ethernet-accessed drives implementing an object storage scheme. Could a Kinetic SSD concept make sense? (That would get rid of object storage's reputation for slow speed.) Disk drive caching Seagate has been the main proponent of using flash as a disk drive cache and so speeding access. This can be expected to continue. Portfolio expansion Before and over the course of the Flash Memory Summit Seagate announced; 60TB 3.5-inch SSD Nytro NVMe drive Nytro SATA SSD 2TB M.2 format drive It already had SAS SSDs and Flash Accelerator cards. Conceivably it's missing NVDIMM format drives and should, we expect, get access to Micron QuantX chips and start developing XPoint-based drives as go-faster follow-ons to SATA, SAS, and NVMe SSDs in their varying formats, where it makes sense. This is something WD doesn't have, SanDisk's ReRAM technology not being ready to productise yet. We don't see Seagate adding storage-class memory system software IP, it not having any expertise in that area. This is deep OS internals work. Top-level cloud supplier Seagate markets its wares to private, hybrid and public cloud service providers. We can surely expect it to use its existing programs to pump flash products to its existing cloud storage customers and new ones. That's fine and dandy, but doesn't seem to have scope for anything that significant in itself. Instead cloud sales/marketing programmes will be used as channel-like activities to prime demand for Seagate's products. We're left with these stand-out possibilities for Seagate product development: Flash NVDIMM-F products XPoint DIMMs XPoint SSDs in 2.5-inch, M.2 and other NVMe formats All-flash ClusterStor and DotHill products Possible Kinetic SSDs For Micron, the prospect of having Seagate as a a QuantX product development and selling partner must look great. From Seagate's point of view it gets product technology that no other flash product vendor can (yet) supply and that's a good position to be in from the growth point of view – XPoint marks the sweet spot. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register Seagate plans to bring down the 16TB HAMR... soon(er) Analysis Salt Lake City SC16 booth talk at Steve Luczo’s company 6 Comments Seagate has a flash early Xmas present for Xbox gamers External drive doubles console capacity and loads titles faster 15 Comments Seagate to dismount and fsck its ClusterStor?

This came as a surprise to many users and businesses, as Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported by the company. In fact, Windows 8.1 is still on its general support schedule while Windows 7 is on extended support already. Many users saw this as another attempt by Microsoft to get customers to upgrade to Windows 10 or buy devices that ship with Windows 10 installed as the operating system. Back then, Microsoft wanted to support Intel Skylake processors only on a selection of business devices, and only until mid-2017. Microsoft to support Skylake on Windows 7 and 8.1 after all Microsoft published an update to its "silicon support policy" for Windows yesterday on the official Windows blog. The main change is that Microsoft, listening to feedback and all, decided to extend the support policy for 6th generation Intel Core (Skylake) processors to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This means that Skylake processors are supported on Windows 7 until January 14, 2020, and on Windows 8.1 until January 10, 2023. According to Microsoft, the change was made possible by Intel and OEM partners who "will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1". What this does not mean however is that future platforms, Intel's upcoming 7th generation Kaby Lake and AMD's 7th generation processors like Bristol Ridge will also be supported on previous versions of Windows. Microsoft states that these 7th generation processor families will only be supported on Windows 10, and that all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10. It is still unclear what "not supported" means practically. Does it mean that Windows 7 or 8.1 operating systems cannot be installed on devices running 7th generation processors? Or is support merely a factor in the business world, with Microsoft not support systems running these processors? If it is the former, it would mean that Microsoft would block customers from installing a previous version of Windows on devices running these processors. Customers affected by this would have two options: install Windows 10, or switch to another operating system supporting these processors (which most likely means a Linux variant).   Summary Article Name Microsoft to support Skylake on Windows 7 and 8.1 after all Description Microsoft reversed the decision to support Intel Skylake processors only on devices running Windows 10 after July 17, 2018.

Seams I am actually seeing it in action. I just posted this on MDL forum, with almost no good replies: "Hi Folks, I have Windows 10 on my main NVMe SSD, but I also have a working SATA SSD which I want to install Windows 7 on it and sometime use as a secondary OS. I applied a fully updated Windows 7 install.wim to a primary partition on the SATA SSD and also added the boot files: dism /apply-image /imagefile:X:\install.wim /index:1 /Applydir:I:\ bcdboot.exe" I:\Windows /s I: /f BIOS Now the problem. When I boot to the SATA SSD for the first time, it sticks on 69% when recognising my devices. I even disconnected any external devices, graphics card, wireless adapter, etc. Nothing helped. I want Windows 7! Using an ASUS Z170-PRO motherboard with the latest BIOS, Intel Core i7-6700K CPU, 16 GB Kingston HyperX Savage 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 2400 C9 memory, and an EVGA GeForce GTX 970 FTW GAMING ACX 2.0 graphics card. The NVMe is a Samsung 512GB 950 Pro M.2 NVMe Internal SSD. (Windows 10). I am also using an OCZ Vertex 3 120GB SATA III SSD for my Windows 7 installation. I can install Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 on the SATA SSD and boot to it, with all my devices connected without any issue. So any idea about why Windows 7 setup cannot continue after applying install.wim and rebooting? I did install Windows 7 in the same way on lots of other computers without any problem. Thanks so much for any possible help." So... Maybe M$ do not want us to install Windows 7 on Skylake systems after all... Reply Arthur August 15, 2016 at 7:28 am # > Maybe MS do not want us to install Windows 7 on Skylake systems after all... Or could it be because Windows 7 is an ancient operating system and doesn't include NVMe SSD support out-of-the-box? Have you integrated the KB2990941 hotfix into your install.wim? Maybe it's just me, but if you want to use the latest hardware it makes sense to use the latest OS. Reply joncr August 12, 2016 at 2:35 pm # No USB 3 drivers in Win7/Win7SP1, so it's still awkward to install on USB3-only devices with no CD/DVD drives, such as newish Skylake hardware. Reply Daniel August 13, 2016 at 2:54 am # You can integrate USB 3 drivers into an ISO of windows 7. I used MSMG ToolKit to do this, made an ISO of that and then used Rufus to put it on a USB stick. Reply Dave August 12, 2016 at 2:50 pm # Someone on here once said Skylake has some kind of badness built-in, that you wouldn't really want given the choice. Anyone know the tinfoil disadvantages of Skylake? Reply The Flash August 17, 2016 at 1:24 pm # Yeah, Intel CPUs in general have all sorts of things snuck in them, but I don't what what bad thing was introduced in Skylake though. That's why I just stick with AMD. Reply Guest703 August 12, 2016 at 4:02 pm # What about 8.0? I don't want the spyware that the 8.1 patch introduces, and 7.x is crap compared with Windows 8. Reply Liv August 12, 2016 at 4:24 pm # Windows 8.0 is officially unsupported by Microsoft and to me Windows 7 is way better than Windows 8/8.1 ever drempt of being. Reply T J August 12, 2016 at 5:04 pm # @ Liv "Windows 7 is way better than Windows 8/8.1 ever dreamt of being" Agreed with 5 up votes for you :-) George August 12, 2016 at 6:55 pm # I don't think 8.0 is unsupported, it shares the same "end of support" dates as 8.1. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet Liv August 12, 2016 at 9:50 pm # @ George No Windows 8.0 was officially dropped from support earlier this year. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/default.aspx?alpha=windows%208 "Customers have 24 months to move to Windows 8.1 after General Availability in order to remain supported." Gary D August 12, 2016 at 5:02 pm # @ Guest703 Win 7 = crap. Pardon ! Perhaps it is because you can not leave sticky finger marks on the screen as you can with a Win 8 touch screen. Reference Win 8.1 spying; did you not read ANY of the articles on Ghacks about blocking telemetry / spyware which Martin has blogged for the last year or so ? ! Reply Decent60 August 13, 2016 at 3:12 am # @Gary D Windows 7 supports touch screen. My mate had an AIO with touch screen so....that's a bad reason to say it's better. But over-all performance and bugs, Windows 7 has had better compared to Windows 8/8.1 MrHandsome August 12, 2016 at 6:58 pm # Its the other way around, 8.x is crap compared to 7.... unless you have a phablet. Reply 420 August 12, 2016 at 4:40 pm # M$ sure does want people to start useing linux or osx which is just as terrible if not worse with the shenanigans. Sounds to me like the only reason this was reversed is because Intel and hardware manufacturers said wtf and decided to flip the bill so M$ really could not argue at that point. Never seen a company with such a huge market share doing everything possible to put its self out of business. Reply A different Martin August 13, 2016 at 10:49 am # My guess is that it's because lots of businesses have no interest in "upgrading" to Windows 10 in the near future, and OEMs realize that they are going to lose a lot of sales of new hardware if Windows 7, and maybe Windows 8.1, are not supported on Skylake through end of life. (I was told straight out by computer support staff at a large medical research facility that a lot of the software the institution uses simply doesn't work past Windows 7 and that they're nowhere close to being ready to "upgrade" their users.) You know that big dip in traditional desktop and laptop computer sales everyone's been talking about for a while? And how Intel has slowed down its development schedule? I have a hunch it's not just because "everyone is using tablets and smartphones instead." I suspect it also correlates pretty closely with the introduction of Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10. As for me personally as a Windows 7 user, I'm still recovering from GWX PTSD -- "Get Windows 10" Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder -- and am gradually lowering my personal alert level from hyper-vigilant to merely vigilant. I'm still vetting every single update Microsoft proposes, but the night sweats have stopped. ;-) I'm fine sticking with Windows 7 for now, but if a bad Windows update slips past me and my awesome clone/backup strategy and borks my system or the hardware simply craps out and I need to get a new machine, that strikes me as a good time to move to Linux. Reply xpclient August 12, 2016 at 5:13 pm # Windows 8.1 is currently the best version IMHO. I will try to be objective. Here's why I think it's the best: Windows 8.1 has the following benefits for me over Windows 7: - USB 3.0 support. Even though Windows 7 PCs do have USB 3.0 drivers, Windows 8.1 supports USB Attached SCSI protocol which makes UASP flash drives much faster than USB 3.0 on Windows 7. UASP with USB 3.0 is a significant speed boost over USB 2.0. - USB Type C connector with KB3103696 - Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)/Bluetooth SMART support means I can use devices like Bluetooth wireless mouse which supports the Bluetooth 4.0 LE standard or LE headsets. The batteries in these devices last for a long time. - 802.11ac. With a fast 802.11ac router, 2 PCs with PCIe/NVM Express SSDs, you get amazing WiFi speeds. (OK, after doing some testing on Windows 7, it turns out, as long as you have the right drivers installed under Windows 7 and an 802.11ac router, you will get the same faster than N speeds as Windows 8 on 7 as well. It's only that Windows 7 continues to report your radio as 802.11n.) - Offloaded Data Transfers for file copying (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/ifs/offloaded-data-transfers) - More WMI classes and PowerShell cmdlets - Miracast wireless streaming to a display which 8.1 supports (although you could also use Windows 7 with Intel WiDi or buy a Chromecast dongle). But Miracast in 8.1 lets you not only mirror your display wirelessly to the second display but also extend your desktop to it. Like a wireless multiple monitors solution. - Windows 8.1 supports external manifests for application executables ("PreferExternalManifest"=dword:00000001) without any side effects of Windows 7 like the Network icon breaking. This is important if you are using a High resolution/High DPI display because Microsoft f***ed up DPI scaling with Windows 7. Windows 7 DPI scaling is broken, Windows 8.1 actually works. You can modify any app's manifest to scale it properly. - The DPI scaling engine in Windows 8.1 loads much earlier than Windows 7 so apps which load at startup are scaled properly - Windows 8.1 has better WinSxS cleanup using Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase - Chkdsk Spotfix ability, Hyper-V. Those who miss Virtual PC can get VirtualBox - Most issues on the software side were resolved for me by using third party apps - Classic Shell, 7+ Taskbar Tweaker, Classic Task Manager, Equalizer APO, Google Chrome, Everything Search, PerigeeCopy, OldNewExplorer, FileSearchEX, VistaSwitcher, Media Player Classic - Home Cinema, and reinstating Sidebar Gadgets, Classic Games, classic MSConfig, various tray applet fixes, ERUNT, AutoHotkey, EasyBCD, UxStyle plus this theme (http://winaero.com/blog/make-active-window-more-visible-on-windows-8-1-taskbar-with-pressed-button-look/), WindowsFirewallControl etc - All the Metro crap uninstalled, default programs set to Win32 apps, Group Policies to disable crap like OneDrive, Bing Search and Customer Experience Improvement Program, it is OK. - DOZENS of Registry fixes to make it work like the way I want - more like Windows XP Professional and Windows 7 so Windows 8.1 is now a pleasant and stable experience!! - Media Center is missing but Kodi is better. Between Kodi and its addons you can do everything. - Aero Glass project is there if you miss Aero. Personally I don't miss Aero's transparencies any more. I prefer the theme above that I linked to. From a usability perspective, I find the Windows 8 theme is uglier compared to Windows 7 but the visual cues that help usability are better. For example, it is easier to tell the active window due to the use of solid colors in the title bar compared to transparencies. The baby blue selection color in context menus is also more visible in the Windows 8 theme vs Windows 7. - Vastly superior virtual machine performance as a guest OS. I would like to stress this especially. Windows 7 and Windows 10 perform abysmally on my host running VirtualBox, Windows 8.1 performs extremely well. So in general, I prefer Windows 8.1 over 7 because of better DPI scaling, better support of newer hardware technologies like Bluetooth low energy, NVM Express SSD TRIM, USB 3.0, Miracast, performance improvements to I/O. Windows 7 is still excellent but on a high res display, the DPI scaling isn't up to it, USB and SSD I/O performance is worse, latest Bluetooth peripherals and wireless displays don't work. Windows 10, I am finding is just fluff and gimmickry and lots of annoyances which are hard to disable or impossible. It has some core/under the hood improvements but 8.1 has most of them too minus the silly and getting-in-the-way stuff which is essential for a serious workstation class OS. I don't find the silly stuff like Cortana and all the dumbed down Metro UI forced on me useful at all. Reply Yuliya August 12, 2016 at 8:07 pm # 1. Network File System (Enterprise-only) and Win Media Centre (Pro-only) So you can't have them both at the same time on W8. W7Ultimate wins because it has both. 2. Start menu I have over hundreds of things (programs/games) installed. Digging for them is not the solution. Nor having another background process for a third party Start button which also have the "most used" list broken. 3. Disabling desktop composition (Aero) without breaking the Windows On W7 I can simply apply W7Classic or Basic and I'm done. DWM.exe renders useless and I can close it. Things are different on 8. Why I need that? Welp I get more precision on my mouse when I need it (in Photoshop, for instance). 4. Shadow Copy (Last version..) tab is gone is W8. Very useful when editing a document and saving it every 5 minutes. It's back in W10 though. 5. Broken ClearType. Try it on 7 vs 8/10, you'll see the difference. 6. Broken intrnal clock on 8. Probably they fixed that by now, probably. (look on YouTube, there's a video about it). 7. 125 Hz polling rate limitation. Some people reported it as fixed, some don't. 8. Looks ugly. Yeah, I prefer glass over flat nonsense. 9. Useless BSoD. At least on 7 I get to recognise the file of the driver which game me the error. If it's "nv..." then it's the graphics one, etc.. 10. 7 is the last non "connected" version of Windows. The "cloud" word gives no results to any search. 11 [extra] It just works. Why do I need third party programs to fix broken things when I can have the real deal, perfectly working? o.O Seems like doing a lot of work for nothing in return. Your first three issues are basically just drivers which should be available from manufacturer's device. Allways use them, even if Windows has some that are compatible anyway. I don't know about VM's. 7 has Hyper-V as well though. I personally use VMWare and on my PC with a 3770k and 32GB or RAM I can easily host two OS'es (8.1 and 10) with zero performance hit in my daily tasks (given that you disable update checking and other maintainance tasks on those VM's) In terms of benchmarking (I did that too, with STALKER Call Of Pripyat, METRO 2033 / Last Light and Tomb Raider 2013. 7 won in all of them, a small win, they were close enough, but still always won. Reply xpclient August 12, 2016 at 10:42 pm # 1. NFS Server - true but a better third party solution must exist? Unix subsystem and NFS vanished from 8.1, only there in 8 Enterprise. You can run Kodi on Enterprise. :) 2. "Most used" list broken in which Start menu? If you're referring to Classic Shell, its developer is very responsive to feedback and immediately implements any fixes or changes if it's broken. But the most used list data is based on Windows UserAssist algorithm which changed in Windows 8 vs 7. Might be "broken" because of that, in that case the Start Menu can't do anything. Also, what's the big deal with running an extra process for a Start menu? Not everyone uses IE, Explorer or Windows Media Player right? They use alternate browsers, file managers and media players which use more resources? It's the same for the Start menu. :) 4. Shadow Copy is not back in Windows 10. MS deceived everyone by putting back a Previous Versions tab but it is now based on File History, not Shadow Copy. File History does not use Shadow Copies. :( 5. Broken ClearType where? In the main Windows UI? In Explorer? In web browsers? 7. Is this the PS/2 mouse polling rate you are referring to? 9. BSoD can be reverted to the useful one using a Registry tweak :) 10. Cloud shit can be disabled using Group Policy in 8.1 and stays disabled, but not 10. I can't stand it either :) There are no drivers for Bluetooth LE or UASP for Windows 7 except for very limited hardware. There is much more robust support for these technologies in Windows 8.1. Yuliya August 13, 2016 at 12:05 am # xpclient, Well we clearly have different ideas on the OS aspect :) I like a small ffotprint, my Win7 boots with 30-something processes only. I don't like patching thing , I'd have to do it for Explorer, Task manager (always replaced with Process Explorer), Msconfig (how do I disable a process from booting up once I replace W8 task manager?), you name it. Too much, too complex, and sooner or later something will break. Even now I still have to restart Explorer like once a day due to a bug which, I assume the current microsoft developers are not capable of fixing it, because it's still present in 10 as well. StartIsBack and ClassicShell, both have this broken "recently used programs" issue. In the same manner. Sometimes the list is updates on spot, some other times it's delayed, with like a minute or so, and most of the times not updated at all. As for AIMP, VLC, Firefox, etc, well I'm trading the internal process for a new one. I'm not stacking them ;) With the start menu replacement it's a new one. Clear type mostly throughout Windows UI, not browser's canvas, thankfully. You can even easier spot this by comparing any of the Office 2010 program to its counterpart from Word 2013 or 2016. There's many complaints about this, even on their forums. I'll again blame the incompetence of their developers for breaking something that worked and not being able to fix it back. Normal mice, USB. I rember I noticed this myself while moving a window on the screen, it feels way less smooth than on 7. A quick search for "bluetooth le windows 7" shows many people asking how to get it working and also many ohers which have managed to do so. It's a driver thing. Native or not - well you're not using the native graphics driver, do you? You always get the one from Nvidia/AMD/Intel ;) Same for audio and so on.. And still the main issue is present. No possibility to disable desktop composition, which makes the mouse signifficantly less responsive. And these are my issues. I could go on with the UAC related ones - once completely disabled (via registry) the "modern apps" stop working. Now the fun part begins when you try to create a new windows profile. Instead of CPanel, the Settings modern will pop up, but with a message telling you that it can not work while UAC is off. xpclient August 12, 2016 at 5:15 pm # Windows 8.1 is currently the best version IMHO.

If you were around in the ’90s or the early aughts, you saw the TV ads. Intel Inside. For decades, Intel has supplied a majority of the chips that sit at the heart of our personal computers, including desktops as well as laptops. These chips are called central processing units, CPUs for short. They handle most all of the digital calculations that drive our PCs. They also handle most of the calculations inside the millions upon millions of computer servers that run Internet services like Google Search, Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter. And Intel came to dominate this market too. It now builds 99 percent of all CPUs that wind up in a computer server, according to research firm IDC. When you use the Internet, you use Intel. But the chip market is now shifting in new directions. And as it shifts, Intel is remaking itself in an effort to stay on top of the heap. The world’s largest chip maker somehow missed the shift away from the PC and toward the smartphone. Other chip makers supply most of the silicon at the heart of our phones. But Intel now sees that the game is changing on the Internet as well. To run their myriad online services—operations of unprecedented size and complexity—Internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft need more than just CPUs inside their millions of servers. They’re using all sorts of alternative chips to accelerate particular technologies, most notably the new breed of artificial intelligence. So, Intel is remaking itself as a company that can build these chips too. Last summer, Intel paid $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, a company whose programmable chips, known as FPGAs, help choose search results inside Bing, the Microsoft search engine. This was the largest acquisition in the history of Intel. And then, earlier this week, the company agreed to acquire Nervana, a startup building chips just for deep neural networks, AI services that can learn tasks by analyzing enormous amounts of data. At Google, Facebook, and so many others, deep neural nets are now recognizing photos, identifying spoken words, and translating from one language to another—among other tasks—and that’s why Intel paid an apparent $408 million for Nervana. “We’re now at the precipice of the next big wave of growth,” says Intel vice president Jason Waxman, “and that’s going to be driven by artificial intelligence.” These hefty buys show just how rapidly the global chip game is changing. As Microsoft explores FPGAs as a way of accelerating search, it’s training deep neural networks with massive farms of GPUs, chips originally built for rendering images for games and other highly graphical software. So many other Internet companies are doing the same. And at Google, engineers have gone so far as to build their own alternative chip, dubbed the TPU. After GPUs help train a neural network to, say, recognize faces in photos, Google’s TPUs help execute this neural network, putting it to use in the real world. It’s an attack of the geek acronyms. FPGAs. GPUs. TPUs. And certainly, keeping it all straight is far from easy. But the trend isn’t hard to see. The world is moving onto Internet services, and these Internet services now require many chips beyond the classic CPU. As Microsoft vice president Peter Lee explains it, our Internet services are evolving more quickly than our CPUs. CPUs continue to mature according to Moore’s Law, getting faster every two years or so, but that’s not enough to accommodate the rise of deep learning. Nor can it handle the tremendous growth of our online services. So, we need chips that can handle “post-CPU workloads,” in the words of Lee, who oversees a new Microsoft Research operation called NExT. “Increasingly, we’re looking at more specialized hardware,” he says. It’s significant that so many acronyms are in the mix. We’re at the beginning of this movement, with Internet companies exploring so many possibilities, and it’s unclear how things will eventually pan out. Will the market settle on one or two chips? Or it will it be more? And what will those be? It’s telling that Intel has acquired not just Altera, but Nervana too. Wherever the market goes, it wants to be there. Go Back to Top.

Wired Staff Gear Date of Publication: 08.12.16. 08.12.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am These Are the Best Laptops for Under $200 Dell Great news! If you only have $200 to spend on a laptop, your options are far better than they used to be. While these machines aren’t built for hardcore gaming or video editing, they’re more than enough for web browsing and writing papers. These days, sub-$200 laptops commonly ship with HD displays, full Windows 10 (rather than something more limited, like Google’s Chrome OS), and a decent chunk of internal storage. Many also come with a free year of Microsoft Office 365—perfect for the students they’re targeting. To find the best of this affordable bunch, we put the most popular models through a series of performance and display tests in our state-of-the-art labs. Then we put them to the test at our desks, to get a feel for real-world factors like keyboard feel, trackpad responsiveness, and build quality. The result? We can tell you with authority that if you want the best affordable laptops available today, these are the ones to buy. This article was originally published on Reviewed.com. See more at Reviewed.com’s best laptops for every kind of student. Also see their recommendations for the best laptops. Best Overall: Asus E402SA Asus The Asus E402SA (also known as the EeeBook E402SA) won us over right away. While it’s not much faster than its competition, its 14-inch screen is bigger than most. The display is a mere 1366 x 768 pixels, but it’s glossy, looks great, and isn’t a major drain on the battery. Its $249 MSRP is a little above our target price, but we’ve seen it on sale as low as $179. Under the hood, the E402SA has the same Intel Celeron N3050 processor as most of the best sub-$200 laptops, but it’s one of the few to offer both VGA and ethernet jacks. It also includes a full-sized SD memory card slot and two USB ports (one is even USB 3.0). Its trackpad is mediocre, but the full-sized keyboard is very comfortable to type on. Our favorite feature is the E402SA’s expandability; turn one screw to remove the bottom panel and you can upgrade your storage with any 2.5-inch laptop hard drive or SSD. Dell Inspiron 11 3000 (2016) Who says a cheap laptop can’t be pretty? This Dell offers up an attractive design, solid build quality, and the port selection we expect from a new laptop these days (USB 3.0, HDMI, and a microSD slot). Based around Intel’s ubiquitous Celeron N3050 dual-core processor, it performs pretty much like any other laptop in its class. It also sports a decent trackpad, but its keyboard feels a bit cramped. The Inspiron 11 3000’s ($180) biggest flaw is the included McAfee install, which can be a real hog on system resources and annoys with frequent popups. But all things considered, Dell offers up a package that’s colorful, modern, and just fast enough for schoolwork or surfing the web. It may not be inspiring, but this Inspiron is worth its asking price. Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 11 This Acer isn’t a looker, but it’s got what it takes on the inside. Its cramped keyboard has a weird layout, but on the positive side, the Aspire One Cloudbook 11 ($180) has a very responsive trackpad that works well with gestures. Sporting an Intel Celeron N3050 dual-core chip, this small laptop fits the bill if you have limited needs. It might keep you waiting from time to time, but it’s got just enough oomph for Word, Excel, a few Chrome tabs, or older games. While you can find a 16GB version, you should avoid that one at all costs; our test model had 32GB of storage and even that filled up right away. You can add more memory with an SD card, but since it’s not microSD, it’ll stick out the side of the machine. In our opinion, your best bet for inconspicuous extra storage on the Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 11 is probably a low profile USB drive. Lenovo Ideapad 100s (Windows) Lenovo’s Ideapad 100s ($200) impressed us as a Chromebook, but the Windows 10 version falls short of expectations. Its mediocre keyboard, basic trackpad (don’t expect scrolling or zooming gestures), and plasticky feel don’t do it any favors. It’s available in a bunch of different colors, but that does little to distract from its underwhelming performance. Inside, it has an older Intel Atom Z3735F chip. It may be quad core, but it’s still slower than the Celeron N3050 dual-core processor found in rival machines. The 100s is also stuck with USB 2.0 ports, which can’t keep up with the 3.0 ports on better machines. It’s not all bad though. You can add storage through the compact microSD slot, the hinge rotates a full 180 degrees, and it had the best battery life of any of the sub-$200 models we tested. HP Stream 11 (2016) HP We liked the HP Stream last year, and are happy to see the line continue with this year’s updated model ($200). Revamped from the ground-up, the playful Stream 11 is a little bigger than its 11-inch competition, but that makes for a keyboard that’s much more pleasant to use. Its keys are almost full-sized, and the typing feel is pretty good for this part of the market. With Intel’s Celeron N3050 inside, the Stream isn’t great at multitasking, but can tackle lighter work without breaking a sweat. The worst part of using the Stream 11 is its iffy trackpad, which isn’t nearly as responsive as we’d like. The screen also seemed a little duller than the rest of our test group. Unfortunately, HP also bundles McAfee with this computer; it’s a pain, but you can uninstall it to speed things up. Lenovo IdeaPad 100s (Chromebook) If you’re shopping for a Chromebook, we thought that the affordably-priced Lenovo IdeaPad 100s ($180) was pretty solid. Even though you won’t be able to run Android apps, for only around $175, we can’t get too upset. It’s a lot like the Windows-based IdeaPad 100s we tested for this article, but it has a slightly better trackpad and, of course, runs Google’s ChromeOS. It’s competitively spec’d thanks to an Intel N2840 processor, 2 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of storage. It’s the right price for a simple Chromebook, without spending more than $200. Go Back to Top.

Long live Atom for IoT, cars! JC Torres - Aug 12, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Rumors of Intel Atom’s death have been greatly exaggerated. And Intel has only itself to blame for that. Now it seems that the company is clarifying, or further muddling, its plans for its low-power processor line. Intel is, indeed, axing the Atom but that is true only as far as mobile devices, laptops, and even wearables go. It still has Atoms planned, newer ones based on its Apollo Lake architecture. Those, however, will be heading towards smart cars and smart appliances as Intel tries to make a grab for the IoT market instead. Intel has had a rather tough time with the mobile market. Due to circumstances and poor business decisions, it allowed Qualcomm, a leader in the competing ARM computing architecture, to take a foothold in smartphones and tablets. By the time it did make a concerted effort to gain a presence in that industry, it was far too little, far too late to make a difference. The most recent casualty of that failed business was the Atom line of processors, initially intended for the low-power, low-spec, and now extinct netbook product line. But while Intel is practically backing out of the smartphone and tablet race, that doesn’t mean there is no room for a power-efficient chip on the x86 architecture. And it seems that Intel has found the exact niche for it. Come August 17th at the Intel Developer Forum, the company is expected to unveil a new generation of Atom processors. Those, however, are earmarked for the IoT industry. But that’s not the only market either. Intel has long had its eyes, no pun intended, on imaging technologies, particularly in virtual and augmented reality. It is also expected that Intel will make a grab for that market, introducing its own Remote EyeSight take on the Microsoft HoloLens. Curiously, Intel’s Atom was last seen powering Microsoft’s very own AR headset. Of course, just because Intel wants to doesn’t mean it will be able to. While relatively more power efficient than its bigger siblings, Atom chips have been traditionally still seen as giants compared to equivalent Atom processors. And that might be a bigger problem in smaller spaces like appliances and headsets.

Microsoft retreats, will extend Skylake PC support to normal support lifetimes Customers cried foul, and Microsoft changed its mind. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 12 August, 2016 05:11 0 - - - - print email On Thursday Microsoft completed its retreat from its controversial policy regarding support for Intel’s “Skylake” processors on its older Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems. Now Skylake PCs running those OSes will receive the standard length of support. In a controversial move, Microsoft had previously said this past January that it would only support Skylake PCs running its older operating systems for about 18 months. (Generally, mainstream support is five years and extended support is 10 years.) Support for Skylake would have run out in July 2017, far earlier than for older systems powered by Intel’s “Broadwell” processors. Now, the support lifetimes for “Broadwell” and “Skylake” PCs are the same: Windows 7 support will expire on January 14, 2020, and support for Windows 8.1 will end January 10, 2023. Microsoft noted the changes in a blog post it published Thursday. Why this matters: Microsoft originally pitched the changes to its support lifecycle as a positive: The older OSes were designed with older CPUs in mind. Thus Intel's Skylake was not only not optimized for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, but it also required special tweaks to ensure those OSes remain compatible. But customers latched on to the fact that Microsoft was ending support years early for Skylake PCs, and Microsoft has steadily backtracked since then. The dam started crumbling a month later, for example, when the Windows Server team publicly stated that it would not be enforcing Microsoft’s policy and it would support Skylake-based servers through the original support dates. Still pushing Windows 10 Microsoft had originally set the early expiration dates for Skylake PCs to encourage users to move to Windows 10, a more modern OS with more advanced protections against malware and other threats. That’s still Microsoft’s stance. “We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software,” Microsoft wrote. Microsoft claimed that the changes would primarily affect commercial customers, though the list of affected PCs includes gaming systems from Dell’s Alienware subsidiary as well as other consumer notebooks. According to Microsoft, the change has been made possible by the PC OEMs and by Intel, which will themselves be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing through the end of the support dates.

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Microsoft backs down, extends Skylake PC support By Juha Saarinen on Aug 12, 2016 2:22PM Updated policy driven by enterprise customer needs. Microsoft has backed down over its decision to shorten support for Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processor technology following enterprise customer outcry. The company originally said it would support downgrades from Windows 10 to Windows 7 until January 2020, and Windows 8.1 until January 2023, but this past January decided it would "embrace silicon innovation" and cut short that promise to 2017. Now, however, Microsoft's director of Windows business planning Shad Larsen said the company had changed its mind again as a result of protests by enterprise customers. Larsen said Microsoft now understood that enterprise users may still need to go slow in rolling out Windows 10. "At the same time we recognise that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th-gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy," Larsen said. The policy change means Intel Skylake PCs will once again join other Windows 7 and 8.1 devices to be supported until January 2020 and January 2023 respectively. The updated support policy applies to Microsoft commercial customers who currently manage Windows 7 and Windows 8 deployments, Larsen said. It doesn't apply to users currently running Windows 10. Larsen made it clear that Intel's upcoming seventh-generation "Kaby Lake" and AMD's new "Bristol Ridge" and other hardware would only be supported on Windows 10. Copyright © iTnews.com.au .

While it’s not expected to match the power of Intel’s latest Core family, most believe it’ll be a much better showing compared to the company’s recent efforts. To that end, WCCFTech has come across what it claims are the first verified benchmarks of the Zen platform courtesy of the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark database. It is worth noting, however, that these results are from an engineering sample of the chip and may not accurately represent the performance of the final product brought to market. The tests, which were conducted on August 6 and August 9 (two versions were tested, it seems), were run in conjunction with a Radeon RX 480. Using comparable hardware runs from the database, the publication found the Zen ES sample to be 38 percent faster than the AMD FX-8350, about 10 percent faster than Intel’s Core i5-4670K and around 11 percent slower than a Core i7-4790. So, what’s the verdict? It’s hard to say for sure. Keep in mind that the Zen ES samples tested had a low base clock of 2.8GHz (boost to 3.2GHz). If the retail product is pushing speeds closer to 4GHz, performance will no doubt improve significantly. It’s also worth pointing out that the Zen ES is being compared to Intel’s three-year-old Haswell processors. The Core i5-4670K has just four cores and four threads while the Core i7-4790 features four cores and eight threads and both are built on a 22nm process. The Zen ES reports eight cores, 16 threads and is a 14nm part yet it can’t keep pace with Intel’s old chips? Making matters even worse for AMD is the fact that Intel is planning to release Cannonlake, its 10nm die shrink of Kaby Lake, next year. AMD has said it doesn’t expect to ship Zen with full market availability until sometime in 2017. Nothing is official at this hour but if the benchmarks are indeed legitimate, it's not a great start for Zen. Then again, it's just a single set of benchmarks we have so even if they are legit, it's tough to draw full conclusions based on them alone.

Shocked, we're totally shocked Storage tech's real performance figures fail to match marketing claims Is the XPoint dish over-egged? 12 Aug 2016 at 01:54, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Ibm, Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp Recent Articles Micron scrambling up wall of revenues pit Zeta Systems: NVMe over Fabrics speed is real... and here's why Scale scales: HCI maverick heads upstack with apps +Comment XPoint will substantially undershoot the 1,000-times-faster and 1,000-times-longer-lived-than-flash claims made by Intel when it was first announced – with just a 10-times speed boost and 2.5-times longer endurance in reality. This became clear when Micron presented details of its QuantX-branded XPoint memory technology at the Santa Clara Flash Memory Summit this week. Summit attendees could see a 128GB prototype QuantX system with four XPoint, seemingly, dual-chip packages on it; meaning two 16GB die per package. In contrast to the wildly optimistic Intel "1,000 times faster than NAND" claims when XPoint was launched, the Micron pitch presented a 10-times improvement over NAND in terms of IOPS and latency, and four times more memory footprint than DRAM per CPU. Now that does seem more realistic. A Micron blog states: It delivers mesmerizing PCIe SSD performance – measuring typical read latencies at less than 10µs and a five 9 QoS at less than 25µs. That's over 10X better than the best NAND flash-based SSDs! El Reg doesn't think a 10-times improvement over NAND is worth an exclamation point, or classing it as "mesmerizing" – not when a 1,000-times improvement has been alleged before. We understand Micron is arguing that raw XPoint cell performance is 1,000 times faster than NAND raw cell performance, but, when you add in everything else in an SSD, such as the controller, its firmware and the interface, the speed drops. What did Micron tell the audience about QuantX latency? Write latency is <20μs (An NVMe SSD has <200μs). Read latency is <10μs (An NVMe SSD has <100μs). A U.2 200GB to 1.6TB XPoint SSD achieves 900,000 IOPS vs a 1.6TB NVMe SSD's 200,000 IOPS. A 900GB to 1.6TB XPoint SSD in a half height, half length PCIe 3.0 x8 card achieves 1.8 million IOPS vs a 1.6TB NVMe SSD's 200,000 IOPS. The IOPS testing used 4KB blocks with random 70 per cent read and 30 per cent write operations. With the U.2 QuantX NVME SSDs, queue depths of four to six saturated a PCIe x4 link, which the NAND NVMe SSD couldn't do. On a PCIe card, the queue depth reached 8 to 12, varying with QuantX SSD capacity, before the link was saturated. A 200GB QuantX SSD saturated the link at a queue depth of 16. Micron also provided an endurance number: QuantX SSDs will support 25 drive writes per day (DWPD) over five years. What do NAND SSDs provide? Samsung SM1715: 10 DWPD for five years Toshiba PX04P: 10 DWPD for five years Intel DC P3700: 17 DWPD for five years It looks as if QuantX XPoint has 2.5 times more endurance than ordinary NAND SSDs, and not the 1,000 times (which would mean 10,000 DWPD for five years) that the Intel marketing department keeps banging on about. We understand data stored in QuantX DIMMs will be encrypted. Operating system and application code changes will be needed to get the full benefit of XPoint as system memory, as opposed to storage. The NVDIMM-P products from Netlist will, presumably, help here, alerting potential XPoint memory ecosystem partners to the need for change. Price QuantX products will cost four to five times more than equivalent flash capacity and about half the cost of DRAM. We could see XPoint being used to bulk out DRAM as storage-class memory, and so enable larger working sets to be held in memory, leading to faster application run times. Products with capacities from 200GB to 1.6TB are expected and these will be for data centers and enterprises. We can expect Micron to be trying to sign up server and storage system vendors as OEMs, with array vendors needing an NVMe-over-fabrics link to server hosts to make XPoint SSD use worthwhile. Expect the first QuantX products in the second 2017 quarter. We would expect all the server vendors: Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HDS, HPE, Huawei, Inspur, Supermicro, etc to look at qualifying them. We would also expect all the NVMe over Fabrics-class array vendors: Apeiron, Dell/EMC DSSD, E8, Excelero, Mangstor and Pavilion Data Systems, to check them out as well. Reg comment The big question is: does XPoint deliver enough of a performance boost over NAND to justify a four to five-times price premium? There are other technologies available to fill the price-performance gap between DRAM and NAND. Flash DIMMs in NVDIMM-P guise for one. Everspin MRAM DIMMs for another. And then there's Samsung's mystery Z-SSD. XPoint competition is mounting up and it has a relatively trivial endurance advantage over flash, and a less-than-expected performance advantage. It is remotely possible that Intel and Micron have over-egged their XPoint pudding and it could fall flat. ® PS: QuantX is supposed to signify quantum leap, by the way.

Players have reported problems that include crashing upon launch, heavy stuttering and frame rate drops.  ( Hello Games | Steam ) Advertisement Gamers who patiently waited for the PC version of space exploration game No Man's Sky to be released are now extremely disappointed, as the title comes with performance issues right upon its launch. No Man's Sky for PC, released Aug. 12 on Steam and GOG for $59.99, has not been living up to expectations, with a variety of issues that are preventing players from starting their space exploration adventure. On the game's Steam page as of this writing, No Man's Sky has already garnered nearly 5,000 negative reviews, compared with over 3,000 positive reviews. Players have reported issues that include crashing every time they launch the game, heavy stuttering and frame rate drops. As detailed on the same page, the minimum system requirements for the title are 64-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10; an Intel Core i3 processor with at least 8 GB of RAM; a GPU equivalent to Nvidia GTX 480 or AMD Radeon 7870; and 10 GB of available storage. However, despite players using computers that far exceed these system requirements, they are still experiencing the game's reported performance issues. In its tests of the game, Ars Technica reported that there has been inconsistency in frame rates and instances of freezing, despite the two PCs they are using boasting specifications of Nvidia GTX 980Ti cards, 16 GB of RAM and either a Haswell i7 or Skylake i5 Intel processor, with Windows 10 and fully-updated drivers. No Man's Sky for the PC defaults to a cap of 30 frames per second, which can be disabled in the game's options. When the setting is turned on, the title keeps dropping to 20 frames per second, but when the cap is removed, frame rate reaches 60 frames per second. However, the frame rate randomly keeps dropping down to 30 frames per second. Kotaku, using a PC powered by a 4.2 GHz Intel i7 processor and an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU, is also experiencing performance issues of hitching and stuttering that happens from the loading screen and continues into gameplay. The confusing thing is that No Man's Sky runs well on the PlayStation 4, despite the gaming console packing relatively weaker processing power compared with some of the PCs that are experiencing performance issues. A lengthy thread on the PC version's performance issues has spawned on the subreddit for No Man's Sky, where it has been determined that most of the problems are due to the game itself and not players' hardware. One of the reasons for the issues has been pinpointed to be the lack of SSE4.1 support, which is something that players can fix but is something that is the fault of developer Hello Games. No Man's Sky director Sean Murray has acknowledged the PC performance issues on his Twitter account, through which he provided possible solutions. Murray promised that Hello Games will try to solve the issues as soon as possible, with a patch already uploaded within minutes of the game's launch. The patch, however, did not seem to help. PC users who have been excited to dive into No Man's Sky are now forced to wait for a fix to be applied to the title, which is a letdown as most were expecting a smooth experience similar to what PlayStation 4 gamers have had so far.

Aditya Bhat   August 13, 2016 15:20 IST "No Man's Sky" is currently available on PS4 and PC.Twitter/PlayStation Europe The release of the PC version of "No Man's Sky" on Aug. 12 has been beset with performance issues. PC players of "No Man's Sky" were plagued by framerate issues as systems are unable to run the game at a steady pace. Players have reported stuttering issues with some players being unable to even launch the game. Why advertise with us? Related Developer is aware of issues and these are the workarounds it suggested for 'No Man's Sky' "No Man's Sky" is expected to be released on Aug. 9. Other issues that has affected the game include sound problems, an issue where the game asks players to restart when playing and crashes.  The developer has noted that it is aware of these issue. Sean Murray, the co-founder of Hello Games, the company that developed it, noted on Twitter, "99% appear to be up and running on our servers. We'll begin trying to resolve asap for those who are having issues."  Hello Games has released day one patch for PC version of the game.  He also noted that one of the biggest issues that was reported by players was that they do not have Visual C++ Redist 2010, and requested they install the first day patch and restart the system. He also noted that the other issue is those having outdated GFX drivers or those who do not have one. So he requested players to install the latest from either AMD or nVidia. He also requested that the GFX card be above the minimum specification.

This is not supported No Man's Sky is an OpenGL 4.5 game, and requires latest drivers on most cards, please update VC++ Redist 2010 was not included by default. We have updated in a patch, please restart Further, it would be deploying hot fixes for the following issues: Shader Cache issue – means that framerate is initially stuttering on some cards. Whilst it resolves itself over time (~1 hour of play), we will fix this issue in a patch. SSE 4 – for CPUs that do not support SSE 4, it is causing the game to crash on boot (some of these area technically below min spec, but we don't want it to crash!) Mouse controls jitter on foot – this caused by a combination of certain resolution and GFX card. A fix is in progress. We can expect more fixes dropping to players and platforms in the coming days.

The Redmond, Wash.-based company previously had said it would pull Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 support for systems using Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake processors as early as 2017. Thursday the company said it had extended that deadline. “Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows. At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment time frames. We listened to this feedback and … we have extended the support period,” said Shad Larsen, director of Windows Business Planning, in a blog post. [Related: As Windows 10 Free Upgrade Expires, Anniversary Update Is Set To Launch] Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, said in a January blog post that after July 17, 2017, only the “most critical” security fixes would be released for systems with a Skylake processor running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 -- and Windows 10 would be the only supported Windows platform for Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake processors, expected to hit the market later this year. Now, Windows 7 and 8.1 will be supported with all security updates on Skylake processors until their end of life. The compatibility and security fixes will be published until Jan. 14, 2020, for Windows 7, and Jan. 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1, according to Microsoft. Joe Balsarotti, president of Software To Go, a St. Peters, Mo.-based Microsoft partner, said the extension is “great news.” “The initial announcement didn't seem to make sense to me as it gave AMD an obvious invitation to take market share for anyone with 'real-world' refresh cycles,” he said. David Felton, founder of Microsoft partner Canaan Technology, Norwalk, Conn., said many of his company's customers would be upset if their Windows 7 support on new, Skylake-powered devices ended in a year. “Most of our clients are on a three- to five-year refresh cycle, and … bought new hardware with Windows 7,” he said. “So many clients are completing their second year of the upgrade cycle, and would be upset to find out their Windows 7 support would end in a year.” Since the operating system’s release last July, Microsoft has been pushing customers to upgrade to Windows 10 by using techniques that some see as aggressive. For instance, if customers who had not yet upgraded clicked on a Red X at the bottom of the Windows 10 updates box, the computer would automatically begin upgrading as opposed to clicking out of the window. Following widespread criticism, Microsoft in June said it would make the upgrade process easier and more clear.

By Nick Heath | August 12, 2016, 6:06 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus The Windows 7 desktop. Image: TechRepublic Microsoft has gone back on an earlier decision to prematurely end support for Windows 7 and 8.1, in the firm's latest concession to businesses in no rush to upgrade to Windows 10. The tech giant yesterday announced it will support Windows 7 and 8.1 on PCs running on Intel Skylake processors until the official end of support for these operatings systems — January 2020 for Windows 7 and January 2023 for Windows 8.1. It marks a reversal of Microsoft's decision in January this year to phase out support for Windows 7 and 8.1 on PCs running on Intel Skylake processors ahead of the official date for the end of support. At the time, Microsoft said that support would end for Windows 7 and 8.1 systems running on Skylake processors in July 2017. It later pushed that date back to July 2018.

Microsoft's u-turn means that Windows 7 and 8.1 systems running on Skylake will now get all security updates until support officially ends, as opposed to only receiving 'critical' updates. The company's change of heart was prompted by the need to give businesses more times to upgrade from Windows 7 and 8.1, said Shad Larsen, director of Windows Business Planning at Microsoft. "We recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes," he said. Microsoft's decision is the latest in a series of measures designed to appeal to businesses that want to continue running Windows 7. Earlier in the year, Microsoft announced the release of the Windows 7 SP1 convenience rollup, a collection of security and other updates for the seven-year-old operating system. By most estimates, Windows 7 is by far the most popular Windows operating system and still used by most businesses today. Microsoft's Shad was also keen to stress that the decision to improve support for Windows 7 had not been prompted by lacklustre demand for Windows 10 among businesses. "Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows," he said. Analysts predict that from 2017 onwards businesses will begin moving to Windows 10 in earnest. "2017 will be a big year for enterprise upgrades. Many organizations are already piloting Windows 10 devices, but in 2017 they will be driven by security concerns," Forrester principal analyst JP Gownder told TechRepublic earlier this year, citing the OS' support for security features such as application containerization, faster updates and anti-malware instructions built into Skylake processors. Skylake processors were first released at the end of last year. There are still some restrictions when it comes to support for Windows 7 and 8.1 machines running on Skylake processors. To be eligible to continue receiving updates until the end of support, the Skylake PC will need to be one of the models on Microsoft's list of approved machines. Machines that use even newer processors will not receive updates for Windows 7 and 8.1, however, and will need to running Windows 10 to ensure continued support. These include processors in Intel's Kabylake family, due before the end of 2016, AMD's Bristol Ridge, due this year, and Qualcomm's 8996/Snapdragon 820 architecture.

The decision essentially delays the retirement of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 for a good few years, and comes as Microsoft insists that businesses are adopting Windows 10 at a faster rate than previous versions of the operating system. Support Extension That said, Microsoft admitted in a blog post that some commercial customers have systems that require longer deployment timeframes. “We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates,” it said. This policy change primarily applies to Redmond’s commercial customers. So what are the new deadlines. Well support for Windows 7 has been extended to 14 January 2020, whereas support for Windows 8.1 will end 10 January 2023. And Microsoft said that customers using six generation Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until those dates. “This change is designed to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10,” wrote Microsoft. It said there are now over 350 million devices on Windows 10 and more than 135 billion hours of use since the launch. But there are concerns that despite the offer of a free upgrade, and some questionable tactics, Windows 10 might miss its target of one billion installations by 2018. That said, by most metrics Windows 10 has been a success for the company. “We recommend that customers upgrade these 6th Gen Intel Core systems on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as soon as possible so that they can receive full support along with the great enhancements that come from running modern hardware with modern software,” Microsoft said. Earlier this month Microsoft released its Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which is said to be more secure, faster and boasts another improvements as well. Mobile Confusion Confusion meanwhile still surrounds Microsoft’s intention in the mobile space. Windows Phone is being quietly retired and the company has effectively withdrawn from the consumer mobile space after the sale of its feature phone business, and the brutal gutting of its phone workforce. However Microsoft continues to insist that it is still committed to running Windows 10 on mobiles, is reportedly working on new smartphones, but these seem to be aimed at the business and not the consumer segment.

Argggh, my back! A bigger splash: The mathematics of spilling beer Some clever folks have started an experiment that will hunt for signs of alien civilisations using the Murchison Widefield Array – a low frequency radio telescope in western Australia. Eggheads at Curtin University, Down Under, and the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica in Italy, have published a paper outlining the experiment today in the Astrophysical Journal. In order to understand the nature of life in the universe, you have to look for it. Researchers at the SETI institute in California have a long history of using high-frequency radio waves to search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Interestingly, though, this experiment by the Aussies and Italians uses low frequency radio waves in the range of 103 to 133MHz. Past experiments were conducted at 1.4 to 1.7GHz range, also known as the “water hole” as it was where the radio spectral lines produced by neutral hydrogen and hydroxyl (OH) could be found. The presence of water is often associated with the possibility of life as it is considered a crucial component of life. “That radio band is the cornerstone for of communications technologies on Earth, and it could be reasonably assumed that a similar path has been taken by extraterrestrial civilisations,” the paper said. The pilot study will be performed using the Murchison Widefield Array, chosen for its high sensitivity, prime radio range, large field of view and is a located in an extremely radio quiet area over 200km inland from the western Australian coast. The telescope will cover 400 square degrees field of view, where 45 exoplanets in 38 planetary systems known. Radio spectra from those systems will be analysed to find the limits on the presence of narrow line emission - which could signify the presence of chemicals suitable for life. The researchers hope to carry further experiments into using low frequency waves using the Square Kilometre Array, a large multi-telescope project to be built in two sites: one in South Africa and the other close to Murchfield's silent perch in Australia. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 39 Comments More from The Register Spoiler alert: We'll bet boffins still haven't spotted aliens Spectral modulation looks like 233 coincidences too many 54 Comments Russian billionaire: GET me the ALIENS ON THE PHONE.

Does Windows 10 Need Brand-Specific Hardware? Q. Does Windows 10 Need Brand-Specific Hardware? Aug 11, 2016 Fred Langa EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement Q. According to an Italian PC magazine, due to a special partnership between Intel and Microsoft, Windows 10 performs at its best only on a PC/tablet whose hardware is specifically designed for this purpose. Therefore no machine born to work with Windows 7 or 8 is really suitable. Is all this true? A. No. Win10’s hardware requirements are actually rather modest, as the Windows 10 Specifications page states. I’m running Win10 on some PCs from the XP and Vista eras, and they’re working fine. In fact, in some cases, those older PCs actually run a skosh faster under Win10 than they did with their original operating systems. I don't have a copy of the article you read. Perhaps it may have been referring to some special-purpose Windows 10 features such as “Windows Hello,” which has features like facial recognition, iris (eye) recognition, or fingerprint scanning -- all of which needs specialized hardware. Facial recognition, for example, requires an illuminated infrared camera; fingerprint scanning requires an appropriate optical- or capacitance-based device; and so on. Other nonessential features also require specialized hardware. See the full list on the Windows 10 specifications page. But these optional technologies have nothing to do with Win10’s basic functionality. Again, Windows 10 runs just fine on most older hardware. * Editor's note: We feature an abridged Q&A from Fred Langa's LANGALIST, a column available exclusively to paid subscribers of the Windows Secrets newsletter,.

Aug 12 2016 at 10:00 AM Updated Aug 12 2016 at 10:07 AM Save article Print Diversity is hard to achieve even with ambitious goals and a generous budget Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Despite an ambitious goal and a generous budget, Intel is making slow progress on transforming its workforce. Getty Images by Marco della Cava Technology company Intel has committed $US300 million ($389 million) to ensure that by 2020 its staff mirrors what it calls the market availability of the US tech workforce. But even that kind of cash doesn't buy overnight success. In the company's latest mid-year diversity report released on Wednesday, most of Intel's key metrics remained flat or ticked up slightly despite concerted efforts in the past six months to target women and minorities in the hiring process. "One of the biggest learnings we've had this year was that, while there are positive trends in the hiring of underrepresented minorities and our representation of women, we have a ways to go on our journey to making Intel a truly inclusive place," read a note accompanying the report, which was signed by CEO Brian Krzanich, diversity and inclusion chief Aisha Evans and human resources leader Danielle Brown. Currently, Intel is 53 per cent white and 32 per cent Asian, a skew that is generally reflective of tech companies – from Google and Apple to small start-ups – as they continue to grapple with the challenge of creating a workforce that better reflects the US population.

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Beyond social justice While tech firm leaders long resisted revealing the overwhelmingly white and male composition of their work force, pressure from media outlets and activist groups such as Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH Coalition have since made reporting diversity efforts almost de rigueur as prospective employees look for companies that reflect their own values. Achieving workplace diversity also goes beyond social justice or mere optics, as many researchers have noted that a diverse workforce typically correlates to increased corporate performance as employees are better able to anticipate the needs of a broad consumer base. Many companies now have diversity on their front burner, dedicating resources to in-house diversity programs and non-traditional outreach programs in efforts that often are led by senior leaders focusing solely on diversity and inclusion. But despite this new-found emphasis, progress is slow. In a report last month, Facebook revealed that its employee make up has changed little over the past years despite the social media giant's intent on looking less homogeneous. Underrepresented minorities Apple was the latest tech company to update its diversity numbers. Last week, the iPhone-maker revealed that its non-white workforce grew by a percentage point, although white employees also increased by 2 per cent to 56 per cent. African-American employees went from 8 per cent to 9 per cent, Hispanics from 11 per cent to 12 per cent and Asians from 18 per cent to 19 per cent. Among the key findings in Intel's latest report: female employees inched up to 25.4 per cent from 24.8 per cent in December 2015, while underrepresented minorities (URMs) decreased slightly to 12.3 per cent from 12.4 per cent. Among URMs, African-American staffing increased to 3.7 per cent from 3.5 per cent, while Hispanics dropped to 8 per cent from 8.4 per cent. The US workforce currently consists of 47 per cent women, 16 per cent Hispanics and 12 per cent African-Americans, according to the Department of Labor. On the hiring front, Intel's efforts remained flat with women and minorities accounting for 43.4 per cent of all hires, compared to 43.1 per cent in December. Of that 43.4 per cent, 13.1 per cent were URMs, a notable jump from the 9 per cent figure logged in December 2014. The company also said it was at 99 per cent pay equity for URMs. Gender pay equity is at 100 per cent. Need to improve retention Women in senior company positions grew to 18.2 per cent from 16.5 per cent six months ago, while those in leadership positions also increased slightly to 18.7 per cent from 17.6 per cent. URM representation in senior positions inched up to 6.4 per cent from 5.8 per cent, while those in leadership roles hit 6.9 per cent from 6.3 per cent. Intel also announced it had added a second woman to its board of directors, University of California at Berkeley electrical engineering professor Tsu-Jae King Liu. The company also noted a need to improve its retention efforts, as adding new women and minorities to the payroll can easily be offset by departing employees who don't find the environment welcoming. Intel also is grappling with a challenging business market, as it looks to reinvent itself from a chip-maker to a provider of cloud-based services powering Internet of Things devices. In April, Intel announced it would be laying off 12,000 employees, or about 11 per cent of its global workforce.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     New MacBook Pro With Touch ID Sensor Expected To Release Soon Posted: Aug 13 2016, 1:04pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 13 2016, 1:07pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple   Macbook Concept By Martin Haek   We will be seeing a revamped MacBook Pro any time now if we are to believe the word of Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The new 13 inch and 15 inch retina display laptops by Apple will have a bunch of new features which include a Touch ID sensor and an OLED mini screen above the keyboard. How To: Find Hatchimals In Stock It seems like Gurman’s report is pretty much in line with all other reports we have received about the new MacBook Pro. He seems to agree with both Ming Chi Kuo from KGI securities and 9to5mac that the reveal of the new laptop is going to be a pretty big event. The new laptops are going to weigh less and are thinner in design than other MacBook’s released by Apples. The new MacBook Pro will not resemble the MacBook Air which is good news for all those MacBook users who want more than one port on their laptop. Users should expect better performance and improved battery consumption due to the Intel Skylake processors which will power the new MacBook Pros. The stand out feature about this new MacBook however remains the OLED mini screen that is expected to be situated above the keyboard keys. It will most likely serve as a replacement of the physical function keys. We still aren’t quite sure how Apple plans on using this screen. It could use it to control basic functions such as volume or media buttons, or it could take a step further and display shortcuts as well as information about the app that might be in use on the laptop. These new MacBook’s are going to more secure than any other Macs available for two reasons. Firstly the Touch ID sensor that has been incorporated into these new machines and secondly the secure enclave that these laptops will ship with. The updated features should settle the complaints made by MacBook pro users that the laptops are quite outdates and have received no upgrades since June 2012. But Apple has not made a habit of upgrading its laptops too often if you follow the trend set by the company. According to Gurman the new MacBook Pros will be released sometime in October and will not be part of the iPhone 7 launch in September.

That is the first of ten home games this season (ideally more with the playoffs!), and given past issues, the team is continuing to try and figure out ways to improve the inbound and outbound traffic. It’s had some solid moments, but it’s a bit inconsistent at times, so any additional help is welcome. This year, the team has arranged deals with Uber and the Valley Transportation Authority to help folks out. Here’s a quick look at each, along with some of my own thoughts given my experience with both. Uber The 49ers and Uber have partnered up to create an “exclusive Uber Zone” at the stadium. The press releases says it will “provid[e] guests with a seamless pickup and drop-off experience for all 49ers home games and third-party stadium events.” Here’s how they describe it: Guests using Uber pre-event for curbside drop-off will be let out in the newly designated Uber Zone, located in the northwest corner of the Tasman Drive and Great America Parkway intersection. Guests using Uber for post-event pick-up will exit out of Intel Gate A. Returning to the same designated Uber Zone, located in the northwest corner of the Tasman Drive and Great America Parkway intersection, guests will request a ride via the Uber app. Event staff will be onsite to assist guests meeting drivers and securing rides. Uber is offering $15 off a ride to Levi’s Stadium for first-time users who enter the promo code 49ERS. And while this is an improvement over nothing, you’re probably gonna need that promo code. Uber has something called “surge” pricing, which increases the cost of travel when there is high demand. The surge pricing multiplies the base fare and the per mile charge (or whatever specific distance is charged by Uber) by X amount. The busier Uber drivers are, the more the surge. I would think surge pricing will be high for a trip to or from Levi’s Stadium. I’m guessing this will be an option for people who live near Santa Clara in the South Bay. VTA The South Bay offers a light rail service called the VTA. It goes all around the Santa Clara Valley, and is what you connect to if you take Caltrain down from San Francisco. This year, the VTA will offer new season and single-game light rail passes. The passes will allow the purchaser round-trip service on VTA’s new express light rail trains from the Great Mall, Santa Teresa, Diridon, and Mountain View light rail stations. Pass holders will have priority departure and exclusive use of express trains for their return trip. The pass is $149 for the season, or $20 per game. You can purchase them online at VTA.org/49ersExpress, at the Levi’s Stadium box office, and at VTA retail locations. The VTA is really solid, although there are long lines after the game. The upside is that the lines actually move at a pretty decent speed, so it’s not too awful. But taking advantage of an express option would add some convenience, albeit for a little more money. For those of you that take BART to the Fremont station and bus over, this does not apply. You will use that particular service like you normally do.

Microsoft has decided to reverse its decision to cut support early for PCs running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This policy change primarily applies to commercial devices and is intended to accommodate organizations not yet ready to transition to Windows 10. In January, Microsoft issued an update to its support policy in an effort to accelerate Windows 10 upgrades among enterprise users. Its intent was to limit support to new processors and chipsets running Windows 10 on the computer systems. This move would have had the greatest effect on businesses that planned to buy new computers running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 with the intention of eventually migrating those devices to Windows 10. [Read: Microsoft Leaks Secure Boot Key, Raises Security Concerns.] As part of its January announcement, Redmond explained that, in its view, the newest generations of silicon would require the latest Windows platform. This would allow Microsoft to focus on integrating Windows with silicon while staying compatible with earlier generations of both. The exceptions to its policy change included consumer and enterprise users running PCs and tablets with Intel Skylake chips. The company would continue to support Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on these devices through July 17, 2017. Users would have to upgrade to Windows 10 during this support window, because after July 17, 2017, only the most critical Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 security updates would be provided. This gave about 18 months for businesses with Skylake-equipped devices to upgrade to Windows 10. Now Microsoft has announced it will wait before terminating support for 6th-generation Skylake devices, acknowledging most organizations won't upgrade in such a short amount of time. "Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows," Shad Larsen, director of Windows Business Planning, wrote in an Aug. 11 blog post. "At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes." To support these customers, Microsoft is extending its support date to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. The tech giant will provide all necessary security updates for Skylake devices within that time period. So how long do enterprise users have to upgrade their Skylake machines to Windows 10? It depends on which version of the OS is currently running. (Image: Michal Krakowiak/iStockphoto) Windows 7 is currently in extended support, which will end on January 14, 2020. Support for Windows 8.1 will end on January 10, 2023. Despite the newly extended support period, Microsoft urges business users to upgrade to Windows 10 as soon as possible. Earlier this year Microsoft announced future silicon platforms, like the upcoming 7th-generation Intel Core Kaby Lake processor and the AMD 7th-generation processors, will only be supported on Windows 10. All future silicon editions will require the newest version of Windows 10, the company emphasized. Microsoft recently released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was purposefully updated with business-friendly features to give organizations motivation to upgrade. However, research indicates the update isn't pushing businesses to make the jump. A survey recently released by Adaptiva discovered 63% of businesses plan to wait at least six months to upgrade to Windows 10. Slightly more than three-quarters (76%) said the Anniversary Update is not increasing their urgency to upgrade. Kelly is an associate editor for InformationWeek.

Share story This week, let’s look at the state in the Pacific Northwest with one of the nation’s best economies, where its biggest city is seeing the country’s fastest housing-price appreciation — and no, this is not about Washington. Welcome to Oregon, 2016. With its dependence on durable-goods manufacturing and housing, Oregon suffered in the Great Recession. In May 2009, the unemployment rate nearly touched 12 percent, a high not seen since the nasty downturn of the early 1980s. Fast forward to this year. In May its unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest since modern record keeping began in the 1970s. June’s rate ticked up 0.3 points, a modest rise signaling discouraged workers re-entering the rising labor force.

By contrast, Washington’s June unemployment rate stood at a seasonally adjusted 5.8 percent. Nationally, unemployment was 4.9 percent in June. Other yardsticks are impressive, too. The state’s labor force is at a record high and jobs are keeping pace with population growth. Real gross domestic product rebounded early past its pre-recession peaks and has reached new records, too. It grew by 3.9 percent in the first quarter, tied with Washington and Arkansas for the fastest growth in the nation. According to the Census Bureau, real median household income shot up to $58,875 in 2014, the latest year for which data are available. That’s just shy of Washington’s number. It’s a convergence not seen since the end of the 1990s boom; historically Oregon trailed Washington. Nationally, median household income was $53,657. It’s also worth noting that while income for Oregonians hit a record in 2014, Washington was down nearly $9,800 from its peak in 1998. The epicenter of the Oregon boom is Portland, which has seen the hottest housing market in the nation for months. Last year, 11 percent of the metropolitan workforce was in advanced industries, the 15th strongest out of 100 metros nationally. This is no longer simply “the city where young people go to retire,” if it ever was. I don’t want to compare apples and cattle. Washington and Oregon share many characteristics but are not economic twins. Oregon is less populous, 4 million in 2015, vs. 7.1 million for Washington. Although Portland is nearly as large as the city of Seattle (632,309 vs. 684,451 in 2015), metro Seattle is much larger. The Seattle area also boasts two of the most valuable companies in the country, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as such major headquarters as Starbucks, Nordstrom, Weyerhaeuser and Expedia. It is home to one of the nation’s leading public universities, a major biomedical cluster and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. And don’t forget Boeing and the aerospace sector. Portland lost container shipping service while Seattle and Tacoma remain major seaports. Beyond Nike and Columbia Sportswear, PDX’s headquarters are less well known. Its big deal is semiconductor engineering and manufacturing, especially with Intel and its approximately 19,500 workers. But this undersells a shift in Silicon Forest to a constellation of younger homegrown tech companies, according to a 2014 report in The Oregonian. Like Seattle, Portland has also been a beneficiary of Silicon Valley companies opening outposts there. It’s more affordable than the Bay Area, but growth and rapidly rising house prices are causing local angst (sound familiar?). The housing-cost problem is made worse by the little new construction seen after the recession. So, what’s driving Oregon’s economy? Population growth is a big factor, especially of college-educated young people. Job increases are broad-based, but especially in health care, business and professional services, and leisure and hospitality. Still, the state has a history of volatility, especially in construction and manufacturing jobs, including those connected to chipmaking. In May, Intel warned employees they could see more layoffs if enough don’t take buyouts. Which state has the better wine? That’s beyond my tippling expertise: I enjoy both. Like all states, Oregon shows sharp differences among its regions, especially between metro and rural areas. For example, nonmetro areas in southern Oregon “still have a long way to go to regain all of their lost jobs,” according to Josh Lehner, an economist in the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, who writes an illuminating blog on the state economy. Most of rural Oregon is growing again but still suffers from the decline of the timber industry that started in the 1980s. The population is older and less likely to be of prime working age. On the other hand, nearly all of the state’s counties have seen population growth. The resort-retirement area of Bend, savaged by the housing crash, is booming again. Without the cushion of the Puget Sound aerospace cluster, Oregon manufacturing remains weak. Among its head winds are loss of demand for material in the Oil Patch because of falling petroleum prices and a strong dollar. Job polarization — the loss of middle-wage jobs — is another common problem found in Oregon. For example, factory employment remains well below pre-recession levels. The workforce in accommodations and food services, which typically pays less, has been at record highs. Lehner told me the state’s fast growth should ease off as it reaches close to full employment. “The problem is the economy does not typically then transition down to something sustainable,” he said. “It slams down into recession and you start the cycle over. But we are approaching full employment and there aren’t too many worrisome things on the horizon at the moment.” You may reach Jon Talton atjtalton@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

But this 2-in-1 device was much more than that. When the first version was unveiled last October, it was warmly accepted. Many users loved the concept of the detachable screen, but on the other hand, the Surface Pen disappointed. Well here we are going to talk about the next version, Microsoft Surface Book 2, sadly not much has been leaked about this upcoming device. Let me sum up the expected specs, features and release date of the much-anticipated Microsoft Surface Book 2. Microsoft Surface Book 2: Expected specs, features, and release date Processor As per the rumors, we can expect Surface book 2 to be powered by Intel's Skylake processor. Operating system The Surface Book 2 is expected to run on the Redstone 2 update of Windows 10 OS. Microsoft further trims smartphone division jobs San Francisco, July 29, 2016 (AFP) -Microsoft is cutting more jobs from its smartphone hardware and global sales divisions by shedding an additional 2,850 positions, the company said Thursday. The news came in a corporate annual report filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Display According to Yibada, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 device will feature a 4K pixel resolution. This will enable users to stream 4K video content. Rechargeable stylus According to Yibada, the Redmond-based tech giant has filed a patent for a rechargeable stylus which will reportedly debut on Surface Pro 5. As per few leaked images, the unproven Surface Pen is expected to feature an on/off button, an indicator light, a built-in rechargeable battery and terminals for charging. The charging terminals are expected to be placed on the stylus' housing and will be in a form of a ring which wraps around the upper portion of the pen. Now you can buy the Microsoft HoloLens for Rs 2 lakhs Microsoft HoloLens is a complete wireless independent headset in itself. Users are not required to attach it to a smartphone or PC to enter VR mode. Battery The new device is expected to pack an improved battery life. Earlier Microsoft had promised 9 hours of playback last time; therefore, it may go up to 7 hours of battery life. Microsoft Surface Book 2 launch date According to news sources, the Surface Book 2 is expected to be launched either in June or October this year. Microsoft's Surface Book has been able to impress the users in many ways, and this is the reason why many are eagerly waiting for the all new Microsoft Surface Book 2. Due to the huge popularity of the Surface Book, Microsoft is quite obviously now burdened to work consistently in improving the specs and features of the next generation device.

"Give her a thumbs up for her beat," exhorts instructor Jeffrei Pettaway and an enthusiastic sea of hands juts into the air. For many in this classroom, this is the first time they have touched an iPad. This six-week, hands-on summer class exposes kids ages 7 to 12 to technology — and the 21st century skills that come with it. With a few swipes, the tablets on the tables in front of them — a gift from technology giant Apple — open up worlds miles away from this hardened stretch of East Oakland, Calif. The kids have ventured on virtual scavenger hunts in Africa and researched what life is like in India, each project making them more familiar and at ease with the software that is transporting them. "This is bringing a whole new world inside their backyard in a way that's safe for them to explore," Regina Jackson says as she watches the students absorb the morning lessons. Jackson is president of the East Oakland Youth Development Center. Equal parts sanctuary and springboard, it was founded nearly four decades ago by former Clorox CEO Robert Shetterly to lift the fortunes of a neighborhood overburdened by sky-high rates of poverty, crime and violence. Of the students in this class, about 90% qualify for free lunch and live within blocks of the center. They come here for rare access to opportunity in the form of free after-school tutoring, college preparation courses, music and arts lessons, health and wellness education programs and the hardwood that such NBA greats as Gary Payton and Jason Kidd once played on. The community center's goal: to give children the same shot at success they would have in wealthier parts of the city. Increasingly, that means the digital literacy they will need to successfully navigate the world. Apple's donation of iPads helped expose 180 kids at the East Oakland Youth Development Center to the technology that will shape their lives and careers.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) Low-income youth in East Oakland are among "the most technologically disconnected demographic groups in the United States," Jackson says. Four out of 10 students in Oakland public schools do not have access to a computer at home, and Jackson estimates 70% of the students at her community center do not have a computer at home with parents relying instead on smartphones. USA TODAY Intel pilots $5 million 'scholars' program in Oakland, Calif. schools Jackson installed computer labs to connect more kids to technology and offer year-round computer classes. And, this summer, she teamed with Apple, which is reaching across the digital divide into Oakland, starting with this donation of 40 iPads to expose 180 kids to the technology that will shape their lives and careers. The East Oakland Youth Development Center eventually wants to teach coding classes to help youth develop the skills they would need to work at a company such as Apple. "We know how transformative technology can be in education and throughout communities," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, who first visited the East Oakland Youth Development Center in June. "Every child deserves the right to a great education. These students are working on everything from learning to code to writing résumés, and we can’t wait to see what they will do in the world.” A student at the East Oakland Youth Development Center plays with software on the iPad.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) Silicon Valley, the high-tech corridor that stretches between San Francisco and San Jose, has come under broad criticism that its outreach efforts have overlooked Oakland, a diverse city across the Bay where African Americans and Latinos make up more than half of residents. No critic has been more vocal than Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who has led the campaign for Silicon Valley to hire more African Americans and Latinos, two groups sharply underrepresented in Silicon Valley tech companies. His advocacy led to Intel forming a five-year partnership with the Oakland Unified School District designed to touch the lives of 2,300 students and graduate 600 students in computer science and engineering programs at two high schools. Apple CEO Tim Cook  (Photo: Gabrielle Lurie, AFP/Getty Images) Jackson says he proposed to CEO Tim Cook that Apple invest in Oakland after an Apple shareholder meeting. Apple's workforce is 9% African American and 12% Hispanic, a single-percentage point increase from last year. It's pushing to make progress. Out of a U.S. workforce of 80,000, 27% of new hires in the last year were underrepresented minorities, according to the company. Apple is far from alone. Tech companies in Silicon Valley have made pledges to do better, but their numbers have barely budged. Apple is more diverse than some tech companies because of lower-paid workers in its retail stores, though it did post a 1% increase in African Americans in technical jobs. Rev. Jesse Jackson  (Photo: Mark J. Terrill, Associated Press) " 'Tim, all these companies say they can't find talent,' " Rev. Jackson recalls telling Cook. " 'Oakland is the most multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural city on the West Coast. It's within shouting distance of most of these tech companies. They say 'we can't find them,' Well, they aren't looking in the right places. Come to Oakland. You'll find one of the most creative, innovative, spirited talent bases right in the backyard of Silicon Valley.' " USA TODAY Oakland tech hub fights for diversity This summer, Apple staffers came to the East Oakland Youth Development Center to set up the equipment and offer training on the iPads and use of Apple software such as Keynote and GarageBand. Already, the program is sparking imaginations and ambitions. Tyrese Jackson, 9, dreams of one day making gaming apps like the pair of seventh-grade girls on the Nickelodeon sit-com Game Shakers. Building games is on Raul Sanchez's bucket list, too. The 9-year-old wants to add a third Super Marios brother to the classic video game. "For most of these kids, this is the first time ever being around an iPad," says Pettaway, their 17-year-old college-bound instructor. "What I am trying to do is start their digital footprints early."

Building on a previously proposed instantiation presented by researchers at IEEE Security & Privacy 2015, the winning research identified a better suited error distribution and reconciliation mechanism, analyzed the scheme's hardness against attacks by quantum computers, and identified a possible defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. Using these measures—and for the same lattice dimension—they were able to increase the security parameter by more than 100%, reduce the communication overhead by more than half, and significantly increase computation speed in portable C implementation and current Intel CPUs, all while protecting against timing attacks. The work has already led to concrete use in Chrome and planned usage in TOR.  The prize, which is a partnership of Facebook and USENIX, goes to Erdem Alkim (Department of Mathemathics, Ege University, Turkey), Léo Ducas (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Thomas Pöppelmann (Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany), and Peter Schwabe (Digital Security Group, Radboud University, The Netherlands). Their paper is entitled, “Post-Quantum Key Exchange — A New Hope.” The Internet Defense Prize recognizes and rewards research that meaningfully makes the internet more secure. Created in 2014, the award is funded by Facebook and offered in partnership with USENIX to celebrate contributions to the protection and defense of the Internet. “Security research is in a race against time to innovate faster than adversaries,” said Nektarios Leontiadis, a threat research scientist on the Facebook Security team, in a post announcing the winners. “The last year has seen multiple high-visibility vulnerability disclosures for every major platform. The industry has a history of over-rotating toward offensive work that has little direct impact on most people's lives. Much of the attention still goes to research that celebrates ‘owning’ rather than finding practical solutions for protecting people in the real world. At Facebook, we believe these incentives need to change.” Two additional projects were named as finalists: One is DROWN, a dangerous attack against TLS that uses a server supporting SSLv2 as an oracle to decrypt modern TLS connections. SSLv2, an ancestor of TLS, has been obsolete for 20 years, but about a third of all TLS servers still support it for backwards compatibility. DROWN demonstrates, through several attack scenarios, that SSLv2 is not only weak, but actively harmful to the TLS ecosystem. “The protocol flaws that DROWN exploits are an unanticipated side-effect of US government regulations from the 1990s, which limited the strength of cryptography that could be exported in order to ensure that intelligence agencies could circumvent it,” said Leontiadis. “Decades after these export restrictions were relaxed, they nonetheless contributed to widespread security problems. The authors argue that the attack provides an important historical perspective on how deliberately weakened cryptography can create risks for global Internet security, with implications for current law enforcement demands for backdoor access to encrypted devices and data.” The other is an exploit for a subtle, yet serious, side channel vulnerability (CVE-2016-5696) introduced in a recent TCP specification. The vulnerability allows a blind off-path attacker to infer if any two arbitrary hosts on the Internet are communicating using a TCP connection, and ultimately terminate that connection and perform data injection attacks. This can be used to disrupt or degrade the privacy guarantees of an anonymity network such as Tor, and perform web connection hijacking. The authors also proposed changes to both the TCP specification and implementation to eliminate the root cause of the problem.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Aug 12, 2016 at 10:16AM Image source: The Motley Fool. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is facing considerable challenges, and it will take both time and money for the company to adapt to emerging trends in the industry. On the other hand, when considering aspects such as growth opportunities in strategic imperatives, attractive valuation levels, and big cash distributions via dividends and buybacks, IBM stock looks like a compelling purchase for investors right now. 1. Betting on the right businesses   IBM is a company in transition. Management is reducing its presence in businesses related to hardware and other areas with inferior potential for growth, which is having a negative impact on revenue. In addition, foreign currencies depreciation is hurting sales figures as expressed in U.S. dollars. In this context, IBM reported a 2.6% decline in revenue during the second quarter of 2016, to $20.2 billion. The business is still producing tons of cash; free cash flow amounted to $2.1 billion last quarter and to $13.1 billion in the trailing-12-month period, so financial soundness is unquestionable. Nevertheless, the fact that revenue is moving in the wrong direction is an important reason for concern. However, the company's prospects seem much better when looking under the surface. IBM is aggressively investing for growth in a group of businesses management has identified as strategic imperatives, this includes cloud, analytics, security, social, and mobile technologies. Revenue from strategic imperatives grew 12% in the second quarter, reaching $8.3 billion. The cloud segment looks particularly promising, as revenue in this division increased 30% and reached $3.4 billion during the period. The annual run rate for cloud-as-a-service revenue stands at $6.7 billion, jumping 50% year over year last quarter. Over the last year, IBM produced $31 billion in sales from strategic imperatives, and the segment now represents 38% of total company-level revenue. The way things are going, chances are strategic imperatives will continue outgrowing other segments in the coming years, so the division will most probably account for an increasing share of overall revenue in the future. This should be an important driver for IBM in terms of overall growth going forward. 2. Attractive valuation levels IBM stock is doing really well lately, shares of Big Blue have gained over 20% year to date, so short-term momentum is clearly to the upside. But things look remarkably different on a longer time frame, as IBM stock is still trading below price levels from five years ago.  In terms of valuation, IBM looks fairly conveniently priced. The stock carries a price to earnings ratio of 13.2 times earnings over the last year. As a reference, the average company in the S&P 500 index trades at a price to earnings ratio of 20, while the average company in the same industry carries a price to earnings ratio in the neighborhood of 17.3. The following table compares several valuation metrics for IBM versus other big tech companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The four companies operate in different industries, so the comparison is not completely straightforward. Nevertheless, we are still talking about big and mature tech corporations with below-average growth that are paying consistent dividends.  Looking at ratios such as price to earnings, price to free cash flow, price to sales, and dividend yield, IBM is cheaper than Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel across the board. Company P/E P/FCF P/S Dividend Yield IBM 13.2 16.8 1.93 3.5% Microsoft 27.7 32 5.24 2.5% Cisco 15.4 42.2 3.14 3.4% Intel 16.9 23.5 2.92 3% Data source: SEC filings and FinViz.  3. Big dividends and buybacks Not only is IBM stock paying a higher dividend yield than other tech players facing similar difficulties, the company also has a pristine trajectory of dividend payments over the years. IBM has paid uninterrupted dividends in every year since 1916, proving the business is strong enough to produce consistent cash flows under all kinds of circumstances. Even better, IBM has increased dividend payments in the last 21 consecutive years.  In addition to dividends, IBM has a long-standing policy of allocating free cash flow to share buybacks. This allows IBM to increase earnings per share at a faster rate than overall earnings growth by reducing the amount of shares outstanding, and the company has shrunk its share count by over 36% in the last decade. IBM Shares Outstanding data by YCharts. If IBM can jump-start sales growth via improving performance from strategic imperatives, then the stock offers substantial room for gains from currently attractive valuation levels. In the meantime, the company is rewarding shareholders for their patience with generous dividends and stock buybacks. Andres Cardenal owns shares of IBM. The Motley Fool owns shares of Microsoft.

Intel’s upcoming CPU generation, Kaby Lake, will still only be supported on Windows 10. Skylake CPU powered systems previously had to upgrade to Windows 10 before the 17th of July 2017  to continue to receive support from Microsoft. Many users complained and Microsoft claims his feedback made them extend the support period. Both Skylake powered Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 systems will continue to receive security updates till the end of the regular support period for both operating systems. That means Windows 7 will continue to receive updates till the 14th of January 2020 and Windows 8.1 support will be provided till the 10th of January 2023. Extension of the support period is possible through cooperation with Intel. The chip giant will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for Skylake systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. Intel’s upcoming CPU generation Kaby Lake and AMD’s 7th generation CPUs will only be supported by Windows 10. There will be no changes to that policy. Microsoft also still recommends Skylake system owners to upgrade to Windows 10. Windows 10 support ends at the 13th of October 2026 when the Anniversary Update is applied. Before the release of the Anniversary update the end of support was scheduled at the 14th of October 2025.

But oh no, we(MS) knows your computer better then you. That kinda mentality will go no where fast as evident by the slow Windows 10 market shares. 0 Agree Xercus Moderator Posted on: 13 Aug 16 19:21 ^We agree on that subject, an open interface is what is needed, after all who is to tell me what is better for me. Give me a set of rules and give me power to take it from there. It is really all that is needed. Then there is that other aspect, listen to the users! Collect only the bare essentials of what you need to develop the OS, not any and everything. A few more's and we're home. They will have to adapt to markets though, and so they look in envy towards the app stores, but they really do not have to as they already have a winning formula/effective monopoly, so the interesting question is why? The possible answer is they're looking for ways to earn even more/getting better margins. What I can not figure out is why they are seemingly willing to risk their entire existing user base to achieve it. No one, not even MS is THAT big and there are always some waiting in the shadows. In this isolated case however, I think MS is worthy of a clap on the shoulder - Way to go! 0 Agree TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 14 Aug 16 06:07 Personally, I don't think Microsoft should be paying any attention to what CPU you have. It shouldn't matter if you have the latest Kaby Lake CPU, or some old XP-era uniprocessor. The software updates should come regardless of how old the hardware is.

That's probably what people said when IBM tried to enter the microcomputer market. I wasn't born until the 1990s, so I can't say what the public though in the early 1980s, but I assume someone must have said "They practically have a monopoly on mainframes, what could they gain from selling cheap microcomputers?" But, IBM was smart enough to realize PCs weren't going away. Rather, they probably saw that PCs were only going to become more mainstream in the future. Microsoft has most likely seen something similar in hand-held devices. Therefore, they probably feel they must do whatever the leaders in the field of hand-held computing are doing until they can claim leadership themselves. If that happens, others will likewise feel like they must imitate Microsoft. 0 Agree roho MyCE Member Posted on: 14 Aug 16 08:16 Sounds like it was a bit of a cynical ploy to force certain users off Win 7 or 8.1, just 2 weeks after the free upgrade period "expires" they do a u turn. Probably nowhere near as many upgraders as Microsoft thought/hoped for so the decision had to be reversed. 0 Agree Xercus Moderator Posted on: 14 Aug 16 11:26 Quote: Originally Posted by TSJnachos117 That's probably what people said when IBM tried to enter the microcomputer market.

If that happens, others will likewise feel like they must imitate Microsoft. First of all, IBM never sold 'cheap' microcomputers , secondly, there is a big difference between going into another market and tweaking an existing OS in a way that has received much negative mention. I was around in the eighties, but I do not recall any negative attitude towards IBM going into the client computer market. However, I do recall much negative mention regarding their arrogance and ignorance towards customers in the server market. As we know, they got hit quite badly some years later when Microsoft came along with their NT4 and the rest is history. Now, that would qualify as a comparison to what may happen to Microsoft's client OS unless they start listening to the users and rather continue their travel on 'ignorance avenue'. The sheer amount of 3rd-party tweaks and tools, both legal and well in the grey at least should tell Microsoft that there are a lot of users who disagree with their present direction. What I notice is that there are several Linux distros being made with the more casual user in mind and given a little time, they may become real competition to Windows which really is the oddball compared to the rest, even MAC (that's just BSD and so sort of Linux as well). 0 Agree TSJnachos117 MyCE Resident Posted on: 15 Aug 16 03:14 I understand microcomputers were, by nature, cheap compared to mainframes (and probably still are). I also understand that IBM was, up till that point, best known for mainframes. I'm sure the IBM PC was cheap compared to whatever their newest mainframe was. The price compared to other micros was, I assume, another story. Of course, the negativity towards IBM in the early 1980s was just an assumption on my part. My bad, I guess. In any case, Microsoft's theoretical motivation doesn't make the bad things they've done right. Microsoft doesn't have the right to spy on people "because we're just imitating Google. They did it first." 0 Agree Register Login Register to Myce.com Register in 10 seconds, pick a username, enter your mail address and proof you're human, that's all!

Then there are the two large dish-shaped apparatus, each standing at opposite sides of the hall: Just whispering into one gets the message across clearly to the other side. In yet another exhibit, there is a maze and ping-pong balls, with several openings through which the balls can be “navigated” by opening and closing the flaps on the side of the maze. These are just part of the 120 interactive exhibits at the newly-opened Penang Tech Dome, a place where science is fun and much more exciting than memorising the periodic table in chemistry class. The idea of a science discovery centre was mooted by the Penang state government back in 2011 as a way to arrest the decline in the standards of English, mathematics and science among students below 15 years of age. After five years of fundraising, the steering committee finally managed to raise RM27.5 million (S$9.2 million) to turn Komtar’s old Geodesic Dome into the Penang Tech Dome. According to steering committee chairman Wong Siew Hai, the Penang Tech Dome is modelled on the San Jose Tech Centre in California, where the government provided the building and some seed money, with the rest of the funding raised from corporations and the public. State-owned development arm Penang Development Corporation (PDC) sponsored RM4 million and the free use of the Dome in Komtar while the Penang state government provided seed funding of RM1.15 million. At the opening of the Penang Tech Dome recently, Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng thanked major sponsors including PDC, IJM, Dell, Intel and other corporations and personal donors for their contributions, which have made the centre a reality. “Going forward, the Tech Dome will need further support from the industry, corporate sector and the general public to help ensure its future success,” he said. The Penang Tech Dome occupies two levels, with six main galleries. It is also the first science centre in the world to exhibit the Digital Autopsy Machine, which will be displayed in London and New York only next year. The first section is the Optics section, where the laser room is located and where the science behind the various types of light and their influence on human perception is explained through very simple interactive devices. From there, you move on to the Forces and Motion section, where gravity, momentum, kinetics and dynamics are again explained through interactive experiences, including the G-Drop, a gigantic slide where you get hoisted up and then slide down. Then there is the Robotics section, where visitors learn what makes a robot and how it functions. There are even robotic arms to control for a full interactive experience of how robots work. Naturally, there is an Information Technology section to explain the nuts and bolts behind modern technology and how modern-day devices and appliances are created. This is where the making of tablets and smartphones are explained and demonstrated. On the second level, there is a Life Tech section, where the digital autopsy machine is displayed, and which also comprises various sections on other diagnostic systems, nutrients and the science behind keeping people healthy through technology. On the same level is the Electromagnetism section, where topics such as electricity and magnetism are demonstrated through mini-interactive experiences in which visitors can experience magnetic fields and the flow of electrons on their own. Finally, there is a Children’s Exploration Zone for younger children who may not be able to grasp some of the more sophisticated exhibits. There will also be an observatory slated to open at the end of the year. Besides the permanent exhibits, the Penang Tech Dome will have a line-up of events, and Science, Technology, English and Maths (Stem) programmes almost every month. This month, an Education Toys Demo together with FisherTechnik, Grow Kid and Science Explorer will be held along with a celebration of the Perseid Meteor Shower by the Astronomical Society Penang. A Japanese Technology Weekend will be held in September with events and workshops lined up by Sony EMCS (Malaysia), Toray Group (Malaysia) and Murata Electronics (Malaysia). The Penang Tech Dome is open daily from 10am-6pm except for Tuesdays.

Resend activation e-mail Opposable Thumbs / Gaming & Entertainment No Man’s Sky Windows port launched today, is kind of a mess Button remapping woes, framerate hitches; first patch already online. by Sam Machkovech - Aug 12, 2016 8:15 pm UTC Login to bookmark 238 Three days after its PlayStation 4 launch, the space-exploration game No Man's Sky is now live for Windows PC gamers (via either Steam or GoG). But if you've been anywhere near PC gaming for the past few years, you won't be surprised to find out that combining "small development team," "video game that promises 18 quintillion planets," and "worldwide simultaneous launch on all kinds of PCs" is a dangerous mix. The game's Steam reviews, which have surpassed 5,700 as of press time, are sampling out as "mostly negative," with frequent complaints about framerate hitches and total system crashes. Though Steam's reports must be considered anecdotal, more than a few trustworthy voices are piping up online to report issues with No Man's Sky, despite using systems that far exceed the game's minimum spec, which calls for older cards like the GTX 480 and Radeon 7870. Even users with high-end solutions like the GTX 1080 or two GTX 980Ti cards in SLI mode are reporting major stutters—on a game that runs on a comparatively so-so PS4 console with a mostly consistent 30 FPS refresh. Ars Technica is running two NMS test sessions on high-end PCs at the moment, and both of them are running GTX 980Ti cards with SSD drives, 16GB of RAM, and either a Skylake i5 or a Haswell i7 Intel chip. We're seeing inconsistent framerates, in spite of both computers in question having fully updated drivers on Windows 10. The game's PC version defaults to a 30 FPS cap, which can be disabled in the normal options menus. But with this setting turned on, the game can't help but hitch down to an apparent 20 FPS on a regular basis, not to mention throw up frequent display hitches of half a second at a time. Removing that framerate cap can get play up to a smooth 60 frames per second, and we enjoyed more consistent framerates without the cap. But even those framerates can bounce down to 30 or less at random intervals. The game also suffers from freezing hitches, even without apparent spikes in visible geometry like creatures or spaceships. Developer Hello Games chief Sean Murray took to Twitter to ask users to check their video cards' drivers and make sure their video cards are compatible with OpenGL 4.5. Otherwise, he offered little recourse beyond "we'll try to resolve ASAP" for affected users. A patch was already uploaded within minutes of the game's 1pm EDT launch on Friday, but Ars' tests came after that patch went live. Beyond these rendering-engine issues, we've noticed some surprising sloppiness in how NMS treats PC gamers. While the game supports total button remapping on either keyboard-and-mouse or gamepad, its on-screen prompts don't update accordingly. For example, harvesting a resource always brings up a prompt saying what button triggers the action. But if you remap that button (on keyboards, it defaults as E), the prompt will either remove the button hint entirely or continue asking that you press the E key. (Those remaps do not apply to the "rename your discoveries" interface, by the way. So if you like uploading custom names for your creatures and planets, we hope you like the default button assignments.) The game's floating-menu interface was apparently built with joysticks in mind, which PC gamers have been finding out the hard way. Mouse scroll wheels cannot be turned on to scroll between menus or through text, and players are also forced to hold-to-confirm every menu interaction in the game. If you'd hoped that using a mouse would simplify the game's constant use of menus and loot-sorting, you may be disappointed. Oh, and don't try alt-tabbing out of the game. That's a guaranteed crash. We imagine some of those interface bits could see an update before long, but we're surprised to see such usability issues not checked before the game's launch. How long the widespread stutters will last, however, is anybody's guess. Expand full story Promoted Comments Xenoveritas Smack-Fu Master, in training jump to post I haven't had any issues with alt-tabbing the game. (In fact, I'm alt-tabbed out right now!) I did, however, discover that changing pretty much ANY of the graphics options makes the game constantly blink on my computer. Like, the screen just goes completely black, at a rate that leaves the game entirely unplayable. Changing them back is an effort in either massive frustration or just editing the No Man's Sky\Binaries\SETTINGS\TKGRAPHICSSETTINGS.MXML file. (Just throwing that out there for anyone else who needs to tweak graphics settings or needs to know where to look to revert a setting change they made that makes the game effectively unusable.) The problem is that changing anything requires restarting the game. If you're just starting out and haven't touched your ship yet, you haven't created a save. So do that before playing with options and be prepared to hunt for the "Quit to Desktop" option (it's in the Options tab of the menu for some reason). And that's ignoring things like apparently I may have broken the game by taking the preorder ship. Who knows. 13 posts | registered 9/24/2014 Reader comments 238 You must login or create an account to comment.

Before you head to the lake, check out Xconomy Seattle’s review of a couple of healthcare IT investments; Apple’s acquisition of Turi (nee GraphLab, then Dato) and the future of the iPhone; new funding for Zenoti and Kepler Communications; a new fund for Keiretsu Capital; a 12th Man licensing deal; and Paul Allen’s new music festival. —We’ve seen a couple of significant healthcare IT investments in the last week. Accolade, which provides personalized guidance on healthcare decisions to employees of large, self-insured employers, topped up its Series E funding round to the tune of $70 million from Andreessen Horowitz and Madrona Venture Group, among others. The company recently established a second headquarters here under the leadership of Rajeev Singh, a co-founder of Concur, one of the Seattle-area’s biggest startup success stories. That followed last week’s $11 million investment in 98point6, which is hiring software engineers and physicians to “deliver direct patient care through technology.” Both companies have in common a focus on delivering healthcare help—or, in the case of 96point8, care itself—through technology. The Northwest, and specifically University of Washington, has been a hub for development of telemedicine practices going back four decades, at first as a way to provide care in remote areas. It’s an area that appears poised for significant growth, according to a new survey by the National Business Group on Health, which represents 425 large employers. The survey, which polled 133 companies with more than 15 million covered individuals, found that nine out of 10 employers plan to offer telehealth services in 2017, in states that allow it. That’s up from seven out of 10 that planned to do so in 2016. The group’s CEO, Brian Marcotte, says large employers are placing less emphasis on the design of their healthcare plans for the coming year, and thinking more about “optimizing how health care is accessed and delivered. That translates into expanded telehealth services,” among other efforts, he says in a news release. And that should bode well for companies like Accolade, 98point6, and their competitors. For more on what Washington can do to encourage healthcare IT innovation, check out Rob Arnold’s piece in the Xconomist Forum. —ICYMI late last week, Turi—formerly known as Dato and GraphLab, but all the while one of Seattle’s most prominent machine learning startup companies—was acquired by Apple. GeekWire first reported the news (and today has a report on rumors that Apple may be looking for a very large chunk of Seattle-area office space) but oddly, a week has gone by with no public acknowledgement of the deal from Turi’s leaders or investors. Need to know basis. For a glimpse at why Apple is making acquisitions in machine learning, check out Wade Roush’s iPhone 7 predictions. He argues that the software on our mobile devices needs to catch up with the hardware, which is nearing perfection—at least for the current world of the touch user interface. “What’s missing is an organizing idea—a new way of packaging and interacting with the information on our mobile devices. Something that will make iOS look as primitive as the operating system on a 2003 Treo or Blackberry. “And here’s my big prediction: that idea is Siri. Or rather, her future offspring. To make the next leap, Apple and its competitors need to figure out how to build more powerful conversational agents, so that computing can finally move off the screen and into our daily lives.” To do that, Apple needs to race against the rest of tech giants for experts in machine learning and other artificial intelligence precursors. Turi’s staff included lots of people with that expertise. See, for another example, Intel’s $400 million-plus acquisition this week of Nervana Systems, a San Diego machine learning startup. —Zenoti, which provides management software geared for spas, salons, and resorts, raised a $15 million Series B funding round from lead investor Norwest Venture Partners, and Accel Partners, which invested in the company’s $6 million Series A round. The 6-year-old Mercer Island, WA-based company says it will invest some of the new capital to expand its offerings for fitness and yoga businesses. —Kepler Communications, a 2016 Techstars Seattle company based in Toronto, Canada, announced a $5 million seed funding round from lead investor IA Ventures, joined by Techstars Ventures, Liquid 2 VC, SK Ventures, Zelkova Ventures, Plug & Play Ventures, V1 VC, Globalive Capital, and BDC. The funding will support the company’s launch of two communications satellites by the end of 2017, which will form the initial pieces of a network that the company says will reduce costs and latency for accessing satellite data. Co-founder and CEO Mina Mitry has high praise for the support the company received during its time in Seattle, citing in particular Techstars Seattle’s managing director, Chris DeVore, and Joe Landon of the Space Angels Network. It’s worth reading Mitry’s perspective on the fund-raising process, and the out-sized attention the tech world pays to venture funding events, as opposed to more meaningful milestones on the path to building a real business: “All too often I find entrepreneurs get praise for raising investment while those building businesses that bootstrap to exciting revenues go unnoticed. The converse should be true as bootstrapped businesses have actually built a machine (business) that works. We’re only at what I like to call step 0 of execution; we’ve got the parts and resources to build our machine, but some assembly is required. “Fund raising quickly becomes a toxic activity that takes away from building a real business. It’s easy to get roped in by the allure of travelling to different destinations, meeting exciting people, and landing investor checks, so much so that you unwittingly ignore (or want to ignore) very real problems that need to be solved. To that end, I made every effort to minimize how much of the team’s most precious and finite resource – time – would be spent to get the necessary money resource. This came at the cost of isolating myself from most business operations and the team for an extended period of time. Needless to say, I’m happy to be off the fundraising trail.” —Keiretsu Capital, the managed investment fund set up in 2015 to invest alongside angel investing groups, including its namesake, Keiretsu Forum, announced a $4.2 million second fund. That brings the fund’s total to $10 million, of which more than $5 million has been invested in upwards of 40 companies. The remainder is earmarked for investment through early 2018. Keiretsu Capital is headed by CEO Nathan McDonald, who also chairs the Keiretsu Forum Northwest, which last year saw its members plough a record $43.5 million into startup companies. —At Xconomy, we pay close attention to university technology transfer and intellectual property licensing deals. This one doesn’t have much to do with tech or biotech, our usual focus areas. But hey, it’s almost football season, and today happens to be August 12, so: When the Seahawks first went to the Super Bowl in 2006, putting their 12th Man fan base in the national spotlight, it attracted the ire of Texas A&M, whose football team has a proud 12th Man tradition dating to 1922. I wrote about it for The Seattle Times. A decade later, Texas A&M says it has reached a new licensing agreement for the “12th Man,” which the Aggies trademarked in 1990. A clip from the Seahawks website. 12s, not 12th Man. The five-year deal prohibits the Seahawks from using “12th Man” on the Ring of Honor in the stadium, and the Seahawks franchise can’t use it on social media. The Seahawks pay Texas A&M a licensing royalty covering limited use in the Pacific Northwest. But the team mostly now uses “12” or “12s”—which is much more inclusive than the gender-specific 12th Man—in reference to the fan base. Anyway, the first pre-season game is Saturday at the Kansas City Chiefs.   A rendering of a concert stage in the North Plaza of CenturyLink Field. Via Upstream Music Fest + Summit. —And while we’re on the subject of the Seahawks and CenturyLink Field, word came this week that team owner Paul Allen is launching a new festival around another one of his passions: music. Allen’s Vulcan Inc., which just pulled off a well-received art fair, announced the Upstream Music Fest + Summit to take place May 11-13, 2017, in venues in and around Pioneer Square, including the plaza north of the football stadium. The event looks like a South By Southwest-style combination of conferences and concerts, highlighting artists based in the Northwest. From the event’s Website: “At our Summit we’ll collide music, gaming, tech, media, design, and more to tackle today’s toughest industry challenges and open up opportunities within the new entertainment economy.” Benjamin Romano is editor of Xconomy Seattle.

The PC version of No Man’s Sky was released today, and this version of the game already seems a bit disappointing. The good news is that the game supports a variety of resolutions, from 640 by 480 all the way up to 4K, and a good number of other graphical options and settings. Be aware that the game is locked at 30 frames per second upon launch, and you’ll have to manually bump that up if you want a smoother experience. The controls are also fully remappable, and a mouse and keyboard will give you more options and finer controls than a standard gamepad, although the game also ships with gamepad support if you prefer to play in that manner. On paper, this is a full-featured PC release with all the little fiddly bits that we were hoping for. In practice, it doesn’t seem to be quite ready for prime time. I’m playing on a system with an Intel Core i7-6700 CPU, 16 GB of RAM and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080. It’s a test system that’s on loan, and it’s a bit overpowered to play a game that was first released on the PlayStation 4. And I’m still seeing issues with frame rates. It doesn't help that you have to restart the game every time you adjust the graphics settings or Alt-Tab out of the application. For reference, here are No Man's Sky's minimum specifications: OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions) Processor: Intel Core i3 Memory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: Nvidia GTX 480, AMD Radeon 7870 Storage: 10 GB available space The game hitches and the frame rate drops at random moments, and it’s obvious enough to be distracting. The PS4 version doesn’t quite look as good as the game being played at 3440 by 1440, but it’s a much smoother experience. I also tabbed out of the game to make these notes, and it doesn’t seem like I can tab back into the game. Other people on social media are having similar problems; the game is having issues with stuttering and low frame rates. Sadly the PC launch of No Man's Sky is unacceptable. People are pissed. It wont launch, dips and freezes. They need to patch it ASAP. — Destin Legarie (@DestinLegarie) August 12, 2016 The game currently has 882 reviews on Steam, with a "mostly negative" rating. Our advice? Wait a bit to see if performance is improved in the near future before purchasing. The PS4 version of the game runs much better, as painful as that is to say. Hello Games is currently working on patching the PS4 version of the game, which had its own share of issues. Update: The game has already been patched, and the official Twitter account has offered some tips to get No Man's Sky running smoothly. Biggest issue reported so far is players without the Visual C++ Redist 2010. First PC patch released already! Update and restart if needed — Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 12, 2016 Number two issue so far is players who have out of date GFX drivers, or none installed. Please install latest drivers from AMD and nVidia. — Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 12, 2016 Number three please make sure your GFX card is above the min spec. OpenGL 4.5 is required to play No Man's Sky — Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 12, 2016 We've tried all these solutions, and are still seeing some performance issues. Other folks are having better luck with the game's performance by maxing the framerate cap and disabling v-sync. If you have any tips for getting the game to run better, please post them in the comments.

Known as Fuchsia, it seems to be a completely different project to Android and Chrome OS, but its purpose remains unknown. Fuchsia was uncovered this week. It first made a public appearance in early July, when Google quietly created a new repository for the operating system on its development server. The OS is open-source, allowing outsiders to peek in and contribute as Google begins to build Fuchsia. Not a lot of code has currently been written. There's a basic kernel, Magenta, that targets "modern phones and modern personal computers" and the beginnings of a user interface stack to create apps. According to notes in the repository, the operating system can already be booted onto the Intel NUC mini-computer and Acer Switch 12 laptop. Support for the Raspberry Pi 3 is said to be coming soon. Google's choice of UI framework, responsible for creating graphical elements like the desktop and windows, has prompted discussion amongst developers. Fuchsia uses Flutter for its user interface, a framework that includes another project called Escher. Escher supports complex effects like soft shadows and light diffusion that appear out of place on the lightweight Fuchsia. In a comment on Hacker News, user pavlov proposed a reason for Escher's presence. The shadow and reflection effects that Escher specialises in are a key component of Google's Material Design Android design language, suggesting Fuchsia will run apps that are styled like current Android ones. "I think the idea here is to build an UI layer that's designed from scratch for Google's Material design language," explained pavlov. Apart from the Material Design focus, nothing else is known about Fuchsia. Google hasn't officially said anything about the OS and speculation is rife about its intentions for the project. A new operating system from a company as sizeable as Google is bound to attract attention and Fuchsia is no exception. There's currently no serious suggestion that Fuchsia is built to replace either Android or Chrome OS, Google's two current operating systems. It could be designed to combine the two into a single merged OS, as has been previously rumoured. The inclusion of a kernel that runs on phones and PCs fits with this idea, although the emphasis on lightweight software makes it less plausible. Fuchsia may be planned as an operating system for internal use by Google. It could be intended to power Internet of Things devices that require a scaled-down core, but the inclusion of a sophisticated UI stack doesn't make sense here. Hacker News users suggested the OS may be intended as a platform for virtual and augmented reality. Here, a complex UI layer is required, allowing developers to create immersive visually appealing content. A slimmed down kernel is also desirable, reducing input latency and creating higher frame rates. Fuchsia could be an OS designed from the ground-up for VR, indicating Google's growing interest in the field. Advanced users interested in the project can download and build it themselves from the source. It comes with a basic kernel, support for a handful of programming languages and a single functioning program. As Fuchsia evolves over the coming months, Google's intentions for the project should become more obvious. It may be some time before it's clear whether Fuchsia is a new device-agnostic OS for consumers or something to run behind the scenes at Google, however.

‘Our Technology Is Our Ideology’: George Siemens on the Future of Digital Learning EdSurge https://www.edsurge.com/ News Higher Education Postsecondary Learning ‘Our Technology Is Our Ideology’: George Siemens on the Future of Digital Learning By Marguerite McNealAug 11, 2016 George Siemens Check Out the EdSurge Digital Learning NetworkLet’s Go! Top Stories: What does it mean to be human in a digital age? Some people researching education technology might not spend their days wondering how their work fits into this existential question—but George Siemens isn’t "some people." “Maybe my mama hugged me extra when I was a baby.” That’s his explanation for how he thinks about the role of education in the 21st century. A researcher, theorist, educator, Siemens is the digital learning guy. He’s credited with co-teaching the first MOOC in 2008, introduced the theory of “connectivism”—the idea that knowledge is distributed across digital networks—and spearheaded research projects about the role of data and analytics in education. Siemens’ work is on the cutting edge of what’s possible in digital learning, but he doesn’t want to discuss the latest fads in education technology. Instead he wants to talk about humanity. He’s optimistic that technology can help people achieve a higher quality of life in a future where work is increasingly automated and distributed across the globe. He just doesn’t think our current university systems and edtech solutions will get us there. “Our technology is our ideology,” Siemens says. He’s worried that, rather than advancing our human potential, many edtech companies and universities are perpetuating the status quo. While machine learning and automation are obviating the need for learners to memorize content and develop routine skills, current edtech solutions still focus on helping learners develop these capabilities, he says. Instead, they should drive students to hone their uniquely human traits—the ones that will help them thrive in an increasingly automated world. Rise of the robots Siemens has both an academic and an industry perspective on digital learning. He’s a researcher and strategist with the Technology Enhanced Knowledge Research Institute at Athabasca University in Alberta. He also leads the the Learning Innovation and Networked Knowledge (LINK) Research Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington. The LINK Lab is a hub for international scholars exploring the digitization of knowledge and learning, and how this process impacts education. Siemens also serves on the advisory board of learning analytics company Civitas Learning and is a mentor to startups in Intel’s Education Accelerator. He’s currently working with adaptive technology platform Smart Sparrow as part of a research grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Throughout his various projects, of which there are too many to track, he focuses on education’s potential to develop the capabilities that make humans unique. Affect, self-awareness and networking abilities are all traits that separate mankind from machines and will be important for work and life in an increasingly automated world. The kind of knowledge that humans need to function in society looks different than it did during the Industrial Revolution. Apple supplier Foxconn recently replaced 60,000 workers with automated technology, a move that’s becoming increasingly common as machines master more routine tasks. Now that robots are flipping burgers and reading X-rays—for a fraction of the cost of human labor—learners need to prepare for careers that employ uniquely human traits like self-regulation and communication. Creativity, complex problem-solving and coordinating with others are among skills that will become increasingly important for workers to develop by 2020, according to the World Economic Forum. From adaptive learning to adaptive learners Siemens worries that current education systems aren’t adjusting to this new reality. Even the latest edtech trends are still preparing students for a concept of work and life that’s quickly becoming outdated, he says. He points to the learning management system as an example. It’s controlled, top-down, by the institution that bought it; it’s closed to anyone without a login. The LMS reflects a content-driven concept of education that encourages learners to master what the university thinks they should know. Blogs, wikis and social media, on the other hand, are distributed across networks. These technologies encourage more self-driven, open-ended exploration—skills that Siemens says are increasingly important for humans to function in their careers and society. On his blog, he’s opined that most adaptive software focuses on knowledge acquisition instead of helping students in learning to think and function in modern society. Colleges are increasingly using adaptive technology in large online or blended courses to help students learn at their own pace. But while these solutions make learning more efficient, they’re perpetuating an outdated form of learning, Siemens says. “You’ve made a process efficient that would make an awesome, productive employee in the 1960s, but you haven’t developed the mindsets, the networking capabilities and so on that you need for an individual—not just an employee, but a member of society—in 2020. To make a process more efficient that shouldn’t be done at all is a waste of time.” To some, that kind of thinking equates to putting the cart before the horse. “You can’t be an adaptive learner if you don’t know anything,” says Rory McGreal, a professor in the Centre for Digital Learning at Athabasca University. He says learners need to master content and skills before they can move on to “higher-order” functions like creative thinking. “In order to be creative, you have to have skills behind that. I think you teach creativity by giving facts and showing how to do things.” McGreal, who’s worked alongside Siemens at Athabasca, cautions against putting the learner at the center of education conversations. “This focus on the learner is a big mistake. We should look at the whole learning system and how it works—the learner, teacher, technologist, administration, community.” The path forward Our ability to look at the “learning system” and see how it works is getting better by the day. Learning analytics tools now track the digital breadcrumbs that students leave everywhere from signing up for meal plans to completing online homework assignments. Siemens says rich data about students is a game changer for higher education. “One of the most important developments for the education system of today—over the last 100 years—has been the development of data-centric models to understand learner performance and teacher activity.” Most universities have yet to use this data in meaningful ways though, he adds. Institutional leaders might be excited about the potential for data solutions like early warning systems that indicate whether students are at risk of dropping out of a course. But most of them need to do a better job of understanding how these systems work and what kinds of data they’re capturing. University staff who are buying data-driven technology should demand transparency from the companies that sell them these tools, Siemens says. That’s the only way they’ll be able to study the tools and understand how they’re impacting student outcomes. Say a company promises its solution reduces the dropout rate among first-generation students by 15 percent; Siemens argues that the university should be able to look at the company’s data—and algorithms that use the information—to understand how this happens, and to make sure the product does what it claims. Otherwise, there’s an “imbalance of power” that leaves universities—and researchers like himself—in the dark, he says. Siemens is optimistic about the future of higher education, if data remains open as colleges work with more and more companies. He says right now, universities are experiencing an “enormous unbundling.” The value of a traditional bachelor’s degree has come under fire, as students are supplementing and customizing their education with alternative options like MOOCs, programming bootcamps and nanodegree programs. As Napster “unbundled” music albums, edtech startups are unpacking the degree. But that’s not what Siemens is excited about. He’s interested in the rebundling of higher education. “If we do things right, we could fix many of the things that are really very wrong with the university system, in that it treats people like objects, not human beings. It pushes us through like an assembly-line model rather than encouraging us to be self-motivated, self-regulated, self-monitoring human beings.” The rebundling, which according to Siemens hasn’t happened yet, will upend the university’s role as a gatekeeper of knowledge.

A new report has now shed more light on the upcoming device, revealing there'll be three models and a new "gapless" Surface Book. According to Windows Central's Daniel Rubino, Microsoft is planning a "refreshed" line-up of Surface devices for launch next year. The current Surface Pro tablet and Surface Book laptop will be revised with "modest" updates, clearing the way for the launch of the all-new Surface all-in-one (AiO) PC. Unlike the other members of the Surface family, the new PC will be aimed at living room users. Microsoft is aiming to create an "elegant" computer that owners will want to see in their living room, according to Rubino's inside sources. Three different versions of the PC currently exist internally, giving customers a choice of display sizes and resolutions depending on budget and space. 21.5-inch, 24-inch and 27-inch variants are available. The 21.5-inch option has a Full HD 1920x1080 resolution. The larger versions get ultra-high resolution 4K panels. The sizes and resolutions may be adjusted before launch. The rest of the hardware specifications are currently unknown. The PCs are likely to be based on Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake processors but no firm details have leaked out yet. However, with Microsoft hardware still relatively obscure to most consumers, the company is likely to use the living-room-based "Surface AIO" as a flagship for its brand. That would suggest cutting-edge, high-power hardware to match the rest of the Surface line-up. As with the other members of the family, Surface AIO is likely to include a unique standout feature that makes it more suited to its purpose than its rivals. With the original Surface, it was the ability to convert seamlessly between tablet and laptop. Last year's creative-oriented Surface Book is one of the most powerful detachable notebooks ever built. The star device-defining feature of the Surface AIO is still a closely-guarded secret. It can be assumed it will be a little different to current all-in-one PCs by manufacturers like Dell, HP and Lenovo, but exactly how remains up for speculation. Microsoft isn't devoting its entire hardware team to Surface AIO. It is also working on updates to the existing Surface products, designing the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2 for launch either in the fall or early next year. The Surface Book in particular is getting a reworked design, Rubino's sources said. Notably, its unique fulcrum hinge has been revised so it sits flush with the keyboard tray, allowing for a gapless design. The large hinge on the current model prevents the laptop's lid from meeting the keyboard when closed, leaving a visible gap between the two that looks unsightly and makes the Surface Book more liable to become a dust collector. The new design will solve this issue, allowing the lid to close completely like a regular laptop. Surface Book at Microsoft's October 2015 #Windows10 devices event. Microsoft October 2015 Live Event The update will also feature more modern internals, including Intel's new Kaby Lake processors again. Microsoft could offer an upgraded discrete graphics card too, turning Surface Book into an even more capable mobile workstation. Microsoft is still widely rumoured to be working on a Surface Phone, a professional-oriented smartphone to restore its now almost non-existent handheld business. No information has leaked about the project for a while, either to say it's in active development or has been abandoned. The phone is now expected to launch sometime next year. All of these reports should be taken with a grain of salt as Microsoft is yet to reveal anything about its new Surface products. It has previously hinted at a single launch this year, however, followed by three more devices in 2017. Microsoft may be planning an event this fall, coming a year after the launch of the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. There's some speculation it may wait until early 2017 though, timing the unveiling to coincide with the release of the "Redstone 2" update for Windows 10. With the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book selling well and anticipation high for a Surface Phone, Microsoft's next-generation hardware could prove to be another success, a few years on from its $900 million write down of the original Surface tablet.

VENTURE CAPITAL How This Woman Went From Homelessness to Running a Multimillion-Dollar Venture Fund A year ago, Arlan Hamilton was bouncing from couch to couch chasing a dream. Now, she's leading a $5 million venture fund focused on finding the most promising female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs.

She landed investments from top names in tech, including Marc Andreessen and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. CREDIT: Backstage Capital Advertisement After another long day of chasing down potential investors, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton was ready for bed. The only problem was, she had no idea where she would sleep. As day turned to night, Hamilton sat at a table outside of a grocery store in Palo Alto, California, with a backpack, her suitcase, and nowhere to go on this Sunday in September 2015. For more than a year, she had been pursuing her dream of starting a venture capital fund focused on female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs. But it's tough to get a fund going when you don't have any money to invest. Hamilton had met with every investor she could track down and cold-called everyone in tech she could think of. No one had written her a check. Why would they? Hamilton, an African American lesbian, was a Silicon Valley outsider. She had no track record as a venture capitalist. And she wanted to invest in a segment of founders with little proven success. She'd spent everything to bootstrap her mission. For months, she'd been homeless, sleeping on couches, in motels, out of cars, at airports. As a weary Hamilton sat, contemplating her next move, her phone buzzed. "I'm in," read the text from Susan Kimberlin, a tech veteran who made a name for herself at Salesforce and PayPal. Kimberlin was ready to bet on Hamilton to bring more diversity to tech--and her check was the lifeline Hamilton needed to get Backstage Capital up and running. Hamilton sat there in silence, lost in thought, letting the moment sink in. "I made it," she thought to herself before standing up to do a moonwalk and a little twirl. Then immediately, she went back to work, calling the startups she'd been wanting to invest in for months. She picked up her bags and started walking. "I never had to be homeless again after that," she says. Not a charity There is a wave of new venture funds focused on bringing more diversity to Silicon Valley, by investing in women, people of color, or those of the LGBT community. Backstage Capital, along with Kapor Capital and Intel Capital's diversity fund, is an exemplar of such firms. Since Kimberlin's first check, Backstage Capital has collected investments from a who's who of tech investors and executives, including Marc Andreessen, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca and his wife, Crystal English, Rose Tech Ventures managing partner David Rose, Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie, and Swati Mylavarapu of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. To date, Hamilton, 35, has invested in nine sets of founders whose companies tap into ideas and markets that have been largely ignored by the predominantly white, Asian, and male Silicon Valley. With her $5 million fund, Hamilton looks to capture 1 percent ownership in early-stage companies that are seeking their first round of funding. "Arlan's focus on diversity will unlock access to valuable talent and huge markets that haven't been on the radar of traditional investors," Sacca says. "She's out there finding companies that I would never ever have seen," marvels Rose. Hamilton's portfolio includes Text Engine, a startup that allows users with "dumb phones" to pull information from the internet; Radial, a music-streaming app focused on the soca, a Caribbean-based drum-heavy dance offshoot of calypso; and Tinsel, a hardware company that makes fashionable necklaces that double as headphones. "Last year when I was raising money, being black, being a woman, being pregnant--it was just strike after strike of what investors are not interested in," says Aniyia Williams, Tinsel's CEO. "But when I talked to Arlan, she got it right away." Lowercase Capital chairman Chris Sacca. Sacca is among the numerous big-name investors to join Backstage Capital as a limited partner. CREDIT: Getty Images Like many of her tech idols, Hamilton wears the same uniform every day: a black shirt or black hoodie that proudly sports the name "Backstage Capital" in bold purple letters. Tall, African American, and female, wearing her hair in a short black bob, Hamilton looks nothing like the majority of venture capitalists in the Bay Area--but nonetheless has the goals of any investor. "This is not a nonprofit or a charity. I want killer companies that are making money and will make money," says Hamilton, who rarely raises her calm and confident voice. "My job is to make money for my investors, and I can't do that with companies based on my heart. It has to be based on companies that are badass." As with the rest of the tech industry, diversity among venture capitalists is scarce. Among 71 of the top venture capital firms, women represent only 8 percent of senior investment teams, according to data compiled in 2015 by Social Capital and The Information. Hispanics and African Americans make up just 2 percent of those ranks. All this trickles down to startups. Only 2.7 percent of venture-funded companies are led by women, according to a 2014 report by Babson College. Just 1 percent of founders among venture-backed startups are black, according to 2010 data from CB Insights. More specifically, a mere 24 black women received any venture funding from 2012 to 2014, according to the #ProjectDiane report released in February. Hamilton, obviously, understands that some of her founders will fail, but she believes they deserve to be given the same opportunities that are often plentiful for white, Asian, and male entrepreneurs. "For all of the Mark Zuckerbergs or the successful companies that we see that are founded by white men, how many have failed?" says Alicia Thomas, CEO of Dibs, a Backstage Capital-backed startup whose technology lets gyms charge dynamic--or surge--pricing for their classes. "Women and people of color aren't given the chance to fail because it's like, 'Oh, see, that's what happened.'" Chasing billion-dollar ideas Hamilton first started studying tech in 2012. At the time, she was working in the music industry as a production coordinator, helping orchestrate shows for acts like CeeLo Green, Kirk Franklin, and Amanda Palmer. This was Hamilton's dream job, but she noticed that many of the artists and music executives she admired were investing their music money in tech. That piqued her interest. Hamilton began reading and watching anything she could get ahold of to teach her about the world of tech and venture capital. She'd watch keynote speeches on YouTube and read blog posts and books by investors, "even though I didn't understand most of it," Hamilton says with a chuckle. But she'd grown up knocking on strangers' doors as a Jehovah's Witness (she no longer practices), and had no qualms about randomly reaching out to founders and investors and offering to help in any way she could. Making connections and helping young companies land investments gave her a high. It became a hobby, something she did at home in Houston in between her artists' tours. And all her life, Hamilton had been insatiably curious. In elementary school, Hamilton would ask countless questions, often to the annoyance of her teachers. This landed her on both the honor roll and in the principal's office--for being disruptive. Hamilton, who'd grown up without much money, was often one of few black kids in her honors classes. In them, she would make a point and see it receive little attention--but then, a white boy would be praised for saying something similar. "I grew up very quickly understanding that I was going to have to do more if I wanted to be seen as equal," she says. "I was going to have to work at least twice as hard if I was even going to be given a chance or taken seriously." And, as she connected founders and investors, she saw that more often than not, it was the white male founders she helped that received the most opportunities: "It became clear really fast that there were certain people who were not getting meetings, even if they had a really great company." To the queer black woman within her, this was wrong. To the hustler within her, it was a huge opportunity. While others saw markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence as the next jackpot technologies, Hamilton saw the next billion-dollar ideas in that pool of untapped, underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a side project to her music gigs, Hamilton chased the idea of a fund focused on LGBT entrepreneurs, for about six months in 2013. "I went hard on that, but it just didn't take off at all," she says. Hamilton had no credibility in the tech industry: "There was a lot of stuff I had to prove." Her music career was on an upswing, but as months passed, Hamilton became obsessed with her idea. She decided she was going to give it another try. In August 2014, Hamilton wrote an email to all her music colleagues and told them she was putting her career on pause. "Anyone who works in music will tell you that it's hard to get a gig, and to turn down gigs is silly," says Hamilton, who was then ready to fully focus on her fund. "To turn down the only money that was coming in ... yeah, it was crazy." Aniyia Williams, CEO of Tinsel, is one of the several founders who have received funding from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital She began living off her savings while lining up entrepreneurs she hoped to invest in and scrambling to meet more investors. She just needed to find one person who believed in her. That proved tougher than she had imagined. As months went by, Hamilton was forced to leave her apartment and bounce around from one friend's couch to another. By the end of 2014, she had yet to collect a single investment check, but she had begun building her profile with powerful Silicon Valley allies, including Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the top startup accelerator. Altman couldn't invest in Backstage Capital, given his commitments to Y Combinator, but one night as Hamilton sat in a motel room in Houston, unsure when her next meal would come, Altman sent her an email. "The world needs what you're doing, and I want to help you," he said. "I just remember thinking, 'Wow. If he's saying that, that means this could be bigger than I thought,'" Hamilton says. Dear White Venture Capitalists On January 1, 2015, Hamilton relocated to Austin. A month later, she flew to San Francisco for Y Combinator's Female Founders Conference. "It wasn't, 'Oh, my god, this is Disneyland.' It was like, 'This feels right. I feel confident here. I feel like I belong,'" Hamilton says. Later, when she got accepted for 500 Startups' two-week seminar for new investors in Palo Alto, Hamilton bought a one-way ticket. She got there in May and rubbed shoulders with dozens of other rookie investors. Many were already-wealthy industry veterans. One of them was Kimberlin. The two gravitated to each other thanks to their similar investment theses: They believed diversity was technology's next great opportunity. After working in tech for 18 years, Kimberlin knew firsthand how rarely women appear atop the corporate ladder. She wanted to change that through angel investing, and Hamilton intrigued her. As part of the seminar, the investors were encouraged to establish their brands by writing essays for Medium. Write about what you know, 500 Startups' Dave McClure said. Hamilton penned a piece titled "Dear White Venture Capitalists: If You're Reading This, It's (Almost!) Too Late." It went viral. "Your goal is to make money as a VC or accelerator who is investing other people's money because you have a fiduciary duty to do everything in your power to bring your LPs returns," Hamilton wrote in her Medium post. She implored investors to dedicate fractions of their funds to underrepresented entrepreneurs and offered to help. "Therefore, if you haven't hired a team of people who are of color, female, and/or LGBT to actively turn over every stone, to scope out every nook and cranny, to pop out of every bush, to find every qualified underrepresented founder in this country, you're going to miss out on a lot of money when the rest of the investment world gets it." Hamilton's inbox exploded with emails from founders and others in tech thanking her for the post. Many invited Hamilton for meetings. Some were enticed by her arguments but not quite ready to make the jump. Others offered to bring Hamilton in--but have her work in the background, without any ability to invest. "I pitched to well-known VCs, and I was met with a pat on the head. 'Good idea, but let's talk another time,'" Hamilton says. "I thought, 'Cool. We'll talk when I'm writing a check across the table from you.'" Building brick by brick Hamilton didn't need their support. She had Kimberlin. "I got to the point where I understood what a difference it would make, what kind of possibilities it would unlock for somebody to write her that first check and let her form the fund," Kimberlin says. "It was an opportunity for me to put my money where my mouth was." Hamilton won't disclose the size of that check--but it nonetheless came just in time. "I could only go so far on my own steam," Hamilton says. "There was a breaking point where I would not be able to go any further without any capital." With the check in hand, Hamilton began calling entrepreneurs she'd met months before and finally made the investments she'd been waiting to make. She invested in entrepreneurs like Sarah Heering, co-founder of NailSnaps, which lets people print nail art designs as stickers--an idea that several male VCs failed to understand. "You as a man don't get it; you don't walk into a salon and have to sit there for an hour smelling those chemicals," Heering says. "Having females on our investor sheet is important because it helps us solve the problem." NailSnaps co-founders Angel Anderson, left, and Sarah Heering are among nine sets of founders who have received investments from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital But one limited partner does not a venture fund make, and while Hamilton's Medium post spread her name, she still needed endorsements. That's when Stewart Butterfield came in. Butterfield, the co-founder and CEO of Slack--Inc.'s Company of the Year in 2015--is uniquely positioned to affect diversity in tech. While Slack's work force--around 600 employees--is tiny next to the likes of Google and Facebook, the company is growing so rapidly that its hiring over the next year or two could make it one of the first major tech companies to reach, or approach, gender and ethnic parity. Butterfield has hired multiple leaders in the tech diversity movement, including Erica Baker, an engineer who left Google after she was reprimanded for raising awareness over salary inequality, and Leslie Miley, a former engineering manager at Twitter who left the company over its lack of diversity. Butterfield is among the few elite CEOs who has spoken about the topic at length, and he has given the limelight to his underrepresented employees during key moments, like the night Slack won the Crunchies award for Fastest Rising Startup. When Butterfield caught wind of Backstage Capital, he followed Hamilton on Twitter and sent her a direct message. He wanted to invest. "Stewart Butterfield changed things," Hamilton says. "It added more legitimacy to what I was doing." With Butterfield's support, Hamilton's momentum picked up. "Each time we got a Stewart, each time we got a Marc Andreessen, it was one more step in us knowing we were on the right track," she says. "Every time we could tell our LPs that someone else had joined, it was a celebration." She was still building the fund brick by brick--but now, when she had conversations with prospective investors, she could point to Kimberlin's and Butterfield's names on her list of limited partners. "She's hustling," says Slack's Miley, who also decided to invest in Hamilton. "Whether it's chasing down billionaire investors or showing up at fundraising events, you know she put the work in to get where she is." Many of Backstage Capital's LPs are venture capitalists themselves, but Hamilton supplied an opportunity to discover entrepreneurs they might have otherwise missed. "She gets access to entrepreneurs that your typical Valley investor might not," says Lars Rasmussen, an angel investor and veteran of Google and Facebook. "It's almost like using an unfair advantage by knowing Arlan and using her connections into an area that is overlooked, and wrongly overlooked." Others who have invested in Hamilton see it as doing their part to add diversity to the industry they love. "Part of our reason for backing Arlan is acknowledging and understanding that everyone in tech has these blind spots," says Zachary Bogue, co-managing partner of the firm Data Collective. Box CEO Aaron Levie speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2015 in New York City. Levie is one of several tech leaders who have invested in Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Getty Images Creating the next generation Now that her fund's up and running, Hamilton has the tough task of proving her thesis. Despite all her big-name investors, the fund is small, and, she says, must be run lean. Her investments are typically seed-round bets that range from $25,000 to $100,000. "The next stage will be going out and finding truly world-class companies that can be game-changing in their respective markets. That's the hard part for any investor: still being incredibly selective on where you're going to put the capital to work," says Aaron Levie of Box. Levie joined Backstage Capital as an LP this spring. "It'll be exciting to see how the portfolio evolves over time." For Backstage Capital, it's not enough to spot promising entrepreneurs. Hamilton and her staff--she now has a full team that includes Kimberlin as a venture partner--don't expect to see any returns on their investments within the next five years, so in the meantime, it's important that they, like many other top VC firms, help these founders get to the next stage. "We try to punch higher than our weight, so if we're putting $50,000 in, we try to do enough work so it feels like we gave you half a million dollars," Hamilton says. The Backstage Capital business model is to connect founders with bigger investors--like those she's brought into her fund. Because, she says, "our $50,000 check means nothing if that company can't raise again." There's also this, Hamilton says: If Backstage's founders succeed, they'll become the next generation of role models and angel investors themselves. Published on: Aug 12, 2016 Advertisement

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Finance  ⋮  Hardware Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) Reports A Strong Second Quarter for FY17 – Beats Analysts’ Expectation by 16 Cents with EPS of $0.53 and $1.43 Billion in Record Revenue By Usman Pirzada Posted Aug 11, 2016 65Shares Share Tweet Submit Stock image of Nvidia's GTX 1060 Graphics Card which will compete with AMD's RX 480. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) has reported a non-GAAP EPS of 53 cents, easily beating out analysts’ expectation of 37 cents per share. With a beat of 16 cents, the chip manufacturer has reported an impressive quarter and is continuing its streak. Analysts expected Nvidia to report revenues of 1.35 Billion, which the company was able to beat by a handy $80 Million for a total reported second quarter revenue of $1.428 Billion. During the first half of fiscal 2017, Nvidia spent $509 million in share repurchases and $124 million in cash dividends. Nvidia will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.115 per share on September 16, 2016, to all shareholders of record on August 25, 2016. In the wake of such a strong quarter and the fact that Nvidia holds 81% of the GPU market share (according to Jon Peddie research) the company’s share price rose to a record high of $62 and is currently trading After-hours (at the time of writing) at around $61.7. Keep in mind however, that the past few months have shown an incredible period of growth in Nvidia’s stock and a correction to support levels could potentially see the price dropping due to herding behavior. Things to remember about Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) current quarter This quarter marks a new era for the chip manufacturers AMD and Nvidia – where the transition from the 28nm node to a sub-20nm node is made (which in the case of Nvidia is 16nm FinFET+). The company has recently introduced the first generation of FinFET GPUs with GeForce branding. This is an upgrade a long time in the making since we have been stuck on 28nm for quite a few years (since 2012). The performance of these GPUs exceeded expectations and have been met with unprecedented demand in the high end segment. However: The company has yet to match competition below the $250 price point. It has been trying to make headway into the autonomous vehicle industry which is currently dominated by Mobileye. This is something that stands to change following the recent divorce of Tesla and Mobileye. While the company’s iron grip on the mainstream GPU industry is impressive, it needs to maintain its bullish momentum in other sectors to ensure proper diversification of risk. Deep Learning is something Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) GPUs are being widely implemented in and this lead is being maintained thanks to introduction of Pascal architecture with CuDNN 5 The downside risk of this company is limited in nature, however, it is still vulnerable to disruptions that originate from TSMC (including but not limited to Apple being given priority for orders on the 16nm node or bad yields both of which are likely). Specifically regarding the sub-$250 price point, the question was put to CEO Jen-Hsun Huang on the investors conference call asking whether, given his earlier statement that all Pascal chips had taped out and ramped, was Nvidia ceding the sub-$250 market to competition. The answer to that was that although all Pascal chips had taped out and ramped, they had not yet all been introduced. This of course is something readers of our site will already likely be familiar with in our previous reporting on a potential cut down 1060 3GB (which may also be introduced as the 1050). Pre-Earnings Analysis: Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia Corporation Nvidia is major supplier of chips to car manufacturers, but the vast majority of these go into the infotainment systems. The self-driving sector is something that Nvidia has not yet been very successful in breaking into. To properly diversify away from the risk of a  possibly shrinking PC market (as alleged by Intel), Nvidia is attempting to establish itself as a provider of autonomous driving technology – where it is currently trying to dislodge the well established Mobileye. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)’s GPGPU implementation is much more flexbile than Mobileye and their GPUs have a much higher MAC/s rate (the relevant metric for self driving chips) however, due to the lack of an established ecosystem, they have not been particularly successful thus far. Keep in mind however that the B2B market for production runs of things like cars are likely multi-year negotiating efforts with huge terms on both sides to be agreed before deals of this nature get signed and announced. Advertisement Deep Learning and AI is something the world has just started to foray into, and one of Nvidia’s biggest intrinsic strengths is that its GPUs are the go-to standard for deep learning clusters. Of course, how much of their revenue comes from these clusters and after taking into account upgrade cycles the impact of this particular upside diminishes somewhat. GPU Business revenue was $1.20 billion, up 25 percent from a year earlier and up 11 percent sequentially, reflecting strength in datacenter and GeForce® gaming GPU revenue. Tegra Processor Business revenue of $166 million was up 30 percent year on year and up 4 percent sequentially, reflecting growth in Tegra automotive. Gaming platform revenue was $781 million, up 18 percent from a year ago, driven by Pascal™ gaming GPU sales across  all regions. “Strong demand for our new Pascal-generation GPUs and surging interest in deep learning drove record results,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer, Nvidia. “Our strategy to focus on creating the future where graphics, computer vision and artificial intelligence converge is fueling growth across our specialized platforms — Gaming, Pro Visualization, Datacenter and Automotive….We are more excited than ever about the impact of deep learning and AI, which will touch every industry and market. We have made significant investments over the past five years to evolve our entire GPU computing stack for deep learning. Now, we are well positioned to partner with researchers and developers all over the world to democratize this powerful technology and invent its future,” During the earnings call, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang fielded a question about the penetration of Pascal thus far into the gaming segment. In answering the question, he stated that of the ~80 million GeForce cards currently in use, only about a third of those had even upgraded to Maxwell and as such Nvidia sees a huge upgrade potential still in the market to Pascal given that initial penetration is extremely small into their overall footprint, the implication of course being that just under two thirds of users are still on Kepler or older cards. Professional visualization revenue from Quadro® was a record $214 million, up 22 percent year over year and up 13 percent sequentially. Datacenter revenue, including Tesla® and Nvidia GRID™, was a record $151 million, up 110 percent from a year earlier and up 6 percent sequentially, amid strong demand for GPU acceleration related to deep learning. Automotive revenue from infotainment modules and product development contracts was a record $119 million, up 68 percent from a year earlier and up 5 percent sequentially.

This Is Not Normal » Why We Shouldn’t Want Manufacturing Jobs Back August 12, 2016 by Adam Lee Leave a Comment The words “Rust Belt” evoke a vanished age of American greatness. Cities like Pittsburgh and Detroit, once mighty economic powerhouses, now have a reputation for dwindling and decline. Their factories have closed; their populations are aged and shrunken; their civic architecture has fallen into desolation and decay, spawning the genre of “ruin porn”. And the resentment and despair of rootless former blue-collar workers is a central issue in the presidential race. This story resonates because it’s easy for most people to imagine what’s been lost. Everyone can imagine a bustling assembly line, or a foundry where molten metal is poured in torrents of flame. Fictional characters like Atlas Shrugged‘s Hank Rearden, creating factories from scratch with his bare hands, feed the popular narrative of the heroic industrialist. The conventional wisdom is that American manufacturing and industry, which offered secure jobs and a ticket into the middle class, was laid low by offshoring and free trade. There’s just one problem with this picture, and that’s that the numbers don’t bear it out: In the last 20 years, which include enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, real, inflation-adjusted U.S. manufacturing output has increased by almost 40%. Annual value added by U.S. factories has reached a record $2.4 trillion. The American manufacturing industry hasn’t disappeared – far from it. In fact, we make more stuff now than we ever did, even in the supposed golden age of industry: So in dollar terms, output is at record levels — worth more than $2 trillion. Back in 1964, remembered as a glorious time in our industrial history, factories generated only about $1.3 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars. (source) If it’s hard to find a “Made in the USA” tag on shelves, that’s because we mostly don’t make consumer goods like clothes or shoes anymore. But we do make plenty of high-tech products: pharmaceuticals, electronics, medical devices, advanced machinery, aircraft and aerospace. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, or Intel’s ultra-advanced D1D fab in Oregon, or the 3D-printing New Lab at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, are all examples of the kind of advanced manufacturing that’s going on today. In terms of value added to the economy, U.S. manufacturing output is at an all-time high. What’s at a low – and here’s where the popular story comes closest to truth – is manufacturing employment. Part of this, it’s true, is that low-skill industries have migrated to other countries. But an equally large part is that improvements in technology allow one employee to do work that once took many. It’s not the free trade, it’s the robots. (China’s manufacturing output is only slightly larger than ours, and they employ ten times as many people to do it.) Manufacturing is following the same downward trend as agriculture, where an industry that once required huge numbers of laborers is becoming more efficient and mechanized. It used to be 38% of all jobs, and is now just 8%, even as overall productivity has risen. And more innovations are coming. Engineers are using computer vision to solve a problem that’s long stymied them, namely sewing clothes. A robot can cut and weld steel plates, but fabric that can bend, stretch and wrinkle has been beyond their capability – until now. This is exactly what we should want. We shouldn’t want make-work jobs, paying people to do by hand what could be done faster and more efficiently by machines. Most old-school manufacturing jobs were dirty, arduous, dangerous, low-paid, and often all four. Lest we be tempted to romanticize them, Jacob Riis describes the sweatshops of old New York – little different from the conditions that people still labor under today – in his muckraking classic How the Other Half Lives: You are made fully aware of it before you have travelled the length of a single block in any of these East Side streets, by the whir of a thousand sewing-machines, worked at high pressure from earliest dawn till mind and muscle give out together. Every member of the family, from the youngest to the oldest, bears a hand, shut in the qualmy rooms, where meals are cooked and clothing washed and dried besides, the livelong day. It is not unusual to find a dozen persons – men, women, and children – at work in a single small room. These kinds of jobs aren’t coming back, and we should be glad for that. More and better robots will free humanity from this drudgery, and we can use the liberated brainpower to come up with more new ways to improve our lives and take us ever closer to a post-scarcity society. Of course, the real reason people are nostalgic for these jobs is that they didn’t take an advanced education. It does raise the question of what the new ladder out of poverty will be, if factory workers and garment workers are displaced by machines. I admit I don’t have a good answer for that. But whatever the solution may be, I’m certain that trying to rewind the clock and reverse the trend of human progress isn’t it.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Microsoft extends Windows 7, 8.1 Skylake lifespan Published on 12th August 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 1 Comment News Microsoft has officially extended support for Intel's Skylake chips in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through to their respective EOL dates, from a planned 2018 cessation. Microsoft has officially extended the support lifespan for its users with Skylake hardware and its previous-generation Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems. While Microsoft had originally set a deadline of July 17, 2017 for support of Skylake chips in its last-generation operating systems, as part of its not-so-gentle campaign to upgrade as many users as possible to Windows 10, it has been having second and third thoughts regarding its decision. Earlier this year Microsoft extended the deadline for cessation of support by a further year to July 2018, and now the company has announced that it's adding another three and six years to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 respectively. 'Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows, claimed Microsoft's Shad Larsen, director of Windows business planning, in the announcement as an apparent attempt to head off any suggestion that Windows 10 is proving unpopular with business users. 'At the same time, we recognise that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy. We have extended the support period from July 17, 2018 to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1; and we will provide all applicable security updates.' The new deadlines, which promise security updates for Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processors, see Windows 7 supported through to the January 14, 2020 and Windows 8.1 to the January 10, 2023. 'This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel,' claimed Larsen, 'who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates.' The company has reaffirmed, however, that seventh-generation chips from both Intel and AMD - Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge respectively - will not be officially supported under Windows releases prior to Windows 10, and that 'all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.'

Samsung claims that this new specialized version of NAND provides a radical performance increase compared to existing NAND-based SSDs. Samsung Attacks 3D XPoint Storage Applications Samsung presented slides that listed the Z-SSD's performance specifications, but a note in the bottom right-hand corner of the slides indicates that it derived the benchmarks from an emulator. This may indicate that the company doesn't actually have physical products yet and is relying on simulations to derive performance specifications. The company compared the SSD to both NAND-based and PRAM-based SSDs. Phase-Change RAM (PRAM) is a glass-type of non-volatile chalcogenide memory that many speculate Intel/Micron uses with 3D XPoint. It appears that Samsung is implying that it can offer similar performance and latency to 3D XPoint. In either case, the slides indicate much higher throughput than a normal SSD (1.6x better than a Samsung PM963 NVMe SSD) and radically reduced latency that is on par with the PRAM-based SSD. The fact that Samsung has a PRAM-based SSD for comparison, however, is telling. The company, like many other fabs, constantly has new technologies under development, and it's possible that we may see a PRAM-based SSD in the future. Samsung representatives informed us that the new NAND would have SLC-like endurance specifications, which implies that the new Z-NAND is simply using the entire capacity of an MLC NAND product programmed as SLC. The company also notified us that it based the new technology upon its existing 3D NAND technology, so it is likely using a 64-layer architecture. One of the key differentiators, beyond performance, is that the Z-SSD promises incredible scaling and maximum IOPS under low QD workloads. This is similar to the 3D XPoint performance profile, and like its competitor, this is likely due to an increased number of planes. Normal NAND-based SSDs require an excessively heavy workload--rare in normal use--to extract the maximum performance. This is because the NAND die need to respond en masse to incoming requests. NAND vendors boost the performance of individual die by splitting the die into separate regions that can respond to commands separately (increase parallelism). The majority of current generation NAND are dual-plane designs, but Micron 3D NAND employs a quad-plane design to increase performance. 3D XPoint doesn't have the traditional plane architecture, but the company disclosed that there are 64 regions that can respond independently, which is similar to a 64-plane architecture. Samsung may have boosted the number of planes per Z-NAND die to achieve a similar level of performance and parallelism. Coupling the extra die with SLC, which is much faster and endurant than MLC and TLC NAND, would provide tremendous performance benefits. Samsung provided results, again generated with an emulator, that show higher performance (up to 1.2X in a big data analytics workload) and much lower power consumption than the PRAM-based SSD. The NAND-based SSD trails far behind the PRAM and Z-NAND solutions, but Samsung did not provide a direct power comparison between NAND and Z-NAND. The company also did not provide any random performance specifications during the announcement, but did note that the new SSD will use the NVMe protocol and will be faster than existing NVMe SSDs. Most NVMe SSDs top out in the range of 750,000 IOPS with a x4 connection and 1 million IOPS with a x8 connection. Samsung also divulged to us that the Z-SSD would offer up to a 7x improvement in 99.99th percentile latency (worst-case) over existing NAND-based SSDs. Samsung representatives noted that because it based Z-NAND on existing NAND technology it will be much cheaper to produce, while its 3D XPoint competitors are investing billions in new fabs and tooling. The impact of the increased investments have already shown up in Intel's financial reports, and the extra cost will push the price of 3D XPoint up beyond NAND-based SSDs. Samsung Attacks 3D XPoint as Memory Samsung is also squeezing 3D XPoint, which can be used as either storage or memory, on the RAM axis. Samsung's partner Netlist also announced its new HybriDIMM products, which use HyperVault technology. Samsung invested a total of $23 million in Netlist last year to develop the HyperVault technology. The result of the investment is the new HybriDIMM products, which connect into a DDR4 LRDIMM slot and allow the system to address large repositories of NAND (up to 512 GB with the first-gen product and 1 TB with the second-gen product) as either storage or memory. The DIMMs work without a BIOS change, which will be unlikely with 3D XPoint DIMMs, and use PreSight predictive algorithms to pre-fetch and stage data from NAND into a small amount of DRAM (8-16 GB) on board the DIMM, thus alleviating performance limitations. These new DIMMs will allow users to place terabytes of RAM into a single server in a much more cost-effective manner than current DRAM and 3D XPoint. We have deeper coverage of the technology here. HybriDIMMs use Samsung NAND, but it would be logical to assume that we might also see Z-NAND on them in the future. Shots Fired Samsung's line of attack with the Z-SSD might help price 3D XPoint out of the market for storage applications. Combining the storage assault with lower-cost HybriDIMM memory alternatives will also provide additional pressure. The kicker is that Samsung based all of the new products on proven and mature technologies, which is important for the lucrative data center market that Intel and Micron are chasing.  Samsung's strategy capitalizes on the simple fact that in most cases good-enough and cheap will win, but we will have to wait until products hit the market to see if it pans out.

Well then you have to run this microsoft operating system"... Get it? And you guys that are cheerleading microsoft and winblows 10 are might as well be the sheep in that corral... -4 hannibal Aug 12, 2016, 3:05 AM The support for X-point will arrive to Linux and iOS platforms too, so no worry in there. But hybriDimm works now, so it has merits on its own. 2 epobirs Aug 12, 2016, 3:46 AM Considering who the biggest customers for 3D Xpoint as memory are likely to be and that those same customer aren't likely to be building their systems for Windows Server, I very much doubt this is going to be locked into Wintel offerings. The use case for really big enterprise systems is far easier to find than that for a desktop PC. I would expect a lot of work remains to be done before a desktop OS really knows how to much real use of this. It can be treated as a traditional RAM disk but that is just scratching the surface of the potential. 2 costeakai Aug 12, 2016, 5:46 AM nice dog fight 0 jasonf2 Aug 12, 2016, 8:11 AM In the immediate term Hybridimm will only have server applications. Most (if not all) consumer motherboards and chipsets will top out on addressable memory long before 256 gb. Intels magic here will be that the 200 series chipset coming with kabilake will support xpoint and handle the increased headroom necessary to put nonvoltile on the memory bus. Samsung's move here could lead to some workstation class boards becoming popular in the high end consumer class depending on how expensive xpoint really is (in the short term). At the very least we should see some competition here starting the race to the bottom on the emerging techs. I hope AMD and Zens chip set are taking all of this into account and at least getting ready for the need for a terabyte+ of memory on the Ram bus. 1 serendipiti Aug 12, 2016, 10:58 AM I don't agree the assumption of endurance coming from using TLC NAND as SLC. I suppose the difference between 3D NAND and Z-NAND is that 3D NAND is stacking 2D NAND in multiple layers, while Z NAND takes the 3D concept to the cell itself by changing the doping areas and materials. This way the cell may have less leaks, resulting in a higher endurance, etc... 1 josejones Aug 12, 2016, 2:34 PM So, when will these new Samsung Z-SSD's come available and for which chipset? The Z-270 or the Z-370 motherboards? Kaby Lake or Cannon Lake? 2017 or 2018? 1 hannibal Aug 12, 2016, 3:17 PM Well, the point of hybriDimm is that it use old production techniques, so it can be produced with old factories. That seems to prove the point that this is indeed MLC acting in SLC mode. That makes it relatively cheap to produce them, compared X-point that requires own production capasity and technic. 0 Tykkopoles Aug 12, 2016, 3:21 PM Anonymous said: I like samsungs' approach with the HybriDIMM alot better than intel's, because intel is in cahoots with microsoft to lock down the system via tech corralling... So you approve a technology of one company not because the technology has any merit, but simply because you are throwing a temper-tantrum about that company's competitor. GGWP, mate. In adult news, Z-NAND and HybriDIMM are both very cost-effective approach for enterprises to massively overhaul storage and memory solutions. I'm definitely interested to see some non-emulated tests on performance under heavy server workloads. I, for one, am happy that there are multiple companies innovating on volatile and non-volatile options. 1 computerguy72 Aug 12, 2016, 11:18 PM Funny how Samsung had to 'massage' the numbers using the xpoint results adapted to a pcie x4 with standard drivers and then using a emulated 'simulation' to get their own numbers in there. Intel/Micron seem to have a solution that can dramatically outperform anything else. Samsung no doubt hopes to dull the enthusiasm but they will need to do better than this that's for sure. 1 MRFS Aug 13, 2016, 2:52 PM Anonymous said: The use case for really big enterprise systems is far easier to find than that for a desktop PC. I would expect a lot of work remains to be done before a desktop OS really knows how to much real use of this. It can be treated as a traditional RAM disk but that is just scratching the surface of the potential. Several years ago, we filed a Provisional Patent Application for adding a "Format RAM" feature to BIOS subsystems, easily adapted to UEFI subsystems: http://supremelaw.org/patents/bios.enhancements/provisional.application.1.htm http://supremelaw.org/patents/bios.enhancements/provisional.application.2.htm Installing an OS into a non-volatile ramdisk seems like a natural extension of Optane's capabilities. A more ambitious approach would dedicate one-third of a triple-channel memory subsystem to Optane, and adding the logic required to BOOT from that subsystem, either during COLD starts or during WARM starts: 4 x DIMM slots w/ DDR4 operating in quad-channel mode 2 x DIMM slots w/ Optane operating in dual-channel mode, hosting NV-OS Compare what we are doing right now with our workstations: (a) first, we "Migrate OS" to a fast RAID-0, and maintain the source OS as a backup, in case we need to boot from that original partition; cf. PartitionWizard freeware's "Migrate OS" feature; (b) if/when we need to restore a drive image to the fast RAID-0, we boot from the original partition, and then run GHOST restore (this works much faster than running GHOST from a CD-ROM). Because the logic required to create and maintain a transparent NTFS ramdisk has already been developed e.g. see RamDisk Plus from www.superspeed.com it doesn't seem to me like a LOT of new R&D would be required to format a ramdisk as part of a fresh OS install. See our Provisional Patent Applications above, for one straightforward approach. (I'm open to hearing why the latter statement is NOT entirely correct.) Hosting an OS like Windows in a non-volatile ramdisk is something that prosumers would enjoy using on their primary workstation. With that capability working and perfected, such a workstation cannot be too far from an "INSTANT ON" ability too. And, we already host all of our Internet browser caches in a 13GB ramdisk, and the performance of Firefox is noticeably accelerated by this one change. ... just thinking out loud here, OK? MRFS 0 MRFS Aug 13, 2016, 3:22 PM p.s. Some of the features which I just described above can also be approximated / demonstrated with a modern workstation that is powered by a reliable UPS / battery backup: (a) assume that it runs 24/7 and only powers OFF for periodic maintenance: this renders conventional DDR4 effectively "non-volatile" (because the power stays ON without any interruptions between scheduled maintenance events); (b) enhance the BIOS/UEFI subsystem to "Format RAM" and host an OS in a ramdisk formatted using the uppermost 50GB of DDR4; (c) with a Windows OS, that uppermost 50GB is recognized as the C: system partition and operates exactly the same as C: on any other modern storage subsystem; (d) the remaining DDR4, ending at one byte address less that the starting byte address of C:, operates just like the DRAM remaining after configuring a ramdisk with RamDisk Plus. All of the above can be done withOUT needing Optane necessarily; and, all of the above can be done WITH Optane too. Thus, the question for today is this: what does Optane bring to a workstation which a workstation cannot already do withOUT Optane? One answer: it eliminates the time-consuming SAVE and RESTORE steps which are required at SHUTDOWN and STARTUP of systems using a utility like RamDisk Plus. That, in turn, means that browser caches remain intact even after power is switched OFF. As correctly observed above, YES, this is "only scratching the surface" of what Optane brings to the table. 0 xyriin Aug 15, 2016, 7:21 AM The important take out of all this is that Samsung has a solution that looks like it could very well hit the market before XPoint and that's really the point right? (no pun intended) Intel and Micron have been teasing XPoint for over a year now with no product to market. Furthermore, each new data point that comes along makes it a little less shiny on the performance and cost side. Seeing as Samsung wouldn't need an infrastructure change or build out to release Z-SSD it seems like XPoint may end up going nowhere. 0 MRFS Aug 15, 2016, 10:41 AM Anonymous said: Seeing as Samsung wouldn't need an infrastructure change or build out to release Z-SSD it seems like XPoint may end up going nowhere. i had a good chuckle over the weekend, when I began assembling an NVMe workstation in my mind. I went to Newegg and looked for "U.2 cables", and then just poked around to see what else came up e.g.: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817801139&Tpk=N82E16817801139 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAA6W3YY8665&Tpk=9SIAA6W3YY8665 So, with a Highpoint 3840A, I can assemble a RAID-0 with 4 x Samsung M.2 NVMe SSDs, and I won't even need a backplane: the latter U.2 cable plugs right into that Syba M.2 enclosure: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147466&Tpk=N82E16820147466 The 2.5" form factor has become rather universal, and a modern chassis should already come with proper cooling for 3.5" drive bays. The wiring topology is almost identical to standard 2.5" SSDs. With a tower chassis that has 2 empty 5.25" bays, this next enclosure should cool 4 x 2.5" SSDs nicely, and it's not too expensive either: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA9PV4374597&Tpk=9SIA9PV4374597 0 Display All 14 comments Most Popular Samsung Reveals 'World's Largest SSD,' Seagate And Huawei Beg To Differ 3D XPoint SSD Pictured, Performance And Endurance Revealed At FMS Seagate Displays 60 TB SSD At Flash Memory Summit Tom's Hardware Around the World Tom's Hardware Around the World Russia France Germany UK Italy USA Subscribe to Tom's Hardware Search the site Ok About Tom's Hardware Advertising About us Contact Purch Privacy Policy Terms Of Use and Sale Copyright Policy Copyright © 2016 Purch Group, Inc.

VENTURE CAPITAL How This Woman Went From Homelessness to Running a Multimillion-Dollar Venture Fund A year ago, Arlan Hamilton was bouncing from couch to couch chasing a dream. Now, she's leading a $5 million venture fund focused on finding the most promising female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs.

Arlan Hamilton chased her dream of starting a venture fund to support female, minority and LGBT entrepreneurs. She landed investments from top names in tech, including Marc Andreessen and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. CREDIT: Backstage Capital Advertisement After another long day of chasing down potential investors, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton was ready for bed. The only problem was, she had no idea where she would sleep. As day turned to night, Hamilton sat at a table outside of a grocery store in Palo Alto, California, with a backpack, her suitcase, and nowhere to go on this Sunday in September 2015. For more than a year, she had been pursuing her dream of starting a venture capital fund focused on female, minority, and LGBT entrepreneurs. But it's tough to get a fund going when you don't have any money to invest. Hamilton had met with every investor she could track down and cold-called everyone in tech she could think of. No one had written her a check. Why would they? Hamilton, an African American lesbian, was a Silicon Valley outsider. She had no track record as a venture capitalist. And she wanted to invest in a segment of founders with little proven success. She'd spent everything to bootstrap her mission. For months, she'd been homeless, sleeping on couches, in motels, out of cars, at airports. As a weary Hamilton sat, contemplating her next move, her phone buzzed. "I'm in," read the text from Susan Kimberlin, a tech veteran who made a name for herself at Salesforce and PayPal. Kimberlin was ready to bet on Hamilton to bring more diversity to tech--and her check was the lifeline Hamilton needed to get Backstage Capital up and running. Hamilton sat there in silence, lost in thought, letting the moment sink in. "I made it," she thought to herself before standing up to do a moonwalk and a little twirl. Then immediately, she went back to work, calling the startups she'd been wanting to invest in for months. She picked up her bags and started walking. "I never had to be homeless again after that," she says. Not a charity There is a wave of new venture funds focused on bringing more diversity to Silicon Valley, by investing in women, people of color, or those of the LGBT community. Backstage Capital, along with Kapor Capital and Intel Capital's diversity fund, is an exemplar of such firms. Since Kimberlin's first check, Backstage Capital has collected investments from a who's who of tech investors and executives, including Marc Andreessen, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca and his wife, Crystal English, Rose Tech Ventures managing partner David Rose, Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie, and Swati Mylavarapu of Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. To date, Hamilton, 35, has invested in nine sets of founders whose companies tap into ideas and markets that have been largely ignored by the predominantly white, Asian, and male Silicon Valley. With her $5 million fund, Hamilton looks to capture 1 percent ownership in early-stage companies that are seeking their first round of funding. "Arlan's focus on diversity will unlock access to valuable talent and huge markets that haven't been on the radar of traditional investors," Sacca says. "She's out there finding companies that I would never ever have seen," marvels Rose. Hamilton's portfolio includes Text Engine, a startup that allows users with "dumb phones" to pull information from the internet; Radial, a music-streaming app focused on the soca, a Caribbean-based drum-heavy dance offshoot of calypso; and Tinsel, a hardware company that makes fashionable necklaces that double as headphones. "Last year when I was raising money, being black, being a woman, being pregnant--it was just strike after strike of what investors are not interested in," says Aniyia Williams, Tinsel's CEO. "But when I talked to Arlan, she got it right away." Lowercase Capital chairman Chris Sacca. Sacca is among the numerous big-name investors to join Backstage Capital as a limited partner. CREDIT: Getty Images Like many of her tech idols, Hamilton wears the same uniform every day: a black shirt or black hoodie that proudly sports the name "Backstage Capital" in bold purple letters. Tall, African American, and female, wearing her hair in a short black bob, Hamilton looks nothing like the majority of venture capitalists in the Bay Area--but nonetheless has the goals of any investor. "This is not a nonprofit or a charity. I want killer companies that are making money and will make money," says Hamilton, who rarely raises her calm and confident voice. "My job is to make money for my investors, and I can't do that with companies based on my heart. It has to be based on companies that are badass." As with the rest of the tech industry, diversity among venture capitalists is scarce. Among 71 of the top venture capital firms, women represent only 8 percent of senior investment teams, according to data compiled in 2015 by Social Capital and The Information. Hispanics and African Americans make up just 2 percent of those ranks. All this trickles down to startups. Only 2.7 percent of venture-funded companies are led by women, according to a 2014 report by Babson College. Just 1 percent of founders among venture-backed startups are black, according to 2010 data from CB Insights. More specifically, a mere 24 black women received any venture funding from 2012 to 2014, according to the #ProjectDiane report released in February. Hamilton, obviously, understands that some of her founders will fail, but she believes they deserve to be given the same opportunities that are often plentiful for white, Asian, and male entrepreneurs. "For all of the Mark Zuckerbergs or the successful companies that we see that are founded by white men, how many have failed?" says Alicia Thomas, CEO of Dibs, a Backstage Capital-backed startup whose technology lets gyms charge dynamic--or surge--pricing for their classes. "Women and people of color aren't given the chance to fail because it's like, 'Oh, see, that's what happened.'" Chasing billion-dollar ideas Hamilton first started studying tech in 2012. At the time, she was working in the music industry as a production coordinator, helping orchestrate shows for acts like CeeLo Green, Kirk Franklin, and Amanda Palmer. This was Hamilton's dream job, but she noticed that many of the artists and music executives she admired were investing their music money in tech. That piqued her interest. Hamilton began reading and watching anything she could get ahold of to teach her about the world of tech and venture capital. She'd watch keynote speeches on YouTube and read blog posts and books by investors, "even though I didn't understand most of it," Hamilton says with a chuckle. But she'd grown up knocking on strangers' doors as a Jehovah's Witness (she no longer practices), and had no qualms about randomly reaching out to founders and investors and offering to help in any way she could. Making connections and helping young companies land investments gave her a high. It became a hobby, something she did at home in Houston in between her artists' tours. And all her life, Hamilton had been insatiably curious. In elementary school, Hamilton would ask countless questions, often to the annoyance of her teachers. This landed her on both the honor roll and in the principal's office--for being disruptive. Hamilton, who'd grown up without much money, was often one of few black kids in her honors classes. In them, she would make a point and see it receive little attention--but then, a white boy would be praised for saying something similar. "I grew up very quickly understanding that I was going to have to do more if I wanted to be seen as equal," she says. "I was going to have to work at least twice as hard if I was even going to be given a chance or taken seriously." And, as she connected founders and investors, she saw that more often than not, it was the white male founders she helped that received the most opportunities: "It became clear really fast that there were certain people who were not getting meetings, even if they had a really great company." To the queer black woman within her, this was wrong. To the hustler within her, it was a huge opportunity. While others saw markets like virtual reality and artificial intelligence as the next jackpot technologies, Hamilton saw the next billion-dollar ideas in that pool of untapped, underrepresented entrepreneurs. As a side project to her music gigs, Hamilton chased the idea of a fund focused on LGBT entrepreneurs, for about six months in 2013. "I went hard on that, but it just didn't take off at all," she says. Hamilton had no credibility in the tech industry: "There was a lot of stuff I had to prove." Her music career was on an upswing, but as months passed, Hamilton became obsessed with her idea. She decided she was going to give it another try. In August 2014, Hamilton wrote an email to all her music colleagues and told them she was putting her career on pause. "Anyone who works in music will tell you that it's hard to get a gig, and to turn down gigs is silly," says Hamilton, who was then ready to fully focus on her fund. "To turn down the only money that was coming in ... yeah, it was crazy." Aniyia Williams, CEO of Tinsel, is one of the several founders who have received funding from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital She began living off her savings while lining up entrepreneurs she hoped to invest in and scrambling to meet more investors. She just needed to find one person who believed in her. That proved tougher than she had imagined. As months went by, Hamilton was forced to leave her apartment and bounce around from one friend's couch to another. By the end of 2014, she had yet to collect a single investment check, but she had begun building her profile with powerful Silicon Valley allies, including Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the top startup accelerator. Altman couldn't invest in Backstage Capital, given his commitments to Y Combinator, but one night as Hamilton sat in a motel room in Houston, unsure when her next meal would come, Altman sent her an email. "The world needs what you're doing, and I want to help you," he said. "I just remember thinking, 'Wow. If he's saying that, that means this could be bigger than I thought,'" Hamilton says. Dear White Venture Capitalists On January 1, 2015, Hamilton relocated to Austin. A month later, she flew to San Francisco for Y Combinator's Female Founders Conference. "It wasn't, 'Oh, my god, this is Disneyland.' It was like, 'This feels right. I feel confident here. I feel like I belong,'" Hamilton says. Later, when she got accepted for 500 Startups' two-week seminar for new investors in Palo Alto, Hamilton bought a one-way ticket. She got there in May and rubbed shoulders with dozens of other rookie investors. Many were already-wealthy industry veterans. One of them was Kimberlin. The two gravitated to each other thanks to their similar investment theses: They believed diversity was technology's next great opportunity. After working in tech for 18 years, Kimberlin knew firsthand how rarely women appear atop the corporate ladder. She wanted to change that through angel investing, and Hamilton intrigued her. As part of the seminar, the investors were encouraged to establish their brands by writing essays for Medium. Write about what you know, 500 Startups' Dave McClure said. Hamilton penned a piece titled "Dear White Venture Capitalists: If You're Reading This, It's (Almost!) Too Late." It went viral. "Your goal is to make money as a VC or accelerator who is investing other people's money because you have a fiduciary duty to do everything in your power to bring your LPs returns," Hamilton wrote in her Medium post. She implored investors to dedicate fractions of their funds to underrepresented entrepreneurs and offered to help. "Therefore, if you haven't hired a team of people who are of color, female, and/or LGBT to actively turn over every stone, to scope out every nook and cranny, to pop out of every bush, to find every qualified underrepresented founder in this country, you're going to miss out on a lot of money when the rest of the investment world gets it." Hamilton's inbox exploded with emails from founders and others in tech thanking her for the post. Many invited Hamilton for meetings. Some were enticed by her arguments but not quite ready to make the jump. Others offered to bring Hamilton in--but have her work in the background, without any ability to invest. "I pitched to well-known VCs, and I was met with a pat on the head. 'Good idea, but let's talk another time,'" Hamilton says. "I thought, 'Cool. We'll talk when I'm writing a check across the table from you.'" Building brick by brick Hamilton didn't need their support. She had Kimberlin. "I got to the point where I understood what a difference it would make, what kind of possibilities it would unlock for somebody to write her that first check and let her form the fund," Kimberlin says. "It was an opportunity for me to put my money where my mouth was." Hamilton won't disclose the size of that check--but it nonetheless came just in time. "I could only go so far on my own steam," Hamilton says. "There was a breaking point where I would not be able to go any further without any capital." With the check in hand, Hamilton began calling entrepreneurs she'd met months before and finally made the investments she'd been waiting to make. She invested in entrepreneurs like Sarah Heering, co-founder of NailSnaps, which lets people print nail art designs as stickers--an idea that several male VCs failed to understand. "You as a man don't get it; you don't walk into a salon and have to sit there for an hour smelling those chemicals," Heering says. "Having females on our investor sheet is important because it helps us solve the problem." NailSnaps co-founders Angel Anderson, left, and Sarah Heering are among nine sets of founders who have received investments from Arlan Hamilton and Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Backstage Capital But one limited partner does not a venture fund make, and while Hamilton's Medium post spread her name, she still needed endorsements. That's when Stewart Butterfield came in. Butterfield, the co-founder and CEO of Slack--Inc.'s Company of the Year in 2015--is uniquely positioned to affect diversity in tech. While Slack's work force--around 600 employees--is tiny next to the likes of Google and Facebook, the company is growing so rapidly that its hiring over the next year or two could make it one of the first major tech companies to reach, or approach, gender and ethnic parity. Butterfield has hired multiple leaders in the tech diversity movement, including Erica Baker, an engineer who left Google after she was reprimanded for raising awareness over salary inequality, and Leslie Miley, a former engineering manager at Twitter who left the company over its lack of diversity. Butterfield is among the few elite CEOs who has spoken about the topic at length, and he has given the limelight to his underrepresented employees during key moments, like the night Slack won the Crunchies award for Fastest Rising Startup. When Butterfield caught wind of Backstage Capital, he followed Hamilton on Twitter and sent her a direct message. He wanted to invest. "Stewart Butterfield changed things," Hamilton says. "It added more legitimacy to what I was doing." With Butterfield's support, Hamilton's momentum picked up. "Each time we got a Stewart, each time we got a Marc Andreessen, it was one more step in us knowing we were on the right track," she says. "Every time we could tell our LPs that someone else had joined, it was a celebration." She was still building the fund brick by brick--but now, when she had conversations with prospective investors, she could point to Kimberlin's and Butterfield's names on her list of limited partners. "She's hustling," says Slack's Miley, who also decided to invest in Hamilton. "Whether it's chasing down billionaire investors or showing up at fundraising events, you know she put the work in to get where she is." Many of Backstage Capital's LPs are venture capitalists themselves, but Hamilton supplied an opportunity to discover entrepreneurs they might have otherwise missed. "She gets access to entrepreneurs that your typical Valley investor might not," says Lars Rasmussen, an angel investor and veteran of Google and Facebook. "It's almost like using an unfair advantage by knowing Arlan and using her connections into an area that is overlooked, and wrongly overlooked." Others who have invested in Hamilton see it as doing their part to add diversity to the industry they love. "Part of our reason for backing Arlan is acknowledging and understanding that everyone in tech has these blind spots," says Zachary Bogue, co-managing partner of the firm Data Collective. Box CEO Aaron Levie speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt in May 2015 in New York City. Levie is one of several tech leaders who have invested in Backstage Capital. CREDIT: Getty Images Creating the next generation Now that her fund's up and running, Hamilton has the tough task of proving her thesis. Despite all her big-name investors, the fund is small, and, she says, must be run lean. Her investments are typically seed-round bets that range from $25,000 to $100,000. "The next stage will be going out and finding truly world-class companies that can be game-changing in their respective markets. That's the hard part for any investor: still being incredibly selective on where you're going to put the capital to work," says Aaron Levie of Box. Levie joined Backstage Capital as an LP this spring. "It'll be exciting to see how the portfolio evolves over time." For Backstage Capital, it's not enough to spot promising entrepreneurs. Hamilton and her staff--she now has a full team that includes Kimberlin as a venture partner--don't expect to see any returns on their investments within the next five years, so in the meantime, it's important that they, like many other top VC firms, help these founders get to the next stage. "We try to punch higher than our weight, so if we're putting $50,000 in, we try to do enough work so it feels like we gave you half a million dollars," Hamilton says. The Backstage Capital business model is to connect founders with bigger investors--like those she's brought into her fund. Because, she says, "our $50,000 check means nothing if that company can't raise again." There's also this, Hamilton says: If Backstage's founders succeed, they'll become the next generation of role models and angel investors themselves. Published on: Aug 12, 2016 Advertisement

Used with permission MediaTek has revealed an upcoming Helio X30 system-on-chip (SoC) that will likely be one of the first 10nm fabricated SoCs to arrive when it ships in mid-2017. The deca-core mobile SoC will also be one of the first to use ARM’s new Cortex-A73 successor to the Cortex-A72, according to PhoneRadar, which based its story in part on an EETimes China interview [translated] with MediaTek CTO Zhu Shangzu. Manufactured using TSMC’s 10nm FinFET process, the mobile-focused Helio X30 has a tri-cluster design with two 2.8GHz, Cortex-A73 based “Artemis” cores, as well as four 2.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores and four 2.0GHz Cortex-A35 cores. The X30 also sports the high-end, quad-core PowerVR 7XT GPU, which is capable of driving VR headsets, says PhoneRadar. The Helio X30 will support up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and is powerful enough to drive a 26-megapixel rear-facing camera, as well as a front-facing cam. The SoC is said to support UFS 2.1 storage, as well as a three carrier aggregation (3CA) modem that supports the speedy CAT 12 LTE standard. MediaTek’s latest SoC follows its similarly 10-core, but 20nm fabricated Helio X20 and X25. These SoCs debuted the tri-cluster concept, but use only two architectures as opposed to three with the X30. The X20 and X25 have two Cortex-A72 cores and two quad-core banks of Cortex-A53 cores with different clock rates. The Helio X25, which is exclusive to the Android-based Meizu Pro 6 smartphone, clocks the Cortex-A72 cores higher to 2.5GHz instead of 2.3GHz and has a faster 850MHz version of the Mali T880 MP4 GPU. Cortex-A73 cores should provide a 30 percent better sustained performance and efficiency than Cortex-A72, claims ARM, which is in the process of being acquired by SoftBank. The tiny, 0.65 x 0.65mm design, which has been licensed by HiSilicon and Marvell, in addition to MediaTek, features an Artemis microarchitecture borrowed from the rarely used Cortex-A17 chip. Artemis emphasizes “sustained performance,” which means that mobile devices can maintain peak performance for longer periods before being forced to throttle down due to heat buildup. The Helio X30 also features power-efficient Cortex-A35 cores for its low-end cluster. According to ARM, Cortex-A35 draws about 33 percent less power per core and occupies 25 percent less silicon area, compared to Cortex-A53. The -A35 is not as power efficient as the new, IoT-focused Cortex-A32, which is slower, but smaller and more efficient. Cortex-A32 is the first ARMv8 chip that works only in 32-bit mode. Coming Up: Apple A10 and Snapdragon 821 According to PhoneRadar, the Helio X30 won’t ship for another year, either at the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third. A lot can happen in that time, including the upcoming Apple A10 due in the iPhone 7, which is said to be fabricated at 10nm as well. The latest rumors has Apple sticking with two Cortex-A72 or -A73-like cores, following the minimalist design of the dual-core, 16nm Apple A9/A9X. Previously, the A10 was rumored to have between three and six cores. In AnTuTu benchmarks the dual-core Apple A9 has beat most other Android-targeted mobile SoCs with many more cores. The A9 was edged out only by Qualcomm’s quad-core, 14nm Snapdragon 820, which has four Cortex-A72 like “Kyro” cores, although the 14nm, octa-core Samsung Exynos 8890 was close behind. In other benchmarks, the A9 has beaten the Helio X20 and X25. It’s unclear whether Apple has proven that high core counts don’t matter or whether Big.Little dual- and tri-cluster SoC designs have yet to evolve to their full potential. Battery life and other considerations are also important. It remains to be seen how these complex multi-core designs are following through on promises to offer smoother transitions between operation modes like high-power video and VR, standard text and voice, and sleep/idle. Meanwhile, with the move to VR and augmented reality, GPUs are becoming almost as important as CPUs. Indeed Imagination’s PowerVR 7XT is expected to beat out the the Helio X20’s ARM Mali GPU in high-end gaming. MediaTek cares more about competition on high-end Android devices than it does about Apple. Principally, this comes down to Qualcomm and Samsung, with upstarts like Kirin advancing from below. Qualcomm recently introduced a modest upgrade to the Snapdragon 820 called the Snapdragon 821. Due to arrive in devices later this year, the SoC is claimed to offer 10 percent faster performance and provide better battery life than the 820. Intel’s Kaby Lake Stays at 14nm If all had gone according to plan it would be Intel, not MediaTek, announcing the first 10nm processor this month. Last month, Intel began shipping its seventh-generation Kaby Lake core processors, but with few details. We do know that the 7th Gen Core CPUs, which were originally meant to debut a 10nm process, will instead stick with the same 14nm process used by the sixth-gen Skylake and fifth-gen Broadwell chips. Intel’s ditching of its traditional “tick-tock” product release cadence is a sign that the Moore’s Law pace of chip miniaturization is slowing. Still Intel’s 10nm “Cannonlake” is expected in 2017, and on the ARM side, TSMC is already working on a 7nm process. The actual transistor density of the 7nm design is expected to be very similar to the 10nm Intel process, however. Meanwhile, Kaby Lake should offer incremental performance improvements over Skylake while squashing some of the bugs that have nipped at Skylake’s heels. We’ll find out more next week at the Intel Developer Forum. One thing Kaby Lake won’t be is a mobile processor, unless you count high-end tablets and all-in-ones. Intel appears to have dropped future development on its 14nm “Cherry Trail” Atom SoCs, which failed to win over many phone vendors, although more embedded-oriented SoCs like the “Braswell” Celeron, Pentium, and Atom x5-e8000 continue to do well.

The game was released yesterday and almost immediately, issues with crashing past the loading screen, frame-rate drops and more were reported. Yesterday, Hello Games founder Sean Murray offered tips on how players could make the game run better. Suggestions included updating the video card drivers, making sure the card was “above the min specs,” and checking to see if Visual C++ Redist 2010 was installed. The first PC patch was released alongside the game, and another is currently in the works. Murray said on Twitter today the team was “currently testing fixes for older AMD Phenom CPUs + more.” An update on the game’s Steam page, provides more information on what’s in the pot, noting that tickets have been filed “for everyone who mailed support,” and the team will respond them in turn. It seems many who filed a ticket “were trying to run the game significantly below” the minimum specs. The post also mentions that Intel cards aren’t supported. Bug reports brought to the team’s attention key issues which they are working to resolve. An “experimental branch with hot fixes” for the most common issues will be released. Issues currently being addressed in the hot fix include: shader cache issues, SSE 4 for CPUs which don’t support it, and jittery mouse controls when the player is on foot. Some players who have filed a support ticket will directed to the experimental branch while the solutions are tested. Hello Games further stated that if users were experiencing issues not addressed in the Steam post, to contact support.

HP’s Spectre, which the company is touting as the world’s thinnest, is one such example. With its high-quality hardware and refined design, the $999.99 Spectre seriously raises the bar for ultra-thin laptops. Still, there are some important considerations to make before picking one up. Here’s a closer look at what it was like to use the HP Spectre. How it Looks and Feels The HP Spectre looks unlike most other laptops out there. Made of aluminum and carbon fiber, the notebook has a sleek black appearance accented with a shiny gold hinge. HP clearly paid attention to the details here: the keys feature a gold trim to match the notebook’s glossy hinge. Meanwhile, the speakers, located to the left and right of the keyboard, look as if they’ve been etched into the keyboard deck. The gold hinge, however, does have the unfortunate tendency to collect fingerprint smudges. At roughly 0.41 inches thin and 2.45 pounds, the Spectre is supremely slim and light. Apple’s MacBook Air, by comparison, is 0.11 inches thin at its slimmest point but 0.68 inches at its thickest, while Dell’s XPS 13 is between 0.3 and 0.6 inches thin. The Spectre has a 1,920×1,080 resolution 13.3-inch screen, which is sharper than that of the MacBook Air but not as dazzling as those offered on some other ultrabooks. Still, for most people, it’ll be more than adequate for watching Netflix or browsing photos. Using It Keyboard quality is arguably one of the most important characteristics of a laptop. A poor keyboard can make it difficult or just plain frustrating to interact with your computer. Thankfully, the Spectre’s keyboard is among the best I’ve used on a laptop. The key travel is deep, providing rich feedback and making it comfortable to type at a quick pace. It’s exactly what should be expected of a premium notebook. The touchpad, however, could use some improvement. I found it to be sluggish and laggy at times, and I had to tweak a few settings to get an enjoyable experience. If you’re seeking a laptop primarily for work and entertainment, the Spectre should be plenty fast. It runs on Intel’s latest processors, and buyers have the option of choosing between a Core i5 or Core i7. I’ve been using the $1,099 Core i7 variant for a mix of web browsing, casual gaming, light photo editing, and streaming Netflix, and I haven’t come across any stutters or hiccups. However, the Spectre’s fans get noisy fairly often, which can be distracting. Those who typically watch TV shows or blast tunes from their laptop will likely be pleased with the Spectre’s Bang & Olufsen speakers, which offer rich and powerful audio. But the productivity-minded should keep in mind that the Spectre offers only three USB Type-C ports, plus a headphone jack. USB Type-C is certainly the future, but for now you’ll need adapters to connect the Spectre to most equipment — like external monitors. I didn’t get great battery life out of the Spectre, but I believe my testing circumstances were part of the problem. The notebook’s battery depleted after about four hours of use, which is unusually low. That said, the Wi-Fi signal in my office kept dropping in and out over the course of writing this review, and the battery may have been drained while the laptop was searching for a signal. It’s probably safe to expect around six hours of battery life out of the Spectre under normal circumstances. Conclusion With its latest Spectre, HP has proven that there is a way to improve laptop design without compromising the computing experience. The HP Spectre is a marvelously slim, attractive machine that tackles all of the basics, offering a sturdy keyboard and fast performance. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider other options. If you don’t need a Core i7 processor and don’t mind something slightly thicker, the Dell XPS 13 is definitely worth a look, especially since it’s about $100 cheaper than HP’s notebook and provides a similar experience. Chromebooks, meanwhile, are increasingly compelling options for the budget-minded. But in general, the Spectre is priced fairly considering most ultrabooks cost around $1,000. All told, HP’s Spectre is a top contender among today’s Windows 10 laptops. 4 out of 5 stars Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Microsoft controversially announced back in January that anyone still running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on a Skylake-based PC after July 17, 2017, would receive only “the most critical” security fixes – and these would only be released if they didn’t "risk the reliability or compatibility" of Windows 7 and 8.1 on other (non-Skylake) systems." In March, Microsoft pushed this date back a year to July 17, 2018, which still meant support would end earlier than for systems powered by its older Broadwell processors. But today, the company is pushing the date back again to bring it in line with the support lifetime of Broadwell. January 14, 2020 is now the last day for Windows 7, and Windows 8.1 will be supported until January 14, 2023. This also applies to Windows Embedded 7, 8, and 8.1 devices. “Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows. At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes. We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy,” wrote Microsoft director of Windows business planning, Shad Larsen, in a blog post. The post also mentions that future Intel chips Kaby Lake and Bristol Ridge will only be supported on Windows 10. Microsoft says the change is “to help our customers purchase modern hardware with confidence, while continuing to manage their migrations to Windows 10.” Related Reads Touch-based Office preview now available for Windows 10 This Microsoft tool tries to guess your age and gender based on a photo Microsoft releases browser-based Skype Meetings for small businesses 12 comments 189 interactions Share this article: Video Highlight Now Read This… Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation Win 10 Creators Update bringing smaller update downloads Microsoft stops sales of Windows 7 and 8.1 OEM licenses Popular 8 comments The Best Mice: Overall + Gaming, Wireless, Travel & More 10 comments The Best Video Game Gamepad Controllers Load Comments 12 ...

At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes," explains Shad Larsen, Director of Windows Business Planning. "We listened to this feedback and today are sharing an update to our 6th Gen Intel Core (Skylake) support policy.

The report forecasts the global cloud security market in retail sector to grow at a CAGR of 20.91% during the period 2016-2020. Increasing mobile workforce will be a key trend for market growth. The mobile workforce in the US was 96 million in 2015, and it will reach 105 million by the end of 2020. Developing regions have been witnessing a change in the working culture of organizations. With constantly changing business scenarios, organizations are required to develop a mobile workforce in order to stay competitive. The demand for flexible IT services is increasing, which can be met by cloud solutions. In addition, changes in work locations, time zone barriers, and the need to access official and confidential data using employees' personal devices is resulting in an increased demand for cloud services. In order to address these changes, IT service providers are providing tailor-made cloud services for smartphones and tablets. This trend will strengthen in the future, thereby pushing the market growth. According to the report, increase in phishing and malware attacks in retail sector will be a key driver for market growth. Approximately 63% of the data breaches in 2015 were due to default, stolen, or weak passwords. A major reason for the adoption of cloud security is the increase in cloud-specific attacks such as crimeware, cyber-espionage, and DoS. The growing use of cloud-based services has led to the increase in cloud security attacks, which results in data theft and identity theft. Further, the report states that inconsistent network performance will be a challenge for the market. One of the major requirements for the efficient performance of cloud security solutions is a strong and robust network connection. However, developing regions and some parts of developed regions are still plagued with slow and unstable network connections. The lack of proper network connections will expose cloud services and applications to cyber-attacks. Slow network connections also lead to time lags or latency issues. This makes it difficult to identify and provide access to authorized users and affects the reliability of cloud security solutions, thereby hindering their adoption.

While many IoT projects are more hype than reality, Davra Networks has woked with Cisco to create an end-to-end IoT platform that was first rolled out in Huntsville, Texas. The platform includes IoT gateways placed on buses to add a layer of video and passenger-counting technology to ensure the safety and security of students. The gateways also gather data to help school districts reduce carbon emissions by measuring the fuel efficiency of buses. ‘The business grew quickly from Texas to Oklahoma and New York and we are talking with school districts in Florida and elsewhere to deploy the technology’ – PAUL GLYNN, DAVRA It has since been deployed in Oklahoma and is going into school bus fleets in New York in Q4 of 2016. Talks are ongoing with schools in Tennessee and Florida. Keeping the IoT revolution rolling Paul Glynn, CEO, Davra Networks It is just one facet of the kind of work that Davra does. The a 24-strong company is based in Dublin’s IFSC, where most of its R&D and product development takes place. Davra is also working on other public-facing IoT projects, including tram networks in San Diego and rail networks in Canada. “Our focus is on transport and smart cities,” explained Paul Glynn, CEO of Davra. According to Glynn, Davra is a spin-out from Crannog Software, itself a spin-out from Lan Communications, which was bought by Eir in 1999. Crannog was bought by Fluke Networks in 2007. “Our initial plan with Davra, which we set up in 2011, was to focus on networking. We were doing internet of things before anyone called it internet of things,” said Glynn. “I sometimes compare internet of things to e-commerce, it isn’t an industry in itself, it is just a new way of using technology by old industries. People get caught up in this concept of the internet of things being this whole new industry that is going to take over the world. It is just existing industries using technology in different ways.” In recent weeks, Davra won the Best Overall Platform award at the IoT Evolution Battle of the Platforms competition, where it competed in categories including transport, smart cities and manufacturing. The platform was recognised for its superiority in real-time monitoring, tracking and data management. Real-time, reliable data is key to machine age The Davra Networks RuBan real-time data dashboard The secret sauce of Davra is its RuBan platform, which helps system integrators gather relevant information from vehicles and present the data in a real-time dashboard. This data helps companies increase employee productivity, passenger safety, reduce fuel costs, optimise driving routes and perform vehicle tracking. When we spoke to Glynn last week he was in San Francisco meeting potential venture capital investors who will bring Davra to its next stage, which, as well as product development, includes expanding its presence in the US, Europe and the Middle East. “We see a huge opportunity to manage the data that comes from the edge of the network. People think IoT is just gleaning data from sensors, but the reality is that is extremely difficult and expensive to do. However, our software managed the quality and the quantity of the data that is coming back and this is critical for real-time local decision-making.” The key to Davra’s strategy to winning the vital IoT landscape in the US is partnerships and the company works closely with Cisco and Intel on key projects. “We don’t believe there will be a single Google of IoT, that one single platform will manage sensors across multiple industries. We tend to focus on specific niches like transport, smart cities and manufacturing. For example, our partner in the manufacturing space is industrial technology giant Rockwell. And we have partners who are dedicated to healthcare.” Glynn said that because of the siloed nature of IoT deployments, companies are struggling to get real value out of their IoT investments. “What we bring to the table is a platform that lets you get any data from within a vehicle. If a driver hits the brakes we automatically tag the video to see what was happening in the cab or among the students in the bus. If a driver leaves a geofenced area for any reason our system knows it and raises the alarm. This is vital for, obviously, safety but also insurance purposes.” Davra’s entry into the US school transportation market – there are more than 500,000 yellow buses in North America by Glynn’s reckoning – was unplanned. “It began as a project to deliver Wi-Fi to the buses because many kids in Texas and Oklahoma live in rural areas and spend hours on the buses. But because Cisco routers and gateways also come with GPS chips, there was the opportunity to add in layers of functionality that would boost safety. “The business grew quickly from Texas to Oklahoma and New York and we are talking with school districts in Florida and elsewhere to deploy the technology.” Glynn said that all of Davra’s technology is designed and built in Dublin. “The purpose of our investment round will be to build out the team and expand in the US and other markets. We are taking a different approach to most Irish tech companies by going directly to Silicon Valley venture capital firms because they have a different mindset to European investors. “Investors in Silicon Valley are quite jaded with most IoT plays because some of them are novel rather than realistic. But they like what we are doing because we have real customers with real problems to solve.” American school bus image via Shutterstock Related: US, The Interview, smart cities, internet of things, funding and investment, transport Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Start-ups Meet the 5 start-ups smartening up Dublin’s booming cycle scene 23 Sep 2016172 Shares Hiring Now Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Help develop the future of sales and trading Be part of a globally successful team Working at the leading edge of IoT Innovation Dublin gears up for five smart solutions to cycle problems 16 Sep 2016212 Shares Comms The cable guy: David C McCourt on Ireland’s broadband future 3 Aug 2016101 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Slideshow 14 Views from the Flash Summit Rick Merritt 8/12/2016 08:00 AM EDT 11 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- New persistent memories and techniques promise to reshape computing. At the Flash Memory Summit here, engineers talked about how they are driving shifts in everything from server design and network storage to machine learning and flash chip prices. One of the hot topics of the event was closing the gap between flash storage arrays on the network and solid-state drives (SSDs) on the server. The idea that systems could access flash memory whether it is local or on the other side of the data center is driving new system, silicon and software designs. Fueling the trend, the NVM Express group just released a specification to enable the NVMe flash interface to run over networks such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and Infiniband. The so-called NVMe over fabrics spec supports various schemes for direct memory access. The upcoming PCI Express Gen 4 standard also is driving the move, in part because PCIe already forms the plumbing for NVMe.  The Gen 4 speeds will blow away older SAS and SATA interfaces on solid-state drives. Ultimately PCIe is expected to dominate SSDs and become relatively low cost. There’s plenty of work to be done, noted Stefanie Woodbury, director of advanced architecture at Micron and design lead for the company’s 3D XPoint-based SSDs. Interoperability will be critical given three fabrics, multiple direct-memory schemes and various block, file and streaming storage semantics –as well as emerging memory types such as 3D XPoint, she said. Micron's Woodbury showed a prototype 3D XPoint SSD. (Images: EE Times) “I was at Seagate when we introduced the first Fibre Channel drives so this sounds familiar,” Woodbury said. The trend is opening an opportunity for a whole new class of flash controller designs, said Tim Canepa, a chief controller architect at Seagate who previously worked at SandForce. Engineers can’t create effective products by patching together SSD and a fabric controllers. Ground up designs are needed, Canepa said, noting the controller space has a healthy crop of several stealth startups – some of them attracted by the need for chips for emerging memory types such as the Intel/Micron 3D XPoint. Other chip and system startups showed their wares at the event. Kalray demoed its processor with 288 custom VLIW cores running NVMe over Ethernet based on version 2.0 of the RoCE direct-memory access approach. Mellanox and Chelsio are among other chip makers hoping to offload such jobs from host processors. At the systems level, Mangstor showed its dual-socket servers integrated with flash and Mellanox network cards. But the company claims its software for NVMe over fabrics, which was out ahead of the SNIA spec, is its secret sauce. The competition is stiff. E8 Storage won an award at the show for its flash array which delivered a whopping 10 million I/O operations/second (IOPS) while supporting 100us reads and 50us writes over NVMe.

In July they were still saying that it ships this year but at IDC it seems that they only mentioned cloud access this year to XPoint, guess they might be counting that as shipping. In 2015 Micron was talking XPoint gen 2 ramping at the end of 2016 and "emerging memory gen 1" in late 2017. Maybe Intel has the controller ready sooner so they'll take all the output next year and ship a little in consumer while qualification in server takes a bit longer? Would explain the gap between what Micron has been saying and Intel's claims. When Intel talks about shipping, they don't mention volumes and it wouldn't be unusual if the ramp is 1 year after they start shipping.

It seems I may not have been very clear on some of the key points I attempted to make. You probably know that I'm very aware of Intel's FPGA direction. So your point that one could build an arch POC to implement the Data Coprocessor is correct. The key points I was trying to make are the following: 1. The PCI(e) IO architecture is over 20 years old. Admittedly a lof ot enhancements have been made in the 20 years to increase BW, reduce latency and to reduce somewhat processing overhead. However it has been designed for traditional IO such as network adapters and storage controllers with embedded DMA channels and some local data handling facilities. 2. In the main time server memory capacity has been increasing due to the advancements of DRAM density. Most of the memory capacity today is used to store data (hence the In Memory Processing trend). SCM will exasperate it further if the SCM density projections are correct.  3. The argument I was trying to make is to 'right size" the main memory for OS/HV/App/Temp, Heap etc storage and create a new low latency attach point for SCM to the CPU but not through the memory channels and controlled by the CPU's memory controller, rather an evolved version of DCP, where DCP would become the SCM's memory controller. Both the performance demand of the applications and the access models warrant to create this new peer level function for SCM. IMHO it is time to think about server architectures beyond what the PC/AT defined long time ago.  Regards   Balint Fleischer Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: NVMe over Fabrics Error rick merritt   8/13/2016 1:09:02 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Fixed, thx!

Chandler: Meet your City Council candidates Chris Coppola , The Republic | azcentral.com 8:45 a.m. MST August 16, 2016 Chandler’s next city election is scheduled for August 2016, when three City Council seats will be up for grabs. Any seats that are not won outright in August would result in a runoff election in November. (Photo: The Republic) Eight candidates are vying for three open seats on the Chandler City Council in the Aug. 30 primary election. Two seats are guaranteed to be filled with council newcomers as current members Jack Sellers and Rick Heumann will reach their term limits in early January. New members will be seated soon after. If there are not enough candidates who win seats outright in the primary — by obtaining more than 50 percent of votes cast —  a runoff election will be held Nov. 8. The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com asked Chandler candidates several questions. Below are excerpts from their responses. To see all questions and complete responses, along with detailed biographical information, visit votersguide.azcentral.com. Information on candidates in all local, county and state races is available on the Web page. THEVOTERGUIDE My Ballot - #azvotes: azcentral politics' 2016 Voters Guide Matt Eberle Website:http://matteberle.com Facebook: Matt Eberle for Chandler City Council What makes you the best person for the job? I have over 20 years of proven financial leadership within Fortune 500 and publicly-traded companies, holding roles including treasurer of the parent company of a Nasdaq company, director of finance with a Fortune 100 and controller. In addition, I have mergers and acquisitions experience, having been a part of multi-billion dollar mergers with large household-named companies. ... Policy decisions that promote lifestyle, safety, and growth can be complicated, and require collaboration, tenacity and patience. I am accessible and open to ideas, understanding that there are more great ideas in a group and as an individual. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? 1. Set aside reserve for the future. 2. Pay down existing debt. 3. Give the taxpayers back their hard-earned money. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I would change anything that threatens our way of living. We can always look for opportunities in entertainment and lifestyle, and we see the beginning of our downtown being developed to a new level. Over the next few years we will continue to see a transformation downtown as well as in other parts of the city. Nora Ellen Nora Ellen  (Photo: Special for The Republic) Website:  ElectNoraEllen.com Facebook: Nora Ellen What makes you the best person for the job? As the only incumbent in this race I have a proven track record. ... I have worked on four budgets, helped in updating our General Plan that takes place only every 10 years and fulfilled what I promised to do when I ran the first time. That is, to push to make Chandler a world-class economy with beautiful and safe neighborhoods, and to ensure fiscal responsibility along the way. This I will continue to do. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? We currently have a 15 percent contingency reserve and a budget stabilization reserve. Should we have a surplus above these important amounts, I would follow what the Citizen Budget Survey showed in the priority based budget goals. The most important areas by priority are: fire emergency response; police patrol services; criminal-investigations services and traffic management; and street rehab and maintenance. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? While I believe Chandler is doing a great job in our operations, since coming on council I have advocated for our city to operate with the latest and best technologies in all areas so we are the most efficient running city. This is especially important when it comes to our police and fire departments in keeping our residents safe. ... I also want our businesses to have what they need online to streamline their business-startup process, in getting permits, and accessing helpful resources that will boost their ultimate success. Seth Graham Website:graham4chandler.com Facebook: Seth Graham for Chandler City Council in 2016 What makes you the best person for the job? For myself and my family, this is much more than just a career move or a political stepping stone. I sincerely feel I was born to serve the people of Chandler and to contribute to their prosperity and success. ... Regardless of where you live or who you know, municipal residents expect and deserve the highest level of attention regarding their concerns. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? I would use and encourage other council members to use the surplus monies for public-safety hiring, parks and recreation (improving our overused sports fields) and save a large portion to reduce taxes and fees charged to residents and businesses. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I love most of the big events Chandler offers throughout the year. I would change how Chandler operates some of these big events. I would look at the least popular in attendance and local business participation. The under-performing events waste taxpayers' money and city resources. They should be eliminated or reworked. Aaron Harris Sr. Website:electaaronharrissr.org Facebook: Elect Aaron Harris Sr. for Chandler City Council 2016 What makes you the best person for the job? I have a great affection for our city as evidenced by my civic interests and affiliation with the Chandler Gilbert Family YMCA and service to the community as the chair of the city of Chandler citizens panel for review of police complaints and use of force. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? A needs assessment should be conducted in order to prioritize the best use of funds. Maximizing the city’s contingency fund would also be recommended in order to offset any unforeseen emergencies, safety concerns, economic crises, and also funding one-time and ongoing reserves for various city projects. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I would focus on prioritizing and expediting the redevelopment of aging communities and parks within the city. Parks support the engagement of the great citizens of Chandler and provide a venue where citizens can participate in recreational activities and events that promote the overall well-being of our community. Parks and aquatic centers across the city should be equal and offer well-kept and safe amenities for all citizens. Sam Huang Sam Huang  (Photo: Special for The Republic) Website: SamHuang.net Facebook: SamHuang4Chandler What makes you the best person for the job? With the vision to lead and passion to serve, (I) pledge not only to ensure Chandler remains a great city to live, work, and play, and also to take Chandler to the next level. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? Add water features in parks; repeal grocery tax; reduce impact fees; expand libraries and library services; promote more arts and cultural activities; support parks/recreation, public safety and museums. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? Revitalize old communities Greg Pekau Website: greggpekau.com Facebook: Gregg Pekau for Chandler What makes you the best person for the job? Mayor Boyd Dunn asked me to serve on Chandler’s Neighborhood Advisory Committee during the Great Recession. I served as a commissioner from 2008-2011,  working with citizens, neighborhood leaders and HOA’s to protect home values, resolve community issues and ensure proper engagement with city services and resources. I have worked in management and leadership positions for Intel Corporation since 2001. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? Invest in our “rainy day” fund to handle unexpected future economic downturns; pay down or pay off long-term debt to keep our tax rates low; accelerate key projects (water infrastructure, roads, etc.) that were planned for future years; invest in one-time expenses for critical items such as needed technologies and training for our first responders. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? Chandler families are going to Gilbert, Tempe and Phoenix for entertainment more and more frequently. We need a vibrant entertainment experience in Chandler year round to build upon our concerts, festivals and current entertainment options. We should work with our developers and business community to find the right fit of entertainment uses and options for Chandler. John Repar Website: johnreparforchandler.com Facebook: John Repar for Chandler City Council What makes you the best person for the job? I am experienced in civic affairs through previous service to Union City, Calif., and current involvement in Chandler. I have the time to be available to serve, the interest to follow up on detail, the experience to apply my skills and the motivation to follow through to obtain results. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? I believe some of the older parts of town could use a face lift through road improvements, lighting, walkways, and recreational facilities. Some type of program to stimulate residents for landscaping and maintenance of properties. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? I think there is a little too much discussion about "build out" as though it is some type type of huge event. This will simply come in time. Puts way too much pressure on pushing for revenue sources instead of continued economy of operations and detailed planning of infrastructure maintenance. Mark Stewart Mark Stewart.  (Photo: Special for The Republic) Web site: Stewart4Chandler.com Facebook: Stewart4Chandler What makes you the best person for the job? As an entrepreneur and small-business owner, I have a bold vision for Chandler. One that inspires and energizes the city by creating a community of innovation. One that empowers small businesses and startups by reducing regulation and lowering taxes. A vision that attracts and retains bedrock companies to Chandler and sees the limitless potential for growth and prosperity. If Chandler has a budget surplus next year, how would you suggest it be used? Maintaining the city’s financial health so we can operate from a position of strength is critical. Our second priority must always be ensuring our first responders have everything they need. Keeping the city financially secure ensures continued low taxes. What is one thing you would change about how Chandler is operating? We can think big and I will work to achieve the next evolution of our city. Maintaining the high quality of life that residents have come to expect as we grow means ensuring public services and infrastructure keep pace with our city’s growth. We must strive for the next level, rather than settling.

It was the IBM 5150 and the pioneer of personal home computing, thanks to its innovative design, specifications and price tag.  Costing a hefty $1,565, which is the equivalent of $4,150 today (£3,200), the IBM 5150 wasn't necessarily affordable. But its small size and IBM's ability to produce a a high volume of them made it the first accessible computer on the market.  "This is the computer for just about everyone who has ever wanted a personal system at the office, on the university campus or at home," said C. B. Rogers, then-IBM vice president, at the 5150's launch. "We believe its performance, reliability and ease of use make it the most advanced, affordable personal computer in the marketplace."  Within two years of its release tens of thousands of homes and businesses were fitted with an IBM PC and rival companies such as Dell and HP started to developing the machines that would become the computers of today.  Happy #IBMPCDay 🖥! On this day in 1981 "The IBM PC" made our lives a lot more awesome 👍 https://t.co/kyGsoMydhe #FBF pic.twitter.com/ssVr6dCXMC— IBM (@IBM) August 12, 2016 How it was born Before the 5150, IBM computers were significantly more expensive to run, cumbersome and energy intensive, according to the company's history. Not long before the 5150 debuted, IBM computers had cost as much as $9 million to run and needed a staff of 60 people and an air-conditioned room that took up a quarter of an acre. The company's entry-level computer, the IBM System/38 minicomputer cost $90,000.  But when the idea of a home computer was first floated at IBM it was met with a cold response: "Why would anyone want to take a computer home with them?"  Facing competition from the likes of Apple, Commodore and Atari, then-chief executive Frank Cary decided IBM needed to buy one of those smaller computers or design its own microcomputer that would cost a seemingly impossible $1,500.  "Come back with a prototype in a month," he told William Lowe, who was a systems manager.  Retro computers like you've never seen before For the first time in the company's history it used external products inside the computer, including Microsoft's operating system QDOS and Intel's 4.77MHz 8088 processor.  The computer was unveiled on August 12 1981 at a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York. It had 16KB of RAM and came with a few pre-installed applications, including a spreadsheet called VisiCalc and a word processor called EasyWriter. It didn't have a hard drive, but was available in a larger 256KB size. When it went on sale, the IBM 5150 came with a keyboard, anti-glare screen, printer, floppy disk drive and built-in speakers.  On its 25th birthday, IBM described the 5150 as "a very small machine that could not only process information faster than those ponderous mainframes of the 1960s but also hook up to the home TV set, process text and store more words than a huge cookbook." A few months later, the company released the above advert for the PC, which was inspired by Charlie Chaplin and at odds with IBM's traditionally corporate image. "We were dealing with a whole new audience that never thought of IBM as part of their lives," Charles Pankenier, the director of communications at the time, told Time Magazine.  It took two years for the IBM PC to become a household name, but by 1983 people were buying them in the tens of thousands and Time Magazine replaced its "Man of the Year" with the personal computer as the "Machine of the Year".  Dell, Compaq and HP soon emerged with "IBM compatible" machines, which gave way to laptops, tablets and smartphones over the next three decades.  Evolution of the computer - in pictures   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: IBM Show more Technology latest 23 Nov 2016, 8:06pm Autumn Statement 2016: The Telegraph's business panel gives its verdict 23 Nov 2016, 4:30pm Parking chaos as payment app RingGo offline across the country  23 Nov 2016, 11:24am Facebook 'prepares to suppress posts in bid to enter China' 23 Nov 2016, 11:02am How much of the UK has mobile phone coverage?

Photo: Mint Rs.59,766 crore What is it? The combined revenue of Aditya Birla Nuvo and Grasim Industries, both of which belong to the Aditya Birla Group. The group announced the merger of the two on Thursday. Why is it important? Post merger, Grasim will become a more diversified firm with interests in cement (contributing 42% of its revenue), textiles (17%), telecom (16%), financial services (15%), chemicals (9%) and others (1%). The combined net profit will be Rs.4,245 crore. Shareholders aren’t happy. Grasim’s share prices fell 12% in the last two days since reports on the merger emerged. Tell me more: The group plans to spin off its financial services business, and list it separately. The merger will also bring down the cross-holdings in Aditya Birla Group, since its larger companies, including Grasim and Nuvo, hold shares in each other. 315 million What is it? The number of rural internet users in India by 2020, according to Boston Consulting Group. Why is it important? That would represent an addition of nearly 200 million internet users in the next four years—from 120 million at present. It would demand a change in the way online businesses approach customers—with greater stress on local languages, smaller mobile screens, simplified user interface, logistics and optimising for slower connections, among other things. At present, online businesses mostly cater to urban customers and have been facing a slowdown in their growth. Tell me more: The share of online users in rural India will be 48% by 2020, from 36% at present, according to the report, The Rising Connected Consumer in Rural India. $31 billion What is it? India’s telecom revenue for 2015. Why is it important? It’s about 3% of the global revenue of $1.093 trillion. India has a large and growing number of telecom users, but the average revenue per user (ARPU)is still low at about $4 per user, compared to $20 per user in Asia. Some analysts believe ARPU might go further down as companies target next segment of relatively poorer users for data. Besides, Reliance Jio launch is expected to have an impact on prices as telecom players compete for customers. Tell me more: China Mobile, with revenue of Rs.4.63 trillion crore from 886.2 million connections, Vodafone (Rs.2.68 trillion from 461 million connections) and Bharti Airtel (Rs.336 crore from 336.2 million connections) are among the top mobile companies by connections globally. 2 What is it? The number of Indians in Forbes’ 100 Richest Tech Billionaires 2016 list. That’s Wipro Ltd’s Azim Premji and HCL Technologies’s Shiv Nadar. Why is it important? Neither Wipro nor HCL Tech is the largest tech firm in India, and Premji and Nadar made it to the list on account of their huge shareholding in their respective companies. United States has more than half (51) of the top 100 tech billionaires, followed by China (19) and Canada (5). Tell me more: Bill Gates (Microsoft), Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) top the list. The top 10 also has billionaires from Google, Oracle, Alibaba, Tencents and Dell. 3 What is it? The number of Indian companies to get Intel Capital’s investment this year. All the three were follow-up investments. Why is it important? Intel Capital is reportedly slowing down on investing in Indian start-ups. It’s significant because Intel’s venture capital arm has been the most active of corporate VCs (CVCs) in India between 2011 and 2015, according to CB Insights. It also reflects the slowdown in global CVC activity, which just hit its lowest in the last nine quarters. Tell me more: Qualcomm Ventures, Bertelsmann India Investments and Cisco Investments are the other three most active VCs in India.

Suppliers use sensors, cameras, radar and computing power to provide that functionality. The auto industry's self-driving revolution has spurred the biggest two years of car-supplier takeovers in a decade, with more coming as parts makers struggle to keep up with the pace of technological transformation. The total value of automotive-supplier deals in 2015 and 2016 was $74.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with each of those years far exceeding the $17.7 billion annual average in the previous 10 years. The number of transactions valued at $500 million or more also skyrocketed to 18 last year, triple the level of the previous decade. There have been 11 such deals so far this year. The driving force behind the wave of consolidation is the pressure to keep up with the shift toward autonomous driving that started about five years ago. Suppliers need the know-how to help cars see their environment much as a human pilot would, which means sensors, cameras and radar, plus the computing power to comprehend the waves of data and share some of it, like traffic conditions, from vehicle to vehicle. Meanwhile, parts makers are getting cheaper, with economic uncertainty and Brexit concerns driving share prices down. "Automotive bankers are definitely spending more time in places like Silicon Valley," said Christian Kames, Citigroup Inc.'s head of investment banking for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the global co-head of automotive. "The focus areas are electronics, communications and software. In the past, most suppliers didn't really have that kind of technology, but they now know they need to have it to set the industry standards for the future." Up next could be deals in infotainment, which would give parts makers access to the all-important interface between driver and vehicle. With a number of smaller players, the sector is attractive because combinations probably wouldn't raise the concern of competition regulators, said Chris McNally, a London-based analyst at Evercore ISI. Companies that could be bought either wholly or partially include Harman International Industries Inc., Van Buren Township-based Visteon Corp. and Troy-based Delphi Automotive Plc, he said. "I think we'll probably see a few more interesting deals over the next year or so," McNally said. ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Continental AG and Robert Bosch GmbH have relatively little exposure to infotainment, he said. Last week's slate of deals show where the industry is headed. ZF, fresh off last year's $12.9 billion purchase of Livonia-based TRW, the industry's biggest in eight years, took a 40 percent stake in radar supplier Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH and bid 4.41 billion kronor ($515 million) on Aug. 4 to win brake-maker Haldex AB away from German competitor SAF-Holland SA. The day before, Samsung Electronics Co. was said to be in advanced talks to buy some or all of auto-parts maker Magneti Marelli from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in a potential $3 billion deal. If successful, it would be Samsung's first automotive purchase. "If you don't buy now, and boost your capabilities for autonomous driving and for connected cars, there's no second chance," said Dietmar Ostermann, who leads an annual study of supplier deals as director of the automotive practice at PwC. "Because the others will." Deals involving makers of powertrain and chassis components remain the most common, he said, but electronics-related acquisitions are the growing the fastest. The shift toward electric vehicles will also drive deals, especially as industry leaders announce ambitious targets, said Axel Hoefer, a managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in Frankfurt. Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Matthias Mueller is aiming for as much as one-quarter of its global sales to be battery-powered vehicles by 2025. "Put yourself in the shoes of a traditional supplier," Hoefer said. "A gradual shift is fine. But if it's a steep change, that will put lots of people under pressure." In addition to the rush to acquire technology, increased appetite from China is driving deals, according to bankers. For example, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp., a Chinese supplier to several of the world's largest automakers, agreed in February to buy U.S. airbag maker Key Safety Systems for $920 million. "The targets for my clients sit in Silicon Valley, while the buyers for my clients are in China," Hoefer said. Autonomous functions will take a leap forward in the next few years. BMW AG is working with chipmaker Intel Corp. and camera-software company Mobileye NV to bring a car to the road by 2021 that can cruise highways autonomously. Volvo Car Group is promising the same. Continental, Europe's second-biggest car-parts supplier, is working on its own BMW-style cooperation. The industry's profit expectations for shared self-driving cars have helped make ride-sharing provider Uber Technologies Inc., which is testing autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh, the world's most valuable startup, worth about $62 billion. Continental bought Elektrobit Oyj's automotive-software division for 600 million euros ($665 million) last year. This month, the company said orders for autonomous systems, including products that use Elektrobit technology, leaped 50 percent to 1.2 billion euros, making the area its fastest-growing business. "If you think back five years ago, nobody knew such products would exist," Continental Chief Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer said in an interview. As the sector shifts from supplying car seats and exhaust pipes to offering camera software and sensors, new entrants like Samsung will speed the rate of change. At the same time, companies that aren't profitable enough to keep up could be snapped up by larger competitors looking to grow while saving costs as well as set up a better negotiating position with automakers. "If a company isn't innovative and its products aren't unique, they won't survive in the shark tank that is the auto supply sector," said Peter Fuss, a partner at Ernst & Young's automotive advisory unit.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software MacBook Pro will Soon Receive its Biggest Update in Years August 12, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Useful Tips to Make Your MacBook Pro More User-Friendly GoPro Unveils Telemetric Addition for Footage Captured Through Hero 5 It’s been a while since MacBook Pro has been updated with some heavy features. In fact, over these four years since its arrival, we haven’t seen a single update to the device that has made the MacBook Pro stand apart from its previous versions. But it’s time, says Apple, as the company is now gearing up to put some beefy updates on table for the MacBook Pro. According to Bloomberg, Apple has been testing a new MacBook Pro since the beginning of 2016, and it includes a fresh design that would narrow the thickness of the device noticeably. Along with this comes the trimming of the bezels around the display, which will also yield a smaller frame for the MacBook Pro. The best part of the new MacBook Pro is that it will be replacing the physical function keys on top of the keyboard with a narrow touchscreen OLED display. Basic laptop functions could be controlled using this strip of OLED display. There is no info on what all additional functions and shortcuts Apple will include on the touchscreen. The updated MacBook Pro is also likely to house the Intel Skylake processor that should improve the performance and power consumption of the device. Besides, MacBook Pro is also said to be arriving with the new AMD Polaris GPU. On the outside, MacBook Pro will have its USB ports replaced with USB Type-C ports. This could also replace the MagSafe port and Thunderbolt ports, given that USB-C ports support the Thunderbolt protocol. Despite having the redesign nearly completed for the MacBook Pro, it looks less likely that we will be having the new MacBook Pro launched during their iPhone 7 event scheduled on September 7. Apple could push the launch of upgraded MacBook Pro to October, following which it will be made available on the markets the same month.

It as now added to that portfolio with the launch of the Titan Juxt Pro which is priced at Rs 22,995. The smartwatch coming in Black and Silver colour options will be selling online on Flipkart as well as select offline Titan stores along with some electronics stores. Unlike its predecessor, which was more of an analog watch with a slight digital feature, the Juxt Pro is an all-out smartwatch complete with a circular touchscreen display. Built with an all-metal body, the Titan Juxt Pro has a somewhat chunky design thanks to the 15.2mm thickness. The Juxt Pro comes with a 1.3-inch IPS LCD display with a 360 x 360 pixel resolution which gives a pixel density of 278PPI. It uses Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The Juxt Pro is water resistant up to 30 metres and it is compatible with any smartphone running Android 4.4 (and over) and iOS 8 (and above) operating systems. The pairing is done via the Titan Juxt app via Bluetooth. On the inside, you have an Intel dual-core processor clocked at 1GHz which is paired with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage. There is a rechargable 450mAh Li-Polymer battery which according to Titan, gives around 36 hours of usage time. There are some 20 pre-loaded watch faces from which you can select your preferred watch face. You can also store music on the watch and listen to it using a Bluetooth headset. The Titan Juxt Pro can display notifications such as messages, emails and lets you answer phone calls as well. There’s a camera app which you can use to remotely fire your smartphone. Other apps include fitness, calendar, timer and sensors such as an accelerometer, gyroscope and so on. The Titan Juxt Pro also has a security feature. On installing the Titan Safety app on the paired Android or iOS device, you can inform your emergency contact about your location. Long pressing the button on the watch will send your location and an emergency call to your registered emergency contact. Alongwith this you also get features such as weather forecast, converter across units and more.

The driver was stubbornly high levels of enterprise use of Windows 7 and 8.1 (still 47.01% and 7.8%). Microsoft typically offers 10 years of product support for Windows. The support is broken into two five-year phases, called "mainstream" and "extended." As Windows 10 is Microsoft's last product brand name for the Windows client, support policies become irrelevant. Microsoft does, however, have a point, and that is that the hardware and operating system are closely coupled and it is getting hard to support Windows 10 on older hardware – especially on machines which may not have UEFI (software bios) or devices on which rootkits and malware can hide in firmware. The extension makes sense as it allows enterprise time to depreciate their existing investments and still run standard operating system environments like Windows 7/8.1 on modern hardware. Future silicon platforms including Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (Bristol Ridge) or later will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10.

August 11, 2016 · 1:45 PM EDT By Mary Kay Magistad facebook Share on Facebook twitter Share on Twitter googleplus Share on Google + share Share Comment ShenzhenMakerTruck.jpg Credit: Mary Kay Magistad Are you a maker? Probably so, even if you haven’t heard the term. Player utilities Popout Share download Listen to the Story. PRI.org <iframe frameborder="0"  src="http://www.pri.org/node/154119/embedded" height="75" width="100%"></iframe> “We were born makers, and if we choose to develop our interest in making, anybody can do this,” says Dale Dougherty, who founded the Maker Movement 11 years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. “It’s not like a few geeks, a few people, are wired to do this. We’re all wired to do this.” Dale Dougherty, founder of the Maker Movement Credit: Mary Kay Magistad Dougherty’s original idea then was to encourage people in a country that had outsourced so many manufacturing jobs, to reconnect with the creativity that comes from making things with your hands — gadgets, robots, 3-D printing projects, but also crafts, cooking, even gardening. That, after all, is the way a lot of great inventors got started – but there’s no pressure here. “It’s not about how good you are. It’s about the sense of control and the sense of purpose and of setting your own direction, doing things that are meaningful to you.” Credit: Mary Kay Magistad So, first came MakerSpaces — kind of like communal use work benches or shop, with tools and materials and space for makers of all sorts to gather and share ideas. It started small, and went big — went global. There are now thousands of MakerSpaces in dozens of countries around the world. There’s Make Magazine, online Maker communities. There are some 180 annual Maker Faires — annual gatherings of Makers. More than 1.2 million people went to a Maker Faire last year alone in places like France, Italy, Turkey, Egpyt and China. And there's been international cross-pollination among Makers. Tuna Tumer, 14, from Ankara, Turkey traveled to California with his dad for this year's SIlicon Valley Maker Faire, to learn from other makers and to show off his latest invention, a business card-sized metal card with scalloped edges, that can measure the radius of corners. "This is a problem that most designers face, because there isn’t a tool for it," he says. "So for the radius of what they put on their designs, they just put a random number, but this is a really easy tool to use, so you just use it and write it down." All this for $5 at the Maker Faire. Tumer said he's considered himself a maker "ever since I got a 3D printer a couple of years ago ... now, when I'm bored, I just experiment with making things with it." He now has his own company, TNA Designs. Tumer says the real value to him of being at the Maker Faire was meeting other makers, and seeing what they're doing. "It's really cool to meet new people, the whole society of makers, and get new ideas," he says. "It's a really cool place." Tuna Tumer, 14, from Ankara Turkey, shows off his latest invention, which measures the radius of corners, at the 2016 Silicon Valley Maker Faire in San Mateo, CA. Credit: Mary Kay Magistad At first, you might think — China? China’s been the factory of the world for decades. Why does China need a Maker Movement?  Well, if the US embrace of the Maker Movement was to reconnect with a kind of creativity lost when the US moved from manufacturing to services and the knowledge economy, Chinese who have long been finding clever ways to recombine components want both to raise their innovation game and to get some recognition for the skill and creativity that already goes into manufacturing in China. Shenzhen electronic components mart Credit: Mary Kay Magistad In its early years in the US, the Maker Movement was meant to help Americans see themselves not just as consumers, but as producers. “And I started shaping the Maker Faire around this,” Dougherty says. “My way of doing that was to show them lots of their fellow citizens doing this. They were just ordinary people, their neighbors. And it gets you thinking, ‘well I could do that.’ It didn't have to be, ‘oh, they're just wonderful entrepreneurs, they're off doing their crazy things.’ It harkens back to the world of hobbies, which I feel are important and sometimes slighted in our culture as, ‘well, it’s a hobby. It's something he does in his spare time.’ But people really value that time, because it's theirs and it replenishes them for other work. And often it, in funny ways, it influences even what they might do it more seriously for work as well. Exhibit at San Mateo Maker Faire Credit: Mary Kay Magistad That was why, from the beginning, the Maker Movement was about play, not work, Dougherty says. It may sound self-indulgent, but he believes a mind at play is a mind open to innovating. “I actually think it comes, not from sitting down and thinking that you're going to innovate and create something,” he says. “I think it comes from these moments of play, when you're trying things, and you're immersed in a problem set that you suddenly find compelling, and you want to figure your way out of it. And you see something that you would have never seen if you just stood on outside and watch someone else do it. And so I think innovators, in a sense, become that way because they are comfortable playing.” Scene at San Mateo Maker Faire Credit: Mary Kay Magistad That hasn’t been the approach thus far, in trying to increase innovation in China. China’s leaders have had a goal for almost two decades now, to make China a global power, ideally a global leader, in innovation. They’ve invested hundreds of billions of dollars in science parks, research labs, and other initiatives. They’ve incentivized researchers to come up with patents and journal articles — and they have. But so far, they’ve done better on quantity than on quality. It’s not that the potential isn’t there — it’s that, in many cases, the environment doesn’t support thinking that challenges the established way of doing things, or of open-ended research, failing, and trying again, and failing again, maybe for years, before hitting that eureka moment. The private sector is more nimble, but also cut-throat competitive, and often looking for the fastest way to a profit, which is usually to copy and recombine, rather than play around and come up with something startlingly new. Into this environment in China comes the Maker Movement. It started about five years ago, when a Taiwanese former PhD student-turned startup entrepreneur, David Li, moved from California to Shanghai — and set up China’s first MakerSpace. Another MakerSpace opened up in Shenzhen, just opposite Hong Kong, and now there are hundreds in China. David Li, founder of China's first Maker Space, in Shanghai Credit: Mary Kay Magistad China’s leaders have embraced the Maker Movement, offering welcome resources and publicity, but also a less welcome reflexive desire to take MakerSpaces, which are meant to be open and inviting, without too many rules and expectations, and add structure and, well, expectations. And this is happening at a time when China’s tech-savvy, relatively worldly, younger generation has, under Xi Jinping’s rule, seen open spaces for creative expression and challenges to Communist Party-approved ways of thinking close up, online, in classrooms and in the media. More websites have been blocked online, more Western textbooks banned. Innovation is still possible, in such an environment; there’s just a higher degree of difficulty to achieve it, given that China’s would-be innovators don’t have access to the same ideas, debates and habits of critical and creative thinking that their counterparts in other countries might have.  But there’s an old saying in China — "the sky is high, and the emperor is far away." And the city of Shenzhen is 1,300 miles away from the halls of power in Beijing.  In every sense. It’s looser, less political. A fishing village-turned city of some 22 million mostly migrants, Shenzen is a longtime center for manufacturing and now the darling of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, who see Shenzhen's agility with hardware to be a perfect complement to the Silicon Valley software and ideas factory. Eric Pan, founder of SEEED Studio in Shenzhen, and key organizer of Shenzhen's Maker Faire Credit: Mary Kay Magistad An influential player in having helped make that happen is Eric Pan, a native of Sichuan province, a former engineering student who, as a kid, loved to take things apart and put them back together. He is a former Intel employee who came to Shenzhen to start his own company, SEEED studio. (That’s not a typo; it’s spelled with three ‘e’s.) It sells open-source hardware products to Makers and others, and also provides manufacturing services to companies. Pan also opened Shenzhen’s first MakerSpace. “It started off very humble,” Pan says. “I was trying to help Makers out, because that’s really fun. And I just needed to make myself survive. Then, it went really well. It exceeded my expectations.” At work at SEEED Studio, which offers open-source hardware for makers, and more. Credit: Mary Kay Magistad Premier Li Keqiang came to see Pan’s MakerSpace in early 2015 and then, as so often happens when the Chinese government decides something is worth doing, it went big, at speed. Some officials seemed to see MakerSpaces as little more than incubators, that would become accelerators, and then start-ups that would contribute to economic growth and innovation. China’s early makers, including Pan and Li, have gently pushed back. “We are trying very hard to distinguish between MakerSpaces and incubators,” Pan says. “With MakerSpaces, we’re talking about passions, about exploring what you want to do, where you can explore all the possibilities to try new things. But the gravity of the Chinese government’s will is strong, and China’s version of the Maker Movement got pulled a little closer to its orbit during the Shenzhen Maker Faire last year, which Eric Pan spearheaded. Shenzhen Maker Faire 2015 scene Credit: Mary Kay Magistad It was huge. About 200,000 people came, and it covered several city blocks — a far cry from a few enthusiasts gathering in a room four years earlier. There was a whole Shenzhen Maker Week, with events all over town. But at the opening ceremony, where Communist Party officials spoke, it was walled off, with just state-run media, and a few invited guests. Lots of control. Very Communist Party. There was even government resistance to letting Dale Dougherty speak, but Eric Pan ceded some of his time on the stage to this man he clearly respects. After that, Dale had some time to wander around, and see how the Maker Movement was taking off in Shenzhen, and he found some interesting contrasts with the American Maker Movement. “My experience at the Shenzhen Maker Faire, I'd go down a row of exhibits and they were all drones. And they all look the same. And I'd ask them, ‘what does your drone do?’ And they said, ‘well, it's my drone. I made it.’ I said, ‘Well, great. How is it different than his drone?’ ‘Well it's not. It's a drone, you know?  And I can make it.’ Someone said to me the Chinese are really good at anything from one to a million, but it's zero to one they have a problem with. And in some ways, it's that real thing that, like, something's missing. ‘I'm going to create something that doesn't exist.’ That's where innovation is really about when you see that opportunity and you trust and you take the risk to do that."

What’s in shorter supply is breakthrough, game-changing innovation that had as great an impact outside China’s borders as inside. One reason, perhaps, is that so much creative energy in China goes to getting around government-imposed obstacles and restrictions, or to finding out that someone’s come up with a catchy idea — the hoverboard, for instance — and getting to market before the inventor can. Can the same energy go to solving the world’s problems, in tech, biotech and beyond? It could — or at least it might, with the right incentives, the right supporting environment. The Maker Movement might help. The way the government is engaging with the Maker Movement, may or may not. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has been celebrating the Maker Movement, with a White House Maker Faire, some funding, and words of appreciation — but without anything like the same degree of hands-on effort to control the outcome. He has said that the Maker Movement, along with the emerging Internet of Things, could end up having as great an impact as the rise of the internet 25 years ago. SIlvia Lindtner, assistant professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information, is writing a book about Shenzhen's Maker Movement Credit: University of Michigan And how will that play out in China? Someone who’s given that question deep thought over time is Silvia Lindtner, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Information. She speaks Chinese, lived in China for five years, including in Shenzhen, and is writing a book about the impact of the Maker Movement there. I caught up with her at the Shenzhen Maker Faire. “I get asked all the time, ‘is Shenzhen really creative?,” she says. One of the Europeans visitors here said, ‘well, they’re not really creative, here, because they’re focused on business. They’re focused on products.’ So there’s this interesting tension here between, and I’m simplifying right now, this Western view of, ‘oh, you shouldn’t be talking about money up front, you should be unleashing your passion, and that’s true creativity. I would say it’s more interesting to say, ‘well, what are the roots of production here, the history of production here, and what could creativity mean here on its own terms, rather than using familiar frames of reference, like Silicon Valley-type notions of creativity and innovation, that you hear very often thrown around here at the Maker Faire.” Stepping into a robot suit at the 2015 Shenzhen Maker Faire Credit: Mary Kay Magistad And yet, Chinese innovations are not yet having the kind of impact globally as the Chinese government set out to make happen, when they set goals back in 1998 and started pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into science parks and research centers, recruiting top overseas Chinese and foreign talent as well as using impressive talent at home. This begs a question. How necessary is it, really, for China, or India, or any other emerging economic power, to hit the highest rung of the innovation ladder, to come out with the kinds of innovations that change lives and how people live, around the globe? Throughout human history, relatively few countries have hit that mark. But China happens to be one of them. For a thousand years or so, up until about a thousand years ago, China was one of the most innovative places on earth, and Chinese astronomy was among the most advanced at that time. And then, the political environment changed. Incentives changed. There was less social support, or encouragement or recognition for coming up with — shaking up established ways of doing things, and proposing something radically new. And now, the Chinese government wants to launch a new era in which China is a global player, perhaps a global leader, in innovation — but it wants to do it by allowing innovation and critical thinking in specific silos — tech, biotech, hard sciences — but not in creative fields, or academia, where the same kind of thinking could challenge the Communist Party in ways it finds deeply uncomfortable. Shenzhen seems to have found a sweet spot, transforming three decades of experience in manufacturing into a draw for Silicon Valley innovators who need partners to bring form to their ideas, and to do it with speed, with an impressively efficient supply chain, and with a certain innovative flair that the Maker Movement now celebrates. But how much are Chinese in Shenzhen, or anywhere in China, coming up with innovation at the highest level? “I think the absolute percentage is very, very low,” says Eric Pan of SEEED studio. “Because Shenzhen has gotten used to ‘Copy to China.’  In the beginning, we manufactured something, like Nokia, and we imitated the design. But I think from all these imitations, people have difficulty differentiating from one to another. Some of the weaker teams, they need to do differently. They can’t just differentiate on cost only. They need to come up with some new functionality or design. That’s where I think innovation comes from." “It’s like, if you want to write a book, you first need to learn the alphabet, and repeat, repeat, repeat. And then you come up with words. Then you can form your own sentences, and express your experience. In Shenzhen, people know how to write a sentence now. The next stage is to express themselves differently.”                                                                                                                                     For more on the Maker Movement:  Why the Maker Movement Matters: Part 1, the Tools Revolution MAKING IT: Pick up a spot welder and join the revolution.

NVIDIA had record revenues for the quarter, coming in at $1.43 billion, which is up 24% from a year ago. Gross margin for the quarter was 57.9%, up 2.9% from a year ago, while operating expenses fell 9% to $509 million. Operating income for the quarter was $317 million, up 317% from Q2 2016 where it was just $76 million due to a write-down of the Icera modem division. This also impacted net income, which was up 873% to $253 million, and earnings per share of $0.40 was up 700% compared to the Q2 2016 results. NVIDIA Q2 2017 Financial Results (GAAP)   Q2'2017 Q1'2017 Q2'2016 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue (in millions USD) $1428 $1305 $1153 +9% +24% Gross Margin 57.9% 57.5% 55.0% +0.4% +2.9% Operating Income (in millions USD) $317 $245 $76 +29% +317% Net Income $253 $196 $26 +29% +873% EPS $0.40 $0.33 $0.05 +21% +700% NVIDIA also released Non-GAAP measures, which “exclude stock-based compensation, legal settlement costs, product warranty charge, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable” and therefore don’t factor in the Icera write-down. In Non-GAAP measures, revenue was the same $1.428 billion, and gross margin was 58.1% which was up 1.5% from the Q2 2016 Non-GAAP results. Operating income was up 65% to $328 million, and net income was up the same 65% to $313 million. Earnings per share were up 56% to $0.53 compared to last year’s Non-GAAP results. NVIDIA Q2 2017 Financial Results (Non-GAAP)   Q2'2017 Q1'2017 Q2'2016 Q/Q Y/Y Revenue (in millions USD) $1428 $1305 $1153 +9% +24% Gross Margin 58.1% 58.6% 56.6% -0.5% +1.5% Operating Income (in millions USD) $382 $322 $231 +19% +65% Net Income $313 $263 $190 +19% +65% EPS $0.53 $0.46 $0.34 +15% +56% At the heart of this is NVIDIA’s GPU business, which has diversified quite a bit over the last several years. For Q2 2017, NVIDIA’s GPU business brought in $1.196 billion in revenue, up 18% from last year and up 14% over last quarter. NVIDIA’s Tegra platform, which is primarily automotive now, but still powering a couple of consumer devices like the SHIELD Tablet K1 and the SHIELD Android TV, brought in revenues of $166 million, which is up 30% from a year ago. NVIDIA’s “other” category is the $66 million they report per quarter for the payment from Intel for licensing. Broken down by market, gaming is still the largest market for NVIDIA, with revenues of $781 million attributed to gaming, which is up 18% year-over-year. This has been spurred by the recent releases of their latest Pascal GPUs for the desktop, which hold the current performance crown with the move to a new FinFET node. Professional Visualization brought in $214 million, up 22% from a year ago, and NVIDIA just announced Pascal based Quadro cards as well, so I would expect this growth to continue if Quadro matches GeForce. The Datacenter revenue had the biggest jump, up 110% year-over-year to $151 million, and NVIDIA has put a lot of effort and marketing into deep learning to achieve this kind of growth. Automotive accounted for $119 million in revenue, up 68% from a year ago, and NVIDIA’s OEM and IP market was the only one to see a small loss of 6% revenue compared to last year, down to $163 million. NVIDIA Quarterly Revenue Comparison (GAAP) In millions Q2'2017 Q1'2017 Q2'2016 Q/Q Y/Y GPU $1196 $1079 $959 +11% +25% Tegra Processor $166 $160 $128 +4% +30% Other $66 $66 $66 flat flat For next quarter, NVIDIA is expecting revenues of $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, with GAAP margins of 57.8% and non-GAAP margins of 58.0%, plus or minus 0.5%. With record revenue, a more diversified platform, and the current GPU performance crown, NVIDIA has been easily outperforming the PC market with their strong focus on one of the few bright spots in the PC market – gaming. We’ve seen several companies transition to practically only selling gaming computers, and that is because of the higher margins and strong sales they’ve seen. NVIDIA has been riding this wave with successful launches of it’s Maxwell products, and now Pascal.

Nvidia's pricing practices are shameless this generation. How I wish AMD could figure it out and compete again, then this pricing insanity would stop. After 9 GPUs bought from Nvidia, I'm seriously considering not buying from them until these insulting practices end. Reply webdoctors - Friday, August 12, 2016 - link Newegg has an ASUS GTX970 for $199 after rebate. That's a pretty good deal, and it might be cheaper if you get settlement money too. I think the issue is they're competing with their previous gen stuff too which wasn't bad. The GTX970 and 980 are amazing cards (I'd love to upgrade to either of them if I had time to actually game). Reply dsumanik - Friday, August 12, 2016 - link You realize what this means? 1. Nvidia is going to gouge even worse the next product cycle 2. The next product cycle just got 'delayed' 12 months 3. If you bought a 10 series card, you have no one to blame but yourself There was a golden era in the tech scene when AMD had a faster Athlon than Intel, and ATI first dropped the Radeon. FSB overclocking was not only 'allowed' but was considered normal and encouraged. Ultimately, this downhill greedy slide can be blamed on 2 things: 1. Media sites like this one, promoting the shameless business models of companies like Apple 2. You, the consumer for buying into it. And yes, I do blame AT directly...remember when Intel locked down FSB overclocking and AT wrote a puff piece about how this would be a good thing because it would have been 'too much work' for reviewers and 'unsafe' for system integrators lol... Just disgusting. It's a 2 stage system now, wealthy tech companies are paying big $$$ to try and have tech sites influence your purchasing habits, quite literally punishing sites that don't get on board. See through it people, be smarter. For the love of God, vote with your wallet or this is just going to be the tip of the iceberg. Reply TheJian - Saturday, August 13, 2016 - link For the love of god, get a better job and quit whining. If you can't afford a $300-1000 card every 3-5yrs (which seems to be my gpu upgrade cycle though my current one is far longer waiting all 14nm chips, IE vega/1080ti maybe), you clearly need to work on yourself. How much does your cell phone cost OFF contract (and that thing costs you $1500-2400 for 2yrs to own on contract!)? If you're that broke that a 1070 etc is out of your range, improve your earnings ability. I will be buying my 10 series card soon, or Vega if it WINS (win or bust, period). I have no problem with pricing and AMD really needs to charge more. I can easily afford a TitanX if I see some benchmarks showing it's anywhere close to Quadro's in pro app stuff for content creation (3dsmax/blender/adobe/maya etc) and far better than 1080/1070. Since it's a pro card I'm waiting on those tests and Vega to see where it lands. BTW, I am by no means rich or anywhere near it. Saving $300-1000 for me is a one month affair though :) If that isn't the case for you (or close, maybe another month or two) again, improve your job. I'm middle class for crying out loud, but I live within my means (basically means very little to no debt!). :) All I've done is lengthen my cycle from 2yrs to 3-5 depending on what I want in an increase in perf etc. I love the fact that people are buying high, and giving me a great deal below if I choose not to go $400+. I love that there are rich people who can afford these $1000-1200 cards EVERY year…LOL. They pay for all the R&D. If you take out Intel's 266mil a year payments (coming next year to an end) they still wouldn't make 1B (far from it). Just exactly how much money is a company supposed to be able to make in your opinion? We're not talking apple/intel/samsung etc here (who make 10-50x NV) either. So how much is an OK amount for a tech leader? The only thing disgusting here is you whining about your own position in life ;) There are cards that are very high performing from $200 and up. If that is really a problem for you every few years you have major issues. The market sets the price not NV and their job is to find the highest price they can get IN that market, no matter what company we're talking about. Price what the market will handle, anything less is silly. The fact that AMD seems to be failing in this is their own management problem (or lack of product perf currently on the high end and cpu). AMD's current situation is lack of R&D in CORE products. They gave up the cpu race 5yrs ago (and lost the gpu race pretty much 77% share for NV) due to chasing consoles, apus etc. They did it again with consoles rev2 coming up. If they don't charge appropriately for ZEN (assuming it's a LARGER chip than Intel HEDT) they have failed themselves and their customers as they'll have no R&D cash for the future. They have billions in debt (less than 800mil cash too) and need to make a billion or two for a few years to get that paid off and get back in the game for real. I really hope ZEN is bigger than xbox1 (363mm^2 and they make it for $100! sony's is slightly smaller but made for $90 sold for $100-105 probably) or they'll YET AGAIN be relegated to under $200 and priced to death by Intel who can bleed until AMD is beaten down yet again. They also better be aiming for Intels 24 core $7000 server chips soon next year. They will have pricing power if they put out a WINNER. After 8B in losses in the last ~15yrs they need a freaking winner in CPU again. Besides yourself, blame AMD for not making better products to compete. ***prays for HUGE die sizes*** :) Reply dsumanik - Saturday, August 13, 2016 - link poor lil baby go cry cry...peeps only rage when you hit that nerve of truth.

Reply slickr - Sunday, August 14, 2016 - link Get a life you worthless basement dweller. Rather than spending hundreds of dollars on a video card that becomes obsolete in just two years, that is already $100-$200 overpriced already, if you had a life you could spend it going outside, having drinks and eating with friends and having a good time. Only lifeless trash would spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on an overpriced GPU. Reply Michael Bay - Saturday, August 20, 2016 - link >Life=gut You`re exactly like him. Reply Gigaplex - Monday, August 15, 2016 - link Why would you get settlement money? The only "settlement" regarding these cards I've heard of were over 'false advertising' of the specs, which had a cutoff date. The issue is well known now, so if you buy a card with full knowledge, you're not eligible.

Katherine Noyes (IDG News Service) 12 August, 2016 09:44 - - - - print email Comments Hewlett Packard Enterprise is buying SGI in a $275 million deal that it hopes will give it a major boost in big-data analytics and high-performance computing. It's the latest surprise development at HPE, which has continued to make big changes since it was formed in the break-up of the old Hewlett-Packard last year. The deal to buy SGI, announced Thursday, fits with HPE's goal to expand its data analytics business. It will also make HPE a bigger player in high performance computing, a growing part of the server market.  SGI has roughly 1,100 employees worldwide. On Thursday, it reported a net loss for its last fiscal year of $11 million, on revenue of $533 million. "Not only will the acquisition of SGI strengthen HPE’s position in the high-growth big-data analytic segment, it will also extend our presence in HPC verticals," including government, life sciences, higher education and research, manufacturing and supercomputing, Antonio Neri, head of HPE's Enterprise Group, said in a statement. SGI's in-memory high-performance data-analytics technology, in particular, will bolster HPE's position in the HPC server market, the company said. With a long and tempestuous history dating back to 1982, SGI was founded by Jim Clark, who later went on to launch Netscape. Originally called Silicon Graphics Inc., it was rebranded following its descent into bankruptcy and subsequent acquisition by Rackable Systems in 2009. HPE faces challenges of its own since the split from HP's printer and PC group. Like other legacy technology companies, it's been struggling to adapt to the new business model of cloud computing. So far this year, HPE has killed off its public cloud service and announced plans to spin off most of its IT services division into a new company jointly owned with CSC. It's also seen several top executives announce plans to leave the company. This deal isn't the first time SGI and HPE have joined forces: SGI's NUMAlink interconnect is part of HPE's Integrity servers. What remains to be seen is whether acquiring a storied name like SGI can give HPE the boost it needs. First and foremost on the positive side are SGI's continuing advancements in HPC and analytics products based on Intel silicon, said Charles King, principal analyst with Pund-IT. "That is highly complementary to HPE's technology and business focus, meaning that it should be easy for the companies to find common synergies," King said. Another significant benefit is the price. "When you consider some of the lofty valuations of recent IT acquisitions -- many of which were unprofitable or marginally so -- HPE's purchase looks like a terrific deal," he said. "That will be especially true if projections for continuing healthy growth in sales of HPC and advanced analytics solutions come to pass." There's a growing overlap between HPC and big data, both architecturally and technologically, said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. SGI's Ice line of servers makes it a key player in high-performance computing, while its UV line gives it strong big-data capabilities, Moorhead said. In HPC, it boasts "very strong customer relationships that span decades." "I believe this acquisition will make HPE more competitive in HPC and could do the same in big data," he said. "HPE will need to invest and integrate to make it additive." The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of HPE's fiscal 2017, which ends in January.

Percona Server for MongoDB introduced the Memory Engine starting with the 3.2.8-2.0 version. To use it, run Percona Server for MongoDB with the --storageEngine=inMemory option. In-memory is a special configuration of WiredTiger that doesn’t store user data on disk. With this engine, data fully resides in the virtual memory of the system (and might get lost on server shutdown). Despite the fact that the engine is purely in-memory, it writes a small amount of diagnostic data and statistics to disk. The latter can be controlled with the --inMemoryStatisticsLogDelaySecs option. The --dbpath option controls where to store the files. Generally, in-memory cannot run on the database directory previously used by any other engine (including WiredTiger). The engine uses the desired amount of memory when configured with the --inMemorySizeGB option. This option takes fractional numbers to allow precise memory size specification. When you reach the specified memory limit, aWT_CACHE_FULL error is returned for all kinds of operations that cause user data size to grow. These include inserting new documents, creating indexes, updating documents by adding or extending fields, running aggregation workflow and others. However, you can still perform read queries on a full engine. Since Percona Memory Engine executes fewer operations and makes no disk I/O system calls, it performs better compared to conventional durable storage engines, including WiredTiger’s standard disk-based configuration. Performance The following graphs show Percona Memory Engine versus WiredTiger performance. Both engines use the default configuration with 140GB cache size specified. The hardware is 56-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v3 @ 2.00GHz with 256GB of RAM and RAID1 2xHDD. Test data set is about cache size and fully fits in memory. You can clearly see that Percona Memory Engine has better throughput and less jitter on all kinds of workloads. Checkpointing, however, can cause jitters in WiredTiger, and are absent in Percona Memory Engine as there’s no need to periodically sync in-memory data structures with their on-disk representations. However, the performance of Percona Memory Engine drops when it’s about to become full (currently, when it’s 99% full). We’ve marked this issue as fixed (https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-24580) but it still crops up in extreme cases. Percona Memory Engine might use up to 1.5 times more memory above the set configuration when it’s close to full. WiredTiger almost never exceeds the specified cache memory limit. This might change in future versions. But current users should avoid possible swapping or OOM-killing of the server with Percona Memory Engine if (mis)configured to use all or close to all of available system RAM. You can download the latest version of Percona Server for MongoDB, which includes the new Percona Memory Engine feature, here.

Here's what the acquisition indicates about HPE's strategy going forward. HP Milestones: A Look Back, As Tech Giant Splits In Two (Click image for larger view and slideshow.) Looking to lock up the high performance computing (HPC) market as it grows to accommodate the needs of big data, Hewlett Packard Enterprise on Aug. 11 announced plans to acquire another high-end hardware and software company, SGI. HPE announced it is buying this high performance solutions company for computing, data analytics, and data management, in a deal worth about $275 million. The acquisition strengthens HPE's position in the $11 billion HPC segment and in the data analytics segment, according to HPE. Plus, it expands the company's presence in key vertical markets for HPC, such as government, research, and life sciences. This deal marks another move in HPE's ongoing efforts to transform itself into a more focused company designed to compete in today's market. This deal gives new hints about HPE's strategy going forward and the markets it intends to target. It shows that the company is doubling down on its high-end hardware, and on its data analytics and management software. [Are you ready for the next wave of business technology? Read IT Organizations Unprepared For Digital Business.] HPE's executive vice president and general manager of the enterprise group, Antonio Neri, explained HPE's motivation in a blog post about the deal. "This acquisition will enable us to combine both companies' best-in-class portfolio, including our compute solutions and SGI's in-memory, high performance data analytics technology, and provide our customers with sophisticated solutions designed to solve the world's toughest problems," Neri wrote. (Image: Jessica Davis/InformationWeek) "Together, HPE and SGI will offer one of the technology industry’s most comprehensive suites of data analytics products and services -- helping organizations extract maximum insights from exploding data volumes more quickly, drive business automation and innovation, and gain a competitive edge," he added. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of HPE's fiscal 2017 (between November 2016 and the end of January 2017). The SGI deal marks another significant transaction for HPE, which has been spinning off some pieces and acquiring others as it narrows its focus. The biggest move was its split from its other half, now known as HP Inc., in 2015. The split created HP Inc., which owns the PC and printer business, and HPE, which owns the enterprise hardware, software, and services business. In May, HPE announced it would spin off its Enterprise Services business and merge that with another IT services outsourcing giant Computer Sciences Corp., more commonly known as CSC, creating a company worth $26 billion. More recently unconfirmed reports have surfaced about HPE taking itself private in a sale to private equity, or else selling off the software portion of its business. HPE's software assets include technology gained in acquisitions, such as those of Vertica Systems, Autonomy, and Mercury. HPE's software technologies include data analytics, cloud orchestration, and systems management. HPE has declined to confirm or comment on reports of these potential private equity deals. SGI's Journey SGI has 1,100 employees. It had revenues of $533 million in fiscal 2016. Like HPE, SGI has a long history in Silicon Valley. The company got its start in 1981 making 3D graphics computer workstations. It moved from being known mostly to those in the computer industry and into more mainstream fame as the company Steven Spielberg worked with to create the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. The collaboration continued after the film. Like HPE, Silicon Graphics aligned itself with Intel's Itanium processor -- the chipmaker's entry to compete with RISC-based processors that never caught up to RISC. SGI eventually rebranded itself from Silicon Graphics to SGI, and also rebranded itself as a supercomputer vendor. In 2009 it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and sold itself to Rackable Systems. Rackable, which sold computer hardware and software designed for data center deployment, recognized that SGI had a more recognizable brand, and took that name.

They need to have a filesystem that detects corruption, while regular RAID is good for the case where a disk gives read errors it doesn’t cover the case where a disk returns bad data and claims it to be good (which I’ve witnessed in BTRFS and ZFS systems). BTRFS is good for the case of a single disk or a RAID-1 array but I believe that the RAID-5 code for BTRFS is not sufficiently tested for business use. ZFS doesn’t perform very well due to the checksums on data and metadata requiring multiple writes for a single change which also causes more fragmentation. This isn’t a criticism of ZFS, it’s just an engineering trade-off for the data integrity features. ZFS supports read-caching on a SSD (the L2ARC) and write-back caching (ZIL). To get the best benefit of L2ARC and ZIL you need fast SSD storage. So now with my client investigating 10 gigabit Ethernet I have to investigate SSD. For some time SSDs have been in the same price range as hard drives, starting at prices well below $100. Now there are some SSDs on sale for as little as $50. One issue with SATA for server use is that SATA 3.0 (which was released in 2009 and is most commonly used nowadays) is limited to 600MB/s. That isn’t nearly adequate if you want to serve files over 10 gigabit Ethernet. SATA 3.2 was released in 2013 and supports 1969MB/s but I doubt that there’s much hardware supporting that. See the SATA Wikipedia page for more information. Another problem with SATA is getting the devices physically installed. My client has a new Dell server that has plenty of spare PCIe slots but no spare SATA connectors or SATA power connectors. I could have removed the DVD drive (as I did for some tests before deploying the server) but that’s ugly and only gives 1 device while you need 2 devices in a RAID-1 configuration for ZIL. M.2 M.2 is a new standard for expansion cards, it supports SATA and PCIe interfaces (and USB but that isn’t useful at this time). The wikipedia page for M.2 is interesting to read for background knowledge but isn’t helpful if you are about to buy hardware. The first M.2 card I bought had a SATA interface, then I was unable to find a local company that could sell a SATA M.2 host adapter. So I bought a M.2 to SATA adapter which made it work like a regular 2.5″ SATA device. That’s working well in one of my home PCs but isn’t what I wanted. Apparently systems that have a M.2 socket on the motherboard will usually take either SATA or NVMe devices. The most important thing I learned is to buy the SSD storage device and the host adapter from the same place then you are entitled to a refund if they don’t work together. The alternative to the SATA (AHCI) interface on an M.2 device is known as NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express), see the Wikipedia page for NVMe for details. NVMe not only gives a higher throughput but it gives more command queues and more commands per queue which should give significant performance benefits for a device with multiple banks of NVRAM. This is what you want for server use. Eventually I got a M.2 NVMe device and a PCIe card for it. A quick test showed sustained transfer speeds of around 1500MB/s which should permit saturating a 10 gigabit Ethernet link in some situations. One annoyance is that the M.2 devices have a different naming convention to regular hard drives. I have devices /dev/nvme0n1 and /dev/nvme1n1, apparently that is to support multiple storage devices on one NVMe interface. Partitions have device names like /dev/nvme0n1p1 and /dev/nvme0n1p2. Power Use I recently upgraded my Thinkpad T420 from a 320G hard drive to a 500G SSD which made it faster but also surprisingly quieter – you never realise how noisy hard drives are until they go away. My laptop seemed to feel cooler, but that might be my imagination. The i5-2520M CPU in my Thinkpad has a TDP of 35W but uses a lot less than that as I almost never have 4 cores in use. The z7k320 320G hard drive is listed as having 0.8W “low power idle” and 1.8W for read-write, maybe Linux wasn’t putting it in the “low power idle” mode. The Samsung 500G 850 EVO SSD is listed as taking 0.4W when idle and up to 3.5W when active (which would not be sustained for long on a laptop). If my CPU is taking an average of 10W then replacing the hard drive with a SSD might have reduced the power use of the non-screen part by 10%, but I doubt that I could notice such a small difference. I’ve read some articles about power use on the net which can be summarised as “SSDs can draw more power than laptop hard drives but if you do the same amount of work then the SSD will be idle most of the time and not use much power”. I wonder if the SSD being slightly thicker than the HDD it replaced has affected the airflow inside my Thinkpad. From reading some of the reviews it seems that there are M.2 storage devices drawing over 7W! That’s going to create some cooling issues on desktop PCs but should be OK in a server. For laptop use they will hopefully release M.2 devices designed for low power consumption. The Future M.2 is an ideal format for laptops due to being much smaller and lighter than 2.5″ SSDs. Spinning media doesn’t belong in a modern laptop and using a SATA SSD is an ugly hack when compared to M.2 support on the motherboard. Intel has released the X99 chipset with M.2 support (see the Wikipedia page for Intel X99) so it should be commonly available on desktops in the near future. For most desktop systems an M.2 device would provide all the storage that is needed (or 2*M.2 in a RAID-1 configuration for a workstation). That would give all the benefits of reduced noise and increased performance that regular SSDs provide, but with better performance and fewer cables inside the PC. For a corporate desktop PC I think the ideal design would have only M.2 internal storage and no support for 3.5″ disks or a DVD drive. That would allow a design that is much smaller than a current SFF PC. Related posts: Breaking SATA Connectors I’ve just broken my second SATA connector. This isn’t a...

But the PCIe M.2 SSDs do not (and also have the added benefit of just showing up under /dev like all other drives). There are some performance differences, NVMe are better but the PCIe ones are often easier to deal with. Drives * Samsung XP941 is a PCIe 2.0 x4 device * Samsung SM951 is a PCIe 3.0 x4 device * Samsung PM951 is a PCIe 3.0 x4 device * Intel DC S3500 is a PCIe 3.0 x4 device Adapters * http://www.mfactors.com/m2p4a-pcie-x4-to-m-2-ngff-ssd-adapter/ * http://www.mfactors.com/m-2-pcie-to-pcie-3-0-x4-adapter/ * http://www.mfactors.com/m2p4s-m-2-ngff-pcie-base-ssd-to-pcie-x4-adapter/ * http://addonics.com/products/adm2px4.php etbe August 14, 2016 at 19:36 taggart: I presume that you mean SATA when you talk about the ones that aren’t NVMe, as the SATA SSDs use UHCI and should be able to boot with any BIOS. As for booting Linux with older BIOS it’s not a problem as there are lots of other ways to boot. You could have a USB stick as /boot, server class motherboards typically have an internal USB socket on the motherboard for this purpose. You could have a boot loader on a CD-ROM that chain loads to the NVMe device. Making a NVMe device Windows C: is apparently a difficult task at this time. But there are people who report success.

A researcher showed methods for unlocking “high security” consumer electronic safes without leaving any evidence of the attack, Oracle’s payment system Micros (which is used at roughly 330,000 cash registers around the world) was hacked, and a Windows vulnerability served as a reminder of why putting backdoors in secure processes doesn’t make sense. WIRED reported on vulnerabilities in the keyless entry systems of roughly 100 million Volkswagens, open Internet advocates are petitioning to keep web access unfettered in Brazil, and hacking newswires to get embargoed press releases is actually a decent way to do insider trading. Oh, and a hardware vulnerability exposed 900 million Android devices. Casual. But there’s more: Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth at WIRED, but which deserve your attention nonetheless. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. Scope of the DNC Hack Is Larger Than Officials Originally Thought On top of breaching the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, investigators say that Russian hackers targeted and compromised personal email accounts and the accounts of other organizations related to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The evidence is strong enough that officials have been notifying people associated with the Clinton campaign that their email data may have been compromised. Information about who was actually hacked is trickling out slowly. For example, Democrats feared that the Democratic Governors’ Association had been breached, but so far the group says it doesn’t see evidence that its networks were affected. Law enforcement officials say they’re confident Russia was behind the attacks, but it’s still unclear whether Moscow was doing routine surveillance or actively looking to impact the US presidential election. Meanwhile, White House Weighs Imposing Sanctions on Russia Over DNC Hack White House officials are considering using economic sanctions against Russia as retaliation for the DNC hack. That action would require the US to definitively accuse Russia of orchestrating the attacks. So far investigators and lawmakers say they are very confident about the attribution, but the White House hasn’t made any such allegations. The move has some recent precedents: In January of last year, President Obama issued economic sanctions against North Korea in response to the Sony Pictures hack. Then in April of the same year, he signed an executive order expanding the government’s ability to impose sanctions against international hackers. The U.S. government tends to tolerate a certain amount of foreign espionage, given that the US itself participates in digital surveillance and information-gathering. In this case, however, White House may decide that it needs to respond, since the DNC breach involved a trove of information that was released publicly. On the other hand, the US already has sanctions in place against some Russian groups because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, and officials could decide it’s too problematic to strain the relationship further. Powerful ‘Project Sauron’ Malware Lurked Undetected for Five Years If that wasn’t enough state-sponsored hacking news for your week, researchers at Kaspersky Lab and Symantec reported that they’d discovered a previously unknown type of malware that’s so sophisticated it was most likely developed by state-sponsored hackers. Dubbed “Project Sauron” by Kaspersky Lab and “Remsec” by Symantec, the malware has been around since 2011 (if not earlier) and has now been identified on dozens of systems. And the program’s stealthy enough that it seems likely to have infected many more. Both groups of researchers say that the malware targets sensitive data on computers used by international government and military groups, financial organizations, and infrastructure companies like airlines and telecoms. Project Sauron has shown up in Russia, China, Sweden, Belgium, Iran, and Rwanda so far. It can even infect computers that aren’t and have never been connected to the Internet through USB drives. The malware hides on flash drives, undetectable by Windows and virus scanners, and then probably exploits a zero day vulnerability to infiltrate its targets. Project Sauron is aimed at collecting IP addresses, passwords, encryption keys and network details. It’s sophisticated enough that it was likely built by a group of specialists with millions of dollars in backing, which points to a nation state (or states) as the likely sponsor. Given Sauron’s targets, plenty of experts are pointing fingers at the NSA and American allies. Forum Data Breach Compromises 3,000 Login Credentials Including Those of Apple, Google, Samsung, Intel Employees Hackers accessed the login credentials of a popular developer forum, exposing 2,955 accounts, many of which are used by programmers from tech companies like Apple and Google. The data came from the Khronos Group, which runs a popular application programming interface for rendering graphics called OpenGL. The breach revealed usernames and passwords, but also email addresses and the IP address users were on when they signed up for their accounts. It could be a potentially problematic data trove in the hands of bad actors since so many of the accounts are for tech company employees who could have valuable access and privileges inside their companies’ networks.

First Click: How old is your computer? Friday, 5 August 2016 Yesterday my colleague Sam Byford beefed about Apple’s habit of selling outdated laptops and desktops, some of which haven’t had spec bumps in years despite the availability of faster components like CPUs and GPUs. That got me to wondering: how old is your primary laptop or desktop computer? There was a time that I would never consider using a laptop or desktop that was more than a few years old. I’m talking back in the days when Macs were used primarily as digital hubs in the home and workplace PCs needed new Intel or AMD processors just to keep pace with the latest versions of Windows and Office. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: FOX 47 News Michigan - on August 4, 2016< > Embed Old computer system causes election problems 02:13 Getting election results takes so long because the equipment many local communities use is outdated, but clerks can't buy new computers any time soon.

Highlights of its new wares included; 4th generation Vertical-NAND technology products, very high capacity SSDs, and the breakthrough performance on offer from its new Z-SSDs. 4th Generation V-NAND Samsung's 4th gen V-NAND stacks 64 layers of cell-arrays and uses TLC flash. Improved scaling, performance, and storage capacity is the result with Samsung saying that it can now offer 512Gb in a single die, and IO speeds of up to 800Mbps. Products packing 4th generation V-NAND flash will start to ship from Q4 this year. 32TB SAS 2.5-inch SSD Upping the data density stakes for enterprise storage, Samsung also showed off a 32TB SAS SSD in a 2.5-inch form factor. It claims this is the "World Largest Capacity Drive". However, earlier in the week we saw a 60TB SAS SSD from Seagate (using Micron V-NAND), albeit in a 3.5-inch form factor. Samsung says that its 32TB SAS SSD is based upon the previously outlined new 4th generation V-NAND 512Gb chips. To construct the drive, 512 of these are stacked in 16 layers to make a 1TB package, and 32 of these packages are installed in the 32TB SSD. These SSDs won't be rolling off production lines until next year. Samsung expects its 2.5-inch drives to offer over 100TB of storage by 2020 thanks to the continuing refinement of its V-NAND process. Z-SSD with breakthrough performance Forking its efforts in a different direction, Samsung has developed the Z-SSD. This is a high performance, ultra-low latency SSD solution. It is said to use the same fundamental tech as V-NAND but the memory is paired with "a unique circuit design and controller that can maximize performance". Headline performance increases are 1.6 times better sequential reading, and four times lower latency, than the Samsung PM963 NVMe SSD. Samsung's Z-SSD looks to be targeted at a similar market to Intel Optane and Micron QuantX SSDs, offering significantly better performance than NVMe SSDs, and even Phase-Change RAM solutions, thereby filling the storage performance gap between flash and DRAM. We don't have a lot of official info about the Z-SSDs but more should emerge as a 1TB Z-SSD drive launches later this year, followed by 2TB and 4TB Z-SSDs in 2017.

Usually even for home servers it makes no difference. It is certainly step ahead but our computers won't be able to use that. Obviously excluding massive virtualization solutions and data centres… Posted by chinf - Fri 12 Aug 2016 23:55 username2 IMO there is no difference especially for home users if you have average 500Mbps or new 1.5 times faster 800Mbps SSD drives.
