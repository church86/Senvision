Credit: Intel More like this How Intel plans to change servers as it breaks away from PCs Intel's megachips will take on Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs ARM pact will help Intel woo Apple into new chip deal Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles It seems like the chip war between Intel and ARM is slowly winding down, at least for the time being. Intel for decades has doggedly sworn by chips based on its homegrown x86 architecture, but the company is putting a 64-bit ARM processor in its new Stratix 10 FPGA (field-programmable gate array), which was announced on Tuesday. The FPGA -- based on Altera technology -- can be reprogrammed to do a wide variety of server or network tasks. It can also run algorithms for machine learning. In a larger context, the chip points to a long-term strategy of Intel thinking beyond x86 and warming up to other architectures as it looks to shed its reliance on PCs. In the future, it's possible that x86 and ARM could be integrated in some Intel's chips. Intel plans to integrate Altera FPGAs in Xeon server chips and may put x86 and ARM CPUs on one chip. Intel is already pairing Xeon and Altera FPGAs on multi-chip circuit boards. ARM CPUs have been used in Altera FPGAs, but the Cortex-A53 in Stratix 10 shows Intel isn't shying away from the latest ARM technology. There's also the possibility of Intel eliminating the ARM CPU for x86 in its integrated Xeon FPGA chip. Intel and ARM have feuded in the past on architectural superiority, sometimes indulging in petty arguments over power and performance. Intel wants to put its x86 chips in as many devices as possible, but it is willing to tap into ARM CPU designs when necessary. A sequence of events has led to a friendlier relationship between Intel and ARM. Facing a slowdown in the PC market, Intel in April restructured to focus on robots, drones, cars, and the internet of things. Most PCs use x86 chips, but ARM dominates many of the fast-growing markets Intel is now focusing on. ARM is also helping drive Intel's lucrative server business. ARM-based mobile and IoT devices feed information to servers that perform data analysis, image recognition, and natural language processing tasks. Intel's x86 chips dominate servers, and the growth in ARM-based devices will indirectly drive sales of high-margin Intel Xeon chips.  Intel can now manufacture ARM chips following a licensing deal both the companies signed in August. Intel will make chips for LG's mobile devices on its 10-nanometer process and could even make chips for Apple's iPhone. Intel previously dedicated its factories mostly to x86 chips, but the PC market slowdown is forcing the chipmaker to take on contract manufacturing. Intel has used ARM designs sparingly. Intel previously made mobile phone chips and networking equipment based on ARM but sold that business to Marvell in 2006. Intel put ARM's Mali graphics in an x86 Atom X3 chip code-named Sofia, which was originally designed for smartphones but is now in IoT devices. Intel also used ARM processors in an XMM modem but is switching over to x86. One of the big areas of focus for Intel is FPGAs, which provide a high-speed chip alternative to its CPUs. The quad-core 64-bit Cortex-A53 CPU in Stratix 10 is faster than previous chips, Intel said.

Intel has begun sampling its Stratix 10 programmable chips, which the company expects to use as accelerators in data center environments running compute- and data-intensive applications. In a blog post Oct. 4, Dan McNamara, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, wrote that company engineers were able to combine the chip maker's 14-nanometer tri-gate manufacturing process with its HyperFlex fabric architecture to develop a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) that will address the growing demands from end users for more performance and power efficiency as they try to manage the proliferation of smart, connected devices and the huge amounts of data they're producing. Intel is aiming the Stratix 10 FGPAs at such workloads as data center applications, cloud computing, radar and imaging systems, and network infrastructure, McNamara wrote. "We live in a smart and connected world where billions of devices are creating massive amounts of data that must be collected, rapidly processed and analyzed, and available from anywhere," he wrote, adding that Intel and the Stratix 10 will enable "service providers, data centers, cloud computing and storage systems to satisfy their insatiable demand for higher computational capabilities, lower latency, greater system flexibility and increased power efficiencies." With Stratix 10, Intel is delivering twice the performance and more than five times the density when compared to the previous generation of FPGAs, and up to 70 percent lower power than Stratix V FPGAs while providing equivalent performance. There also is up to 10 teraflops of single-precision floating point performance, up to 1TB memory bandwidth that includes integrated High-Bandwidth Memory, and an embedded quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 chip. FPGAs are among a widening group of accelerators used to help speed up the performance of large-scale systems while keeping a lid on power consumption. Accelerators—particularly GPUs from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and x86 Xeon Phi co-processors from Intel—have been used in high-performance computing (HPC) and supercomputing environments. However, with the growth in the number of connected devices and the accompanying data, the rise of cloud computing and the internet of things (IoT), and the increasing amount of video in network traffic, the use of accelerators is expanding. Intel officials have said they expect FPGAs to be used in as many as 30 percent of all data center servers by 2020. Intel inherited the Stratix FPGA technology when it bought Altera last year for $16.7 billion. Altera and Xilinx have been the primary vendors behind the development of FPGAs, which have the added benefit of being able to be reprogrammed for different workloads. Intel began shipping Xeon server chips with Arria 10 FPGA accelerators earlier this year. Along with FPGAs and the Xeon Phi co-processors, Intel officials are looking to increase the number of accelerator options by working with eASIC to bring application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to custom Xeons to be used in enterprise data centers and cloud environments for such workloads as data analytics and security. Intel was a partner of Altera's before buying the company. Intel is not the only chip maker turning to FPGAs. Xilinx has been partnering with such vendors as Qualcomm—which is developing ARM-based systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) aimed at servers—and IBM, which is using Xilinx's FPGAs in Power systems for such workloads as data analytics, machine learning, network-functions virtualization (NFV), HPC and genomics.           LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference Dell EMC Brings PowerEdge Servers to VxRail, VxRack                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Oct 4, 2016 at 12:20PM Image Source: Getty Images. With Autumn now in full swing, another earnings season is right around the corner. October will feature quarterly reports from some of the largest, most important companies on the planet, as well as from an abundance of smaller companies. There will be no shortage of data this month for investors to chew on. Of all the companies getting ready to report earnings, five stand out. Here's a brief look at what investors can expect from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Apple Following two quarters of declining iPhone sales, the iPhone 7 launch in September has the potential to give Apple a much-needed boost. Apple declined to disclose sales figures for the launch weekend, as it has done for each previous iPhone launch, but strong pre-order numbers from T-Mobile and Sprint have raised hopes that the iPhone 7 will return the company to growth. Apple will report its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 27. With the quarter ending just a few weeks after the launch of the iPhone 7, and with the ever-important holiday season ahead, Apple's results won't give investors the full picture. Guidance for the first fiscal quarter will be closely watched: If Apple fails to predict growth, the stock's recent run will almost certainly come to an end. Wells Fargo At this point, it's unclear exactly what kind of damage the ongoing fake account scandal at Wells Fargo will cause. The bank's intense focus on cross-selling products led to fraud that could hurt its reputation for years to come. Already, both California and Illinois have suspended some of its business with Wells Fargo,, and that may end up being just the tip of the iceberg. Wells Fargo will report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Oct. 14. Investors will be looking for answers, and with pressure on CEO John Stumpf to resign following two blistering congressional hearings, an executive shakeup could be in the cards. The company may not go into much detail regarding its outlook, but investors will be expecting a plan. Whether Wells Fargo can continue to be one of the best performing big banks following this scandal remains to be seen. Intel Chip-giant Intel will report its third-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 18. The stock is sitting near decade highs, with continued data-center growth and an improving market for PCs boosting the stock in recent months. Intel raised its third-quarter guidance in September, boosting its revenue outlook by $700 million, driven by replenishment of PC supply-chain inventory and improving PC demand. News that Intel was supplying modems for a portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones no doubt contributed to the stock's recent performance. Advanced Micro Devices will make an attempt to claw back share in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets next year with its upcoming Zen processors, but Intel remains the overwhelming leader for the time being. The PC market is still slumping, with IDC reporting a 4.5% year-over-year unit shipment decline during the second quarter. That decline, however, was smaller than expected, raising hopes that the market could stabilize sooner rather than later, an event that would be a boon for Intel. General Motors Following a strong September, General Motors has gained U.S retail market share in 15 of the past 18 months. With the stock trading at barely more than five times General Motors' guidance for full-year adjusted earnings, the market is betting that plateauing demand for vehicles in the U.S. will devastate the company's bottom line. General Motors has yet to show any signs that this will be the case. General Motors will report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Oct. 25. The company has beaten analyst estimates across the board for four quarters in a row. With analysts expecting a small drop in earnings during the third quarter, General Motors may have yet another surprise up its sleeve. Investors should also be on the lookout for more details on the upcoming launch of the Chevy Bolt, General Motors' affordable electric car. With a range of more than 200 miles and a price tag below $30,000 after incentives, the Bolt is proof that General Motors still knows how to innovate. Netflix Streaming-giant Netflix gave investors quite the scare in July. The company added just 1.68 million subscribers globally, down from 3.28 million during the prior-year period. The company's guidance was also nothing to write home about, with 2.3 million subscribers expected to be added during the third quarter, down from 3.62 million during the third quarter of 2015. Netflix will report its third-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 17. Netflix has spent heavily expanding into international markets in recent years, and the company's bottom line has nearly disappeared as a result. But with that expansion now complete, Netflix will need to produce both robust subscriber growth and improving profitability going forward in order to justify its optimistic valuation. Another disappointment could send the stock tumbling. Timothy Green owns shares of General Motors. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple, Netflix, and Wells Fargo.

Wells Fargo At this point, it's unclear exactly what kind of damage the ongoing fake account scandal at Wells Fargo will cause. The bank's intense focus on cross-selling products led to fraud that could hurt its reputation for years to come. Already, both California and Illinois have suspended some of its business with Wells Fargo,, and that may end up being just the tip of the iceberg. Wells Fargo will report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Oct. 14. Investors will be looking for answers, and with pressure on CEO John Stumpf to resign following two blistering congressional hearings, an executive shakeup could be in the cards. The company may not go into much detail regarding its outlook, but investors will be expecting a plan. Whether Wells Fargo can continue to be one of the best performing big banks following this scandal remains to be seen. Intel Chip-giant Intel will report its third-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 18. The stock is sitting near decade highs, with continued data-center growth and an improving market for PCs boosting the stock in recent months. Intel raised its third-quarter guidance in September, boosting its revenue outlook by $700 million, driven by replenishment of PC supply-chain inventory and improving PC demand. News that Intel was supplying modems for a portion of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones no doubt contributed to the stock's recent performance. Advanced Micro Devices will make an attempt to claw back share in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets next year with its upcoming Zen processors, but Intel remains the overwhelming leader for the time being. The PC market is still slumping, with IDC reporting a 4.5% year-over-year unit shipment decline during the second quarter. That decline, however, was smaller than expected, raising hopes that the market could stabilize sooner rather than later, an event that would be a boon for Intel. General Motors Following a strong September, General Motors has gained U.S retail market share in 15 of the past 18 months. With the stock trading at barely more than five times General Motors' guidance for full-year adjusted earnings, the market is betting that plateauing demand for vehicles in the U.S. will devastate the company's bottom line. General Motors has yet to show any signs that this will be the case. General Motors will report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Oct. 25. The company has beaten analyst estimates across the board for four quarters in a row. With analysts expecting a small drop in earnings during the third quarter, General Motors may have yet another surprise up its sleeve. Investors should also be on the lookout for more details on the upcoming launch of the Chevy Bolt, General Motors' affordable electric car. With a range of more than 200 miles and a price tag below $30,000 after incentives, the Bolt is proof that General Motors still knows how to innovate. Netflix Streaming-giant Netflix gave investors quite the scare in July. The company added just 1.68 million subscribers globally, down from 3.28 million during the prior-year period. The company's guidance was also nothing to write home about, with 2.3 million subscribers expected to be added during the third quarter, down from 3.62 million during the third quarter of 2015. Netflix will report its third-quarter results after the market close on Oct. 17. Netflix has spent heavily expanding into international markets in recent years, and the company's bottom line has nearly disappeared as a result. But with that expansion now complete, Netflix will need to produce both robust subscriber growth and improving profitability going forward in order to justify its optimistic valuation. Another disappointment could send the stock tumbling. Timothy Green owns shares of General Motors. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple, Netflix, and Wells Fargo.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's new computer can serve as the brains of robots Intel's new hardware kits make it easier to build robots and drones Intel's build-from-scratch drone kits to take off next month Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Want to build a drone at home? Intel is shipping its Aero Compute Board so you can get your unmanned aerial vehicle in the sky. The Aero Compute Board is priced at $399 and is available on Intel's website. It's a complete drone board system in one unit, but you have to buy certain hardware, like rotor blades, separately. Intel has also started selling its new Robotics Development Kit for $249. The board is meant to be the guts of a robot, providing direction, navigation, decision-making and other capabilities. You can build robots at home with this developer kit. The PC market isn't as hot as it used to be, so Intel is getting into new businesses and providing hardware to build drones, robots, smart gadgets and wearables. The boards are for hobbyists, and could be used to develop and test products. Other drone kits in the market include the Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight, and Nvidia's Jetson TK1, which are both priced at $599. Parrot is planning a developer kit called S.L.A.M.dunk, but a shipment date isn't yet available. Otherwise, you can make robots with developer boards like Raspberry Pi. Drones and robots have already dazzled audiences at Intel keynotes. The company has also flown 100 drones above Sydney Harbor, and showed off something similar outside Palm Springs, Calif., earlier this year. A unique feature that sets Intel's new boards apart is the RealSense 3D camera, which provides computer vision to drones and robots. The camera can identify objects, measure distances and avoid obstacles. It is key to helping drones and robots navigate. The Aero Compute Board has LTE, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a flight controller.  The board uses Airmap SDKs for low-altitude flight management of drones. It has a quad-core Atom X7-Z8700 CPU code-named Cherry Trail, which is also used in the Surface 3. It has 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB of flash storage, a micro-SD slot, a micro-HDMI port, and a wide set of connectors for adapters and breakout boards. One surprise is an Altera Max 10 FPGA, which can reprogrammed to deal with multiple input and output mechanisms. The board will be compatible with Linux. Intel also plans to release a "ready-to-fly" drone kit complete with the board, rotors, remote control and other hardware. The kit was announced at Intel Developer Forum in June, but isn't yet on sale. A shipment date isn't available yet. The Robotics Development Kit has an Atom x5-Z8350 chip and integrated graphics. It has 32GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, an HDMI port, a gigabit ethernet slot, four USB 2.0 ports and one USB 3.0 port. It has an Altera Max V FPGA to interface with external devices. The board will be compatible with Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04. Intel has a smaller computer for robots coming called Euclid, which is essentially a full computer inside a RealSense 3D webcam. It is like having a full computer lodged in the eyes of the robot. It has fewer interfaces, but its small size makes it more feasible to develop actual robotics products.

(GMS) today unveiled powerful new features that significantly boost the S2U "King Cobra" rugged server's capabilities on the battlefield while lowering price. The enhanced S2U server includes dual Intel® Xeon®E5-2600v4 family CPUs, 48TB of ultra-fast storage, integrated Cisco® industrial-strength Embedded Services Router, 20 ports of managed Gigabit Ethernet switch with POE+, up to 1024GB (1TB) of system DDR4 RAM, and an Auxiliary Power Unit(APU) that powers the system and provides backup power for up to 15 minutes for graceful shut-down or suspend-to disk. All of this is engineered into a dense, modular, 2U short-rack (17-inch deep) configuration that packs more functionality in a field-ready size than anything else on the market, at a fraction of the cost of competing systems. Unlike typical embedded servers, which must be replaced in their entirety in the field, the S2U is the industry's only rugged server that is 100 percent subsystem line replacement unit (LRU) capable, allowing any function of the system to be replaced in the field within seconds, for ultimate flexibility and minimal downtime. The new S2U features dual server processors with Intel's latest 14-core Xeon® E5-2658v4 (Broadwell-EP) and ultra-fast DDR4 RAM. Taking advantage of GMS' state-of-the-art, patent-pending packaging and patented RuggedCoolSM (http://www.gms4sbc.com/technologies/cooling) cooling design, these high-performance processors can run at their full rated speed without the need for throttling to maintain reliability. With up to 1024GB of total system DDR4 RAM with error-correction code (ECC), the S2U can run 56 virtual machines with access via the four 10/40 Gigabit and 24 1-Gigabit Ethernet ports. Highest-Performance for Demanding Applications For defense, avionics, data centers, and mobile applications that demand multiple, high-performance networks but can't afford the space and weight of traditional COTS equipment, the S2U is a one-of-a-kind server and router/switch, mass storage, and APU all in a single rugged box. Designed from the ground-up for harsh environments and space-constrained use, the S2U is ideal for applications such as Tactical Operations Centers (TOC), tent-based forward command centers, UAV/UAS control centers, and in-vehicle SIPR/NIPR (red/black) or battlefield networks. "The S2U King Cobra is a breakthrough in server technology," said Sharfi. "For the first time in the server market, the S2U integrates the reliability and upgradability of blade servers such as ATCA as used in large data centers, with the cost effectiveness and COTS utilization of rack-mount PC servers. No server ever has put all the functionality required such as router, managed switch, APU, mass storage, PCIe, and OpenVPX expansion sites in one 2U, 17-inch deep rack-mount or freestanding system." Designed To Survive, Engineered To Serve • No foreign-sourced, commercial motherboards, switches, or power supplies used. The S2U uses the battlefield-proven OpenVPX standard for the CPU board, COM (Ethernet/router) board, and N+1 hot-swappable 600W power supplies. • Most versatile system with more I/O than any other server or workstation. CPU board supports an XMC module, three ExpressMini modules, 12 drive bays or 24 ExpressMini/M.2 modules, and three 3U OpenVPX modules; four full-length PCIe modules can be added for additional functionality. • Customizable, hot-swappable, front-panel drive bays. Supports 12 front-panel drive bays with SAS/SATA and new ultra-fast and reliable PCIe (NVMe) drives, including hot-swap and RAID-control (if desired) by either a RAID controller in the PCIe cage or via the CPU board using Intel's enterprise-class RSTe. S2U Demos at AUSA Booth #7549 GMS will be demonstrating the new S2U features in booth #7549 at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) (http://www.gms4sbc.com/ausa) Meeting, October 3-5, 2016 in Washington, DC. Base price for S2U with dual CPU, 128GB RAM, and 500W power supply is under $10,000.

So where were all the Canadian venture capital funds? Oct 4, 2016 Catherine McIntyre   The Myo arm band, Thalmic Labs’ first product. (Thalmic Labs) Thalmic Labs announced recently that it raised a whopping $158 million in funding, a deal that’s being touted as one of the biggest venture capital investment in Canadian history—second only to Hootsuite’s $171 million in 2013. But Canadian VC firms were largely absent from the round, which was led by Intel Capital. Although the country’s venture capital ecosystem is slowly improving (Canadian firms invested $2.3 billion in 2015, compared with $1.9 billion in 2013), VCs are still not equipped to participate in blockbuster deals. Thalmic Labs CEO Stephen Lake on mainstreaming wearables “The short answer to why there weren’t more [Canadian investors] is: There are no VCs that can write a cheque this size,” says Stephen Lake, Thalmic co-founder and CEO. “We don’t really have anyone of that scale in Canada.” After Intel, the Amazon Alexa Fund and Fidelity Investments Canada (a mutual fund company, not a VC) were the biggest investors. iNovia Capital in Montreal was the only Canadian VC to contribute funding, along with a handful of other small Canadian investors whose contributions accounted for a tiny portion of the overall fund. It’s little wonder deep-pocketed investors were willing to make big bets on Thalmic Labs, a wearable tech company and one of Canada’s startup darlings. The four-year-old firm got its start at Y Combinator, the prestigious Silicon Valley accelerator, where its Myo arm band—which lets users control any mobile device by measuring electrical signals triggered by the muscle movements associated with certain hand gestures—won praise and attention. Following the program, the company secured $14.5 million in Series A funding to commercialize the Myo. Today, the device is used to assist surgery, control prosthetic limbs and play video games, among other applications. When it came time to raise another round, Lake says Thalmic, based in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont., did approach Canadian venture capital investors. “In the end, the one Canadian VC who was large enough to potentially participate substantially had previously decided the company was not a fit for them and had passed on investing.” (Lake declined to name the firm.) In fact, the largest VC companies in Canada control between $500 million and $600 million in assets, while the top American VCs have upwards of US$4 billion to invest. “The largest venture investors we have are writing maybe $10- to $20-million cheques at the high end,” says Lake. “For a $120-million round, you can imagine the large investors were significantly bigger than that.” While Lake suggests that OMERS Ventures (which contributed $20 million to Hootsuite in 2013) could have participated in Thalmic’s latest round, he adds that “even for them, this would probably be too large, given their fund size.” For Georgian Partners, another prominent Canadian VC firm (it has backed the likes of Shopify and FreshBooks), the nature of the Thalmic deal simply wasn’t in their wheelhouse. “We invest in enterprise software companies…while Thalmic Labs is a maker of a sophisticated hardware device,” explains Jane Podbelskaya, senior associate at Georgian Partners. How Tony Lacavera is helping Canadian startups cross the "Valley of Death" Canadian startups are enjoying more and bigger venture capital deals (in the first quarter of 2016, venture capital investments reached $838 million, nearly double what they were for the same period the year before), but the VC community, lacking size and versatility, is not keeping pace with their funding needs. Anthony Lacavera, the founder of Wind Mobile turned VC investor, told Canadian Business earlier this year that the situation means entrepreneurs sell out prematurely or get wooed across the border by U.S. investors. “We’re actually gift-wrapping investment opportunities for these people,” he said. “I think it’s a shame that Canadian VCs are left out of deals like this,” says John Albright, co-founder and managing partner at Relay Ventures. “Thalmic is an incredible company, and it’s a romantic idea to be part of it.” Still, he’s not convinced the source of funds is ultimately that important. Sean Wise, assistant professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at Ryerson University, agrees. “So long as the company stays Canadian, it doesn’t matter where the funding comes from,” he says. For Lake, selecting an investor with appropriate expertise is more important than nationality. “The number one priority is finding the right partner that’s going to help us be successful,” he says. Intel, a long-standing Thalmic investor, for example, carries brand recognition useful for the company’s global expansion plans. Meanwhile, the Alexa Fund, which supports voice technology innovation, offers a subtle hint at Thalmic’s next product. “There’s no specific partnerships we’re announcing right now with Amazon,” says Lake, “but we’re certainly excited to work with them and figure out how we can bring Alexa into wearables.” “Ultimately,” Lake continues, “it’s a net benefit when you see venture deals happen with major Canadian companies and major U.S. investors. It’s blowing capital into the community here while also establishing ties and partnerships to the U.S. and to Silicon Valley, in particular.” Axiom Zen is building a startup that builds startups MORE ABOUT VENTURE CAPITAL, STARTUPS & TECHNOLOGY: Thalmic Labs CEO Stephen Lake on bringing wearable tech to the mainstream How Tony Lacavera is helping Canadian startups cross the “Valley of Death” Axiom Zen is building a startup that builds startups Nearly half the jobs in Canada are at “high risk” of automation How MBA schools are pushing students to build up their data literacy skills Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke on how to maintain a startup culture at scale How Stratford, Ontario, is luring global startups with its smart-city plan How Canada’s immigration policy is failing high-tech startups Fintech firms are battling banks—and the banks are winning The smartest startups invest in their sales team early and often Venture capital funding is rushing into machine learning startups Why Canada’s tech startups need to prepare for a funding slowdown After years in the slow lane, Canada’s e-commerce ecosystem is booming Is Canada finally developing a sustainable startup ecosystem?

Intel Rolls Out 19.0.1607 and 19.10.1635 Bluetooth Drivers - Download Now The files are compatible with Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 OSes Oct 4, 2016 08:02 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Intel has rolled out two new Wireless Bluetooth versions targeted at several of its adapters, namely the 19.0.1607 driver compatible with Windows 7 and the 19.10.1635 update suitable for Windows 8.1 and 10 operating systems, either 32- or 64-bit architectures. In terms of supported components, the available files can be used on system configurations that include one of Intel’s Wireless-AC 17265 and 18260 Tri-Band adapters, or a Wireless-AC 3160, 3165, 3168, 7265, 8260, or 8265 Dual Band controller. Moreover, Intel’s update can also be used along with its Wireless-N 7260 and 7265, Dual Band Wireless-N 7260, and Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 (for Desktop) devices. However, bear in mind that the producer’s Wireless-AC 8260 and 8265 dual band, as well as its Wireless-AC 18260 Tri-Band products, aren’t compatible with the 32-bit architectures of Windows 8.1 and 10 platforms. With this in mind, if you intend to apply these releases, first of all save the appropriate package for your system OS and bit variant, run it and wait for all required files to be extracted, follow all instructions, and perform a reboot once completed.

Might Be Working on an ARM-Based Mac It's not just a rumor anymore. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 3, 2016 at 7:47PM The A10 Fusion is truly a desktop-class chip. Image source: Apple. Speculation has persisted for half a decade that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be working on an ARM-based Mac, which in turn suggests that Apple could slowly transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as its processor supplier. From vague executive comments to rumors of ARM-based prototype Macs, there have been many different types of leaks and evidence that an ARM-based Mac will one day be a reality. We're now getting even more evidence that such a device is in the pipeline. A storm is brewing In the latest version of macOS Sierra 10.12 that Apple just released to the public, the Mac maker quietly added support for ARM-based chip architectures within the operation system kernel. Specifically, there was indication for supporting a "Hurricane" chip family. This may be a reference to a custom Apple A chip, as prior generations were codenamed Cyclone (A7), Typhoon (A8), and Twister (A9). The new A10 Fusion chip's internal code name has not been discovered quite yet, so it's possible that Hurricane refers to the A10 Fusion. It's worth pointing out that the A10 Fusion chip found inside the iPhone 7 is theoretically faster than all of the MacBook Airs (which run on Intel chips), according to the popular Geekbench benchmark. The new quad-core processor is even comparable to some MacBook Pros from 2013. While the scores aren't 100% comparable due to a variety of factors, the point still stands that Apple's chip team has made incredible progress and the A10 Fusion is a monster of a chip. It then stands to reason that if Apple really wanted to, it could conceivably design a chip that could satisfy low-end performance requirements like what the MacBook or MacBook Air need. Keep in mind that the A10 Fusion's performance is limited by physical and thermal constraints, since we're talking about a smartphone processor. A more appropriate candidate would be something like an A10X Fusion, which is rumored to power the 2017 iPad Pro. The X variants offer higher performance, often including additional graphics cores, and don't face the same types of limitations. Imagine what Apple could do if it was designing a chip for a laptop form factor. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em There's another distinct possibility here. It just so happens that Intel announced in August that it reached a licensing agreement with ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) to manufacture ARM-based chips at its foundries. That was a landmark deal that downplayed the long-standing competition between ARM-based chipmakers and Intel, underscoring that there's more to gain by collaborating. Intel may now produce ARM-based chips for both Apple and Qualcomm, opening up a massive portion of the mobile market that Intel's foundry strategy can address. Taking this a step further, it's not inconceivable that Apple could collaborate with Intel on designing some world-class ARM-based processors for both iOS and macOS devices in the future. Apple's A chips may not be able to compete with Intel at the high end of the spectrum, but Apple could conceivably start at the low end with Apple-designed, Intel-produced chips.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Best Buy Lists 27-inch iMac With Intel’s Kaby Lake Processor By Tyler Lee on 10/03/2016 16:49 PST It has been a while since the iMac has been refreshed. To be more specific it has nearly been a year since the last refresh, which means that it is possible that Apple could be announcing something soon, but could Best Buy have accidentally revealed what Apple has in store for the iMac refresh? Spotted on Best Buy’s website is a 27-inch iMac that is advertised as having an Intel Kaby Lake processor. Given that this Intel’s latest processor, it makes sense for Apple to include it in the refresh. However as pointed out by AppleInsider, there are some details that makes this listing a bit suspect. For example the price listed is $3,200, which makes it more expensive than the current iMacs with the same configuration which is priced at $3,150 on Apple’s website. It also lists its GPU as being the AMD Radeon R9 M380, which is odd since the current iMac features an AMD Radeon R9 M395, so obviously it doesn’t make sense for Apple to move backwards. In any case it is possible that maybe Best Buy is just using placeholder specs for its listing, hence the discrepancies. Apple is also rumored to be announcing new MacBook Pros later this month so perhaps we might get some iMac news as well, so stay tuned and check back with us at a later date for the details, if there any to be had.

And, you don’t have to read a thick manual or be ashamed to use the device.   This is the way wearable tech should always be, designed to enhance not only your capability but your appearance, be easy to use, and become something you are proud – rather than embarrassed – to wear.  The Oakley Radar Pace Like all things Oakley, Radar Pace are not only attractive glasses, they are really expensive glasses coming in at around $450.  The glasses contain Intel Real Speech, Bluetooth connectivity, internal sensors, and they are water resistant.   Intel Real Speech is a new conversational user interface that allows you to talk to the device and have it talk back to you.  Increasingly this will be the way we interact with devices and this apparently is what comes after products like Amazon Echo.   The internal sensors are accelerometer, gyroscope, pressure, humidity and proximity sensors.  These will tell the glasses just how hard you are working out, how fast you are going on your bike or snow skis, or how hard you are running.  This will enable the coach – either remote or digital – to keep track of your progress and provide timely and relevant advice.                      Image via Bigstock TOME Fashion Week The other products that showcased this week were largely from TOME.  Perhaps the most interesting was an attractive handbag, which could measure ambient temperature, barometric pressure, and toxic gasses.  I’m going to avoid the obvious function – to identify the person in an elevator who broke wind – and focus on the part where it could alert you to major changes in the weather in time to dig out an umbrella or run for some kind of cover.  Another TOME product was a leather bracelet that looks nothing like a typical digital exercise band yet has similar functionality.  This is very much like the new trend to make smartwatches actually look like watches because, as Apple found out, most folks apparently don’t want to wear an iPod Mini on their wrists no matter how capable it is.   Finally, they partnered with Baja East and Fila on connected shoes, which are likely a better place to put most excursive sensors than your wrist is.  For instance, when I’m using my Fitbit I find that when using a stationary bike or treadmill it works better stuffed in my sock than on my wrist because I don’t move my arms much.  Wrapping Up:  A Taste of What’s to Come I think this is just the beginning. While we haven’t yet figured out how to put tech into clothing that can be washed, this idea of concealing the tech behind designs as opposed to exposing it seems vastly more sustainable.  People, in general, at least for now, want solutions that are invisible and attractive; not really obvious and ugly and, of course, they want it to be both easy to use and easy to learn.  This next generation showcasing Intel’s Curie platform looks to be far closer to what the market is looking for than the stuff that has come before.  As a result, you will likely find a smartwatch, handbag, pair of shoes, or handbag that isn’t just helpful but also something that you can be proud to wear or carry.  Now that’s progress I can get behind.   However, we will need to make sure this stuff increasingly interoperates and doesn’t all try to talk at once.  I can imagine hell being a near constant argument or power play between all of your worn technical gear that could drift from just annoying all the way to intolerable pretty quickly.  Intel has made great progress in coverage now they need to drive interoperability to insure we aren’t driven insane by our warring wearable technology.    Edited by Maurice Nagle Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Virtual vs. Real: Both Count When Selling By: Doug Mohney    11/16/2016 People have been predicting the end of "real" interaction to buy things for decades.

Intel Core i5 vs. Core i7: Which processor should you buy? By Joel Hruska on September 27, 2016 at 11:26 am Comment Whether you’re building your next PC or shopping for a new computer online, one of the questions that comes up from time to time is whether the Intel Core i5 or Core i7 is a better bargain. The short answer, “It depends,” isn’t all that helpful, so we’ve broken the data out in more detail and for both mobile and desktop processors. Here’s what you need to know. Desktop Core i5 vs. Desktop Core i7 Intel’s Skylake (6th generation) differentiation and feature sets haven’t really changed much since Haswell (4th generation). The Core i7 features quad-cores with Hyper-Threading enabled and Intel’s HD Graphics 530 solution. The Core i5 family offers quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, and either HD Graphics 530 or 510 GPUs. Most people, including gamers, should be fine with a Core i5 desktop CPU. Core i7 chips tend to help more with engineering, video editing, audio post-production, and other tasks that require as many processor threads as possible. For graphics, the HD Graphics 510 has 12 execution units (EUs), while the 530 has 24. Avoid the 510 in any case where you intend to do anything substantial with the GPU. But the long-standing rule of thumb remains true: No Intel chip is particularly strong in the graphics department, apart from the EDRAM-equipped Iris Pro variants (none of which exist in socketed consumer hardware). Enthusiast gamers should always opt for a discrete GPU. One significant difference between the desktop and mobile markets (the latter of which we’ll get to below) is how Intel positions Hyper-Threading. Almost all of  Intel’s desktop Core i5 chips across the last six desktop product generations are all quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, while its Core i7 family consists of quad-cores with Hyper-Threading. (Intel’s Core i5-4570T is the single exception to this — it’s a dual-core + Hyper-Threading chip.) Older Core i5 / Core i7 chips top out at 32GB of RAM, but Skylake raises this to 64GB for both types of processor. What about desktop PC performance? To compare performance between the Core i5 and Core i7 families, I turned to Anandtech’s excellent CPU Bench database. While AT doesn’t have records on every chip released by Intel or AMD, they’ve got a solid selection of comparable parts. I opted to check the Core i5-4690K versus the Core i7-4770K. The 4770K has Hyper-Threading, a base frequency of 3.5GHz, can Turbo up to 3.9GHz, and has 8MB of L3 cache. The Core i5-4690K has the same clock speed, but no Hyper-Threading and just 6MB of L3 cache. That’s about as perfect a match-up as you can ask for. The graph below was generated by comparing Core i5 and Core i7 in each and every benchmark and taking the geometric mean of the results. This diminishes the impact of outliers, though in this case, the arithmetic and geometric means are quite close to each other. I’ve split the data into three sections — general compute, gaming performance with 1x GTX 770, and gaming performance with the GTX 770 in SLI. Aggregate performance between the Core i5-4690K and Core i7-4770K. Data from Anandtech CPU bench There are some differences in the data sets that we need to discuss. The aggregate General Purpose ratio doesn’t reflect the impact Hyper-Threading can have on various applications. There are a number of applications where Hyper-Threading makes no difference, a handful where it decreases performance (though never by more than 8 percent) and a several benchmarks that show gains of 10-30%. If we set a 3% threshold for a tying score, Hyper-Threading gives the Core i7 a win in 21 out of 36 tests. It ties the Core i5 in 14 tests, and loses to it outright in just a single benchmark (x264). In workstation and consumer CPU workloads, Hyper-Threading sometimes helps a lot, sometimes doesn’t help much, but almost never hurts. Gaming, however, is a different animal. In gaming, Hyper-Threading never offers a single performance boost, while it impacted BioShock Infinite’s minimum FPS by 11% (meaning the Core i5 outscored the i7). The net effect is a 2% performance decrease for Hyper-Threading. In SLI gaming, we see a similar pattern, though this time it’s different games that take performance hits. The minimum frame rate for Sleeping Dogs was 10% faster on the Core i5 (56 vs. 61.8) and 5% faster in BF4 (86.4 vs. 82.9). What this means, in aggregate, is that while Hyper-Threading probably doesn’t hurt gaming in most titles, you can’t depend on it to offer a significant performance boost, either. While the above comparison uses older data from Haswell, there’s nothing about Skylake or Broadwell that changed the Core i5 / i7 comparison point. You can assume that the same metrics hold true for these chips as well — namely, that the Core i5 offers an equivalent level of performance. What about AMD? AMD isn’t a formal part of this article, but since I know people will ask, I took a look at how the FX-9590 compares against the Core i5-4690K. The news is not particularly good. There are a few well-threaded benchmarks where AMD can shine, including WinRAR, x265 encoding, multi-threaded Cinebench (both 11.5 and R15) and 7zip. The FX-9590 is utterly incapable of matching the 4690K’s single-threaded performance, which means AMD loses every test that can’t scale to eight cores or is single-threaded to start with. The gap between AMD and Intel in game benchmarks is much smaller than in general CPU performance. AMD’s FX-8350 and FX-9590 are capable of pushing perfectly acceptable frame rates. But the FX-9590 never outclasses the Core i5-4690K in any test. If you’re building a gaming box and you want to go AMD, you absolutely can — but pound for pound and watt for watt, the Core i5 wins this competition. Mobile Core i5 vs. Mobile Core i7  (Skylake, Kaby Lake) Mobile users now have three distinct choices to make, which clouds the issue a bit. There are previous-generation Core M chips as well as new Core i7 and i5 processors. The Core M chips are now limited to the m3 family — Intel has taken what used to be a distinct brand and folded it into the Core i7 and Core i5 families instead. This creates situations like the one shown below. These two chips look similar, with the same cache, almost the same clock speed, and similar GPUs — but they have different operating TDPs and hence offer different user experiences. Exactly how different isn’t something we can speak to without test hardware, but past systems showed marked variation depending on OEM design and thermal limits. To date, Core M hasn’t done particularly well — OEMs often saddled the processors with aggressive high-resolution displays and extremely thin chassis, leading to mediocre battery life. The Core i5 is in a similar situation: If you’re looking at the Core M-branded Core i5, we strongly recommend doing your homework and checking reviews of specific systems. Core M systems can deliver better battery life than their i5/i7 counterparts, but this will depend on the specifics of the manufacturer. Remember, high-resolution screens and ultra-thin systems with limited battery life will cost you just as much in power savings as you can get with a lower-TDP CPU — possibly more these days, since high-end chips account for a decreasing amount of power consumption. The other major difference we want to discuss is the newfound gap between Core i7 and i5 core counts on mobile. Prior to Skylake (6th gen), almost all Intel chips on mobile were dual-core below the Core i7 level. Now, there’s a group of Core i5 mobile parts that offer quad cores without Hyper-Threading support, as shown below: The difference between these three cores is that one of them supports Intel’s Iris Pro Graphics, while the other two are Intel HD Graphics-only. The Iris Pro 580 is Intel’s only EDRAM-equipped 128MB  Core i5. If you want a mobile processor with top-end graphics and a quad-core CPU, this is the Core i5 you want to purchase. Outside of these three cores, the general rule does still follow. Most mobile Core i5 and all Core i3 processors are dual-core with Hyper-Threading. Here are the features that separate mobile Core i5 and Core i7 processors: More cores: Many of Intel’s Core i7 processors are quad-core chips with Hyper-Threading enabled. This isn’t universal, however, and the company does offer a few dual-core + Hyper-Threading SKUs. Higher clocks: Intel’s dual-core mobile Core i7 chips typically have higher clock speeds than their Core i5 counterparts, even at the same TDP. More cache: Core i7 chips carry either 6MB or 4MB of cache. Core i5 chips run the gamut here. Older chips (pre-Broadwell) often carry 3MB, while Skylake and Kaby Lake chips are sometimes 4-6MB. The extra cache has only a small impact on performance. More addressable memory: Many older mobile Core i7 and i5 processors are limited to 16GB of memory, but there are Skylake (6th-gen) chips that support 32GB and even 64GB on some late Core i5 / i7 models. 16GB of RAM is fine for the vast majority of users. But if you think you might need more, check what your CPU is capable of at Intel’s database. How much performance you get out of a mobile Core i5 versus a Core i7 will depend a great deal on your laptop’s cooling solution and whether the chip can handle its own heat output. We’ve previously discussed how Intel gave OEMs more freedom to define their own TDP targets and skin temperatures. But this creates scenarios in which buying a faster Core M can actually result in worse performance, as the chip hits its thermal trip point and down-throttles to keep cool. Intel’s highest-end Iris Pro graphics are available in both Core i5 and Core i7 mobile SKUs We can’t point to specific instances where this has tilted performance between Core i5 and Core i7 chips, but it’s likely to create at least a little “slosh” between the two core families. Generally speaking, if you truly want to emphasize low power, pick the CPU that has lower base and turbo clocks. Intel historically defined TDP as “The CPU’s average power consumption when running typical workloads over a period of time.” A chip with more headroom is a chip that’ll hit its throttle point faster. Which chip should you buy? Right now at Newegg, Core i5 chips are running as low as $185 for the Haswell-based Core i5-4430, while the cheapest Skylake is $189 for the Core i5-6400. The Haswell is the better buy, with a 3GHz base clock, but the platform is older and you won’t be able to upgrade to a faster chip at a later date — assuming anyone still bothers. It’s a little surprising to see how much Haswell hardware is still in-channel. It’s been a year since Skylake launched and Intel normally turns its stock over fairly quickly. The cheapest Core i7 chip, in contrast, is $295 at Newegg for the Core i7-4770S, and there’s not much to recommend the Core i7 over the Core i5 family if you want to play games or do basic desktop work. The Core i7 can be faster, but many consumer applications top out around four threads. Many have hoped that AMD’s Zen will reinvigorate this market, but until that chip formally launches we’re stuck with the product roadmap Intel offers, and the Core i5 is the better deal for most people. Over a year ago, I wrote that DirectX 12 could offer the Core i7 a chance to prove itself, but we have yet to see that happen in the titles that have shipped to date. DirectX 11 and DX9 will remain important APIs for years to come, which means we have to wait and see which titles offer DX12 support and how it changes the Core i5-versus-Core i7 comparison. It’s harder to make this call on mobile. Poor cooling will cripple any laptop, and some of the boutique laptops on the market are sold with CPUs that they can’t possibly keep cool. I tend to favor the Core i5 over the Core i7 for mobile gaming because it helps preserve battery life and still offers good overall performance. CPU choice is just one element of a laptop — just be aware that higher-end CPUs may not deliver much of their expected performance if the chassis isn’t well designed for the chip it’s carrying. If you’re considering a laptop with a Kaby Lake or Skylake chip, as opposed to something older, I’d tend to go for the platform with the newest components and lower-resolution display if you want to maximize battery life, and the strongest GPU if you want to maximize gaming performance. The gap between Haswell and Skylake is irrelevant as far as gaming is concerned, while the difference between a GTX 970M and 960M is much larger.

Jeffrey Sickels I3’s do deliver. I’m still using a Sandy Bridge i3 2120 (3.3ghz) even for modern gaming. It’s been flying since early 2012. Kawaii Kurumi I agree i also have the i3 – 2100 but it does face some trouble when playing some games such as Far Cry 4 and all that and the PCI.E. is limited to generation 2 VirtualMark i7 if you can afford it. /article. close Even if you afford it it’s a waste of money if you don’t *need* it. You’re paying for something that you’re not using. Yes, you could argue that maybe you’ll need it in the future when it will spare you another upgrade and you may be right. But there are people using their computers in fixed scenarios and their performance needs won’t change until the next major OS upgrade which will come in the form of a new PC with new OEM license. Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it? Or would you stick to an i3-i5 because it’s already more than they’ll ever need? Crunchy005 Yep. For basic computer usage I would not buy anything over an i5 and I feel i3s are fine for that stuff, assuming a decent clock speed. Or even an AMD APU for that matter. The Hyperthreading is always nice but most gamers won’t use it that’s true, but lets be real here, gamers want the big core for benchmark numbers. I game and have the 4790k but I also have a minecraft server running in the background while I game and stuff so the extra threads are not a bad thing. Also the HT is really nice when i encode videos as well. Sunset Rider For basic computer usage you don’t even need anything above a Celeron, that’s what they’re for, basic computer usage. Buying an i5 would be overkill for basic usage, and it’s a waste of money because you don’t *need* it. MetusBatmanV3 You don’t need a large house, right? You don’t use every room in your house every moment of the day, right? You’re just wasting money because you don’t need the extra room, right? Why not build a house so the space is used all the time? Exactly, it makes zero sense because sometimes you need to do activities inside your house that requires more room than normal. Living in a tiny house isn’t the same as living in a house bigger than needed, right? That is why I buy a processor that can handle anything I’ll ever use it for, because I want to know that when the time comes I can complete the task in the least amount of time possible. Time is money, right? Lonnie Veal On point! But a lot of people, even techies, have unconsciously been co-opted by the Marketing Depts. i3 is slower than i5 is slower than i7 which is the best…because it costs the mostest? I regularly have arguments with staffers who insist they need an i7…even though all they are doing is regular office work…(I smile and tell them that if I Blocked all the Shopping websites, their i3 machine would operate even FASTER, BTW ;-) Paul Franklin Well said. Lonnie. I wish the Hardware industry had to abide by the same rules the canned food industry does… that is provide the price in terms of price/unit of speed. Not that I cant do the math. Usually the 80 20 rule applies, so buying the second tier product will provide the biggest ROI. MetusBatmanV3 Do you need a large house? No? So why are you complaining? Why not build a single room to live in? You can hush now. VirtualMark “Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it?” I’d tell them to buy the best CPU they can afford, it’s a fairly simple approach. The more powerful the system, the better the future proofing. Newer software tends to run slower on older systems, so I always like to get the best CPU for my budget. spoffle Afford and need aren’t the same thing. A lot of people could “afford” to go down the x99 route, but wouldn’t ever derive any benefit from doing so because they don’t push their hardware enough to make it a sensible choice. VirtualMark Nobody needs a computer for survival, all we need is oxygen, water and food. So what’s your point exactly? spoffle You know full well what my point is, don’t play dumb. Sunset Rider No he makes a good point, you don’t *need* anything faster than an 8 year old Core 2 Duo for basic web-browsing and Office. Actually you could get away with something even less powerful. spoffle This is exactly the point I’m making. VirtualMark You don’t have a point as far as I’m concerned. I could use DOS on an 80s computer if I wanted, but I work for a living and can afford a much more powerful machine. So I like to get the best CPU as I like to be able to run present and future software as smoothly as possible. spoffle You aren’t concerned at all, relative to my point, because you aren’t being sensible. There is a ratio of cost versus benefits, and for that vast majority of people who do very basic stuff with their PCs, by the time they actually needed the performance that a high end i7 offers, something new will be out that’s so much better that their i7 is long irrelevant in terms of the performance it offers. For example, look at how long a Q6600 stayed relevant in terms of the level of performance it offered versus what was necessary to perform basic tasks. With your method, most people are going to be wasting money. Joel Hruska The Q6600 was a damned good chip. Meaningfully good for years thanks to solid single-threading and fairly good scaling. I got one of the later G0 steppings and took it up to 3GHz. It wasn’t quite as fast as the Extreme Editions of the day, but it also cost a lot less. spoffle Most definitely, I ended up with a really good one that I could get to 4ghz. I actually got 5 years of use out of mine before I managed to sell it for a third of the price I bought it at. I’ve never known a CPU to deprecate so slowly. Matt Menezes My wife’s computer gets my hand-me-downs, and she has a Q6600 @ 2.8ghz (just because I didn’t want to raise voltage), 8GB DDR2, and a Radeon 6950 2GB. It can maintain 30FPS at 1080P with medium-high settings in most RPG games she likes (no ultra settings, no AA). Honestly, I can’t believe the legs the Q6600 has had – and to think that was the first quad-core CPU for consumers!! Joel Hruska I mean, there are now much faster CPUs — the Q6600 is probably about half the speed of a modern high-end Intel processor. But as far as longevity, yeah, that core was hard to beat. :) Matt Menezes Exactly. I could have spent hundreds upgrading the CPU, mobo, and RAM, but instead I jacked a bit of memory from a decommissioned computer at work and gave her decent hand-me-down GPUs whenever I upgraded mine. I didn’t want to spend money, I wanted to build a box for her with spare parts on a solid platform, and I’m just amazed that the thing is even relevant all these years later. cr1swell I’m still using my G0 Q6600, got it up to 3.915Ghz cpu-z validated as well. I’m still running my golden chip, but it’s finally showing it’s age. But for 175 bucks, this thing has done way more than I have paid for it. Maverick Leo I have 2 desktop that runs on Core 2 Quad 8600 on Intel board with 8Gb DDR2. It’s almost a decade old. When I bought it, it was for Photoshoping, Corel, Vegas other stuff, sans gaming. It already underwent several VCard, HDD and PSU replacement. And still working. I bought it for its power, and it never fails. My point here, future proofing can be relative, gladly I am already taking advantage of it. Four (4) years into service, Memory and CPU technology have gone too, far. There’s not much we can do. VCard might be upgraded but only few applications can took advantage of CUDA power that I USE in my shop. (e.g. CS6, Nero, MSO13, AutoCAD, Vegas, and a few free apps, thanx to Linux community). So, yes, you’re right. Buy computers for its intended purpose. Think a decade ahead, consider what module that will last into the future, and what needs replacement that will still be supported by then. Think SATA, PCI-E, etc. MetusBatmanV3 “benefits” is subjective, you clown. Get off your high horse and stop trying to dictate how other people spend their money. Spoffle Well you’ve completely misunderstood what I’ve said, so yeah, no. Huhster “but I work for a living and can afford” And yes we all get your point, but Spoffle still makes a very good point and you are just being childish and snarky in return. VirtualMark He makes the same tired point over and over again, and it all comes down to cost. Which was exactly my point – if you can afford the i7 then buy it. A faster computer is better than a slower one, end of story. And the rest of your comments don’t even deserve a reply, so I’d suggest that you conduct yourself like an adult if you wish to continue this discussion. Phobos I don’t know how can you be such a troll magnet yet it’s hilarious how you crush them with an ease . VirtualMark Lol it’s quite funny really. They all act smart, then start talking about cost, which just goes back to my original point. close Ok, maybe you weren’t the best example. I was thinking more of a person who can actually answer the question :). So it’s basically like you asking “what should I do to solve this problem” and getting the answer “whatever you can”. VirtualMark As you haven’t made any relevant points, your tacit concession on the matter is accepted. close Well the educational system isn’t what it used to. Come on, I don’t expect you to know anything about CPUs but not even language? Tacit? Concession? This is what you gather from me telling you that you know sh|t? Sarcasm won’t help you, I feed on the tears of people like you :)). That’s because every time you try to feel good about yourself with a witty remark I just pop up with some facts (hope you don’t need a thesaurus for this one) to put you down. I also bore pretty easily so try to keep up. Your “one-line” idea is plain wrong no matter how you put it. “The most expensive CPU you can afford” is not necessarily the fastest or best so you just cost you parents an extra $60 (or 80 pounds which is worse) and got them a weaker CPU. Way to go son. Also it implies that your parents understand that there will be higher costs in the rest of the platform (like a dedicated graphics card, more powerful PSU, more expensive motherboard, more expensive RAM, more expensive cooling system) and also operational costs (like more power consumption). You just cost your parents another $1000 just so they can get that slower CPU that is already more than they need, plus a few bucks extra each month on electricity and a noisier PC. They just wanted a browsing machine son and they gave you the best they had all your life. Why couldn’t you give them proper advice so they don’t end up spending that money with no tangible benefit? They could have gone on a nice trip with the money you let them spend for nothing because you didn’t care enough to send them to someone who knows this stuff, you ungrateful… So no matter how you put it, it’s either dumb or ignorant and any person spending their own money would confirm this ;). Just ask you parents and maybe they’ll give you a smarter answer than the one you were prepared to give them. VirtualMark Wow, now I see that you’re just plain stupid. I would have thought that it was obvious that a higher powered CPU would require more power and better cooling, and that the cost would be higher, and didn’t really feel the need to spoon feed the obvious to you. Honestly I don’t know why the hell you’re even mentioning it, it’s laughable. And you’re still banging on about cost, which just goes back to my original point – if you can afford an i7 buy it. So thanks for proving my point. Anyhow, I’m bored of you now. Go away please and play with your i5, you little cheapskate. Huhster “you little cheapskate.” You are so obviously a teenage pro-troll using a “rig” your daddy bought you. close Ok Mr. DJ then how’s this: If somebody comes asking a washed up “DJ” for CPU advice (yeah, I know what you are, a 20 something guy who tries to imitate the big names in music, who sometimes calls himself a producer without actually producing anything original and plays around on his ripped off Ableton – best you can afford, right? ;)), if someone doesn’t know what CPU they need, they probably also know nothing about this and don’t realize that a better CPU needs more power, better cooling. They might also not realize that choosing a better CPU comes with a different socket so a much more expensive platform overall (MoBo, RAM, discrete GPU as the MoBo doesn’t have video output, even bigger PSU because of this). But you also don’t know this ;). So how are you expected to give someone else this info? You didn’t pay for your DAW so I guess now I know how you tricked your parents into paying for it: the most expensive they could afford. So, you keep it up. It’s no shame knowing shit in some areas. Well, it is when you try to sound smart and fail. But you keep it up ;). If you got over sucking in your field you can get over anything. But enough about this. The point was made. You can pay extra for nothing, or you can read the article and pay for what you need. To each his own. VirtualMark Lol what a nonsensical rant. You shouldn’t have edited your post, as your first one was better. Namely: “sometimes the more expensive CPU is not the fastest” Sometimes being the key word there, well done, you’re learning. Usually it is faster, but occasionally it isn’t. So the i7 is still the better processor. Anyhow, the rest of your post is entirely irrelevant, and as such, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. close Oh joy. You’re a glutton for punishment. No, the keywords here are “ignorant/dumb/uninformed” ;). If you pay for the most expensive thing you can afford and only ever use a fraction of that because you have no idea what you need or what you buy then you are ignorant at best. And to prove it I showed you that there are cases when not only do you not get to get more than you need, you actually get even less than you would have with the cheaper part. So you pay more for less. Does that sound like something a smart person would recommend? Not really, eh? It’s about as smart as buying 10 loaves of bread every day just for yourself (and implicitly throwing away 9) just because you can afford it. You’re still determined that more expensive is better but I think it’s pretty clear that you lack both common sense and knowledge. As for the “tacit concession”, you’re getting repetitive with stuff you don’t seem to understand. It’s probably what you have to do when you’re reminded that you tricked your parents into buying the most expensive computer they could afford for you just so you can play with knobs and sliders and call yourself a “producer”. Tacit enough? :)) VirtualMark Lol your angry rants are getting longer and longer, you appear to be repeating yourself, and as you havent brought up any further points, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. And I now consider the discussion closed, and probably won’t be replying any further. But please, keep ranting, I’m sure someone will read it. close You read it, pissed you off, came back for more. You looked like an eager beaver until you realized I nailed your description. So to quote the only thing you managed to say in the last few days in trembling “voice” while having the horrible revelation that you suck even at trolling: your tacit admission that you’re a DJ wannabe who knows shit about CPUs is noted. Sleep on that ;). Huhster OHHHHHH! OH NO SHE DIDN’T. claudette.musser = Randall Snoddy back in 2007 i went for gold and got a q6600 still using it so if i had to do it again i would go for gold again and use it for many years again Kawaii Kurumi Yep agreed, why the heck would parents who just browse the web and watch a bunch of movies require an i7 to do the work??? An i3 is more that enough to handle all of that in todays world, just grab the 6th gen i3 and plug it and go play 4K movies its more than enough MetusBatmanV3 I guess since you make $8 an hour you don’t understand what it means to make six figures a year. Spending a few thousand on a computer is nothing. Mooki What a stupid remark to make after a article that actually shows you that that is certaintly not the case and that a i7 only Potentially could be faster in a end users specific situation. Unless you just throw money at anything that has a higher number and then simply trust it was the best performance you were buying based on that. These sort of articles are nothing new so for my game PC i bought a 2500K and OC’s it to 4.6Ghz. The money i saved by not buying a i7 has been been spend on better components elsewhere. VirtualMark You say it’s a stupid remark, then go on to say about money you saved. Don’t you see the irony in your statement? Lol… clearly money was your concern, so my comment still stands. close VirtualMark, it’s already pretty clear that you confuse price with performance and you can’t establish a usage baseline in order to correctly size your computer for your needs. You throw money at something you don’t need or use. You’re still free to do it just don’t expect it to be considered normal or best solution by any smart person. Ignorance is bliss but comes at a price. So your parents will end up buying a bulky, hot, power hungry $2500 computer thinking that they *need* it when a $500 NUC would have been enough. Coming back to performance and price: i7 4910MQ 3.9GHz, 8MB cache – $570. i7 4950HQ 3.6GHz, 6MB cache + better GPU and TSX-NI – $630. So… You may never use/benefit from TSX-NI instructions, you may never use an integrated GPU, but you can afford the extra $50-60 so you pay more to get a CPU that’s slower. Smart advice… VirtualMark Nice essay, and a cute attempt to appear intelligent. But it doesn’t change my opinion, I’ll still buy top end CPUs. And I’ll always recommend to my friends and family to buy the best system they can afford. Obviously if their budget was small, then the i5 would be the better option, but if they could afford more, then go for the i7. It’s simple enough really, which part don’t you get? As for making use of the full CPU features, generally newer software will make use of those, so it’s good to future proof. For example, I use a lot of VSTs, and some of them have recently been patched to make use of newer instruction sets, and run a lot faster for it. close Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion (you know the saying, they’re like as*holes, everybody’s got one). I just enjoy bringing some people down to earth the second they try throwing crappy sarcasm along with their crappy opinions in an attempt to give them some weight. Since your opinion revolves around price tags we can all assume your advice was totally crap, being free and all. I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower. And your only argument is that “generally… at some point… maybe… my VST software will be improved by a better integrated GPU and TSX-NI instructions”. Also, TSX-NI is permanently disabled through BIOS in most motherboards (you wouldn’t know that, you only know price tags). So that’s what you get for asking a guy who knows little to nothing about a field. It’s ok if you like throwing money at something you’re not using or if your friends have to come to you (of all people) to get such advice. But that will never make it “best option”. It just means that you cannot add any value to such a discussion or properly answer this question, that’s all. You’re the guy who knows next to nothing about whatever domain but tries to look informed: “What car should I buy? The most expensive you can afford.” or “What should I eat? The most expensive thing you can afford.” Etc. VirtualMark “Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion” Clearly you’re trying your damned hardest, and failing badly. “I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower.” No you haven’t. close That’s because your parents didn’t spend enough time to educate you in reading and now you just want to get back at them by telling them to buy more expensive, slower stuff. It;s pretty simple. And I have shown you, you just weren’t able to understand even when I gave you specific product names and official prices. It’s common among the more ignorant population. Paul Nelson I agree they should always buy the best system that they can afford. But, the best system is not necessarily one with an i7. Benchmarks have proven that, in some scenarios, the i5 is as capable or more capable than the i7 and therefore the i5 would be the better system. Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved on using an i5 on installing better graphics, faster storage or a more efficient power supply. VirtualMark Lol, you just proved my point again. Hint: “Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved” Paul Nelson Not at all. Your original statement was “i7 if you can afford it. /article.” My point is that the i7 is not always the faster processor and therefore not worthy of the extra money. Just because you can afford it, does not make it the correct choice. Spending extra on an i7 hoping that it will last longer is a false economy. Chip technology changes. Take the change from Power PC to Intel in Apple Computers. You could have bought the best G4 machine available in 2004, because you could afford it, yet in 2005 the change to Intel wiped out that generation of processors and they soon became obsolete. But it’s fine, I could afford it. Didn’t make it the right choice though did it? VirtualMark Sorry but your incoherent rant proves nothing. You said that the i5 could be faster if you spent extra money on a graphics card, clearly you have no concept of how a PC works. A CPU is not a graphics card, nor is it faster storage. They are completely different parts, you utter fool. Paul Nelson Oh no, you called me a fool whilst completely misunderstanding what I wrote. That actually made me laugh out loud. VirtualMark That’s an interesting story. Tell me another one – what did you hope to achieve here? Did you expect to be able to convince me and change my opinion? Can’t you see that it was a year ago and that I’ve moved on? Can’t you see that I don’t care about a thing that you have to say? Go away please, no need to embarrass yourself any further. MetusBatmanV3 i7 has hyper-threading, if you can afford it, yes, it is the best processor. MetusBatmanV3 Really, so what exactly will be wiping out the i7 next year? MetusBatmanV3 i5 doesn’t have hyper-threading except for one i5 CPU. Which means if you want to take advantage of that technology i7 would be the way to go and if you can afford it what is the issue? Speed isn’t the only thing to consider. Huhster Back under your bridge, please stop feeding him. spoffle An article, an end, an i7. There’s more, but they’re the most obvious. tetriminos http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png some dude I kinda hope there’s benchmark where they test multiple application at the same time, and see if HT have any effect or not. most of people run multiple application, heck I play game and watch youtube at the same time. Lagittaja This is kind of relevant, Linustechtips video “CPU Cores for Gaming, Streaming, & Rendering Simultaneously – Is More Actually Better?” He used 5960X to simulate other CPUs. Scenario was gaming Far Cry 4 with rendering video, Twitch streaming, stream capture, AV scan in the background. It’s not a perfect test but pretty damn good showcasing the difference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgDZKGA89I I personally have a i7-3770K@4.7Ghz and I chose it over the i5 as I am a heavy multitasker. Plex media server so gf might be watching TV show while I’m gaming and server is doing transcoding. And I backup all my movies/TV shows and shove them through Handbrake with my own best quality/low filesize profile. Gaming/streaming. Multiple VM’s running in Workstation 11 in the backgroun. And so on. I so much want a 8c16t CPU :( GranFaloSentado Obviously i7 was the smartest choice for you. But for the 99% of the population, an i3 or even an AMD APU is more than enough, since they won’t use virtualization or they won’t be streaming video while having a heavily queried DDBB or a webserver. Lagittaja Well that’s the thing. You choose the CPU based on your needs! And for 99% of the population, a modern dual core Celeron/Pentium is more than enough. Even an i3 is overkill.. Heck, if I didn’t do any transcoding/streaming or running multiple VM’s at the same time > a lowly dual core would be enough for me. And I’ve been there and done that.. Purchased a Celeron G530 after I sold my OC’d 2500K as a placeholder before I purchased the 3770K, this was before IVB had even launched. Had it for quite a few months (edit: actually 7½) and it’s crazy how much you get for so little money nowadays. Joel Hruska I don’t think 99% is true. I’ve used the dual-core chips you’re talking about, and while they’re faster than Atom, they’re not that fast. If I had to choose between a dual core Pentium/Celeron and an AMD chip, I’d take the AMD core. Much better graphics performance and better overall multi-threaded perf. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1497 (As an example). Lagittaja So you’re comparing a ~63€ Pentium to a top of the line APU costing 136€, or ~85$ vs 150$. Good job. Since you did that I might as well just go and do this since it’s pretty much the same price difference. http://anandtech.com/show/9320/intel-broadwell-review-i7-5775c-i5-5675c/7 hue hue hue And if you’d compare in similar price brackets your “better overall multi-threaded perf.” doesn’t hold true even the slightest. A6-7400K is almost the same price as the G3420 and the Pentium pretty much rapes that A6. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1492 Or A10-7870K vs i3-4330 http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1192?vs=1497 Joel Hruska You’re right, I should’ve made my point more clear. I would not buy a low-end dual-core chip of any flavor. Between the Core i3 and the A10, it entirely depends on how much GPU perf you want. If you want the fastest integrated GPU you can buy at that price point, I’d buy the A10-7850K. If you care more about power consumption and want a strong CPU core, I’d buy the Core i3. Vice Squeezer I got a I5 and play on steam and play pandora at the same time.. never a conflict between the two.. youtube I’ve done that too.. but on pandora the music never stops.. Arian Hajiakbar How is I7-4500? Recommended? Joel Hruska It’s not clear to me why the i7-4500U is considered an i7 at all. It’s a dual-core chip with HT, and its clock speed (1.8GHz base, 3GHz top) is not unusual. It can’t address more than 16GB of RAM and its onboard GPU is an Intel Graphics 4400, not the HD Graphics 4600 that most i7’s carry. (The difference between the two isn’t huge, but I’d expect 4600 on an i7.) I think I’d look for something else. happycube lie7’s annoy the heck out of me. Matt Menezes Haha, lie7…that got me… :-) Naum Rusomarov From my experience, the i7 is better on the desktop if you’re planning on running more than two processing tasks concurrently. If the opposite is true then the i5 is perfectly capable for day to day work. You could even go with the i3 and you will still be fine. Mooki a i7 will only be better in such a case if at least one of those programs benefits from HT. As you can see it could even lower performance. Naum Rusomarov As far as I know the i7 processors have four physical cores, with HT enabled you get 8 cores in total. The i5’s have two physical cores plus 2 virtual cores due to HT, so in total you have four cores detected by the OS. p.s. This is on the desktop. The mobile i5 and i7 are a different story. UPDATE: I was wrong. The i5 have 4 physical cores, but no HT enabled. Thanks to the comments below. :) Sunset Rider No, desktop i5’s have 4 physical cores = 4 logical cores, desktop i7’s have 4 physical cores + HT = 8 logical cores. Eduardo Larios i5 have 4 cores, not 2+ hyper threading. Matt Menezes I see what you’re saying, but that could be misunderstood. An i5 could easily handle Outlook, Word, Chrome w/ 10 tabs, Visual Studio, multiple Explorer windows, SQL Server Management Studio, and YouTube playing music in the background. I say this because my work machine is an i3 (3.4GHz, 2C/4T) and it handles all those tasks just fine. As long as you have a decent IO subsystem (enough memory and an SSD) so the CPU isn’t constantly waiting, you can multitask all day long with a CPU that can address 4 threads like an i5. Now, if you are talking about applications that soak up every bit that a core provides and spawn threads left and right, then you might want to step up to an i7. That being said, even if you are only running 3-4 single-threaded apps that each peg an entire core, the only thing an i7 will give over an i5 is the tiny clock speed advantage (since HT won’t help). thepaintsaint In short, to figure it out for yourself and learn more, go to ark.intel.com. bob lebart If the user/builder wanted to save some $, and was mostly gaming, or just doing one main task, an overclocked i5 is great value. As the article said, for a multi-purpose machine, more threads are always better. My pc serves as a trading station (6 monitors, 2 different heavy market-steaming trading programs running, incl CNBC, 2 chats, multiple browsers up!!) and at other times it’s a gaming machine- a non-overclocked i7 Haswell, 16 gb ram, nVidia SLI system, and handles it all with plenty of headroom. Oh, and how could I forget: Photoshop…sometimes with all the above stuff running! Vice Squeezer I have thinking of upgrading to a I7 but my I5 is still fricking fast.. but to have 32 gigs of ram is very tempting.. games in the future will be more and more demanding for power and speed.. Mooki I would not do that if i where you it is simply not worth it unless you have some specific aplications that would benefit of that and are important enough for you. If not you will be way better off upgrading your videocard or SSD or anything else you think you might need. Vice Squeezer I just did that getting a 980.. but feel I still need to up my ram from 8 to 16 also wanting an upgrade on my mother board that supports blueray and wi fi, my ausus is four years old. I tried one of those blueray usb plugs still doesn’t see my speakers which are plugged directly to my sound card. Wanting a prettier tower.. a see thru one.. because both video and sound cards lite up.. jimv1983 What does having an i5 have to do with having 32GB RAM? With a 64-bit CPU the theoretical limit is like 2 million TB of RAM. I thought the only thing that limits that is the motherboard. Joel Hruska No. Intel and AMD chips have limits on maximum addressable RAM due to memory controller limitations and market segmentation. Right now, top end Xeons can address up to 1,536GB of RAM per chip, but that requires ECC RAM. jimv1983 Interesting. I didn’t know that. Are there any motherboards out there that have enough RAM slots to have 1,536GB of RAM? The biggest RAM sticks I have seen are 16GB and the most slots I’ve seen on a motherboard is 24 for a max of 384GB. Joel Hruska 32GB sticks are on the market. A high-end Xeon, according to Intel, can support 6TB of RAM in a dual-socket solution and 12TB in a quad-socket. However, this doesn’t square with the listed spec sheet on Intel’s own website. SuperMicro makes a motherboard that it claims can support up to 6TB of RAM using riser cards and Jordan Creek technology. Given that the largest server DIMMs I see are 32GB, that only works out to 3TB of RAM. Presumably the other 3TB will be available once 64GB DIMMs are out. Tim Tian ECC, not Buffered? Joel Hruska The spec sheet just said ECC. I’m not sure how much registered memory is still in use. Didn’t Intel phase out its fully-buffered DIMMs? Tim Tian FB-DIMMs, yeah, but I think you still need the RDIMMs for the full load out with RAM. Can’t find any half decent info though. Tim Tian Looks like disqus ate my reply again. Pretty sure FB DIMMs are being replaced by LR DIMMs, but R DIMMs (or LR DIMMs) are still required for more than 3 or 4 per channel. jimv1983 It would all depend on what the uses are. If I was building a computer to do simple browsing, media viewing, very light simple games, etc then I’d get the i5. If I was building a computer to play high end games, professional video editing or 3D graphics rendering I’d get an i7. This question is like asking would you buy a compact sedan or a huge truck. It all depends on your uses. Idiot Inside, Moron Outside Sum it up. i5 for gaming and i7 for more CPU intensive tasks using programs that can utililse the cores and threads. DecksUpMySleeve If it’s a workstation of any sort, 4-6MB cache all the way for me. Other than that I seek the wattage to performance G-spot for the i7 series. For example the i7-860 had the best performance per watt at it’s time. As will the i7-6920HQ right around the corner. For a gamer a high i5 will feel similar to any i7, but if you do rendering, digital art or video processing a low i7 will shine. spoffle Performance per watt isn’t a very good metric, with how far a lot of i5 and i7 chips will overclock, performance per dollar with a typical overclock added into the equation is the more sensible metric. Joel Hruska Most workstation users *don’t* overclock. Unless you’re buying from a vendor that guarantees it, like BOXX. spoffle Maybe they don’t, but I’m one of the ones that do, else I’m missing out on a level of performance that I otherwise wouldn’t see for a number of years. My current workstation has a 4930K that comfortably overclocks to 4.6ghz. Nothing would come close to that for raw performance at stock except those mental 18 core $4500 Xeon you can get on 2011-3. DecksUpMySleeve Sensible for the willfully wasteful. spoffle In what sort of context? DecksUpMySleeve Overclocking in general drops the processing per watt while upping the frequency, the processing may go up 5% for a 9% power hike. They optimize the default base clocks for a reason, and that 5% gain usually only translates to a very marginal difference unless the system is already near cap. I myself ran my i7-860(years back) at 2.7 instead of the 2.86 base clock and left the turbo to deal with demand hikes, ran cooler and therein never throttled due to temp under load. Everything I threw at it ran like butter. I find a 1/2-2/3rds full SSD to make a larger difference than clock speed ever could. When friends came over and played on my rig they went home sad to log on elsewhere. But back to my initial point the means doesn’t justify the ends in most cases for OCing, modern CPUs aren’t that much of a bottleneck in most applications. One less background process comes to the same effect, it’s better to keep those well managed than to ever OC. I myself know nearly every process and either use Msconfig to take them off startup or manually kill them through task manager. Works like a charm, in effect a ghz saved is a ghz earned. From what I read of your post though you hiked a hex core 3.9 to a 4.6ghz so a 17% clock increase translating to probly a 11% processing gain. I’m guessing your workload is hefty enough to possibly require such beastliness(12mb cache) but most overclockers are simply overkilling it, hampering overall performance and stability. On a side note; Broadwell-E with Turbo boost 2 technology may be something of interest to you in Q1 2016, though replacing your current system might not be all that rational, but none the less interesting. Skylake-E’s X models may be your next reasonable purchase. spoffle You’re looking at it very narrowly though, and your scope of overclocking is, well pretty weak. I’m talking a decent overclock, not a weak one that’s barely over single digits. Any PC I’ve had for the last 10 years, I’ve managed a hefty overclock. I’m talking in the 30-50% range. A few percent is a waste of time and effort. Also, I’m not sure why you’re comparing an SSD to an overclock. They aren’t comparable. When you’re doing light tasks, an overclocked CPU will still step down its clock speed to match the demand, so you’re not going to notice an overclock much doing light menial tasks where you’re going to notice the big SSD improvements. I’m talking heavy demand situations, as I use my system as a workstation, by applying a hefty overclock, I get a level of performance I’d otherwise be waiting years for. Unless I went down the multi Xeon route, and not at all if we’re talking single threaded performance. On top of that, the power consumption increase is vastly overstated, and the reason why CPUs are clocked conservatively is because they want to sell people who don’t overclock, new chips that are faster. There have been IPC (instructions per clock) improvements over the last few years, but they’ve been fairly conservative. Each new Intel CPU range that comes out is clocked about 5% faster on average, and they’ve been consistently upping the clock speed at that sort of rate whilst making the above IPC improvents too, so in reality they’re being held back for a few reasons, to give lay people an upgrade path (profit, and why they keep changing sockets) and cooling, the semi professional hardware like x79 and x99 already run hotter anyway, and have got loads of headroom. That’s why they sell unlocked K variety chips. DecksUpMySleeve I’m not understating the gains of OC, just practical advisories for the everyday workstation. Also I’m not sure you read the most recent edit of my post. I agreed that in specific cases the gains were more practical. I’m also very aware of the IPC clock gains, but with Skylake really being the end of the road for a couple years it’ll be a decent investment on arrival not soon outmoded. VirtualMark I find it’s better to undervolt modern chips, as it allows them to run cooler and thus run at their turbo frequency more often. I’ve tested my 4700HQ and it can run constantly at turbo now, even though it’s a mobile chip. Tim Tian Hmm. Interesting. Did you use the limited unlock overclock as well? And how much were you able to undervolt (I’d like a ballpark for my 4770MQ so I don’t need to reboot that often)? VirtualMark I used the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, and was able to set the multipliers for 1-4 active cores. The undervolt I’m currently running is -94mV, although this will vary from chip to chip. I undervolted my Core 2 Duo laptop too a few years back, and found that it ran about 10°C cooler. Tim Tian Now I’m curious whether you have Win Vista/7/8 on your laptop, or a old version that runs on XP. anyway, sue to unrelated issues, my big laptop is dead with a “BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO” every time. Think I messed something up with MSConfig.exe. Nothings helped so far :/ Dustymack Thats like asking if you would like a Ford Edge or a Mustang. Sunset Rider Two years ago when I built my last PC, I debated between the i5-4670k and the i7-4770k. I ended up going with the 4770k because I reasoned, “This PC is going to last me the next 4-6 years before I need to upgrade again. How much is $100 worth to me througout 4-6 years? How much is a faster CPU worth to me throughout 4-6 years?” Seeing as how I was already spending near $1500 on a new PC, i figured spending another $100 on the processor wasn’t such a bad idea for the next 4-6 years. It’s been two years and my usage pattern has varied wildy, from simple web-browsing, to playing the latest vidya games, to encoding raw 32 GB videos. I haven’t once said to myself, “Darn, I wish I had bought an i5 and saved $100.” lopo Future proof is still i5 for gaming. If you do lots of video editing, then i7 is for you. Actually even i3 can play every game you want to play without any problems. You just need good graphics card but you wont need i7 if you dont do video editing and stuff that needs more power from cpu and less power from gpu. Mike kizaberg I have a I7 4700hq for graphics design and gaming to be honest, i also do a lot of benchmarking, while watching very high res videos online to. It does the job that i want it to do, while for those who are looking to do the very basic on computers should not even get a i3 or i5, they should just go with a celeron in that case. Robert Foy I had a i5 that someone gave me for a gift, 3 months later ran into some money and bought a i7 3770k, and boy what a difference it made with games, especially Planetside 2 and others. If you can afford it, get an i7, i5 min. i3 or any dual core would be a waste. This is coming from a gamer’s POV btw, if your not a gamer, then go with whats the most efficient performance/cost wise. But if a gamer, go with i7, you won’t be disappointed. AlbiteTwins That’s odd. Most benchmarks show that a desktop i5 or i7 from the same generation don’t make too much difference for most games, Planetside 2 included. http://www.hardwarepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/planetside-2-benchmark.jpg Was the i5 you replaced one of the those low power consumption models (i5-3xxxS or i5-3xxxT) ? BenjaminShade Xeon E3-1231 V3 you can pick up one of these for $210 from microcenter or $250 reatail, and I believe it is the same basic chip as the i7 4770. It isn’t overclock-able but with hyper-threading a 3.8gHz turbo and 32gb addressable memory i doubt you will care. Plus it is built to higher specs being enterprise class so the silicon will physically last longer. It also allows for ECC memory in case you are one of those crazies that want’s to run your computer 24/7 for something like i dunno mining of crypto currency’s. Last but not least you can drop it in any standard lga 1150 mobo. Conservative411 90% of people only NEED i5. vision33r Sandy Bridge i7 is a good bargain right now, pair with a nice solid ASUS mobo it can last forever and still competitive today. Philip Du Toit I came for the comments. *Grabs popcorn* J.L. Cannot but wonder why no compiler guru has yet come up with a technique to virtualize threading so a single thread application can benefit from AMD multi-threading capabilities. Kind of inverse Hyper-Threading.

This PC was first shown off by Biostar back at Computex in June. The Biostar Racing P1 mini PC is based upon the 14nm Intel Atom Z8350 quad-core processor with 2W TDP. Complementing the processor is 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a good selection of I/O options, including six USB ports. The Biostar Racing P1 mini PC measures 129 x 83 x 27mm (0.29L) and it is a fanless design for completely silent operation. Biostar has created this mini PC as part of its Racing range and thus implemented carbon fibre styling and "sports car curves". If that's not flashy enough and you aren't going to squirrel it away behind your screen, using the VESA compatible mounts, Biostar has included RGB LEDs plus a 5V 5050 LED Header for you to add LED strips to this PC and to control via its Vivid LED DJ software. Inside, the Intel Z8350 quad-core processor has a base/boost frequency of 1.44/1.92GHz. This 14nm chip has a max accompanying memory size of 2GB according to Intel but Biostar has it working with 4GB of DDR3L-1600 RAM. The built-in GPU is the Intel HD Graphics 400 with base/boost of 200/500MHz and 12 execution units. Built-in storage (64GB) is of the eMMC Flash type. I've tabulated the full tech specs below:   Model Biostar Racing P1  Dimension 129*83*27mm (0.29L), weighs 255g   CPU Z8350 Quad core 1.92G/ Fanless   CPU TDP 2W   Memory 4GB   Storage 64GB   Expansion Micro SDXC card reader   Video HDMI   Networking Realtek RTL8111H GbE LAN AMPAK AP6255 802.11ac + BT4.0(onboard)   Audio Realtek ALC5645 with Combo Jack   USB 1USB3.0 5USB2.0   Power 20W ( 5V, 4A PSU)   VESA Yes   While a step above the average PC-HDMI stick in size, the Racing P1 is compatible with standard VESA mounts to fix to the back of your monitor or TV so you can tidy it away. All the extra connectivity options provide are a big jump up from what is available on a PC HDMI stick. Unfortunately in its email to HEXUS Biostar neglected to mention pricing and availability. However, according to reports around Computex time it should sell for under $200. If you are interested please keep an eye on the usual Biostar distributors.

Thermal grease is the gooey stuff that’s applied to the CPU and GPU (if one is present) to ensure the best possible bond with the heatsink. A heatsink is a metal device that uses copper to rapidly radiate heat away from chip(s). It’s connected to one or two fans that blow across it. Therefore, proper bonding of the heatsink to the chip(s) via thermal grease provides the best possible cooling of the chip(s). Many accuse Apple’s heavy handed approach of actually working to insulate rather than efficiently cool the chip(s). This means the fans have to work harder to keep the chip(s) cool, and therefore the battery life gets used up more quickly. Even worse, some say the excess heat can lead to premature death of the chip(s), and therefore the MacBook Pro itself. The evidence Take a look at the state of my 15in mid-2015 MacBook Pro after I’d removed the heatsink to undertake the steps outlined below: In other words, this is the grease applied at Apple’s manufacturing plant. Yuk! The chip at the left is the CPU, while the chip at the right is the GPU (note: not all MacBook Pros feature a GPU). Above the MacBook Pro case you can see the heatsink itself, which in the case of most MacBook Pros is a wide metal bar. Ideally the grease would be just on the chip die surfaces, rather than spread across the entire top of the chip surface. I’ve rebonded/regreased the heatsink of every MacBook Pro I’ve owned (and a white Intel MacBook before that). All had extremely long lives. If you can’t wait to see the results of my latest effort, scroll to the bottom of this web page. I advise you rebond/regrease YOUR MacBook Pro too, although only after reading the following really, really important conditions: 1. Only do it if the MacBook Pro is out of its warranty period; 2. Only do it if you know what you’re doing – it’s a moderately easy task if you’ve ever been inside a PC to replace a component, for example, but likely impossibly tricky if you’re new to all this; you may have to remove the logic board depending on the model of your MacBook Pro; 3. You do all of this at your own risk. You take responsibility for it. You make the choice to do it. I tried hard not to make any mistakes below but I cannot be held liable for any omissions or bloopers. What you’ll need The following items are required: Thermal grease, a.k.a. heatsink compound. That’s the syringe in the photo above. You only need a tiny, tiny amount – literally maybe a gram or two – and will be forced to buy way more than you’re ever going need. People online argue about which brand is best. Just google if you really want to. Isopropyl alcohol, to clean off the old thermal grease. Again you won’t need a huge amount. I got a 250ml bottle and used almost none of it. Paper towels and Q-tips for cleaning off the old grease (also known as kitchen roll and cotton buds for UK readers). Anti-static protection ideally including an antistatic mat, earthing plug and wristband. I really cannot emphasize this enough. Some professionals laugh at precautions like this but the risk of zapping a component with static is serious. It’s a mistake to assume that a zap will outright destroy a component, or that the zap will be seen. The electrical discharge might be invisible and might just damage something so that it becomes faulty 1 in 1000 times it’s used. Why take the risk? Screwdrivers, including the right size and shape for your MacBook Pro, including its bottom case and the screws used to fix the heatsink in place. I used a bag of screwdrivers bought to repair iPhones. They cost almost nothing on eBay. Metal polish to polish the heatsinks, of which more later. I used an old bottle of silver polish I had hanging around. You need one of those marginally abrasive old-fashioned polishes, rather than one of the newer magical liquid cleaners. The steps you need to follow Broadly speaking you need to do the following: 1. Remove the bottom case of your MacBook Pro. 2. Possibly remove the logic board. 3. Detach the heatsink. 4. Clean everything. 5. Polish the heatsink copper pads. 6. Reapply thermal grease. 7. Put everything back together again. All of this typically involves unscrewing a handful of screws, disconnecting some logic board connectors, and perhaps rerouting a cable or two. However, I’m NOT going to go into how to do this because: (a) The steps vary quite a lot depending on the model, and; (b) The steps are detailed far better than I could ever write them over at iFixIt. Often there will be a specific guide to removing the heatsink for your model, or you might just have the follow the general teardown steps and stop when you’ve removed your heatsink. Just search for your model at iFixIt, which will be identified by its year of manufacture and size of screen – both of which you can discover by clicking the Apple menu, then About This Mac. Before even lifting a screwdriver read and reread the steps for your model so you’re absolutely sure what you’re doing, and what to expect. Print them off if it helps. Don’t forget the most important early step, which is to disconnect the battery from the logic board as soon as you open the case. Cleaning and polishing Once you’ve got the heatsink off, use the dry paper towel to remove as much of the old thermal grease as possible from both the chip(s) and the heatsink surface. Don’t scape! Using even a plastic tool to scrape can cause scratches in the soft copper used for the heatsink surface. That means the heatsink won’t be as efficient because less surface area will be able to touch the chip. Next, use the alcohol to remove the remaining heatsink compound by applying it to a piece of paper towel or a Q-tip. Use the alcohol sparingly, and definitely DO NOT saturate either, but try to get the chip(s) and the chip die(s) as clean as possible. Use small amounts of metal polish to shine the heatsink copper pads that make contact with the chip(s). Polish repeatedly but carefully until you can start to see your reflection in them. Take a look at the photo below. It’s not the best shot but the left-hand heatsink shows the reflection of my fingers taking the photograph, while the right-hand heatsink is still dull and fuzzy because it hasn’t yet been polished. While polishing be careful not to apply too much force so that you bend or distort the heatsink component. I didn’t believe polishing the heatsink was worthwhile until I tried it and saw a massive improvement in cooling. In fact, I rebonded the heatsink on two separate occasions, polishing only on the second attempt. Temperatures dropped substantially between each attempt. Once you’ve got the heatsink copper pads polished nicely, use the alcohol to thoroughly clean them. Ensure there’s no fluff or dust on either the chip(s) or heatsink coppers. At this point it’s not a bad idea to clean dust and fluff out of the fans, and the air intake areas. Canned compressed air is good for this. Apply a tiny, tiny pea-size amount of heatsink compound in the centre of each of the CPU, and then the GPU if you have one. Don’t spread it yourself! It will be squashed out and spread evenly when the heatsink is reapplied, which you should do next, and then follow your initial steps in reverse to reassemble your MacBook Pro. Don’t forget to reattach the battery before screwing the case back on! Test your MacBook Pro once it’s booted by running lots of apps and really stressing the machine until the fans are spinning. If you get any kind of crash or freeze then you might not have applied the heatsink properly, and should repeat the steps above. What results to expect Below are before and after figures for temperatures, as provided by the excellent Hardware Monitor app. To get these figures I closed all apps and then let my MacBook Pro idle for around five minutes, only moving the mouse cursor occasionally to stop the MacBook Pro entering sleep mode. The difference is quite incredible. Look at the CPU and GRAPH figures, which represent the CPU and GPU respectively. Note that the fans, identified here as LEFT and RIGHT, were spinning at their minimum rotational velocities, so don’t reflect any temperature difference in this instance. Also note that the “before” figures above are from my SECOND attempt at rebonding/regreasing the heatsink, at which point I polished the heatsink coppers. Here’s what the figures looked like prior to my first attempt, when the MacBook Pro was still using the grease applied in the factory: When this measurement was taken the MacBook Pro was doing nothing in particular, with a handful of basic apps open. In other words, comparing the factory-applied thermal grease to my own attempts, I might’ve managed to drop the CPU and GPU idle temperatures by 8 degrees. That’s just incredible. Now do you see why this is worth doing for a long and healthy life for your MacBook Pro? . , Leave a comment... Need advise on purchasing a Mac Book Pro. Thanks. Lee Schroter — P.D.Schroter · Oct 2, 09:27 AM · # Thanks for the nice writeup! (Tho you really should move that “don’t forget to detach the battery” step onto the first list.) In over 30 years of usually intense personal computing, I’ve never had a CPU or GPU fail; problems were other parts failing on the logic board, on the spinning disks and in the power supplies. So it’d be good to understand this work in the context of how it will really help. If it reduces the risk of failure from 0.5% to 0.4%, it’s probably not worth doing except for the pleasure/geekery of it. Spending maybe $100 of time/supplies with a 99.9% chance of not mattering means an expected cost of 1000 X $100. Add also the risk of screwing up. (I say this as somebody who has re-done the heat sinks on a couple of PCs. Successfully, and with good results because the parts WERE running over spec.) I presume that this work merely moves the heat away from the 2 chips faster, and won’t affect the many heat-sensitive parts in the rest of the MBP. So it’d be nice to know what Intel or anybody else says about the CPU’s life span at different temps. Thanks again, and in advance for a reply. — Walt French · Oct 3, 02:06 PM · # Hi Walt I’m afraid I can’t provide the reassurances you need because what I wrote is based on my own experience, and that of others. It’s a bit like applying underseal to a car. Will it work without it? Yes. Will it work for many years. Yes, Will it last for many years? Well, that’s why we apply underseal – and it’s only when you’ve had rust that you see the light. The info you’re looking for is out there on Google. Macs undoubtedly have issues surrounding GPU death, related often to Apple’s poor quality manufacturing (there’s a product recall on several models) but as I mention in the piece lots of people ascribe their troubles to poor cooling. Indeed, Apple repairers like Louis Rossmann are a little obsessed with the poor state of cooling on MacBook Pro computers. — Keir Thomas · Oct 3, 02:30 PM · # Nice text! A curiosity (non related to the article): What wallpaper is that? — Harlley Sathler · Oct 4, 10:50 AM · # This is great advice, very technical but it would be wise to follow if you want to keep a Mac around for as long as possible. I suspect the current (even if ancient) MacBook Pro lineup will be the last true “Pro” Mac lineup that Apple made, so if you have one, take good care of it! Everything is USB-C, dongles, and no fans from here on out… for better or worse. — Annoyed Mac fan · Oct 6, 01:58 PM · # Name Remember Email Website Message Textile help   ◀︎ macOS Sierra's hidden window expansion trick Thoroughly testing your Mac's RAM – an up-to-date how to (2016; macOS Sierra-tested) ▶︎ © 2013-16 Keir Thomas/MacFreda Publishing We work hard to generate ideas and find stories for Mac Kung Fu.

Intel Corporation helped shape Silicon Valley and our tech-driven world, but it isn’t clear whether Intel shares will remain compelling as PCs wane in prominence. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 3, 2016 at 10:16AM Image Source: Intel. For a company that produces and sells a product consumers never even see, semiconductor titan Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) incredible place within our broader consumer consciousness speaks to both its business acumen and resounding success. Few companies have dominated their industries like Intel Corporation, the semiconductor giant whose chips power an impressive share of our increasingly digital lives. Unsurprisingly, Intel stock has also proven to be an investment for long-term investors, turning $1,000 in 1972 to over $2.6 million, or $3.2 million with dividends reinvested. Today, Intel's chart reveals a company in transition. Company Name Ticker Symbol Market Cap P/E Ratio Dividend Yield Intel Corporation Nasdaq: INTC $180 Billion 18.0x 2.8% Data Source: Google Finance.  However, this sampling of financial data speaks to a small piece of Intel's vaunted corporate history. As such, let's delve deeper into Intel Corporation's past, and examine what the future likely holds for its shares. Intel, Wintel, and mobile Intel's history still stands as one of the most seminal and influential success stories in Silicon Valley. Founded by two former engineers from Fairchild Semiconductor -- Gordon Moore, of Moore's Law fame, and Robert Noyce -- Intel became a success nearly overnight. Moore and Noyce started Intel Corporation in 1968 with help from an investment from legendary venture capitalist Arthur Rock, and conducted Intel's IPO only three short years afterward. The recently deceased Andy Grove, the CEO who ran Intel in its most dominant years, was hired as the company's third employee. Through the '60s and '70s, Intel's business primarily involved producing memory chips, and the company profited tremendously. In 1970, Intel's sales totaled just $4 million, and by 1973, the chipmaker passed $3 million in monthly revenue. However, it wasn't until Intel moved headlong into microprocessors -- the chips that executed the central processing task in computers -- that it ascended to the dominance for which it's commonly known. Intel first aligned itself with early PC-era power IBM, then expanded its presence along with Microsoft's Windows to form the operating system and processor alliance that completely dominated the PC market. In 1983, Intel passed the $1 billion mark in annual revenue. Going forward, Intel's PC microprocessor business controlled the vast majority of its market. However, as is so often the case in business, Intel's understandable fixation on dominating the PC market also hindered its ability to foresee the coming revolution in smartphones, a reality to which Intel continues to adapt today. Image Source: Intel. Intel Corporation in the post-PC era  For years, Intel's PC chips and its x86 architecture succeeded by virtue of a singular focus on performance. With PCs and laptops easily connected to a power source, power efficiency understandably mattered little. It wasn't until the dawn of the smartphone era where power efficiency and performance became equally important considerations for chipmakers. While Intel failed to foresee this change, or simply refused to alter its business tactics in the face of it, other semiconductor architecture designers didn't, notably the British chip design firm ARM Holdings, whose chip architecture has supplanted Intel's as the de facto standard on which all mobile chips are designed. Intel has tried for years to dent ARM Holdings' market share in mobile, to little avail, and it seems unlikely Intel will directly participate in powering mobile devices. Crucially for Intel stock's outlook, though, that doesn't mean the company cannot find success in the post-PC era. In reaction to its lot in mobile, Intel has more recently tailored a new strategy to play to its strength in the data center servers that constitute the backbone of the cloud computing and mobile revolutions. What's more, Intel has also aggressively developed new classes of chips that cater to coming tech trends including the Internet of Things.  At present, the tangible signs of progress remain in flux. In Intel's most recent quarter, Intel's sever chip segment saw revenue increase 5%, which some analysts commented seems softer than expected. Intel's IoT chip business saw sales increase 2% compared to the year prior. However, Intel's PC chip business, which still produces the bulk of its revenues, saw its sales decline 3%. Simply said, Intel remains a business still struggling to balance its legacy monopoly in PC chips with a less certain future. To be sure, Intel will not fully fade away in the decades to come, but its financial profile seems likely to change as we move deeper into the post-PC era.

Today AMD announced its new 7th generation Pro APUs, also known as 'Bristol Ridge Pro' processors. As with previous AMD Pro chips, the new generation brings renewed performance and feature gains alongside enterprise-class reliability and security. AMD hopes to continue the success of the Pro series as since mid-2014 it has enjoyed a 45 per cent uplift in shipments of this range. For the first time AMD will be offering both 65W and 35W APUs as part of the Pro APU range. The 35W parts will be easily recognisable with their 'E' suffix and are meant for the growingly popular ultra-small form factor PC systems. These lower power consumption processors still offer plenty of performance, according to AMD, with clear leadership especially with regards to the integrated GPU. AMD chose to make a direct comparison between its Pro A12-9800E and the competitive Intel Core i5-6500T (with Intel HD Graphics 530) in real-world shipping business systems. In PCMark 8 v2 Home the AMD system scored 3461, while the Intel system scored 2965. That's a 17 per cent improvement on AMD's side. However, I noticed that the comparison AMD system had an SSD while the Intel system used a 5,400rpm HDD. In the perhaps fairer graphics comparison between the same machines AMD's R7 Graphics trounced the Intel HD Graphics 530 in 3DMark 11 Performance tests scoring P3050 against P1622. That's 88 per cent better. Important to the appeal of AMD's 7th generation Pro APUs are the other core improvements that were present in the non-Pro 'Bristol Ridge' AM4 socket A-Series products which include; greater power efficiency, support for DDR4 memory, PCIe Gen 3, USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C, NVMe, SATA Express, and enhanced graphics. Alongside these improvements AMD delivers the 'Pro' enterprise-class features of AMD Secure processor for hardware-based security, open-standard DASH manageability, AMD-V virtualisation, plus commercial-grade quality assurance and warranties. The first products we know of packing AMD 7th generation Pro APUs are the HP Elitedesk 705 G3 range, as pictured above. AMD told us that more systems were being readied by partners for launch in the coming days/weeks. Below you can find a chart showing the SKUs announced today.

Not for the regular enthusiast, but for the vendors. AMD will be able to push more APUs on the ultrabook market or on the laptop where power&heat constraints did not allow it before. Posted by ET3D - Wed 05 Oct 2016 21:31 Now I officially can't wait for Bristol Ridge DIY. I just tried to upgrade my HTPC from a 2TB HD (almost full) to a 4TB one, and the nForce drivers can't work with 4TB. That nForce based MB was a serious mistake. I really wish AMD would release that platform already.

The company claims that the 2U server with 22 cores is 20% faster than boxes running the older Haswell family of Intel chips. In our testing, we found that Dell is right. The server arrived and we slammed it into our crowded rack at Expedient in Indianapolis. The R730xd was really crammed, yet there was room for more. The 2U frame has room for 16 3.5-inch drives, totaling 128TB of storage. Added PCIe SSD drives can make it a hybrid storage SAN without going to SAN resources. Like HPE servers, Dell can take forever and a weekend to boot. This said, inside is a highly articulate management console that allowed us to re-fit operating system after hypervisor. We tried VMware 6, Windows 2012 R2 (don’t tell Microsoft that the previews of Server 2016 worked, too), and Red Hat Enterprise 6. Then we tried CentOS, but we did have one kernel explosion with FreeBSD that we were unable to repeat. XenServer 6.5 worked without incident.

The performance gains of the new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K are much harder to put down on paper - or, er - your LCD screen - because we don't know the exact clocks. Expect more news on the 7700K as it breaks.   Intel is very close to the release of its Kaby Lake architecture, arriving in the form of the Core i7-7700K, but first we have some leaked benchmarks that tease the improvements of Intel's new 14nm+ architecture.     The upcoming Core i7-7700K performance is shaping up well, with leaked Geekbench 4 results showing that Intel has managed to pull off some great single-threaded performance improvements over Skylake, but the multi-threaded performance isn't left out in the cold. Intel's upcoming Core i7-7700K arrives with a base clock of 4.2GHz, while boost clocks will have it driving up to around 4.5GHz. Intel has slapped a 95W TDP on the Core i7-7700K, and it still uses the LGA 1151 socket.   Performance wise, the new Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K had a single-core score of 6131 on Geekbench 4, while the multi-threaded score was 20,243 - this is a 42% increase over the current Skylake-based Core i7-6700K, which scores just 4300 points or so in the single-core test. The multi-core result is just as interesting, with a 20% increase in performance over the 6700K and its 16,756 score.   We should expect Intel and its motherboard partners to launch Z270 chipsets alongside the desktop launch of Kaby Lake, with a GIGABYTE board teased in this Geekbench 4 result.

If you were to design a client operating system with the goal of being used by two billion people, what would it look like? We might soon find out what Alphabet’s looks like. Today’s announcement’s from Alphabet’s Google is expected to reveal "Andromeda", the merged Android/Chrome OS. Executives have been hyping today’s event as the most "significant" since the first Android device in 2008, and we already know they’re writing a new operating system from a clean slate. We can also have a good guess about what it looks like. Google’s goal for the successor is to unify the rival Chrome and Android platforms while providing a clean code base free of the Java legacy. Google’s big advantage here is that it now has a blank slate. After Google acquired Android in 2005, Sun Microsystems’ then CEO Jonathan Schwartz offered Google “congratulations on the announcement of their new Java/Linux phone platform”. Android founder Andy Rubin had already figured Java worked, and seen how it decreased time to market, and how much developers liked it. (Anything was preferable to writing for Symbian, the dominant smartphone platform of the time.) But Google doesn’t need Java any more, and the more distance it puts between itself and its Java-based legacy, the better, particularly if (as it is reasonable to expect) Oracle ultimately prevails in the litigation on appeal. Nor does it need, at least not quite so much, the VM-based architecture designed to make porting easy. If OS abstraction is sufficiently well designed, then an easily-ported microkernel can suffice. Microsoft took this approach designing Windows NT, although within three years Redmond had broken the microkernel design (moving graphics drivers into the kernel) and a couple of years after that, the last non-Intel port had been mothballed. By then it was, to all intents and purposes, a monolithic kernel Intel OS. Computer history is littered with “Second System” effects, but Google’s “second system” looks promising. We already know what it looks like. The open source Fuchsia project is led by QNX and BeOS veterans, with plenty of experience designing Android. Fuchsia code boots on x86 hardware, and the source tree indicates it’s going to be backwards-compatible with key Android libraries. Fuchsia has been touted as suitable primarily for embedded devices and its key developers have embedded experience. (And Fuchsia wouldn’t need to be running Android libraries if Google only wanted it to power watches and fridge magnets.) Strong ARMed tech You really need to look at demographics and the cost curve of client devices to see where Alphabet wants its Android successor to run. The ARM world is gradually superseding the x86/amd64 world, and PC sales are in a long-term decline. ARM has a huge cost advantage over Intel, and most first-time computer users are using ARM tablets and phones. So the opportunity here for “Andromeda” is to ensure the “next billion” coming on line, particularly in emerging economies, remain plugged into Google services, while expanding the capabilities of Android2 so it can run the next generation of creative and productivity applications. Why not just tweak Android to do that? Remix OS does just that, adding power management and overlapping windows to Android x86. The Android architecture is already unwieldy, with much code moving into the GMS (Google Mobile Services) binary. Android has distanced itself from Dalvik with its ART runtime, but this is still an optimised Dalvik. The really serious performance (and user experience) wins are made by moving away from a byte code architecture completely to a new microkernel. Users won’t get that “optimizing apps” wait after a platform update (that’s a sure sign of an archaic platform). Google will want to keep the Chrome brand and user base, but Chrome users themselves couldn’t really care less what it runs, as a Chromebook is just a dumb terminal for web-based Google services. That part is easy. I’d expect to see Fuchsia make its début today, perhaps by borrowing a few ideas from Continuum, allowing a device to act smarter when it’s plugged into a remote display. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 72 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Download BIOS 0054 for Intel’s DN2820FYKH Next Unit Computing Kit The new release updates Visual BIOS to version 2.2.20 Oct 4, 2016 13:09 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Intel has made available a new BIOS package compatible with its DN2820FYKH Next Unit Computing Kit, namely version 0054, which applies the 2.2.20 Visual BIOS and adds the Windows firmware update function. In addition to that, the producer managed to implement various security enhancements, improve the BIOS update function by disabling the keyboard and power button during the flash/recovery process, and lower the time it takes to enter recovery menu to 4 seconds. Moreover, BIOS 0054 also resolved the issue where users could still access restricted Setup options, such as Minimum/Maximum Duty Cycle (%) and Primary/Secondary Temperature Sensor, even though User Access Level was set to limited. When it comes to installing the present release, you should know that Intel has provided four downloadable files, which must be used in differentiated situations. Specifically speaking, the .BIO package can update the BIOS through an F7 update method, as well as recover it from an unstable state, while the iflash BIOS Update archive is only able to perform an upgrade from a DOS environment. As for the other two Express BIOS Update executables (one for each bit architecture), these files can help you install version 0054 by simply running them from a Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or 10 OS, and following the instructions. That said, download Intel DN2820FYKH NUC Kit BIOS 0054 for the appropriate product, take into account all aforementioned aspects, and carefully update your NUC.

Unique to SGI, the cluster nodes can later be reconfigured as single-node systems with 1 to 32TB of shared memory (scale up) to run SAP S/4HANA® and other real-time applications. SGI also announced that deployments of the SGI UV 300H as a single-node system provide in total over 800 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity to organizations running the SAP HANA platform. These announcements reflect SGI's broadening leadership in high-performance data analytics and continuing innovation to achieve greater insight and gain competitive advantage with SAP HANA.

When business lines wish to move to real-time analytics utilizing SAP Business Suite on SAP HANA, SAP Bank Analyzer, SAP S/4HANA Finance, or other SAP S/4HANA applications, the clustered systems can be fully repurposed to form single-node systems with 4 to 32 sockets. By avoiding the need to "rip and replace" multi-node clusters when single-node systems are required, IT organizations can enjoy considerable cost savings by protecting investments and reduce time to solution. More than 100 single-node SGI UV 300H systems have been installed in organizations worldwide to provide data analytics in real time with SAP HANA and enable business lines to know when, where and how customers are buying without delay; view inventories, supply chains or financials with up-to-the-second accuracy; and spot market changes early and adjust with precision.

Reuters/Chaiwat Subprasom Recently, a 27-inch Apple iMac with 5K Retina Display and seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processor popped up at Best Buy. The Apple iMac 2016 is expected anytime soon, and this listing on Best Buy made everyone believe it is the new iMac 2016. However, certain discrepancies have cast doubts on the listing. The Apple iMac 2016 listing appeared Sunday night on Best Buy for the 32GB variant also boasting a 2TB Fusion Drive. It claims to have a seventh generation Intel Core i7 processor and AMD Radeon R9 M380 graphics chipset with 2GB of video RAM. The page is offering the product for US$3,199 (AU$4,170 approx). However, experts have found discrepancies with the model number K0SC0LL/A as it does not conform to the existing nomenclature of MK462, MK472, or MK482 prefacing a remaining two digits, and completed with a /A, writes Apple Insider. Moreover, an existing model in the Apple official website also offers a 2TB Fusion Drive, 32GB RAM and a 4.0 GHz sixth generation i7 processor. It carries a price tag $50 less than the one being offered at Best Buy as iMac 2016. Another discrepancy is the AMD Radeon R9 M380 graphics chipset as R9 M395 is already being offered in the existing 5K iMac. It’s also not clear if Kaby Lake quad-core processors compatible with 27-inch Retina 5K iMac is shipping at all. It is possible that the listing is a big mistake by some Best Buy employee or just a placeholder, writes TechnoBuffalo. But whatever it is, the timing seems to be perfect. It proves that Apple is gearing up for the iMac 2016 release and it can be very much in October. The MacBook Pro 2016 is also anticipated this month. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple iMac 2016, Apple MacBook Pro 2016, Apple MacBook Air 2016 and much more. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Apple iPad Pro 2017 in spring 2017?

This lineup can be purchased at Lenovo Exclusive stores and multi brand outlets like Croma, Reliance Digital and Ezone. To begin with, there are the Lenovo Ideapad 710s and 510s, both of which are claimed to be high on portability and performance. The latter is host to Harman Kardon speakers and a full HD display. The laptop is supplemented with 8GB RAM and 1TB storage that allows smooth performance while on the move. It can be bought in exchange of Rs 51090. The Ideapad 710s is built on similar lines and sleeker than the previous one. It offers a longer battery life and JBL speakers with Dolby home theater certification. This slim device is designed to be carried easily and costs Rs 73390. Lenovo has made two multimedia-based laptops for those seeking entertainment. The Ideapad 310 has stereo speakers with Dolby Audio Premium that claim to deliver sound in home theater quality. This system combined with specs like Nvidia graphics is meant to appeal to media-heavy consumers. It is available for Rs 28390. The other media-rich notebook is the Ideapad 510 which is the higher-end cousin of the Ideapad 310. The former is provided with Nvidia graphics and a full HD resolution that can be a big bonus when it comes to video editing and playing, as well as gaming. This laptop is being sold for Rs 61690. Lenovo continues to expand its Yoga series with the new Yoga 510. The 360-degree foldable laptop is lightweight and endowed with fast charging technology. Its features are somewhat similar to the Yoga 710. The first will be sold in black and white color variants for Rs 40990 and the latter at Rs 85490. Laptops are not the only thing on Lenovo’s mind this festive season. The Miix 310 detachable hybrid weighs merely 580 grams, is highly portable, and supplemented with performance-based setups like a long battery life, 4G connectivity, and full HD display. It is available on Amazon India at a seasonal offer of Rs 15990 but is otherwise sold at Rs 16827, lower than its official cost of Rs 17490.

With Hollywood superstar George Clooney as it’s talking head, EP, as it is known, was founded by senior US Intel “spook” Gayle Smith, former Senior Director of the National Security Council under President Obama and now head of the USAID/CIA. Today EP is headed by Ms. Smith’s protégé John Prendergast whose history as head of EP is one of subterfuge and lies in service to Pax Americana. EP claims it’s mission is to prevent genocide in Africa, as in the name “Enough Project”, yet has been conspicuously silent when it comes to the genocidal famine in Somalia during the Great Horn of Africa Drought in 2011-12 where 250,000 Somali children starved to death. Recently George Clooney was enjoying 15 minutes of fame as a humanitarian claiming to have exposed massive corruption in South Sudan when he should have been warning the world of the UN’s next genocide in Somalia as in 300,000 starving children. Soon the genocide in Somalia will hit its peak with hundreds, up to 1,000 children a day dying from hunger with only a deafening silence emanating from the CIA’s Enough Project. EP, with support from its big brother, the Centre for American Progress, only once in its history raised a real genocide, that back  in 2007-8 when Gayle Smith was out to political pasture, she being a rabid democrat during the Bush Jr. years in office. Then she was part of the Democrat “opposition” to the Bush regime and oh so briefly raised the food and medical aid blockade in the Ogaden in Ethiopia, where the only instance of both the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders being expelled from a famine stricken region has been allowed. Once Ms. Smith jumped on the Obama For President bandwagon, no further objections to the genocide in the Ogaden were heard. Today EP is proving its loyalty to Pax Americana by playing huckster for regime change in South Sudan, as in denying China access to African oil via the invasion of “peacekeepers” in the name of Responsibility To Protect of Libyan infamy. The USA has abandoned former “rebel leader” Riek Machar in favor of direct military intervention in South Sudan by the UN and the USA’s gendarme in Africa, the AU. The Chinese have started to expand their oil production so expect to hear louder cries of outrage from the likes of EP about various crimes and even “genocide” in South Sudan followed by demands for more foreign military intervention in the country. With all their lies and subterfuge don’t you think that we here in Africa have had enough of the CIA’s Enough Project? This article was originally published on Telesurtv.com Thomas C.

BlueFin’s Steve Mullane reiterated a Positive rating on the company. The company ended Q3 with production down 3-4 percent sequentially, 2 percent higher than the guidance. On September 16, Intel raised its revenue guidance from $14.9 billion to $15.6 billion, attributing the increase to higher PC supply chain inventory and signs of improvement in PC demand. Related Link: Baird Raises Target Price On Intel Following Raised Guidance “We have been observing and reporting improving PC sentiment over the last several months and maintain our view that 2016 PC shipments will decline a more modest 5 percent year-on-year,” Mullane stated. Product Mix In addition, the analyst pointed out that the company has continued to increase its 14nm product mix at three of its high volume manufacturing sites, Oregon, Arizona and Ireland, while meaningfully reducing its lower node production levels at Fab 11X in New Mexico. “INTC just recently launched their 7th generation core processor called Kaby Lake last month, extending their 14nm technology node platform,” Mullane went on to say. Intel is now guiding to revenue growth of 15 percent for the September quarter, driven by momentum in the Data Center, IoT and improvement in the PC environment.

For Paris Fashion Week, designer Hussein Chalayan has teamed up with Intel to create a high-tech outfit straight out of an 80s sci-fi movie, complete with glasses that sense stress and a belt that projects live images of that data onto a wall. The glasses are running on Intel's Curie, a button-sized module designed as a low-power, versatile "brain" for wearable devices such as Chromat's dress and sports bra, which surfaced at last year's MADE Fashion Week. In this case, the smart specs determine the wearer's stress levels by monitoring biometric data such as brainwave activity via in-built EEG electrodes. There's also an optical heart rate sensor and a microphone that picks up breathing rate. With Curie's built-in Bluetooth LE, that data is sent to a connected device like a smartphone or, in this case, a belt. Rather than watch your waistline like the Welt, this one uses an Intel Compute Stick to process that information and present it visually. An embedded pico projector then throws that live interpretation of a wearer's stress levels up on a wall for all to see, which sounds like a fairly stressful situation in itself. By focusing on calming themselves down, the wearer is supposed to be able to change that imagery in real-time. Why? We're not sure, but that's seems to be a common response when you're talking about the world's bleeding-edge fashion runways – with or without an extra dollop of technology. After Paris Fashion Week wraps up, the collection will be on display from November at the "Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World" exhibition at the Design Museum in London.

Latest Music Tech Artists Motion Contact/About MotionTech How one community was mapping the future of visuals this summer Peter Kirn — September 28, 2016 0 There’s a shift on in the worldwide community of visualists, of the growing field of people using electronic visuals as a medium for performance, art, and inquiry. As these media become more mature and more international, there’s a renewed sense of closeness among practitioners. While big media festivals focus on novelty and show, these maker-to-maker events emphasize something else: craft. This summer seemed a particularly historic moment for not one but two tools – each of them built by small teams who make art themselves. We already covered the Berlin gathering for Isadora, the visual performance tool that has rich connections to the world of dance. Now, we get to look at TouchDesigner, which has made a name for itself as the leading go-to tool for interactive event visuals (among other things). And maybe it’s fitting that unique tools would leave a particular mark. For artists, that particular piece of software is their axe, their main instrument, something to know inside and out. I asked Isabelle Rousset from Derivative, TouchDesigner’s developer, to help prepare a report on the gathering in Moscow. And picking someone from the team here works, because these gatherings are family affairs. This is summer camp for visual nerds – a retreat for people of passion. And I was ready for an exhaustive “what did you do last summer” report. We got it, in the form of obsessive notes on what happened and endless leads to check out yourself. What TouchFest was about Moscow’s MARS Center is a hub for the city’s electronic media community – one of a handful of places everybody meets to see the latest tech and visiting artists from around the world. And in this case, that same community got their hands dirty organizing the event. Curiosity Media Lab’s Yan Kalnberzin and Eugene Afonin spear-headed the four-day event in July. It came against the backdrop of the cancellation of Outline Festival (the last afternoon of TouchFest) – but as such, was a reminder of the possibility still latent in Moscow’s scene. Here’s Derivative on the experience: It was solidly packed with masterclasses, lectures, demos, audio visual performances and a ‘marathon of interactive madness’. There was zero fluff! Derivative’s Greg Hermanovic, Markus Heckmann and Isabelle Rousset who were there to participate were blown away on many fronts: the scope, quality, range of TouchDesigner projects and applications, community engagement and support (100+ in attendance), festival programming and schedule where workshops, lectures and masterclasses ran in parallel for multiple days, the generosity and proficiency of the festival organizers for putting together such a BIG and exciting festival (while working on a major project for clients i.e. they didn’t sleep much if at all for days), the MARS Center who provided the fantastic facilities and staffing…. The volunteers and of course the performers and participants whose work and energies were very far out and intense. A ‘hotbed’ of TouchDesigner 🙂 Yan: I’m still surprised that around 250 people came)) This was a chance to learn if Moscow is ready for educational events like this. And we wanted to see how many people are really interested in the subject. I’m amazed how many people came from around Russia – three people from Krasnodar, several from Izhevsk, from Novosibirsk, and some other pretty far away cities. Ed.: Yeah – uh, Googling those myself! We are super happy and thankful to MARS Center and their technical team. They totally made half of the event. And of course to all the speakers – mostly friends, but not all of them – that they agreed to perform for free. Learning Deep in technical education. TouchFest’s organizers were themselves long-time TouchDesigner instructors. Yan Kalnberzin and Evgeniy Afonin have been teaching the tool since 2012 – even 3- and 6-month courses. These also culminated in presentations: Yan’s 2014 work, The Square Root of Sin, 2014 Exhibit Item Awakening, 2015 [Golden Mask winner] As they explain: Here at Curiosity Media Lab we often get letters about education from scratch. As we organize such an event, inviting Touch masters from Russia and abroad, we want to give you a chance to understand at least on a basic level what they are speaking about. Our 8 hour masterclass will start from the very beginning – fields of application, nodes, logic, interface, contexts of the program. Yan and Evgeniy were teaching again. Other highlights: Markus Heckmann presented an eight-hour class entitled “Developing in TouchDesigner: Python Extensions and Custom Parameters.” “The master class examined how TouchDesigner’s new Custom Parameters and Extensions helps develop complex functionality within the environment of visual programming with networks of nodes,” says Isabelle. “Probably the longest-standing” TouchDesigner user and teacher Andrew Quinn taught a course that incorporated audio and gesture, “Sound-Reactive Visuals and Gesture Tracking.” Recorded or live sound could then animate movement, light, and color – in two and three dimensions. Gesture tracking transforms the VJ “into a puppeteer.” Andrew is applying the same concept to coursework with kids. He played the closing audiovisual concert with composer Nikolai Popov and six musicians from the Russian Conservatory. Conservatory musicians join the AndrewQuinn / NikolayPopov AV performance. Total immersive interactive chaos intensive Three days in the Vostochnaya Gallery turned into a circus of interactive hacking, thanks to Ildar Yakubov (someone I’ve also had the pleasure to know). I like the chaos aspect. As Isabelle describes the event, “NEITHER SEW NOR FASTEN”: [The marathon] showed the world what pure, boundaryless and unpredictable total interactivity looks like. (At one point, I’m told, a doctor in blue scrubs came down saying he was performing an operation upstairs and the floor was shaking!) There was also a flood! But for three days the kids worked tirelessly, connecting all kinds of materials to TouchDesigner, including: Microsoft Kinect 2 Intel RealSense F200 Intel RealSense SR300 LeapMotion Arduinos with a variety of peripherials I/O devices / physical computing Servomotors LED strips Enttec Open DMX Ethernet DMX controlled devices Here’s the proposal-manifesto – slightly broken English here, sorry, but posted as-is (as maybe English can’t really describe everything they imagined)! “Artists are really suppressed with the totality of technology and this way doomed to a both senseless and endless flirting with it” – some critics say  “Until you are really familiar with the technology you are not able to reflect on it” – says the other  “Turn off that weird shit or I call the police” – say the neighbours. Armed with these tools, and using the unlimited potential Touchdesigner offers we will challenge an intuitive interface and the planned user experience. After two days, we will create a real media art gezamkunstverk and put it to the mercy of the crowd. Oh yes, about two days – the event will take place in a Hackathon mode: we will work tirelessly for two days. Some rumors say that on the second morning, participants will become familiar with the machine learning process and will learn to use this powerful tool in their practice! Tools of the interactive madness. Plotting the madness marathon. Ildar writes: For three days we have collected Krastinator – crazy device like a Rube Goldberg machine, the sole purpose of which was to stop the madness in and of itself. However, the rubber glove could not reach the big button, but successfully deceived Leap Motion posing as a real hand! The result of the analysis of the motion of non-existent bone defunct arms generate sound skeleton projected on screens, mixed with a picture of motorized cameras, controlled their own picture and includes a strobe on the floor rolled robo-ball, grazing contact microphones, vibration motor and the cooler is activated by a small Korg, smoke machine made his work, and all of this in an endless loop of interactions and relationships, secured by TouchDesigner. Such collaboration with different people and skills backgrounds very useful in every sense of the activity, a huge thank you to all participants – you are super! Lectures: praxis and philosophy Thumbing through the notes from the lecture content, what strikes me is, you could navigate the full program without ever wanting to even use TouchDesigner user and still be really happy. There’s enough content dealing with theory and general technique. Or, on the other hand, you could come to TouchFest wanting to really hone up on skills – even from scratch – and have a ball, too. To give these two areas physical space, the practical and technical were kept on downstairs and loftier topics literally above. (Nice.) I was sent pages of notes, so let me summarize. Technical 3D mapping technique with Andrew Flat, who has done everything from event design to VFX supervisor, and now is co-founder and technical director of AVEA company. https://www.facebook.com/FLaT4eRs Roman Gavrilov of Curiosity Media Lab, who has spent years researching folk traditions in Russia and Ukraine and makes the leap from traditional craft to electronic media, covered LED control software GEOPIX. http://romanesco.org SILA SVETA’s Dmitry Napolnov drew on an extensive background in events (from live motion capture to projector calibration) to present solutions to production tasks. https://www.facebook.com/cubicdisaster A roundtable discussion looked at how to present LED lighting at low costs (from DMX controllers to DIY LED). Dmitry Karpov covered the “battle” for VR, evaluating platforms and how the technology would shake up the landscape of designers. Derivative’s Greg Hermanovic looked at TouchDesigner past, present, and (possible) future, in a talk called “A playground for design, and how it got that way” Other topics: Building audiovisual instruments: advanced ways to mix human impact with algorithms, TD+Ableton+Max4Live. Anatomy of an installation Coding a pixelshader(GLSL TOP) with DAT nodes, for “raymarching” Dmitry Napolnov, lecture. Upstairs philosophy topics Procedural Functions as a New Canon – watch: Anna Titovets (Intektra), of Russia’s Plums Fest, went deep into the question of live performance. I will paste the whole description here, as I think it matters: Live video performance: from fractal tunnels to live cinema Live video performance as a social and cultural phenomenon in contemporary media art. Talk and talk about video performance as a format, which is a kind of marker for the changes occurring in today’s information society in the context of global changes taking place with the psychology of perception of the information society, with the communication methods with the audience and global technological development. How did the “vj” what “protovidzheing” Live Cinema differs from other genres, as changes in video performance linked with the development of technology and the changes taking place in society in general and in music in particular. As part of the lecture will discuss the main current stylistic trends shaping and live video performances that exist at the moment (from 8-bit to glitch and Camp aesthetics of mash-up and political videointerventsy to generativa and nonlinear narrative Live Cinema). And Isabelle’s own talk sounds fascinating: A Timeline of TouchDesigner, or, How We Got From Touch001 to Russia This talk proposes to untangle the co-joined history of TouchDesigner’s development in the context of 1. making music visuals for raves and 2. everything that followed. Isabelle will attempt to trace TouchDesigner’s development through time, technological advancements, historical events, historical achievements, grand projects, lightning bolt moments, community development and hard work. Ilya Ostrikov covered “the philosophy of digital art”: Thinking out loud, or in response to your questions: Semantics and historical review – where the legs grow .. Art as a way of expression and how to make it? As a born and where to apply? Follow the trend and whether it is now fashionable? More topics: Code as supreme and universal coauthor More speakers Vadim Epstein is a top VJ – who happens to have a background in theoretical physics and 13 years consulting for HP, to boot. Now he makes generative work with code. http://eps.here.ru Kir Hachaturov and Konstantin Novikov presented their team STRUTTURA, a generative AV performance team made up of designers, coders, media artists, and musicians, seen at venues like Moscow’s Circle of Light and Berlin’s Fashion Film Festival. https://www.facebook.com/kir.khachaturov https://www.facebook.com/konstantin.novikov.560 Alexandr Letcius of St. Petersburg’s TUNDRA collective specializes on algorithms for AV instruments and synths, with AV installation and performances. https://www.facebook.com/x.lezius Markus, lecturing.

Gustave "Gus" Perna, commander of Army Materiel Command. The general spoke with government and industry officials during a forum on modernization at the Association of the United States Army's annual meeting in Washington, Military.com reported.  © Photo: Pixabay China Invites Microsoft, Intel to Join Elaboration of Cybersecurity Standards "We need to face that with some stark reality, and we better do it quickly or we are going to have systems on the battlefield that we are not going to be able to operate despite the supply chain or the training of our soldiers." "We are going to have to teach them how to deal with a cyber attack," reiterated Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisitions Katharina McFarland in the same forum. "How do you think in the time of austerity, in the time of war; to have that speed to know what to do; to be able to maintain the most important capability that you need to have?" Cyber attacks may not be as clear as damage to physical objects often is, McFarland pointed out. But, "It's a big deal; they have to have the confidence to know how to come out on the other end," she said.  In June Defense One reported that the US military acknowledged that it still cannot fully test its ability to respond to catastrophic cyber attacks on civilian infrastructure and likely will not be able to until 2019. Following its Cyber Guard exercise, which gathered representatives from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI to practice fighting off a network attack on US infrastructure, Brigadier General Charles L. Moore, the Joint Chiefs of Staff deputy director for global operations, told the House Armed Services Committee, "We don’t have the scale or the complexity to truly represent a realistic and relevant threat, the ones that we’re truly trying to train to." © AP Photo/ Richard Drew CIA Director Brennan Expects New Attempts to Disclose US Election Information The Military Times reported in June on the ongoing lack of materiel and training capacity at US Cyber Command, saying that six years after the organization's creation, it still lacked a training environment for large-scale exercises necessary to evaluate its overall readiness. Cyber Command, headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland, lacks a permanent interconnected range for units to practice tactics, test weaponry and engage in conflict exercises.  "We don't have — but we need — an exercise environment where you do rehearsals, go against adversary networks, and figure out ways to better protect your own," retired Air Force Major General Jim Keffer, formerly chief of staff of Cyber Command in 2015, told Military Times. "For individual training, I think we’re really good. But the team training, the force-on-force training, that is primarily limited by a lack of a persistent training environment." At the Air Force Association’s 2016 Air, Space and Cyber Conference in late September, Air Force Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski echoed similar concerns, saying, "we have to take a serious look at cyber security for our weapon systems in ways that a couple of years ago we didn’t think about," Military.com reported. The service must understand where cyber threats to its systems originate, she said.  The service will develop a Cyber Security Engineering Team within its Life Cycle Management Center to ensure that weapons system upgrades do not introduce new threat opportunities, she said. ...

Login Register Public Release: 4-Oct-2016 EARTH: Thirsty business -- How the tech industry is bracing for a water scarce future American Geosciences Institute Share  Print  E-Mail Alexandria, VA - Server farms do the heavy lifting to meet public demand for information, from emails and tweets to credit card transactions and video streaming. Buildings that house the servers require tremendous amounts of energy to keep the servers running, and even more water to keep them functioning and cool. As the need for warehouses of servers has grown, tech giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft have started building data centers in seemingly out-of-the-way places for good reason: because the local climates can reduce the energy and water needs for the operations. Not to be left behind, the semiconductor industry - led by companies like Intel - are also innovating to reduce their water usage. The October issue of EARTH Magazine explores the multitude of ways the tech industry is trying to address the hard reality of water as a finite resource. These solutions range from submerging server rooms underwater, using creative programming to maximize processing during daily temperature cycles, employing sensing equipment, and using dry chemical reactions and high frequency sound waves to reduce water used during the cleaning processes associated with microchip development. These efforts are not just a safeguard for the environment; disruption in chip manufacturing or data centers could have the potential to wreak havoc on profits. EARTH finds that there is a community of businesses, sustainability organizations and creative engineers at the helm, navigating the tech industry into a more sustainable and predictable future, not as reliant on the natural cycles of the planet. Read the full article at: http://bit.ly/2d2m7FW. The October Issue of EARTH Magazine is now available for digital download from http://www.earthmagazine.org, or in print in the September/October dual issue. In it, you'll find stories about how lack of afterslip following the Nepal earthquake is hinting at mounting plate tensions, how clouds can form in the absence of nucleating particles, and new research that suggests that the reaches of the Milky Way may now be invisible to a third of humanity. Read these stories and many more in EARTH Magazine. ###> Keep up to date with the latest happenings in Earth, energy and environment news with EARTH Magazine online at: http://www.earthmagazine.org.

As said by Lenovo, in coming few years, the company will board on the top position of the PC market holding the highest amount of shares. As announced by the spokesperson of Lenovo, when the Indian market was flat, we kept on growing, and with this motivation, we soon will land on the zenith title. On this matter, Mr. Rajesh Thadani, Lenovo India Head and Executive Director Consumer, online and e-commerce said that we want to be the best in Indian PC market. We are on our ways to grab the shares from others and acquire the crown and soon it will be turned into reality. He further added that the company is aggressively advancing its retail presence in the country and is planning to introduce new PCs and workstation to Indian clients.  As reported by IDC, a tech market research firm, Lenovo sold out 2.14 million units of PC in the April-June 2016 quarter and witnessed a quarter-on-quarter growth of 7.2% in comparison to the declined shipment of 2.2% in the same quarter of previous year. Now the company is hoping to drive more hikes in sale and shipment in upcoming quarters.

NVDA is a great company that has a lot going for it, except for the valuation By Ryan Fuhrmann, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 4, 2016, 12:46 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Biotech Stocks to Buy for Huge Gains Recent Posts: 3 Beaten-Down Biotech Stocks to Buy for Huge Gains 3 Beaten-Down Healthcare Stocks to Buy 3 Blue-Chip Stocks With Hidden Benefits View All Posts Visual computing microchip player Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) updated its shareholders in August by reporting a number of financial records and milestones for NVDA stock. Revenue, gross margins and operating income all reached significant all-time levels, and management is rapidly pursuing a business transformation to enter growth markets. Source: via Nvidia Just a few years ago, personal computers and stodgy corporate applications represented over 40% of sales. Today, that is down to 9%. In its place are chips, applications and systems that support gaming, virtual reality and driverless car markets. It all sounds exciting, but investors could be at risk by moving wholeheartedly into unproven and competitive new markets. NVDA stock is up big so far this year (108%). The key question is whether that will continue, and whether large or upstart competitors stand a chance of squashing it in the future. What Does Nvidia Do? NVDA focuses on visual computing, which it thinks is a huge growth area. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is its biggest rival, which also happens to compete with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC); this rivalry best illustrates that Nvidia is a microchip company. Its key focus is graphic chips, and its four market segments certainly suggest that the underlying industries it serves do indeed have significant expansion potential. 7 Debt-Free Stocks That Will Survive the Coming Bear Market Its most significant segment is gaming, with Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) likely a big customer because of its PlayStation gaming franchise. NVDA boasts that its chips help gamers “enjoy immersive fantasy worlds.” Virtual reality, such as Facebook Inc’s (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift headset, is certainly a newer market, but it could really take off in the gaming space. Nvidia already has existing products in the space, including SHIELD (portable devices for mobile gaming) and GRID (cloud-based applications). Gaming accounted for $2.8 billion in revenue last year and has grown sales nearly 30% annually over the last three years. Total sales last year were just over $5 billion. Pro-Visualization is NVDA’s next largest market, though at $750 million in sales last year, it is much smaller than gaming. Growth has also been negative over the last few years, though management is hopeful its visual computing solutions for the automotive, media and entertainment industries picks up more. Datacenter and Auto each represented around $330 million of revenue last year. They are growing like gangbusters. Datacenter solutions are growing 40% annually, while auto is off the charts at 80% a year. The auto segment has perhaps the most compelling upside potential going forward. The development of self-driving cars is still in its infancy, and Nvidia plans to be a leader in the space for many years to come. The Big Picture for Nvidia Stock NVDA’s sales have consistently grown at 7% a year for a decade now. Analysts expect a rather large jump this year, with the top line growing as much as 22% to $6.1 billion. For 2017, they project growth returns to 7% and sales reach $6.5 billion. For the year, the current earnings expectation is $1.85 per share, or 20% growth from last year. Profit growth has averaged an impressive 20% for three years now, though, again, the 10-year average is right around 10%. The financial picture for NVDA stock looks very healthy. Nvidia has no long-term debt and over $5 billion in cash in the bank. Cash production is great; operating cash flow was $1.2 billion last year to double the reported net income. Capital expenditure is minimal, and annual dividends only require about $200 million to support the quarterly payout. NVDA Downsides: The Valuation and Competition For all that NVDA stock has going for it, it is far from cheap. The trailing price-to-earnings ratio is 45X and only a slightly more reasonable 36X on a forward basis. The cash flow multiple is around 20X given the company generates so much cash, but that is hardly bargain-basement level pricing for Nvidia stock.

IAM Magazine Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top patent professionals Top IP strategists International reports Events Media IPBC New research puts annual licensing return from mobile market at $14.3 billion or just over $7 a phone 04 Oct 16 < Back to Blogs Richard Lloyd Exactly how much is being made from licensing patents to mobile phone manufacturers has become a touchstone issue in recent years leading to some wildly different numbers. The perceived power that the likes of Qualcomm, Nokia and Ericsson hold over the manufacturing community was underlined by a 2014 paper from WilmerHale and Intel which estimated that on a hypothetical $400 phone the royalty stack could be in excess of $120. But according to a new paper, which studied the licensing revenues of 32 major licensors to the mobile sector, the royalty stack is likely to be much lower, accounting for just $14.3 billion in annual licensing revenues or 3.3% of the total value of the smartphone and feature phone markets in 2015. The paper, “A new dataset on mobile phone patent license royalties”, calculates that that translates to just $7.25 of the average sales price of a phone of $221.80. The authors – Professor Stephen Haber of Stanford, Professor Alexander Galetovic of the Universidad de los Andes in Chile and Lew Zaretski, the head of IP strategy firm Hamilton IPV – make clear that they are not taking a position on the level of the royalty rate. However, in joining the band of academics attempting to throw some light on this opaque subject, the trio are clearly trying to prove that the concern that patent owners are subjecting the likes of Apple and Samsung to unduly high licensing rates is unfounded. The problem for anyone looking to apply rigorous analysis to licensing rates is that most deals remain private. As a result, the paper’s authors use a mixture of publicly available material, such as financial disclosures from the largest licensors like Qualcomm, other material they can glean from the public record and estimates from those businesses where licensing revenues are not materially significant and are therefore not disclosed in financial filings. The authors appear acutely aware of the challenges and limitations in calculating licensing revenues and in the interests of full transparency include an excel spreadsheet which details all of the underlying data and their sources. In one interesting side note, the paper estimates that Huawei is earning, just on its mobile phone patents, roughly 20% of all patent revenues earned by all Chinese companies in any line of economic activity. That shows the company’s undoubted status, in patent terms at least, as China’s most powerful tech company, but also the embryonic status of the country’s outbound licensing market. I got in touch with Professor Haber and asked him why the authors had decided to write the paper. “We were motivated to undertake the study because all kinds of numbers about the "royalty stack" in a mobile phone get tossed around among academics, industry practitioners, and government officials--but many of those numbers are not generated by a theoretically-informed, empirically sound, and replicable method,” he wrote in an email. “Science has to start with the facts; with evidence dispassionately gathered.  Our purpose is to provide as comprehensive, transparent, and theoretically informed data source as is practically possible for use by other researchers, industry practitioners, and government officials.  As our paper states: "We do not take a position on whether the estimates of the royalty yield we present in this study are 'too high,' 'too low,' or 'just right.'   That is an important debate, but it can only be joined on the basis of evidence."  Haber points out that the authors are building on the work of others (the paper cites previous studies by Keith Mallinson and J Gregory Sidak) so they are not the first to contradict the sky-high royalty estimates made by some. Such is the nature of this debate that it will likely run for a little while yet, but this latest piece is a valuable contribution to a very hot topic.  Sectors Licensing Patents IP business IP valuation Comments RE: New research puts annual licensing return from mobile market at $14.3 billion or just over $7 a phone Interesting: I remember a talk given by Sandeep Chennasekhu of Ericsson Mobile at LES Scandinavia, 2005 in which he stated that licensing fees were 15% of the costs of their phones (7% for tech licensing, 8% for "essential IPR) compared with only a total of 3% in 2000 and he was expecting that it would increase to 20% by 2010. I wonder whether Apple, Samsung, Lenovo or any of the other current major manufacturers have made any comments on the paper by Haber and his colleagues?

By Teena Maddox | October 4, 2016, 7:15 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Getty Images, eternalcreative VMware and APX Labs are partnering on a new solution that could make smart glasses more enterprise-friendly, the pair announced on Tuesday at AirWatch Connect in Atlanta. The new, integrated solution improves management and support of smart glasses for professional users. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter The solution combines APX Labs' Skylight platform with VMware's AirWatch enterprise mobility management (EMM) platform in order to allow IT administrators to manage smart glasses, ensure compliance with security policies, and configure user-specific variables using a single device management console. VMware is also collaborating with Atheer, Intel, ODG and VUZIZ Corp. to deliver wearable management and app delivery solutions at scale. "This will reduce the burden of IT admins not needing to touch every single device to make sure everything is configured right," said Jay Kim, CSO of APX Labs. SEE: AirWatch Connect: VMware boosts unified endpoint management, BYOD security with new features (TechRepublic) Smart glasses and augmented reality are a growing component of the enterprise. Earlier this year, a Tech Pro Research report, Virtual and Augmented Reality in the Enterprise: Cost factors, benefits, future plans, revealed that 67% of companies not already using AR are considering it at their organization, and another 39% of companies are already using it. This shows a strong interest in AR, and integrated solutions that save money could help further drive adoption, since cost was deemed as a critical factor by 92% of respondents in the report. The new device management solution from VMware and APX Labs includes: Simplified workflows in initial deployments and post-deployment management of smart glasses. Significantly reduced overhead for managing end-to-end configurations on smart glasses. Streamlined on-boarding experiences, network setup and application deployment. Minimized enterprise security risk of deploying smart glasses through management, provisioning, blacklisting, and end-to-end data protection. "Previously, companies have had to manage smart glasses nearly one pair at a time. That worked when there were only a handful of smart glasses in use, but is simply not sustainable once an organization is ready to deploy hundreds and thousands of pairs of smart glasses across their hands-on workforce," said Ramon T. Llamas, research manager for IDC's wearables team, in a press release. "Enabling IT administrators to more easily manage and secure these devices at scale and in a way that administrators already manage other smart connected devices is incredibly important. This capability and partnership is a natural extension to enterprise mobility, and is a real win for customers." The enterprise will be able to more quickly adopt wearables as a result of this new solution, Kim said, explaining that it will drive additional deployments and additional scale because it will make wearables easier and more cost efficient to deploy and manage. "It's a huge milestone moment for APX because this was a capability we'd been working with our customers' IT departments to bring to life. It's been challenging to scale our deployments without this in place," Kim said. Brian Ballard, CEO of APX Labs, said in a press release: "The integration with VMware AirWatch is also significant for our Skylight platform as it helps in 'future-proofing' our clients' investment in smart glasses. The AR smart glasses hardware landscape is growing and is quite dynamic. So, as companies gain more experience with these new types of devices and deploy them at scale, it will be handled from the same enterprise mobility management platform, providing a significant advantage in reduction of overall IT overhead, time and total cost of ownership." Three takeaways for TechRepublic readers: VMware and APX Labs have partnered to create a fully integrated enterprise solution for managing deployment and support for smart glasses. The new solution could accelerate the adoption of smart glasses in the enterprise because it makes the devices easier and more cost efficient to manage. A Tech Pro Research report showed that 67% of companies not already using AR are considering it in the future, which could set the stage for growing smart glasses adoption.

Pay $30 Billion For NXP Semiconductors? Will the world’s largest mobile chipmaker also become the largest vendor of automotive chips? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 4, 2016 at 10:24AM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the largest mobile chipmaker in the world, is reportedly in talks to acquire Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) for over $30 billion. NXP became the world's largest automotive chipmaker last year after acquiring rival Freescale for nearly $12 billion. Let's discuss why Qualcomm might be interested in buying NXP, and whether or not it can afford such a massive purchase. Image source: Qualcomm. Why Qualcomm needs NXP Analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and earnings to each decline about 8% this year for two main reasons. First, its chipmaking division -- which generates most of its revenue -- is ceding market share to cheaper mobile rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Second, the higher-margin licensing division, which generates most of the company's profits with licensing fees for 3G and 4G technologies, remains under pressure from defiant OEMs and government regulators. These parties believe that Qualcomm's cut (3% to 5% of the wholesale price of each smartphone sold worldwide) makes it too hard to profit from sales of low-margin smartphones. In response, Qualcomm is diversifying into new markets beyond smartphones and tablets. These adjacent markets include wearables, drones, smart appliances, connected cars, and various other gadgets across the Internet of Things (IoT). To accelerate that expansion, Qualcomm acquired IoT chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion last year and launched specialized Snapdragon chips for wearables, drones, cars, and other devices. Image source: Getty Images. However, other rival chipmakers are eyeing the same markets. Intel, which faces stagnant growth in PC and data center chips, launched its own IoT division in late 2013. Nvidia has expanded aggressively into the auto industry with chips for infotainment systems, ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), and turnkey solutions for autonomous cars. To widen its moat against these challengers, Qualcomm must make a game-changing move like buying NXP. In addition to making Qualcomm the 800-pound gorilla in connected cars and giving it competitive bundling opportunities, gaining NXP's NFC chip business would boost Qualcomm's content share in iPhones and other devices -- thus reducing the impact of its loss of some iPhone modem orders to Intel in the iPhone 7. But can Qualcomm afford NXP? NXP stock currently has a 5-year PEG ratio of 0.7. Since a PEG ratio under 1 is considered undervalued, NXP is considered cheap relative to its growth potential. Buying NXP could add nearly $10 billion to Qualcomm's projected revenues of $23.7 billion next year, giving it a robust third business unit to offset declines at the chipmaking and licensing segments. However, $30 billion would still be a huge amount for Qualcomm to pay. Qualcomm finished last quarter with $5.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $11.2 billion in marketable securities. It's also shouldering $1.7 billion in short-term debt and $10 billion in long-term debt. Therefore, any deal would require Qualcomm to pay in stock and cash, and take on more debt to make up the difference. However, taking on more debt now, before the Fed further raises interest rates, would likely be a smart long-term move. But it cannot be ignored that buying NXP would significantly increase Qualcomm's debt -- which was non-existent before it financed $10 billion in buybacks with debt last year -- to historically high levels. If it went through with the acquisition it wouldn't be surprising if Qualcomm suspended its buybacks after buying NXP. However, I doubt that Qualcomm will stop raising its dividend, which has been hiked annually for 13 consecutive years and is easily covered by its free cash flow. But let's not get ahead of ourselves Shares of NXP have surged after the rumors initially appeared in the Wall Street Journal. But the subsequent rally boosted NXP's enterprise value to $33 billion, indicating that an acquisition premium has already been priced in. The Journal also claims that Qualcomm is exploring other deals, and that a potential deal probably wouldn't be struck for at least two to three months. So if the deal falls through, NXP could give up its gains very quickly. Qualcomm would certainly benefit from buying NXP -- but the acquisition buzz is all speculative for now.

It’s understood OpenSDS was presented to Linux Foundation reps on a recent visit to China. The idea is that vendors’ products would plug into one side of the finished OpenSDS and third parties’ tools and software, such as Docker, Kubernetes or OpenStack, into the other. OpenSDS aims to replace the litany of proprietary management frameworks underpinning storage. It's analogous to the Eclipse Framework in software tools from the 2000s. Eclipse eradicated an entire culture of proprietary IDE frameworks for something that was open and extensible. Eclipse not only brought down barriers to development for IDE plug-in providers, it also saved the IDE makers the cost and time to constantly update their individual frameworks' IDE plumbing. Cameron Bahar, Huawei storage senior vice president and global chief technology officer, told The Reg at LinuxCon, Berlin, that some storage vendors have as many as 37 storage management frameworks in their own companies - although he wouldn’t name names. Some vendors have open-sourced elements of their own management tools and drivers over the years, but they have generally aimed at solving specific issues and have followed lobbying by big names such as Intel. With OpenSDS, however, Huawei wants to sweep away this piecemeal approach. Dell EMC is understood to have this week gained legal clearance to join OpenSDS. A formal announcement on all new members is planned for a future date. "All the vendors are talking," Bahar said - adding there are no commitments yet. He stressed the importance of customer involvement in OpenSDS. "This is not just a vendor-driven effort - we are in discussions with enterprises and telcos. We are inviting customers and vendors to join this effort." For those customers, he said, OpenSDS promised greater openness and choice. "Customers will get to manage multi-vendor and multi-orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes, OpenStack and Mesos." The point is to get vendor support and bring lots of vendors together, the CTO said. “There’s an opportunity for Dell EMC and others that would like people to interoperate.” Bahar said he reckoned more storage firms would join OpenSDS once there is a critical mass of names. This would mean less lock-in through the storage management layer and genuine competition among firms on the capabilities and features of their storage hardware and software rather than the controller. Also, it would mean customers could quickly take advantage of new trends moving through storage, such as containers and cloud, as developers could easily target the open framework rather than waiting on the storage vendors themselves to update their own proprietary software. OpenSDS would define the interfaces, common management APIs and simple orchestration that would be made generally available to the community and updated on an ongoing basis through open source. The framework would provide the discovery, provisioning and orchestration and potentially be capable of talking to virtualized, containerised and bare metal environments. Two open-source projects that would immediately benefit are Kubernetes and OpenStack. Kubernetes must be implemented differently for each vendor's storage controllers despite the fact that it is solving the same issue of persistent storage. Using OpenSDS, just a single agent could be developed. OpenStack, meanwhile, does have the Manilla and Cinder projects for file share and volumes but lacks basic storage management functionality for discovery, configuration and management. Again, a single agent could be built through OpenSDS that would solve this. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Linux's NFV crew: Operators keen to ditch clunky networks, be 'cool' like, er, Facebook OPNFV Summit Moving as fast as embiggened bods can shift 9 Comments Shall we Drupal 8?

PlatformPlayStation 4Xbox One DeveloperFiraxis Publisher2K Games Reviewed OnXbox One Release Date September 30, 2016.   Despite our best efforts, stunning tactical thinking and snazzy wardrobe choices, it would appear that we lost the war with our alien invaders sometime after the events of XCOM: Enemy Within. Worse still, they now rule us under the guise of an organisation called “Advent” who lord over us like, well, overlords, enforcing curfews and totalitarian laws and stealing us away in the night to experiment on. Your “character”, XCOM’s tactical Commander, is imprisoned in a forced coma, alien-human hybrids patrol the streets, they’ve closed every branch of John Lewis, and the world is generally a very bleak and distressing place. Welcome back. Luckily, those plucky few who strove to defend our Earth are still around, beaten but not defeated, forgotten but not gone. Interestingly, if you play the tutorial you’re tasked with rescuing yourself from an Advent holding facility. Becoming an underground guerrilla organisation doesn’t seem to have phased XCOM, who still pull ex-soldiers from all over the globe and outfit them with the coolest new tech, but who now operate from aboard an Avengers-style heli-carrier named, ironically, the Avenger. As with the last game, it’s worth playing the tutorial once to get the feel of the game and its systems, but then you’d be advised to restart immediately and skip it. It’s very restrictive for the first 30 to 60 minutes, dictating who lives and dies in the initial encounter, and even what to do when you first return to active duty alongside returning character Colonel Bradford (now older and more grizzled), and newbies Dr Tygan and Lily Shen (daughter of the last game’s late Chief Engineer). By skipping the tutorial you can earn promotions for all four deployed soldiers in the first mission, and you’re free to build whatever room you want initially instead of having to do what you’re told. The Avenger is a re-purposed alien ship and, as such, is still being rebuilt. That means clearing debris in the middle are of the craft and installing your own rooms. The Guerrilla Tactics facility, for example, allows you to increase your squad size, give your characters permanent buffs and even train a rookie in a specific class so you don’t have to wait for fate to assign it, while the Proving Ground allows you to develop specialist gear for specific missions, such as the brain-draining Skulljack, or research experimental grenades and ammo types. Power and space are of primary concern here, but if you want to do well outside the Avenger you’ll also need to be gathering Intel, which is used as a currency for recruiting soldiers, establishing communications with global resistance cells, and scanning potential hot spots. Supplies, on the other hand, equal cash, which is the second currency and the one that makes research and development possible. If you want to outfit your squads with plated armour, magnetic weaponry and advanced scopes, you’ll need plenty of money. If you played Enemy Unknown or indeed Within, you’ll feel right at home when your feet hit the ground. XCOM 2 changes very little in terms of the overall mechanics, instead tweaking, refining and adding to what was already there. Assault units are now Rangers, and can use a close-combat melee attack on an enemy; Medics are now “Specialists” and work with a drone to either assist your squad or harry the enemy and hack their systems; Heavies have become Grenadiers, and Snipers are Sharpshooters. While the basic abilities remain the same, the branching paths are much more defined. For example, the Sharpshooter can choose Sniper or Gunslinger perks, the former of which make them deadlier at a distance, and the latter of which increase their lethality with a sidearm, allowing them to devastate enemies with pinpoint accuracy up close. Once again, you’re responsible for everything about your soldier from their name, country of origin and their voice to their appearance, class, skill progression and gear. Losing a favourite to a silly mistake is incredibly upsetting, and it adds an element of tension that never loses its effectiveness. You’re always worried for your soldiers, and the longer they’re with you, the more attached you get. Missions vary nicely, tasking you to escort VIPs, clear out alien bases, raid supply lines, hack their mainframes or rescue civilians. Sometimes you’ll embark on a mission just to rescue a new Engineer or Scientist who will speed up your construction and research on the Avenger. Story missions see you raiding or infiltrating Advent “Blacksites” in order to slow progress in the Avatar Project, a world-ending program developed by Advent that acts as the “doomsday clock”. Once the progress bar is complete, you have only 20 in-game days to save the world. It doesn’t feel as restrictive as Enemy Unknown’s timer, thankfully, and you still have plenty of time to complete side missions and level up your soldiers and base. Movement around the grid-based map is the same as before, as is the turn-based combat, and it’s all about positioning your soldiers, flanking the enemy and working as coordinated team to bring down the enemy threat. Lone wolfs don’t survive for long, and reckless Commanders lose soldiers fast as Advent will often punish a mistake with ruthless efficiency. Unless increased by a buff or item, characters only have limited movement options. You can either attack first and stay where you are, dash over double the distance of normal movement but take no second action, or move within a limited space and then use an action afterwards, either to shoot, throw a grenade, heal an ally or hack a computer. In a nice touch, some enemies now drop lootable gear upon death, which you’ll need to salvage within only a few turns. Particularly in the early game, the random number generator (RNG) that controls your hit/dodge chance is horribly one-sided. Your operatives often struggle to land shots with 80% chances of success, while the enemy rarely misses. As your squad develop, they improve, but XCOM 2 remains a challenging game throughout. Certain enemies are simply nightmarish; even the lowly Sectoids, now evolved since their Enemy Unknown appearance, can be a challenge, as they’re able to revive dead Advent soldiers and confuse, blind or even mind-control your troops. If nothing else, XCOM 2 keeps you on the back foot at all times. Sadly, the multiplayer element still feels tacked-on, and simply isn’t played by enough people to guarantee a game against any but the well-honed. You can field Advent squads, which is very cool, but the actual gameplay remains mostly the same. Except this time, you’re not only dealing with the RNG, you’re also dealing with free-thinking human opponents who either know how to beat you or know how to cheese you. It’s fun enough, but the maps are the same as the ones you see in the campaign and the overall atmosphere is no different. XCOM 2 on consoles comes with DLC that, among other things, allows you to field a Mech and sets Terminator-hard aliens on you that will test even the strongest military mind – even on the Rookie setting. Despite that, though, it’s very much business as usual. It’s an evolution, not a revolution, and one that suffers from some terrible porting hangovers. While the minute to minute combat runs well enough, there are terrible bouts of slowdown during the loading screens, and it has crashed on me three times so far. It can also be very glitchy, with characters clipping through the environment, running on the spot, teleporting to different areas, or stuttering when they run from cover to cover. But aside technical issues and gripes with the difficulty, XCOM 2 is a massively enjoyable, engrossing game. The atmosphere is palpable and the sense of paternity or maternity you feel for your force of operatives never fails to deliver a unique and exciting experience. Bringing everyone through a successful mission unscathed rewards you with a tremendous feeling of achievement. Nothing ground-breaking, then, but a worthy follow-up to one of the best tactical action games out there. Review code provided by publisher. Read our original PC version review.

Tuesday October 4, 2016 09:40 PM GMT+8 ICYMI The Edit: Must-visit destinations in 2017 The Edit: Killers release Christmas compilation Secret hero’s burial for Marcos draws street protests Trump taps Sessions for AG, Pompeo for CIA, insider says Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article The X2 Concept is a subtly stunning show car that will go into production within the next two years as a crossover coupe. ― AFP picPARIS, Oct 4 ― At this year’s Paris Motor Show, BMW officially unveiled a facelifted 3 Series Gran Turismo, a 300km range version of its plug-in electric i3 city car, a new electric scooter and the X2 Concept, a subtly stunning show car that will be going into production within the next two years as a crossover coupe. However, the biggest line of questioning aimed at the company’s global head of Sales and Marketing, Dr. Ian Robertson, was about what is coming next in terms of connected and autonomous cars. Perhaps that’s unsurprising given that BMW is a one-third owner in the hugely ambitious HERE mapping and car data platform and that it recently announced an equally ambitious partnership with Intel and Mobileye that aims to build a completely autonomous production car within the next five years. “The next big step will be the iNext, in 2021,” said Robertson about the car that will not only boast self-driving skills but also an alternative powertrain and cutting-edge connectivity. However, in the process of building this next-generation car, current generation buyers will also benefit. “Along the way, [its] technology will spread through the brand,” he explains. BMW is at the pinnacle of what’s possible with internal combustion engines, but doesn’t trying to be a leader in the tech world go against the philosophy of a brand that is all about driving passion? “I think the two things go together,” responds Robertson. “The DNA of BMW always was innovation and technology. That’s what we are, that’s what we’ve always been and that’s what our brand stands for. It’s what our customers expect so you can expect us to keep pushing those boundaries. The fact that we now have thousands of software engineers ― that’s part of that development.” Driving pleasure and the autonomous world But even with a burgeoning tech department, to bring real-time connectivity and alerts to fruition that cut accidents, eradicate congestion and take the pain out of motoring, BMW needs Intel supercomputing and Mobileye vision systems. “We wanted to drive this forward,” explains Robertson. And where the partners want to drive it to is to the point where it is a secure, cloud-based platform with phenomenal real-time data crunching skills that is “Open source so that other parties will be able to use it,” Robertson points out. Initially it will use real-time data from BMWs, Audis and Mercedes cars but anyone will be able to integrate the system into their production cars, boosting its capability while reducing industry reliance on tech firms such as Google. Real-time mapping and traffic alerts are things that all types of drivers and all types of cars would benefit from, but the move to full autonomous driving could still be a big gamble for BMW, a company obsessed with driver dynamics. Robertson is quick to disagree. For the moment at least, the technology will make driving even better. “I’m driving a new 7 series. It is semi-autonomous. I drive the first 25km in an autobahn environment, unrestricted. I drive over 250km/h. It makes me feel good in the morning and in the evening. But the last 10km are always in bumper-to-bumper traffic. I stick it into the mode that allows semi autonomy. I don’t need to use my feet any more. I can take my hands off the wheel, I can take my eyes off the road, briefly, and that for me is marrying the autonomous world with sheer driving pleasure in an urban environment because not all of it is that much fun.” ― AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week VW to present new brand strategy in coming weeks, says brand chief Mercedes-Benz C63 S Coupe launched in Malaysia China SUV wars to heat up as Volkswagen unveils two new models Singapore ready to test self-driving electric scooter Jaguar XKSS: Resurrecting the original supercar (VIDEO) Mercedes-Benz C63 S Coupe launched in Malaysia Mazda SKYACTIV: What is it all about?

VMware AirWatch announces support for smart glasses Posted Oct 4, 2016 by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story This crazy mod shaves off the edges of the iPhone using gigantic saw and belt sander Turns out Dreamforce isn’t the only enterprise conference going on this week. VMware is also holding its at AirWatch Connect conference in Atlanta, and today it announced support for enterprise smart glasses on the AirWatch enterprise mobility management platform. Smart glasses, which are essentially computers that sit on your face, haven’t found widespread usage quite yet, but the market is expected to grow to 16 million units by 2020, according to data from Gartner analyst Angela McIntyre. The deal puts agreements in place to work with some of the leading providers of smart glasses including APX Labs, Atheer, Intel, ODG and VUZIX Corp to help companies using these devices to streamline onboarding, connect the devices to company networks and deploy applications that run on the smart glasses. One of the things holding back more widespread use of these devices in the enterprise could possibly be a lack of management tools for IT to manage them the way they do other devices inside the organization. Brian Ballard, CEO of APX Labs thinks this agreement could be a big step forward in helping mainstream these devices in the enterprise. “Having wearable management now built into the VMware AirWatch Enterprise Mobility ManagementTM platform is a huge step forward in removing barriers to large scale adoption across the type of global customers we work with, and that’s paramount to not only our growth, but the growth of the entire industry,” Ballard said in a statement. These types of mobile devices could include computers worn on your face like Google Glass or augmented and virtual reality scenarios, depending on the requirements. They could be particularly useful in places where it’s difficult or dangerous to use your hands, and the computer could project instructions on what to do next, and even show you how to do it. It’s still very early days for these types of devices in the enterprise, and while big companies like GE and Boeing are experimenting with their usage inside their organizations, a deal like this could help push the industry forward and take it out of the realm of experimentation and help push it into the mainstream. It’s worth noting that Microsoft Hololens is noticeably absent from this announcement. That could be because initial support coming later this quarter will only involve devices running Android.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Business SGI Introduces Unique Scale-out Solution for SAP HANA® that Protects Investments When Moving to Real-time Business PR-Inside.com: 2016-10-04 15:02:01 SGI also surpasses 800 Terabyte (TB) milestone for total scale-up systems running SAP HANA MILPITAS, Calif., Oct. 04, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, SGI (NASDAQ:SGI), a global leader in high-performance solutions for compute, data analytics and data management, announced that enterprises can now leverage the Intel-based SGI UV 300H server in a multi-node cluster (scale out) to run SAP® Business Warehouse (SAP BW) on SAP HANA® or new SAP BW/4HANA. Unique to SGI, the cluster nodes can later be reconfigured as single-node systems with 1 to 32TB of shared memory (scale up) to run SAP S/4HANA® and other real-time applications. SGI also announced that deployments of the SGI UV 300H as a single-node system provide in total over 800 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity to organizations running the SAP HANA platform. These announcements reflect SGI's broadening leadership in high-performance data analytics and continuing innovation to achieve greater insight and gain competitive advantage with SAP HANA. SGI UV 300H is now SAP-certified under general availability in a clustered scale-out configuration to run SAP BW on SAP HANA or SAP BW/4HANA, using four to sixteen 8-socket nodes and up to 56 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity. When business lines wish to move to real-time analytics utilizing SAP Business Suite on SAP HANA, SAP Bank Analyzer, SAP S/4HANA Finance, or other SAP S/4HANA applications, the clustered systems can be fully repurposed to form single-node systems with 4 to 32 sockets. By avoiding the need to "rip and replace" multi-node clusters when single-node systems are required, IT organizations can enjoy considerable cost savings by protecting investments and reduce time to solution. More than 100 single-node SGI UV 300H systems have been installed in organizations worldwide to provide data analytics in real time with SAP HANA and enable business lines to know when, where and how customers are buying without delay; view inventories, supply chains or financials with up-to-the-second accuracy; and spot market changes early and adjust with precision. These SGI systems deliver in total over 800 Terabytes of in-memory computing capacity - reflecting customer capacity growth in excess of 300% over the past twelve months.

AMD’s PRO lines of processors are akin to their consumer counterparts, except they run a guaranteed lifecycle of support with ‘image stability’ (guaranteed OS images) and extended OEM warranties. AMD’s PRO line typically covers both embedded systems via the BGA lower parts and commercial/enterprise systems with socketed units. This week AMD is announcing their PRO line using the latest AMD microarchitecture, Bristol Ridge, along with continued support for customer requested features. If you’ve ever browsed for an OEM system, or in a brick-and-mortar shop, you may have come across a system labeled something along the lines of ‘PRO A8’ using an AMD APU. I recently wrote a small news piece which involved an HP system in my local store with an OEM-only APU. These PRO parts enable an OEM to build a particular system, either as a business-to-business sale or directly to customers, and guarantee a fixed longevity for replacements to that system. This is a requirement for a lot of government and business electronic installations – the ability to replace like-for-like in the event of failure. AMD states that the unit shipments of their PRO processor line for commercial, enterprise and the public sector has risen by 45% since mid-2014, or a 20.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The processors announced today are direct analogues of the consumer grade processors announced a couple of weeks ago, identical in specifications but with PRO in the name and a direct focus on support structures, management, virtualization, security and performance comparisons. AMD 7th Generation Bristol Ridge PRO Processors   Modules/ Threads L2 Cache CPU Base /  Turbo (MHz) GPU SPs GPU Base /  Turbo (MHz) TDP PRO A12-9800 2M / 4T 2 MB 3800 / 4200 512 800 / 1108 65W PRO A10-9700 2M / 4T 2 MB 3500 / 3800 384 720 / 1029 65W PRO A8-9600 2M / 4T 2 MB 3100 / 3400 384 655 / 900 65W PRO A6-9500 1M / 2T 1 MB 3500 / 3800 384 720 / 1029 65W   PRO A12-9800E 2M / 4T 2 MB 3100 / 3800 512 655 / 900 35W PRO A10-9700E 2M / 4T 2 MB 3000 / 3500 384 600 / 847 35W PRO A6-9500E 1M / 2T 1 MB 3000 / 3400 256 576 / 800 35W All these processors will support DDR4-2400 as standard, and offer USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) support via the appropriate chipset and Type-C with a re-driver chip to support reversible insertion (this is the same as the consumer platform). These new processors are all socketed parts designed for the AM4 platform for now, with BGA components likely to be declared later down the line. With the PRO APUs, AMD uses an ARM Cortex-A5 to implement ARM TrustZone, offering software agnostic (compared to Intel which does not) support for hardware-based security. This includes Secure Boot, Content Protection, per-Application security, fTPM 2.0, and support for Microsoft Device Guard, Windows Hello, independent fingerprint security, data protection and Bitlocker, among other things. AMD supports this via the DASH management protocol, which is ultimately CPU agnostic and allows users of other DASH systems to get up to speed. AMD is positioning the APUs to be comparable to various Intel counterparts. Performance-wise, for the launch, AMD states that in small form factors at 35W and mid-tier at 65W, performance compared to Intel is within 8% for the CPU, but AMD can offer +50-95% in graphics based or graphics accelerated workloads. In this case, AMD was positioning the PRO A12-9800E against the Core i5-6500T for the CPU comparison, and the PRO A12-9800 against the i5-6500 for the graphics comparison. We’ve asked to get these processors in for testing in order to compare. The first systems using the new 7th Gen PRO APUs will be a set of HP Elitedesk 705 G3 systems, in Mini, SFF and mini-tower form factors. Due to the way these commercial systems are promoted, pricing and specifications will depend highly on the support contract aligned with the business customers. AMD is keen to point out that other customers will release their Bristol Ridge PRO based systems over the coming months.

Reply ilt24 - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Are you going to do any Bristol Ridge benchmarking? Reply ddriver - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Why bother, it says it is 17% faster than i5 LOL... Now, I don't doubt that its iGPU will be faster than the vanilla intel iGPU, but those 17% better "system performance" makes me skeptical. Probably some abstract term that has little to nothing to do with CPU performance. Reply MrSpadge - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Only with OpenCL acceleration in a few hand-picked corner cases. Reply Meteor2 - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link That 17% claim is bizarre, when their previous slides suggest parity for 'system' performance against an i5, at best. I've looked through the slides and can't see how they can claim that. Reply KOneJ - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link There is a footnote stating that the 17% greater performance was comparing the Intel Core i5-6500T with the AMD A12-9800E, which both officially have a 35W TDP. They can claim that under a particular benchmark (I may very well be mistaken but I think that it's PCMark Home 8. Don't quote me on that though.) which takes into account both the CPU and the iGPU performance and how it affects "productivity" across a variety of workloads. The parity is the A12-9800 with a 65W TDP against the i5-6500 with a 65W TDP. AMD compares favorably in the given benchmark at lower power envelopes due to the strength of the APU's iGPU. Don't get me wrong, but while I prefer AMD to Intel for both their product and the philosophy/principles/attitude, and I am a huge advocate for Bulldozer not having been Faildozer but rather a decent CMT uArch that got screwed by compilers under Windoze (In contrast with Gentoo...) and had difficulty with power efficiency and platform aging for servers, I can't argue that under Windoze for CPU-related tasks in general, the 17% claim is slated the wrong way. Yes, the APU's GCN-based iGPU smokes Intel's HD Graphics iGPUs (Iris [Pro] comes closer though that gets a lot more complex...), and yes, for people who play games at basic settings, it makes more sense without a dGPU, the fact is that if you're not rendering anything with the iGPU, the i5 is the better chip. Furthermore, it isn't known what the precise memory configurations were and performance varies from motherboard to motherboard. It may have been the i5 was running on an H110 motherboard with 3200MHz CL15 RAM running at 2133MHz since only Z170/X99 can use XMP OC profiles for DDR4, while the A12 was running on an X370 chipset motherboard with the same RAM at their maximum frequencies, boosting the iGPU. Or maybe not. The foot-note may have provided more info, or perhaps it didn't. Even then, ambient temperatures, airflow, thermal compound, and the CPU cooler used can all affect performance. I'm sure AMD's marketing department did their best to favor their new product no differently than Intel would. Again, not at all hating on AMD, and hating a little on Intel for some of their anti-competitive nature (I still consider Intel to be a very decent company, unlike Nvidia...), but those numbers were pulled from a marketing hat under narrow circumstances and should be disregarded. Under Windoze for most tasks that most people encounter mot of the time, the i5 is definitely the better chip. I any case, I hope this was enlightening. Cheers Reply lmcd - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link Consider paragraph breaks, less things like "Windoze," and fewer anecdotes. Reply Meteor2 - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link I found it very interesting! Reply Enverex - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link "Iris [Pro] comes closer" - It doesn't. The Iris Pro series (e.g. 6200 and 580) massively outperform AMD's top APU. I'd agree if you were comparing the low-end basic ones they use, but not the Iris Pro range. Reply plonk420 - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link i assume AMD is going to be more affordable than $250...

With the election just around the corner, I'm concerned that very few of those running discuss or understand the importance of tech in our future. In a recent column, I laid out seven areas where tech is about to explode and have a major impact on our country and world. Yet I hear very little about tech growth on the campaign trail. One of the more interesting aspects of my 35 years of covering high tech has been to chronicle its role and impact on our world. It has also allowed me to see firsthand the various nuances between the worlds of tech, big business, and the US government and the changing role tech has had on the latter two. Indeed, for the first 50 years of the tech explosion, dating back to the early 1940s, Silicon Valley was quite happy to avoid the US government unless it was handing out lucrative contracts. And the feds were seemingly fine with turning a blind eye; the less the government knew about what tech companies were doing, the fewer legal and legislative issues they would have to address. But in the mid 1990s, a group of technology heavyweights led by Cisco CEO John Chambers and investor John Doerr realized that technology would permeate every aspect of business, education, and consumers' lives. And they needed the help of the US government if they were to have the kind of impact they envisioned. Even then, Chambers, Doerr, and key leaders from Intel and other tech companies saw the benefits of mobile, connected cities, and IoT. They lobbied the Clinton administration and governmental agencies under him to help officials understand tech and its eventual role in our country. To Clinton's credit, he and Vice President Al Gore opened a lot of doors to the tech industry in Washington. When George W. Bush became president, he created a special non-partisan tech advisory council, at the urging of Chambers, Doerr and Michael Dell. I was invited to join that council and our first meeting with President Bush was very promising. He seemed to understand how important technology would be for the future of the US, and I know he spent many hours with tech leaders before the election to get a grasp on their vision. But five months after our first tech council meeting at the White House, the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks shook the nation. The Bush administration's focus shifted to fighting terrorism and the tech council was put on the back burner and never revived. While key tech leaders tried to get their message heard in a broader way in Washington, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fight against terrorism took up much of the White House's mindshare. Any real focus to help expand a tech agenda during Bush's years in office was minimal. //Related Articles Are You Ready to Share the Road With Driverless 'Ghost' Cars? When President Obama entered the White House, many of these same tech leaders along with new and younger tech visionaries pushed him and his administration to become more focused on the role of tech at all levels of business. He and his administration have done so and made an effort to understand things like the maker movement, the IoT and its role in cities, and issues related to telecom spectrum. During his presidency, we have seen the Internet and the cloud become a core asset within government, business, education, and consumer programs. But we are now at another presidential transition point and, given the recent advancements in tech, whoever is elected president or to serve in Congress needs to be more tech-savvy than ever. During his keynote at Intel's Developer Forum this week, CEO Brian Krzanich invited Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of GE, to the stage to talk about the various things GE is doing to make cities more intelligent. He also had an executive from BMW share its vision for autonomous vehicles. Both emphasized the role legislators will play in the success of these programs. For smart cities and smart cars to succeed, laws will need to be changed or written to make it possible for autonomous cars to drive safely within city limits. Lawmakers will have to approve the placement of new sensors and smart cameras to enhance accident avoidance. State officials will have to understand how technology will impact every corner as gadgets are added to streets, light poles, and intersections. Unless our elected officials understand this, they will only slow down the expansion.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search DBS IT Australia Weighs in on Australia's Cyber Security Skills Shortage Perth-based custom software development company DBS IT Australia has recently responded to a report revealing that Australia is feeling the lack of professionals working in cyber security more acutely than other countries.   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * It Support * It Support Services By Industry: * TechnologyPERTH, Australia - Oct. 4, 2016 - PRLog -- Custom software development company DBS IT Australia has recently responded to a report revealing that Australia is feeling the lack of professionals working in cyber security more acutely than other countries. The Centre for Strategic and International Studies performed a survey which was commissioned by Intel Security, and it revealed that 88% of decision makers in Australian IT agree that there's a shortage of people with skills in cyber security both within Australia and in their individual organisations. The report, Hacking the Skills Shortage is a study of the shortage in cybersecurity skills internationally, and IT decision makers from the United Kingdom, France, Israel, the United States, Germany, Japan, Australia and Mexico answered a number of questions about cybersecurity. Respondents across all countries surveyed said that education in cybersecurity was deficient. 82% of those surveyed reported a shortage of skills, and 76% said they believe that their government isn't investing enough money in cybersecurity talent. DBS IT Australia recently weighed in on the results, and a spokesperson for the company had this to say: "It seems that almost every day we read about another company that has been hacked, and attacks are outpacing defence- largely due to the lack of cybersecurity skills both in Australia and internationally. This shortfall means that many companies have a critical vulnerability since current education and policies are failing to meet the demand for these skills. At DBS IT, we're committed to providing secure software solutions to prevent hacking and ensure that businesses across all sectors in Australia can keep their data safe and confidential." The most frequent skills currently in demand include secure software development, intrusion detection, and attack mitigation. Interestingly, 97% of those surveyed said that their organisation's board of directors are now viewing cybersecurity as important. This is a huge change, as just five years ago cybersecurity was not even considered to be in the top 10 risks that boards were prioritising. It doesn't look like the workforce shortage for cybersecurity will be abating anytime soon, and respondents estimated that on average, 15% of cybersecurity positions would be unfilled by 2020, with Australian respondents estimating this number at 17%. This skill shortage is risky for organisations, and many companies say that this gap in the workforce has already caused them to incur damages. Many businesses have been targeted by hackers, with 25% of respondents saying that their companies have lost propriety data due to this gap in cybersecurity skills, and 22% saying that they've suffered reputational damage. What does this mean for businesses in Australia that need to keep data safe? The DBS IT spokesperson says it's not all bad news: "While it's definitely a problem that Australia (and many other countries around the world) are facing such a skills shortage in cybersecurity, many are choosing to outsource these tasks instead of hiring dedicated specialists to work in-house. At DBS IT, we work with many different companies, providing software development, cyber security and IT management and we can help businesses both large and small protect their data."

Image: Aslysun/Shutterstock As well as two new smartphones, Google’s foray into the virtual reality (VR) world will continue with the launch of a new Daydream VR headset ‘Made by Google’ at a big reveal tonight. Google is stepping up its move into hardware with a holistic approach and more prominent branding. At a 10/4 (4 October) event today, Google is expected to reveal a slew of new hardware. Unfortunately for Google, the surprise has been marred by UK retailer Carphone Warehouse as well as Canadian stores Bell and Telus, who have already leaked the specs and renders of the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL branded smartphones, manufactured by HTC. But the latest nugget of knowledge to emerge could possibly feature an Irish connection. As well as the new smartphones, Google is expected to take the wraps off its new Daydream VR headset, which will retail for around $79. Earlier this year, we reported that Irish tech company Movidius – which was recently acquired by Intel for around $300m – signed a major deal to work on future hardware with the internet giant. It was also reported that Movidius was at the heart of Google’s plans to create a revolutionary stand-alone VR headset. The headset won’t need to be tethered to a smartphone, games console or PC to function. It could include a screen, high-powered processors and outward facing cameras using chips from Movidius, to use the camera’s feed to track the motion of the user’s head. Could Daydream VR be the same headset? It is hard to say at this point, but according to Hollywood news bible Variety, the headset will be compatible with either of the two Pixel smartphones; so it is possible that Google may still be hard at work on a stand-alone headset. Variety reported that Daydream-optimised smartphones automatically switch into VR mode when inserted into a Daydream headset. Daydream will also ship with a handheld controller similar to a Wii remote to enable navigation and game play. Made by Google According to other reports, Google is understood to be marketing the entire launch under the ‘Made by Google’ name, even though HTC is the manufacturing partner. Interestingly, HTC has manufactured its own fully fledged VR headset called the Vive. The Daydream headsets’ operating system is understood to be an extension of Android. The launch of the Pixel smartphones could see Google jettison the Nexus brand altogether. Both the Pixel and the Pixel XL smartphones will also be running the latest version of Android Nougat, which comes with support for the Daydream VR platform.

The effort to build the Thirty Meter Telescope has been held up by Hawaiians who consider it an eyesore on Mauna Kea, a beloved dormant volcano. [Thirty Meter Telescope via New York Times] MAUNA KEA, Hawaii — Little lives up here except whispering hopes and a little bug called Wekiu.

A few minutes in the sun will fry your skin. Brains and fingers go numb. At night, the stars are so close they seem tangled in your hair. Two years ago, this mountaintop was the scene of a cosmic traffic jam: honking horns, vans and trucks full of astronomers, VIPs, journalists, businesspeople, politicians, protesters and police — all snarled at a roadblock just short of the summit. Abandoning their cars, some of the visitors started to hike up the hill toward what would have been a groundbreaking for the biggest and most expensive stargazing machinery ever built in the Northern Hemisphere: the Thirty Meter Telescope, 14 years and $1.4 billion in the making. They were assembling on a plateau just below the summit, when Joshua Mangauil, better known by his Hawaiian name of Lanakila, then 27, barged onto the scene. Resplendent in a tapa cloth, beads, a red loin cloth, his jet black hair in a long Mohawk, he had hiked over the volcano's cinder cones barefoot. "Like snakes you are. Vile snakes," he yelled. "We gave all of our aloha to you guys, and you slithered past us like snakes." "For what? For your greed to look into the sky? You guys can't take care of this place." No ground was broken that day or since. To astronomers, the Thirty Meter Telescope would be a next-generation tool to spy on planets around other stars or to peer into the cores of ancient galaxies, with an eye sharper and more powerful than the Hubble Space Telescope, another landmark in humanity's quest to understand its origins. But to its opponents, the telescope would be yet another eyesore despoiling an ancient sacred landscape, a gigantic 18-story colossus joining the 13 telescopes already on Mauna Kea. Later this month, proponents and opponents of the giant telescope will face off in a hotel room in the nearby city of Hilo for the start of hearings that will lead to a decision on whether the telescope can be legally erected on the mountain. Over the years, some have portrayed this fight as a struggle between superstition and science. Others view the telescope as another symbol of how Hawaiians have been unfairly treated since Congress annexed the islands — illegally in the eyes of many — in 1898. And still others believe it will bring technology and economic development to an impoverished island. "This is a very simple case about land use," said Kealoha Pisciotta, a former telescope operator on Mauna Kea who has been one of the leaders of a group fighting telescope development on the mountain for the last decade. "It's not science versus religion. We're not the church. You're not Galileo." Hanging in the balance is perhaps the best stargazing site on Earth. "Mauna Kea is the flagship of American and international astronomy," said Doug Simons, the director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. "We are on the precipice of losing this cornerstone of U.S. prestige." Big glass dreams The road to the stars once ended in California at Palomar Mountain, whose 200-inch-diameter telescope was long considered the size limit. The bigger a telescope mirror is, the more light it can capture and the fainter and farther it can see  out in space, back in time. In the 1990s, however, astronomers learned how to build telescopes with thin mirrors that relied on computer-adjusted supports to keep them from sagging or warping. There was an explosion of telescope building that has culminated, for now, in plans for three giant billion-dollar telescopes: the European Extremely Large Telescope and the Giant Magellan, both in Chile, and the Thirty Meter Telescope. Not only would they have a Brobdingnagian appetite for light, but they are designed to incorporate a new technology called adaptive optics, which can take the twinkle out of starlight by adjusting telescope mirrors to compensate for atmospheric turbulence. Richard Ellis, a British astronomer now at the European Southern Observatory in Garching, Germany, recalled being optimistic in 1999 when he arrived at the California Institute of Technology to begin developing what became known as the Thirty Meter Telescope. "The stock market was booming," he said. "Everything seemed possible." Canada, India and Japan eventually joined the project, now officially known as the TMT International Observatory. It has been helped along by the Betty and Gordon Moore Foundation, formed by the founder of Intel, which has contributed advice and $180 million. The telescope, originally scheduled to be completed by 2024, is modeled on the revolutionary 10-meter-diameter Keck telescopes that Caltech and the University of California operate on Mauna Kea. Like them, it will have a segmented mirror composed of small, hexagonal pieces of glass fitted together into an expanse wider than a tennis court. There are only a few places on Earth that are dark, dry and calm enough to be fit for a billion-dollar telescope. Rising 33,000 feet from the seafloor, Mauna Kea is the second biggest mountain in the solar system — only Olympus Mons on Mars is greater. The dormant ancient volcano has been the center of Polynesian culture — the umbilical cord connecting Earth and sky — seemingly forever. The mountain is part of so-called "ceded lands" that originally belonged to the Hawaiian Kingdom and are now administered by the state for the benefit of Hawaiians. On its spare, merciless summit, craters and cinder cones of indefinable age keep company with a variety pack of architectural shapes housing telescopes. In 1968 the University of Hawaii took out a 65-year lease on 11,000 acres for a dollar a year. Some 500 acres of that are designated as a science preserve. It includes the ice age quarry from which stone tools were being cut a thousand years ago, and hundreds of shrines and burial grounds. The first telescope went up in 1970. Many rapidly followed. Places like Mauna Kea are "cradles of knowledge," said Natalie Batalha, one of the leaders of NASA's Kepler planet-hunting mission. "I am filled with reverence and humility every time I get to be physically present at a mountaintop observatory." But some Hawaiians worried that knowledge was coming at too great a cost. "All those telescopes got put up with no thought beyond reviving the Hilo economy," said Michael Bolte, an astronomer from the University of California at Santa Cruz, who serves on the TMT board. "Not a lot of thought was given to culture issues." Some native Hawaiians complained that their beloved mountain had grown "pimples," and that the telescope development had interfered with cultural and religious practices that are protected by state law. Construction trash sometimes rolled down the mountain, said Nelson Ho, a photographer and Sierra Club leader who complained to the university. "They wouldn't listen," he said. "They just kept playing king of the mountain." An audit by the state of Hawaii in 1998 scolded the university for failing to protect the mountain and its natural and cultural resources. An environmental impact study performed by NASA in 2007 similarly concluded that 30 years of astronomy had caused "significant, substantial and adverse" harm to Mauna Kea. A step back for NASA The tide began to shift in 2001 when NASA announced a plan to add six small telescopes called outriggers to the Keck complex. The outriggers would be used in concert with the big telescopes as interferometers to test ideas a for a future space mission dedicated to looking for planets around other stars. Pisciotta led a band of environmentalists and cultural practitioners who went to court to stop NASA. The group included the Hawaiian chapter of the Sierra Club and the Royal Order of Kamehameha, devoted to restoring the Kingdom of Hawaii. Pisciotta said she had once dreamed of being a cosmologist but lacked the requisite math skills and instead took a night job operating a radio telescope on Mauna Kea. She became disenchanted when a family shrine disappeared from the summit and the plans for the outriggers impinged on a cinder cone. "Cinder cones are burial sites. It's time to not let this go on," she said. The group prepared for court by reading popular books about trials. In 2007, Hawaii's third district court found the management plan for the outriggers was flawed and revoked the building permit. "NASA packed up and left," Pisciotta said. Encountering aloha The prospective builders of the TMT knew they had their work cut out for them. In 2007, the Moore Foundation hired Peter Adler, a consultant and sociologist, to look into the consequences of putting the telescope in Hawaii. "Should TMT decide to pursue a Mauna Kea site," his report warned, "it will inherit the anger, fear and great mistrust generated through previous telescope planning and siting failures and an accumulated disbelief that any additional projects, especially a physically imposing one like the TMT, can be done properly." The astronomers picked a telescope site that was less anthropologically sensitive, on a plateau below the summit with no monuments or other obvious structures on it. They agreed to pay $1 million a year, a fifth of which would go to the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the rest to stewardship of the mountain. Quietly, they also pledged another $2 million a year toward science and technology education and workforce development on the island of Hawaii. The Moore Foundation also put some $2 million into the Imiloa Astronomy Center, a museum and planetarium run by the University of Hawaii. Bolte, a mild-mannered UCSC professor with a soothing lilt to his voice, became one of the most visible promoters of the project in community meetings. He recalled going to a meeting in Hilo once where tensions were very high. Afterward, he said, he was afraid to go out to his car. Sure enough, a crowd rushed him when he got there. "What kind of astronomy do you do?" they asked eagerly. "The aloha spirit really exists," Bolte said. "Exploring the universe is a wonderful thing humans do," he added. Nevertheless, "there was a core we never won over." "In retrospect, we might have underestimated the strength of the sovereignty movement." The Hawaiian Renaissance In the years since the first telescopes went up on Mauna Kea, Hawaiian people and culture had experienced a resurgence of pride known as the Hawaiian Renaissance. In 1976, a band of Hawaiians sailed the outrigger canoe Hokulea from Hawaii to Tahiti. The feat showed how ancient Polynesians could have purposefully explored and colonized the Pacific, navigating the seas using only the sun, stars, ocean swells and wind. "And that was the first spark of shutting up everybody who said that we were inferior, that we were not intelligent," said Mangauil, the protester. In 1978, the state recognized Hawaiian, which once had been banned from schools, as an official language. With rising pride came — at least among some more vocal native Hawaiians — questions about whether the occupation and annexation of Hawaii by the United States in the 1890s was legal. Telescopes on a sacred mountain constitute a form of "colonial violence," in the words of J. Kehaulani Kauanui, an anthropologist at Wesleyan University. Or as Robert Kirshner, a Harvard professor who is now also chief science adviser to the Moore Foundation, put it, "The question in that case become not so much whether you did the environmental impact statement right, but whose island is it?" Having cut their teeth fighting the outrigger project, Pisciotta's group, known informally as the Mauna Kea Hui, was prepared when the TMT Corp. formally selected the mountain for its site in 2009. Many Hawaiians welcomed the telescope project. At a permit hearing, Wallace Ishibashi Jr., whose family had an ancestral connection to Mauna Kea, compared the Thirty Meter's mission to the search for aumakua, the ancestral origins of the universe. "Hawaiians," he said, "have always been a creative and adaptive people." But Pisciotta and her friends argued among other things that an 18-story observatory, which would be the biggest structure on the whole island of Hawaii, did not fit in a conservation district. In a series of hearings in 2010 and 2011, the state land board approved a permit for the telescope but then stipulated that no construction could begin until a so-called contested case hearing, in which interested parties could present their arguments, was held. The walk of fame The state won that hearing, and a groundbreaking ceremony was scheduled for Oct. 7, 2014. The groundbreaking was never intended to be a public event, said Bob McClaren, associate director of the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, which is responsible for scientific activities on the mountain. "I thought it was reasonable to restrict access to those who were invited," he said. Mangauil, who makes his living teaching hula dancing and Hawaiian culture, said later that he had wanted only to make the astronomers feel uncomfortable to be on the mountain and to get protesters' signs in view of the television cameras. In an interview, he said he had nothing against science or astronomy, but did not want it on his mountain. "Our connection to the mountain is like, that's our elder, the mother of our resources," he said. "We're talking about the wau akua, the realm of where the gods live." There are no shrines on the very summit, he pointed out, which should be a lesson: Not even the most holy people are supposed to go there. Unable to get to the groundbreaking, the Hawaiians formed their own blockade. Tempers flared. "We were seeing the native Hawaiian movement flexing its muscles," Bolte said. Seeing people hiking up the mountain past the port-o-potties, Mangauil stormed after them and wound up on the hood of a ranger truck, even more angry. Guarding the Mountain Lanakila's barefoot run set the tone for two years of unrest and demonstrations. Protesters calling themselves Guardians of the Mountain set up a permanent vigil across the road from the Mauna Kea visitor center, stopping telescope construction crews and equipment from going up. Dozens were arrested. Gov. David Ige has tried to appease both sides. While saying that "we have in many ways failed the mountain," he said the Thirty Meter Telescope should go forward, but at least three other telescopes would have to come down. Astronomers and business leaders grew frustrated that the state was not doing enough to keep the road open for construction trucks and workers. "The result of the faulty law enforcement surrounding Mauna Kea is fostering tension, aggression, racism and business uncertainty," business organizations and the Hawaii Chamber of Commerce wrote to the governor. "Ambiguity surrounding the rule of law has prompted a poor economic climate." Stopping trucks on the steep slope was dangerous, said Bolte, adding that "people were basically trapped at the summit." Simons, the Canada-France-Hawaii director, grew increasingly worried about the effect of the protests on the astronomers, who became reluctant to be identified as observatory staffers. "It really tugged at us to see the staff going from being proud to scared in a matter of weeks," he said. Meanwhile Pisciotta's coalition was plugging through the courts. On Dec. 2, the Hawaiian Supreme Court revoked the telescope building permit, ruling that the state had violated due process by handing out the permit before the contested case hearing. "Quite simply, the Board put the cart before the horse when it issued the permit," the court wrote. Game of Domes By mid December, Clarence Ching, another member of the opposition, stood in a crowd with other Hawaiians and watched trucks carrying equipment retreat from the mountain. "David had beaten Goliath," he said. "We were even happy and sad at the same time — sad, for instance, that somebody had to lose — as we had fought hard and long." The court's decision set the stage for a new round of hearings, now scheduled to start in mid October. The case, presided over by Riki May Amano, a retired judge appointed by the Land Board, is likely to last longer than the first round, which consumed seven days of hearings over a few weeks, partly because there are more parties this time around. Among them is the pro-telescope Hawaiian group called Perpetuating Unique Educational Opportunities or PUEO, who contend the benefits of the TMT to the community have been undersold. Whoever wins this fall's contested case hearing, the decision is sure to be quickly appealed to the Hawaiian Supreme Court. In an interview, Edward Stone, a Caltech professor and vice president of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory, the group that will build the telescope, set April 2018 as the deadline for beginning construction. Depending on how it goes in Hawaii or elsewhere, the telescope could be ready sometime in the last half of the next decade. "We need to start building this thing somewhere," he said. "We still hope Hawaii will work," he added. "What we need is a timely permit, and we need access to the mountain once we have a permit." But there is no guarantee that even if the astronomers succeed in court they will prevail on the mountain. In an email exchange, J. Douglas Ing, lawyer for the MMT Observatory, said they were "cautiously optimistic" that local agencies would uphold the law, but the astronomers have also been investigating alternative sites in Mexico, Chile, India, China and the Canary Islands. "It's wise of the TMT to be exploring other sites," said Richard Wurdeman, the lawyer for the Mauna Kea Hui. When Pisciotta is asked what would happen if the giant telescope finally wins, she said: "It would be really hard for Hawaiian people to swallow that. It's always been our way to lift our prayers up to heaven and hope they hear us." Bolte said he had learned to not make predictions about Hawaii. In a recent email, he recalled photographing a bunch of short-eared Hawaiian owls. "These are called pueo, and they are said to be the physical form of ancestor spirits," Bolte recounted. Referring to the Hawaiian term for a wise elder, he said, "I had one kupuna tell me it was a great sign for TMT that so many pueo sought me out that trip, and another tell me it was a sign that we should leave the island immediately before a calamity falls on TMT."

By Corazon Victorino On 10/03/16 AT 11:16 PM Close Apple’s upcoming iMac may have just been leaked by Best Buy. The Richfield, Minnesota consumer electronics corporation reportedly published a page featuring a new 27-inch iMac over the weekend. According to Business Insider, the 27-inch iMac that briefly made an appearance on Best Buy’s website was not only listed as “New!” it was also revealed to be sporting Intel’s Kaby Lake Core i7 chip. With the model code K0SC0LL/A, the iMac was listed as having Retina 5K display, 32GB memory and 2TB Fusion drive.  The listing also mentioned the special features of the iMac including built-in wireless networking, a webcam and wireless keyboard and mouse. The leaked all-in-one Apple desktop computer was also revealed to be valued at $3,199.99. Though Business Insider noted that this could just be a mistake or a placeholder made by a Best Buy employee, the timing of this leak strongly suggests that the Cupertino giant is looking to refresh its Mac devices, especially its highly anticipated MacBook Pro. Related Stories Apple To Release Three New iPad Pros In Spring 2017 iPhone 6s Plus Explodes; Class Action Suits Filed Against Apple iPhone 7 Is Coming To South Korea — Should Samsung Be Worried? Meanwhile, AppleInsider claims there are a lot of inconsistencies present in the leaked entry for the 27-inch iMac. The Apple-centric site says the current iMac model with i7 processor, 23GB of RAM and 2TB Fusion drive costs $3,150, which is only $50 less than the leaked iMac’s price.  In addition, AppleInsider states that there is no sign that Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake quad-core processors are currently shipping as of this time. Hence, it is uncertain whether the 27-inch Retina 5K iMac could be housing this type of processor.  Another indication that seems suspicious according to Apple Insider is the model number of the leaked iMac. It is listed as K0SC0LL/A, and this does not conform to the model nomenclature of existing iMac devices, such as MK462, MK472 and MK482.  The leak comes more than a week after a sketchy rumor surfaced claiming that Apple is announcing its revamped MacBook Pro during a keynote presentation that is scheduled to happen on Oct. 24. Apple has yet to deny or confirm the rumor as of late, and it also isn't clear if the Cupertino giant will be launching the new MacBook Pro alongside the rumored iMac refresh.

The facial recognition aspect of Windows Hello was shown off nearly every time Microsoft got on stage for demos and it always got a very positive responses. Then the dots were connected between Windows 10 and the Intel RealSense Dev Kit for the camera hardware and suddenly we could now put Windows Hello's facial recognition to the test on our own systems. The video demo I did last July has garnered over 147,000 views to prove that everyday users are very interested in having this whiz bang technology at their disposal. However, unless you were buying new hardware with the RealSense camera technology built in then Windows Hello facial recognition remained out of reach. It is just shocking to realize that no third party hardware manufacturers were publicly planning to release a compatible Windows Hello camera/webcam to meet that demand. Then at CES 2016 we heard that two companies were planning on releasing hardware to support Windows Hello and facial recognition. One was Razer's Stargazer and the other one was from MouseComputer. Well, since then I have not heard anything about the MouseComputer offering but the Razer StarGazer is now shipping after being offered for pre-order in early September. Those pre-orders have now been shipping for the last week or so and I had one waiting for me when I returned from Microsoft Ignite. These images will show you the unboxing experience but the setup of the device is all hands off. Once the drivers were downloaded by the Device Manager the camera was ready to go. I quickly setup Windows Hello Facial recognition and the device logged me in right from the Lock Screen in my first test.

SEND ANOTHER EMAIL CLOSE share This Is What's Really Going on With Corporate Blockchain Adoption (and What Could Happen Soon) 2.4K Ash Egan and Maia Heymann - General Partner, Converge Venture Partners 10/3/16 @1:56pm in Tech 10/3/16 @1:56pm In our first post on blockchain adoption, Converge investors Ash Egan and Maia Heymann discuss blockchain: Bitcoin vs. blockchain and balancing risk with potential. This piece analyzes the barriers for blockchain and what to expect from corporate buyers. Corporations are still in the preliminary phases of exploring blockchain technology, contrary to headlines hyping the technology’s potential, and advances. Financial institutions are most interested as buyers of the technology, and are exploring dozens of use cases with varying degrees of traction. However, most corporate blockchain exploration is happening under a shroud of secrecy and decisions are kept under a tight lid, so the actual progress of corporate use cases remains largely unclear. Because corporations’ generic public comments (mostly around theoretical impact) do not represent corporate blockchain adoption,  we’re providing our take with four serious considerations around adoption. Early Experimentation One can investigate blockchain interest in two ways: reviewing blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) customers, and deciphering business development activity by consortia like R3, Hyperledger, Project Bletchley, and Paxos (previously ItBit). U.S. based corporations are cognizant of the regulatory environment and as a result almost exclusively look into the permissions space, also refereed to as private blockchains, that would replace expensive and complicated systems. BaaS customers and consortia members are predominantly U.S. banks, while the list is growing and R3 recently added newcomers like China Merchant Bank and insurance behemoth, Metlife. R3 is receiving the most traction in the consortia world and currently has two main tracks for corporate customers: Blockchain Development Initiative with around 50 banks and the other is Reference Data Management pilots with about a dozen banks. As the head of innovation controlling a moderate budget, it makes sense to invest $250,000 as an entrance fee to explore R3’s offerings. Other consortia include Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger, which is in development phase, and open sources its platform for enterprises to contribute code. Hyperledger focuses on bridging blockchain-based distributed ledgers to business transactions; Intel, Accenture and JP Morgan have joined as members. Another consortium to consider is Project Bletchley, which Microsoft released in June. Paxos, formerly ItBit (focused on OTC trading services) recently made a pivot into the private blockchain space, specifically to gold settlements. Consortia efforts come in many forms; the "Big Four" accounting firms are even exploring their own blockchain consortium. BaaS providers like Blockstack, Chain and Multi-chain represent another wave of companies exploring blockchain implementation: Blockstack, Chain and Multi-chain. BaaS adoption (and momentum) is even less transparent than consortia, where players like Chain keep their relationship details close to the chest. A number of companies have announced partnerships with Chain, but beyond instances similar to Nasdaq’s interest in using Chain for issuing shares in pre-IPO companies, progress and general involvement are not clear. Beyond BaaS and consortia, some corporates are exploring hybrid (permissioned and permissionless) systems like Ripple. Ripple plans to sell banks XRP, which is its currency for liquidity and will offer Ripple Connect to hopefully alleviate costs and increase system speed. Four Considerations for Corporate Adoption We examined existing frameworks for how enterprises adopt new technologies and concluded that blockchain adoption warrants a different set of considerations. Here, we highlight the four focus areas that large corporations should consider before and during exploration phase: 1. Delivering on promise: cost savings, security It seems like a Blockchain for X world in which Blockchain is the hammer, and everything is a nail. In early 2016, Jeremy Drane from PwC (now with Libra) said “there are only a small number of industry companies that can deliver solutions built on the technology – the industry is not as diverse as you’d hope.” Blockchain applications must meet the buyer, market, and system demands. As a rule of thumb, corporate buyers will not switch systems unless they see a 10x improvement in performance in new solution. For context, VisaNet, Visa’s transaction processing system averages 2,000 transactions per second, with capacity to reach 56,000 transactions per second; compare this to Bitcoin at seven transactions per second, according to “On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains.” Ethereum’s system is faster than Bitcoin’s, but is not ready to replace VisaNet or comparable systems. Changing systems is complicated. Financial institutions rely on on-premise systems that have been in play for decades, known for their security, but also their inability for data sharing (intra and interbank). Hyperledger’s Donna Dillenberger said “to ensure that blockchain is truly enterprise-ready for different verticals and different applications with different rules, more security and compliance issues must be firmly addressed…it’s technically challenging to add the needed security and compliance layers, as well as new sophisticated features, to blockchain to optimize it for enterprise use. Here at IBM it took many months to do the work thus far. So adapting it to many different use cases and applications takes a while.” Takeaway: A meaningful percentage of blockchain use cases will fail to gain traction for various reasons (security, upkeep, unrealistic expectations) in the current exploratory climate. Migration costs will become more tangible, and corporations will be more defined about their blockchain interest – and, it’s not unreasonable to estimate that this exploratory phase could last half a decade. As corporates refine their view on distributed ledger technology, it’s a win-win for FI’s and entrepreneurs because the blockchain movement is drawing hyper intelligent folks to unsexy business problems.

Corporate politics/internal buy-in “I don’t want to be the guy who misses out, but I also don’t want to stick my neck out to far to be fired.” This sentiment is a common trend amongst corporate blockchain folks - being the blockchain champion within a large and complex organization is not easy, balancing the media’s hype fest with real business solutions. As a large corporation, it’s difficult to innovate, and pressure for results often leads to misalignment between executives and blockchain champions. Without citing a reason, UBS and its blockchain chief parted ways in recent months. Others, like IBM, realize there will be failure, so recruiting blockchain talent and creating a forward thinking culture has been the computing giant’s strategy. The company will create a new unit called Watson Financial Services to encompass Watson, cloud, and all blockchain-related offerings and strategy, and will be led by Bridget van Kralingen, IBM’s senior VP of global banking services and Mark Foster, formerly from Accenture. Takeaway: Corporate innovation groups need influence to pilot and expand use cases, paired with sufficient senior management buy-in, patience, and budget resources. Exploration will take more than the $250,000 R3 entrance fee to understand if a blockchain solution works. 3. Regulatory roadblocks/concerns Regulation around Bitcoin has progressed the way we might’ve expected: slowly. Slow-moving governing bodies are keeping corporates at bay, and reporting regulations outlined in Dodd Frank and Europe’s equivalent, EMIR create friction in linking capital markets and blockchain technology – leading to risk in adopting blockchain technology even steeper. In the U.S., corporates are almost exclusively exploring private (permissioned) blockchains due to restrictive wording in Dodd Frank around reporting. Still behind Europe, some U.S. politicians are pushing for blockchain exploration like Mick Mulvaney and Jared Polis, who announced the creation of a “Blockchain Caucus” last week. Europe has been more transparent, and fast moving on blockchain regulation, and in June released “The Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets” on the relevance of distributed ledger tech. One firm in the Northeast told us top blockchain talent could essentially, “name their salary.” Takeaway: Blockchain regulatory conditions will improve as decision-makers, governing agencies, influencers and regulators understand the technology, and its tradeoffs. We expect Europe to lead the charge, and countries like Estonia (quickly becoming the fintech hotbed), with the United States to follow. Economist, Carlo Meijer analyses the intricacies of blockchain regulation in “Blockchain, Financial Regulatory Reporting and Challenges.” 4. Blockchain Talent There is a shortage of blockchain talent: business folks, engineers, strategists, and individuals who understand blockchain technology adoption. In March, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG announced their intent on hiring blockchain talent, but are realizing there is a talent shortage. Big banks like JPMorgan, BofA, Capital One are staffing up, and feeling the pain as well. In August, we heard frustration from Japanese banks on attracting experts via Reuters. Hiring, attracting and training blockchain talent is highly competitive, and organizations are paying up. One firm in the Northeast told us top blockchain talent could essentially, “name their salary.” Takeaway: Hiring blockchain talent is hard (and expensive). There are only a couple hundred people in the world who truly understand the intricacies and implementation of blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, distributed ledgers, capital markets, existing systems and the many areas blockchain technology will touch. Expect universities to invest in curriculum and recruit professors over the next couple years, similar to the objectives of Cornell’s IC3 and MIT’s Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s VP of blockchain, comments on blockchain’s current environment “at some level, the efficiency you get from blockchain is to create more of a B2B service without the friction. And many financial services companies are the friction in the system, by design.” At Converge, we have noticed this disconnect between startups and corporate objectives, and decision makers. Entrepreneurs, Consortia, BaaS providers, and corporate thoughts leaders are closing this gap and leveraging Cloud infrastructure and the ubiquitous compute power of today. This movement allows for an entirely new way of processing transactions: touching capital, data, and even applications. With two blockchain investments in Cambridge and NYC, we’re scanning the environment for more companies that will bridge existing infrastructure to this new frontier.

We like it, that's what 3 Oct 2016 at 16:03, Chris Mellor Chris Mellor Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Emc, Netapp, Seagate, Hp, Dell Recent Articles IBM stirs Lenovo Optane into its Bluemix cloud Scality developing way to stream objects to tape and the cloud Salesforce backup = Druva Comment HPE's Synergy is, it thinks, the next great advance in servers and is far more capable than hyper-converged infrastructure systems, being able to provision bare metal as well as servers for virtual workloads as well as containerised ones. Getting a grip on this beast is tricky. Is it a form of dynamically reconfigurable hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) with separately scalable compute, storage and networking? Yes, in a way it is, but HPE would position it apart from HCI, as we shall see later. The basic Synergy element is a 10U rackmount chassis, somewhat similar to its C-Class chassis but taking specific servers, not standard ones. This chassis can take a mix of server and storage frames which slot in from the front and has a set of network nodes at the back, with a single master node. These nodes obviate the need for a separate top of rack networking switch. The chassis also has a front-mount Composer, a dedicated server with storage and networking. This runs a version of Linux, auto-discovers Synergy compute, storage and networking (fabric) elements, and provides the OneView command facility for managing Synergy. Front and rear views of Synergy rack. At the rear the blue cables interconnect Composer modules in each frame Synergy frames can scale out, with four per rack, if your floors can stand the weight, and then via adding another rack. The Composers in each Synergy chassis hook up with each other via a dedicated management net, providing a control plane for the system separate from the operational compute and data plane. HPE UK's FSI Strategic Accounts Presales Consultant Joe Hardy with Synergy Composer module. Composer module with lid removed. Users set up named server profiles, defining compute, firmware, OS, storage and networking resources for example, and then these can be simply provisioned to workloads: for example, a database workload template. Synergy can be managed through RESTful APIs as well. Synergy OneView 3 screenshot. Note server profile area middle left. Server nodes can have direct-attached on-blade storage. This can be, for example, SAS 2.5-inch disk or NVMe SSDs. As well as the in-frame storage nodes Synergy chassis' can use external SAN or NAS storage, such as 3PAR StorServe, connected by Fibre Channel or Ethernet, part or all of which gets allocated to the Synergy storage resource pool via, say, volumes allocated to workloads running on Synergy. Both Synergy storage and networking are virtualised into Synergy-wide pools and compute blades can be aggregated for a workload. But individual CPUs on a server blade can't be separately dedicated to workloads with other server nodes; the server blade is as granular as compute gets for now. Similarly memory can't be separately virtualised into a Synergy-wide pool. When Intel's Silicon Photonics is adopted by Synergy in the future then this, with operating system help, might become possible. Joe Hardy showing Synergy server node with lid removed. As servers adopt non-volatile storage-class memory then Synergy will adopt them too via Synergy server blades using non-volatile Memristor, XPoint or some other media technology. It will also adopt HPE's developing Machine concept, with Synergy in one sense, being a Machine precursor. Server inventiveness HPE says it has some 100 beta customers testing Synergy. As you look at the hardware, the 10U chassis and its components, the Composer module and the OneView v3 software, you realise this is a substantial and distinctive effort. A lot of development money is being spent here. No other server vendor has anything like Synergy; not Cisco, not Dell, not Fujitsu, Hitachi, Huawei, Lenovo nor any other mainstream server vendor you can think of. Paul Miller, HPE’s marketing VP for Converged Data Centre Infrastructure, bangs the HPE server inventiveness drum, saying HPE was first with x86 servers, first with a 1U pizza box-format server, first to launch blade servers, and is now the first to launch composable infrastructure servers. Everyone else, he says, including Dell, follows HPE. Synergy storage module. Synergy and HCI Hyper-converged infrastructure systems converged and integrate server, storage and networking with server virtualisation software to apps in virtual machines in a scale-out system environment using virtual SAN software, such as VMware’s VSAN. HPE has its hyper-converged HC 380 product, ones that use StoreVirtual virtual SAN software and ProLiant DL380 servers. Synergy opens up that idea, expands on it, to have a Synergy frame as the basic element, within which you can mix and match variable compute, server and network elements. The HCIA single SKU buying simplicity goes away but the operational flexibility and simplicity benefits gained instead could be huge, quite apart from Synergy providing bare-metal servers as well as support for containerisation. Also Synergy is built as a platform with a10 year-plus life. Different compute, storage and networking elements and technologies can come along and be adopted by the Synergy chassis and software; that’s the theory. So, for example, Intel’s Silicon Photonics can be adopted inside Synergy, and also outside. Once the3PAR StorServe arrays get Silicon Photonics support then Synergy links to external storage will run at 100Gbit/s speed. How this would work alongside or with NVMe over Fabrics is unclear. It could simply be an alternative to 100Gbit/s Ethernet cables and still carry Ethernet protocol signals and data, in which case NVMeF running across Silicon Photonics cables will be theoretically okay. Innovation buzzwordery? Yes – and no Synergy is a multi-million dollar investment by HPE involving server, storage and networking hardware, adapted C-Class chassis, development of the Composer module, and extension of the OneView management software facility, Looking at the racks of Synergy hardware and nodes within the frames it’s obvious that this is a big iron effort. The thing looks like a software-defined private cloud, mini data centres in 10U cans with dynamically re-usable elements. Marketing buzzwordery surrounds it; infrastructure as code, the ideas economy, innovating fearlessly in an age of business disruption, IT must build innovation engines, and IT must become value creators and deliver business outcomes. Synergy is about accelerating the digital enterprise to innovate fearlessly. There’s even a Composable Infrastructure for Dummies book – no, really – which tells you how to turn your data centre into an a revenue generator with composable infrastructure. But step aside from this slick deluge of wordsmithing and Synergy looks pretty damn good. Will it take off? That’s the question, and HPE is giving its best shot, pouring EVPs into marketing events and demo’ing the hardware. If the operational flexibility, CAPEX and OPEX benefits are real and replicable from customer to customer then HPE will have a good and distinctive story to tell and pass through its channel. And Meg Whitman will have product technology to smile about. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 19 Comments More from The Register France, I am in you, says HPE's EMEA channel overlord Gilles Thiebaut says oui oui to country manager's job HPE buffs OpenStack cloud to woo public-shy types OpenStack Summit Helion a 'real environment for production' HPE: Come on in, cool cloud kids, we won't compete with you – unlike *cough* Dell Service providers lured in with promises 7 Comments HPE to offer hybrid cloud hypermarket to world+dog Not just Europeans who'll consume Cloud 28+ 2 Comments The man running HPE's Microsoft Azure biz says shiz this... after eight months Former channel czar John Ansell is about to leave the building 5 Comments HPE, IBM, ARM, Samsung and pals in plot to weave 'memory fabric' Everyone but Intel and Cisco working together to build storage-class memory 3 Comments Whitepapers OpenStack is ready — are you?

The Linux Foundation The Git distributed revision control system is splendid in a multitude of ways but one -- keeping a good history of patches and commits. Pish tosh, you say, for Git remembers everything! Yes, it does, until you rebase. To solve this problem, Josh Triplett, built a new tool called git-series, which he described in his talk at ContainerCon North America. In his entertaining talk, Triplett, ChromeOS Architect at Intel, goes into a good level of detail on why he wrote git-series and how it works. First, why is it even necessary? Can't you just merge everything and never rebase? You can, though, as Triplett says, "You're actually going to go back and rewrite history as though you had done it that way to begin with. The reason you do that is so that then when you send the stack of patches, that stack of patches as merged into the public history will look like a reasonable series of development changes that make sense. As opposed to seeing a pull request that says, "Implement the feature, fix the thing I just implemented. Fix it some more. Maybe it'll work this time." You don't want to see that in your public history even though that is what you actually did." It is reasonable for a project to require a clean public history, and you can have as mucky a private history as you like. But Git is all about working with other people. Triplett describes a typical scenario: "Development proceeds on from there and maybe you have to do a v3, v4, v5 but what happened to version 1? Did you save a copy of it anywhere? Do you still have it? Somebody makes an offhand comment, ‘I liked the way you did this in v1 better.’ They want to see the history of development. The real history of development and not the lovely curated history." So then you're digging through emails, git reflog or branching your project until it looks like hallucinogenic spaghetti. "You might have a branch named feature v1, which was probably named feature and then you renamed it feature v1 when you realized you needed a v2. Then you have a v3 with that typo fix, and a v8 rebased on top of 4.6 with Alice's fix incorporated. We have a version control system. We should be past this," Triplett said. Git-series is an elegant solution that tracks a patch series and its evolution through your project, and it works seamlessly with all Git features. According to Triplett, "Git-series tracks the history of a patch series, how you've changed it through non-fast-forwarding changes. You can rewrite history and it will keep track of what the old history looked like, including a commit message telling you what you were doing. It tracks a cover letter so that you can version that over time. It tracks the base that you started your series from to make it easy to rebase this." Watch Triplett's presentation (below), which includes a live demo of git-series in action. Want to learn more about Git?

Initially GlobalFoundries will continue to use deep ultraviolet (DUV) argon fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers with 193 nm wavelength with its 7 nm production process, but over time it hopes to insert extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) tools into production flow should their customers need this. Keeping in mind that one of GF’s key customers is AMD, the foundry’s advancements in manufacturing technologies are quite important for the PC market in general. Tangible Improvements Over 14LPP GlobalFoundries will use its 7 nm production process to produce high-performance components, such as CPUs, GPUs and SoCs for various applications (mobile, PC, servers, etc.). In general, it means that a number of future products from AMD could be produced using GlobalFoundries’ 7 nm fabrication tech, something we already knew from the wafer supply agreement that the two companies inked earlier this year. Compared to GlobalFoundries’ current leading-edge 14LPP fabrication technology, the initial DUV-only 7 nm process promises over 50% area reduction as well as over 60% power reduction (at the same frequency and complexity) or over 30% performance improvement (at the same power and complexity). In practice, this means that in an ideal scenario GlobalFoundries will be able to double the amount of transistors per chip without increasing its die size while improving its performance per watt characteristics. The company plans to "significantly" re-use equipment and processes it utilizes now for volume production of chips using the 14 nm FinFET technologies for its 7 nm node. Nonetheless, the new process will require an additional multi-billion investment in Fab 8. As of now, GlobalFoundries has already started to produce test wafers with circuits (IP) from a number of its customers using the 7 nm process in its Fab 8 in Malta, New York. While the company decision to skip 10nm means that it will not be able to use 10nm as a stepping-stone to 7 nm technology, it says that it has gained a lot of experience with FinFETs from the 14LPE and the 14LPP processes. The contract maker of semiconductors expects to finalize specs of its 7 nm technology in the second half of 2017, which implies on start of mass production of commercial chips in the second half of 2018. GlobalFoundries naturally does not reveal timeframes for its 7nm with EUV, but it is safe to say that EUV will be used in 2019 at the earliest. While GlobalFoundries’ expectations for performance, power, area (PPA) improvements look solid, it should be noted that right now the contract manufacturer is among what's become multiple companies to have confirmed their intentions to pursue a DUV-only 7 nm process technology. DUV in this respect is the tried and true approach, however in order to create 7 nm features it will require using triple/quadruple patterning, which greatly increases design and manufacturing costs as well as cycle times over previous-gen nodes. So while there is a lot of interest in using EUV if it works, many of the major fabs are starting at the same place as GlobalFoundries and at least internally preparing for DUV-only, while hoping EUV will be ready when they want it. Case in point, Samsung currently hopes to use EUV lithography for critical layers with their 7 nm nodes to avoid triple/quadruple patterning, but are being very careful in how they're wording their plans, saying that they are "reviewing possibilities" of EUV insertion at 7 nm. So it is not cast in stone that Samsung will not proceed with a DUV-only 7 nm if it has to. Meanwhile Intel also once considered to start using EUV for 7 nm. Finally, TSMC does not seem to be afraid of multi-patterning and intends to produce semiconductors using DUV-only 7 nm manufacturing tech in 2H 2018. It remains to be seen how GlobalFoundries’ and TSMC’s 7 nm processes play out, but keep in mind that the former claims that its 7 nm platform is designed to be “EUV-compatible at key levels”. This means that the company will start using ASML’s TWINSCAN NXE step-and-scan systems for critical layers once they are ready (i.e., their light sources will be powerful enough for mass production and the tools will have more than 80% availability). Since GF's 7 nm with EUV process technology will be used to produce a generation of ICs (integrated circuits) that will follow the initial 7 nm chips, GlobalFoundries makes no secret that the 7 nm with DUV and the 7 nm with EUV are essentially two different process generations (keep in mind that specs of either have not been finalized). Moreover, if EUV is ready for prime time in 2019, GF's 7 nm DUV will be a short-lived node. In fact, GlobalFoundries is already using TWINSCAN NXEs and EUV to speed up prototyping of certain circuits for its clients. GlobaFoundries Skips 10 nm For Two Reasons Having announced its 7 nm manufacturing technology, GlobalFoundries confirmed rumors that it decided to skip the 10 nm fabrication process. It looks like there are at least two reasons for this decision and both lie in the PPASC (power, performance, area, schedule and costs) equation. On the one hand, the company figured out that the PPA advantages of its 10 nm technology over its 14LPP process would not be significant. On the other hand, its schedule and costs would further hinder its competitiveness. Now, let’s talk about this in a bit more detailed way. Since manufacturing technologies are getting more complex, it is not easy to ensure that every new node offers substantial power, performance and area improvements (PPA) over the previous one. As a result, some process technologies are only used by fabless designers of semiconductors for a couple of years, whereas others are used by dozens of companies for many years. GlobalFoundries believes that 10 nm process would not provide tangible performance, power and area advantages over 14LPP process technology (which is based on 20 nm back-end-of-line interconnect flow) and would become a short-lived transitional node, hence their reason to skip it. We have seen a few such nodes in the recent years: as a limited number of firms used 45 nm, 32 and 20 nm process technologies, albeit all for different reasons. If we take a look at the advertised PPA improvements for the most recent leading-edge process technologies from GF, Samsung and TSMC, it will be clear that transition to 10 nm node will bring improvements to TSMC's abilities, but not by a large enough degree to satisfy all of its customers (we observed something similar with the CLN20SOC several years ago). Moreover, Samsung's numbers are somewhat less impressive (keep in mind that GF's 14LPP was licensed from Samsung), confirming GlobalFoundries expectations. Advertised PPA Improvements of Leading Edge Process Technologies Data announced by companies during conference calls, press briefings and in press releases   GlobalFoundries Samsung TSMC 7nm DUV vs 14LPP 14LPP vs 28LPP 10LPE vs 14LPP 10LPP vs 10LPE 20SOC vs 28 nm 16FF+ vs 28HPM 16FF+ vs 20SOC 10FF vs 16FF+ 7FF vs 10FF Power >60% 60% 30% none 25% 70% 60% 40% <40% Performance >30% 40% >10% >10% 30% 65% 40% 20% - Area Reduction >50% 50% 32% none <50% ~50% none >50% >37% To a degree, GlobalFoundries seems to be at least partially right in its thinking of 10 nm as of a transitional node. Only three customers have taped out their 10 nm chips at TSMC so far, less than six months before TSMC intends to get its first 10 nm revenue (in Q1 2017). By contrast, tens of companies taped out their 16 nm (CLN16FF) products long before the start of high-volume production in the second half of 2015. What is more important is that according to TSMC, its 10 nm fabrication process will be mostly used by mobile SoC developers (read: Apple, Qualcomm, MediaTek), which desperately need to squeeze more transistors into new chips every year, improve performance and reduce power consumption by a bit too. Such customers are less concerned about manufacturing costs and aggressive improvements, they simply need new technologies to make certain progress due to market demands. Meanwhile, TSMC’s 7 nm manufacturing technology will be used by multiple customers of the company, including those from high-performance computing space, the company said recently (it does not mean, though, that nobody from HPC space is going to use 10 nm). TSMC plans to start volume production of 7 nm chips in the first half of 2018, so, it is a little bit ahead of GlobalFoundries with this node. However, its first EUV-based process technology (5 nm) is scheduled for 2020, so, the company might be a little behind its rival when it comes to next-gen lithography. Samsung demonstrated the first wafers processed using its 10LPE (10 nm, low-power early) technology in May, 2015, and disclosed plans to start volume production of chips using its 10 nm tech in late 2016. In addition, the company is planning to quickly roll-out an improved version of the tech called 10LPP, the company said earlier this year. Since Samsung needs to produce leading-edge SoC for its smartphones, it is not surprising that it is also deploying 10 nm fabrication processes: even in case it does not have a lot of foundry customers for them, it is going to need them itself to stay competitive against Apple (and potentially land Apple as a foundry client). Moreover, if Samsung requires EUV for its 7 nm process technology, it will have to use 10 nm before ASML is ready with its commercial EUV step-and-scan systems. In fact, this is why Samsung does not reveal whether it expects to start making chips using 7 nm process in 2019 or later. Meanwhile, there is another reason why GlobalFoundries decided to skip the 10 nm fabrication technology (in addition to insignificant performance and area advantages over the 14LPP). Back in 2014, the company acquired assets of IBM Microelectronics along with a team of developers. Naturally, the integration of IBM staff took time, so instead of creating a 10 nm manufacturing process (which would be late anyway), the company decided to focus on its 7 nm technology platform. The latter will be the first process developed by the team consisting of GF and IBM developers. Finally, keep in mind that while makers of semiconductors use terms like 7 nm or 10 nm to name their fabrication technologies, such numbers nowadays do not necessary reflect transistor density and other factors. Not all 10 nm manufacturing technologies are created equal. For example, Intel argues that transistor density of its 10 nm process is going to be comparable to transistor densities of competing 7 nm technologies. Nonetheless, a new node is still a new node with its own advantages compared to its direct, in-house predecessor. Smooth Transition to EUV Nowadays both semiconductor makers and manufacturers of production equipment agree that EUV will be required to make chips using smaller fabrication technologies, and the question is whether ASML will be ready with viable tools for 7 nm or for 5 nm nodes. As a result, everyone has to make decisions about when to start using EUV scanners for critical layers. Leading-Edge Industry Lithography Roadmap, Mass Production Data announced by companies during conference calls, press briefings and in press releases   2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1H 2H 1H 2H GlobalFoundries 14LPP 7 nm DUV 7nm with EUV exact timing not announced Intel 14 nm 14 nm+ 10 nm no data Samsung 14LPP 14LPC 10LPE 10LPP 7LPP (7nm with EUV) exact timing not announced SMIC 28 nm 14 nm in development TSMC CLN16FF+ CLN16FFC CLN10FF CLN7FF unknown 5 nm EUV UMC 28 nm 14 nm no data ASML and Cymer are making a steady progress with their EUV tools and manufacturers of semiconductors are learning how to use those tools. So far, only TSMC has publicly announced plans to use EUV for commercial 5 nm chips in 2020. Samsung has publicly mulled over using EUV tools for its 7 nm semiconductors, but it does not specify when. GlobalFoundries said that it could use EUV for its 7 nm manufacturing technology, but also did not specify exact timing. Intel is still weighing its options, hence, it is still possible that the company will start to use EUV for its 7 nm fabrication process. Meanwhile, SMIC and UMC have not specified their plans concerning next-gen lithography. In fact, both companies yet have to catch up with their rivals when it comes to FinFET first. By developing a 7 nm process technology “compatible with EUV at key levels”, which essentially means two generations of the fabrication process, GlobalFoundries plays it safe: Firstly, it will have an all new process technology ready for production in 2H 2018. It is several months later than TSMC, but is still ahead of Intel and such manufacturing tech advantage could be good for AMD as well as other customers of GlobalFoundries (but bear in mind increased costs and cycle times). Secondly, once EUV tools are ready for prime time, GlobalFoundries will have a proven and polished-off process technology ready for EUV insertion (keep in mind that 193 nm ArF tools will be used for the majority of layers for a long time). Thirdly, even if ASML’s tools are not ready by 2H 2019 (something that its clients will learn well ahead of that timeframe), GlobalFoundries will have a competitive node and time to develop its next process with, or without EUV. Of course, in certain circumstances GlobalFoundries may end up competing against TSMC’s 5 nm EUV technology with its 7 nm manufacturing process in 2020, but this is something the company is going to try to avoid. GlobalFoundries to Offer EUV and FD-SOI GlobalFoundries does not put all eggs in one basket. While companies like TSMC and Samsung develop low-cost/low-power versions of their FinFET manufacturing technologies in a bid to attract smaller players, GF also plans to keep developing new planar fabrication processes featuring FD-SOI. Therefore, for cost effective, low power and radio applications, the company will keep using its 22FDX (it uses back-end-of-line interconnect flow of STMicroelectronics’ 28nm FD-SOI as well as front-end of line of STM’s 14nm FD-SOI process technology) and eventually 12FDX technologies (also announced this month). Since it is considerably cheaper to design chips featuring planar transistors, these technologies are going to be used by various smaller fabless semiconductor developers. In general, GlobalFoundries positions its 22FDX as an alternative for 14/16 nm FinFET technologies, whereas the 12FDX is going to compete against 10 nm and, possibly, sub-10 nm processes in 2019 and beyond. Samsung, another FD-SOI backer, plans to add eNVM (embedded non-volatile memory) to its 28FDS platform in 2018, but so far it has not announced any plans for a new FD-SOI technology platform.  It remains to be seen is how successful the FD-SOI offerings from GlobalFoundries will be, given the competition. Nonetheless, GlobalFoundries and Samsung are the only contract makers of semiconductors, which have announced plans to offer both leading-edge FinFET as well as planar FD-SOI manufacturing processes in 2020 and beyond. Moreover, GlobalFoundries is the only company, who disclosed plans for a sub-20 nm FD-SOI fabrication technology.

Reply ddriver - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link I am great, but glofo won't be when they fail to deliver and in 2019 the best they could offer is 14 nm lines. Intel is pretty much the leader in process, and even they don't do stupid things like going ahead of themselves, in fact they have switched process transition to a lower gear. It is highly unrealistic that glofo, the sloth of the semiconductor business, will succeed. That's not playing it safe, that putting all your eggs in a basket you can't deliver. Playing it safe would be baby steps, not skipping node leaps. Reply ddriver - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Best case scenario IMO is that it will be more like Intel's 10 nm, but will call it 7 cuz it sounds better. That should be achievable at least. Let's face it, glofo's 14nm came almost 2 years late and wasn't exactly stellar as polaris efficiency has revealed. Reply Morawka - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link GF had working 7nm silicon over a year ago (in partnership with IBM), it's not so far fetched. Intel has fallen behind and they used to have a full 2 year lead, not so much anymore. I would be worried if i was a intel shareholder. Tick Tock Optimize should tell you something. They are gonna be on 10nm for the next 2-3 years Reply ddriver - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link It tells me that process will not scale down infinitely, ~10 years from now it will hit a brickwall. Reply Morawka - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link I know but my point is, if intel's gonna be on 10nm for 2 years, then GF has plenty of time to get 7nm out, even if it's late, they will be ahead by half a node, even with intel's superior fin pitch. Intel knows this, thats why they are finally willing to fab chips for fabless companies in 10 years when they hit a brick wall, they will simply stack more layers up and up.. Right now, only the base layer is etched at 14nm, 90% of the other layers are etched at a much bigger process to improve yields and provide electron flow. Here is a cross section of a Intel i7: http://imgur.com/a/wXWGX Metal interconnect is the real brick wall, thats why we are seeing material scientist experiment with new materials like Indium gallium arsenide and indium phosphide combined based devices. Silicon will eventually be abandoned in the high end, and down the chain as years go by. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, October 04, 2016 - link I get your point, but that doesn't' change the fact glofo are slow and their process quality is inferior, or in short - IBM or not, they are far from excelling at what they do. Thus getting ahead of themselves has a huge potential to backfire. Johnny boy has problems passing 9-th grade, he is being held for e year or two behind his mates. How smart it is for Johnny boy to "make up" for it by skipping ahead to the 12-th grade exam when he struggles to complete the 10-th? 12-th grade example is harder than 10-th grade. The most likely scenario is they will manage to pull something off, but as usual - delay it, and when it is finally out, it may perform worse than intel and samsung 10 nm and with lower density. And when they finally make chips on it, analysis will reveal that "your nm ain't the same as my nm", or, that it was just a PR number and it is in reality a decorated 10 nm process. Reply witeken - Wednesday, October 05, 2016 - link No, the interconnect has nothing to do with it. I don't think you understand what the interconnect is for. The interconnect simply transports the data, so only the interconnect layers just above the transistor need to be small. InGaAs is researched as a channel material, which is part of the transistor, not the interconnect. Reply Michael Bay - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link >IBM So we can bury it right now and save orselves the wait, huh.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s expected to launch new MacBook models later this month, and the company might have a refreshed iMac up its sleeve too. Over the weekend, an upgraded 27-inch iMac sporting Intel’s seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” Core i7 chip was briefly spotted on Best Buy’s website. The iMac was listed as “New!” with the next-gen processor on board. Otherwise, the hardware hasn’t changed much. The computer still packs a Retina 5K display with options for 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive. It’s possible this could just be a mistake by some Best Buy employee or even just a placeholder. However, the timing suggests Apple is really gearing up for a new iMac. Beyond its new processor, the computer is also expected to feature an upgraded graphics chip. Apple’s expected to put a bigger emphasis on the redesigned MacBook Pro, which could feature an OLED touchscreen above the keyboard, a Touch ID sensor and USB-C ports. An upgraded MacBook Air may also add a single USB-C port. Apple still hasn’t confirmed plans for an October event, but invitations may be going out pretty soon.

Image: Phil Daint/Shutterstock The biggest challenge facing the communications world, driven by more and more connected people, devices and bandwidth-sucking apps, will be physics. For the past two centuries, the communications revolution was principally about connecting people; from Morse code and the telegraph along thousands of miles of rail track and across oceans, to voice and data in our hands today. For the foreseeable future, people will be outnumbered by billions of things and will have to jostle with bots and devices on increasingly crowded airwaves and pipes. The oft-quoted definition of cloud – the network is the computer – could never be truer, especially as we hurtle into a world where even fibre networks will have capacity issues and 5G will not be the silver bullet that policy makers and the telecoms industry imagine it to be. ‘Some homes today can get 60Mbps broadband. 15 years ago that was the total bandwidth into the country. Our expectations keep changing’ – RONAN FARRELL The fact of the matter is that networks as we know them have capacity problems. It’s all down to physics. Wireless spectrum as we know it is finite, and even fibre optic cabling is not as efficient as even stock markets or media giants and social networks want it to be. In fintech, for example, a picosecond – one-trillionth of a second – of latency will not cut it, even in today’s data-hungry world. If you’ve lived the last 30 or so years, your lives have been defined by advances in networking. You’ve gone from rotary and push button phones to the smartphone currently in your pocket; from 56k dial-up modems to broadband-enabled Wi-Fi to the invasion of machines into your home, thanks to the internet of things (IoT) revolution. The next 30 or so years will be just as revolutionary. But there is a problem: physics. Will 5G really be the next generation of networks? Nokia CTO and Bell Labs president Marcus Weldon believes we are about to run out of radio space unless we develop a whole new dimension. Image: Connor McKenna Marcus Weldon, CTO of Nokia and president of Bell Labs, outlined this to me two years ago when we met at the venerable Bell Labs R&D hub in New Jersey. He had set a challenge for his R&D teams to boost networks as we know them by 10X in the next few years, just to keep up with people and machines. ‘The final frontier of radio is we need to go to shorter distances for fewer users’ – MARCUS WELDON “We put that number out there (10X) because we actually need 100 times more radio capacity. We say that because it’s an easy round number but in fact, the better statement is we need to build a network that has seemingly infinite capacity.” He added: “We have only one dimension left to do this in and that is down to space. The final frontier of radio is we need to go to shorter distances for fewer users, which means creating small, indoor cells. Otherwise, in terms of wireless, we are going to run out of dimensions again.” It is a race against time and space. Almost three-quarters of the world’s population will be connected to a mobile network by 2020, according to the GSM Association. It calculates that there were 4.7bn unique mobile subscribers worldwide at the end of 2015, which is 63pc of the world’s population. That is some milestone when you consider most people did not own, or could afford to own, a mobile device 30 years ago. Already, regulators are holding up their hands and admitting they didn’t foresee the capacity issues. Recently, in Ireland, the communications regulator ComReg published its radio spectrum management strategy and conceded that when the last strategy was published in 2011, the true impact of the smartphone could not have been foreseen. Back then, 4G license auctions presented windfalls for governments around the world, and former TV spectrum in the 800MHz range was re-farmed to let teenagers today enjoy unbridled access to Instagram, Netflix and Snapchat. But as Ireland’s telecoms regulator Gerry Fahy has pointed out, we will need to prepare for 200pc more wireless capacity in the next two to three years, as further spectrum bands such as 700MHz, 1.4GHz, 2.3GHz and 2.6GHz are released to support demand. This brings us on to the next sacred cow: 5G. Already, marketers at various telecoms and tech companies are salivating at the prospect of new campaigns around 5G. But they are missing a core point: unlike 2G, 3G and 4G before it, which were all about incremental increases in speeds, 5G will not be about speed. Instead, it will be a collection of standards around the management of data and cells. 3G, which is now a 14-year-old technology, still has a shelf life and networks will still be trying to eke value out of 4G for the next decade. But that hasn’t stopped people getting slightly ahead of themselves. The EU is looking for a complete overhaul of the union’s telecoms rules, to include setting a minimum requirement of 100Mbps in every household and a 5G minimum connectivity of urban centres by 2025. Such targets will require massive investment, the EU admitted, putting an estimated cost of €500bn on achieving its targets – an investment that will come largely from private sources. Recently, some of the world’s biggest telecoms and automotive companies agreed to join the 5G Automotive Association, to integrate 5G technology into future connected and autonomous vehicles. The new association includes AUDI, BMW and Daimler from the automotive side; and Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm from the telecoms industry. People are imagining 5G will represent a step change in speeds. It won’t. It will be a step change in network intelligence. Huawei’s head of ecosystem development, Aileen Smith. ‘The first advantage of 5G will be increased bandwidth because the network world is running out of bandwidth fast and is striving to find bigger pipes’ – AILEEN SMITH In reality, 5G will be a collection of standards and will incorporate a variety of existing 2G, 3G and 4G signals. It will be combined with other forms of connectivity, including Wi-Fi, and new, emerging IoT networks, including Sigfox and Narrowband-IoT. 5G will need to accommodate a world where instead of base stations being every few miles or even 500 metres apart, there could be clusters of smaller, low-power, low-latency base stations that could be just 50 metres apart. The intelligence will be in the network. Think of it as having the power to optimise your smartphone in favour of your Whatsapp communications today; of setting the priority on your home IoT network to security/safety/priority when the Super Bowl is on; to tune all devices to get you the best bandwidth and quality for video. The intelligent network switching power of 5G could also represent a chance for telecoms companies to wrest back the control taken by over the air (OTT) players like Facebook and WhatsApp, who have decimated SMS as a revenue path for telcos. Facebook is already crowing about the death of the phone number. “The service providers are working through a transition from being hardware centric to virtualising their networks and hardware is starting to become a commodity,” said Huawei’s head of ecosystem development, Aileen Smith. According to Smith, the promise of 5G will be in the software. “The first advantage of 5G will be increased bandwidth because the network world is running out of bandwidth fast and is striving to find bigger pipes. “Another critical promise of 5G will be less latency. If you have 5G networks with lower latency and you have self-driving, autonomous vehicles travelling at high speed, then low-latency becomes very important, especially if it is the network telling the car to brake.” A light bulb moment that could change everything In universities across the world, researchers and scientists are working hard to overcome the physics challenge and deliver network innovations that most humans could not even imagine. Companies like Apple and Google are understood to be taking an active interest in a technology called Li-Fi, which uses LED light bulbs to pulse and transmit data at 100 times the speed of Wi-Fi. ‘If you think of today’s networks as a road with one lane, imagine how much data would flow if it was expanded into a highway with 1,000 lanes’ – HARALD HAAS Li-Fi could be a potential solution to the struggle Wi-Fi is going to have in transporting its share of the 35 quintillion bytes of information each month that will be in the world by 2019, according to the World Economic Forum. One of the pioneers of Li-Fi is Harald Haas, who originated the technology in 2011. He currently holds the chair of mobile communications at the University of Edinburgh and is co-founder and chief scientific officer of PureLiFi Ltd, as well as the director of the LiFi Research and Development Centre at the University of Edinburgh. Speaking with Siliconrepublic.com, Haas explained: “Essentially, we are using LED light bulbs to transmit data wirelessly to a mobile handset at very high speeds. “We have shown 10Gbps and we have also shown in the lab that in the near future we can scale it up to 100Gbps.” Haas, traditionally a radio engineer, surprised colleagues 13 years ago when he started focusing at another dimension of the electromagnetic spectrum: light. “Unlike radio, which is limited between zero and 300Ghz, the visible light spectrum can go up to 300 THz, which is 1,000 times more bandwidth compared to the radio spectrum. “If you think of today’s networks as a road with one lane, imagine how much data would flow if it was expanded into a highway with 1,000 lanes.” The idea behind Li-Fi is that LED light bulbs will intelligently transmit data to phones with the right sensors, even in low light. As people move from room to room, Li-Fi-enabled LED bulbs would send the data after them. Cars equipped with Li-Fi LED bulbs, for example, could transmit spatial and diagnostic data as they pass each other on the road. While what Haas is proposing sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, the idea is gaining ground. In July this year, his company PureLiFi raised over £7m in Series B funding from Singapore’s state-owned investment firm, Temasek. Not only that, but the new 3,500 square metre Sogeprom office – located in the commercial La Défense area of Paris – is set to become the first major workplace in the world using high-bandwidth, bi-directional Li-Fi to provide internet access. It will provide the technology and French manufacturer Lucibel will supply the LED luminaires for the ambitious installation at the headquarters of Sogeprom, the property arm of French bank Société Générale. Haas, who sparked the imagination of the world with a famous TED talk on the potential of Li-Fi in 2011, predicts that it could be could be ubiquitous in the next 10 years. He told Siliconrepublic.com: “It took Wi-Fi 14 or 15 years to become ubiquitous. “If you give us another 10 years, I am pretty sure that Li-Fi will be everywhere, in every home appliance that has an LED light, which will allow every home appliance to connect to the internet. It will enable true IoT because, theoretically, you could have IoT in every lightbulb on every street, every home, every vehicle. Every street lamp could be a 5G access point, even in daytime in direct sunlight.” Fibre will underpin everything about the future of networks UCC graduate and PhD researcher at the Tyndall Institute in Cork, Niamh Kavanagh, is working on hollow glass fibre that will make light travel even faster down fibre networks. Image: Tyndall If Haas’s vision to provide connectivity at speeds that are 1,000 times greater than Wi-Fi today is to become a reality, then the broadband networks underpinning each bulb will have to keep up. Every digital experience we take for granted, from a Whatsapp message to a voice call on your landline, involves fibre. Every bank transaction, every email, involves a pulse of data flitting from your device, flying over the air to base stations, hurtling down fibre pipes, bouncing off servers in data centres, and succeeding in arriving in a nanosecond on the other side of the world, or indeed, the room you are standing in. ‘At present, light travels along fibre at 70pc of full speed, it’s akin to trying to jog through water. But when travelling through hollow air, that speed increases to 99.7pc’ – NIAMH KAVANAGH But fibre isn’t perfect and just like with wireless spectrum, it has physical capacity issues too. In countries like Ireland, we stand on the cusp of the fibre to the home (FTTH) era; this is only the beginning. And while fibre is being heralded as a silver bullet that will future-proof communications for the next century, even that will run into problems. But have no fear, because in Cork at the Tyndall Institute, Niamh Kavanagh, a UCC PhD researcher funded by the Irish Research Council, is one of many researchers focusing on the future of fibre and photonics. This year, Kavanagh gave a talk at FameLab, an international science communications event, as well as the Cheltenham Science Festival on the subject of hollow fibre that will transform speeds over fibre. The thrust of Kavanagh’s argument is that in the future, complex surgeries could be carried out using robots operated by skilled surgeons on the other side of the world. This will require fibre networks of the highest speed quality; any network judder, even for a picosecond, could be life-threatening. “At the moment in optical communications, digital information travels along optical fibres, and the one thing people aren’t aware of is that they are using optical fibre links all the time, even when talking on their smartphone. “Currently, the fibres are made of solid glass that is the thickness of a human hair. The laser of information travels down the fibre bouncing off the wall and we can encode that light with information – similar to Morse code – or we can tune it by sending different wavelengths using different colours. “That is where we are at today and photonics is all about finding different ways to maximise the use of bandwidth using different wavelengths,” she told Siliconrepublic.com. The problem, Kavanagh warns, is that we are reaching the maximum bandwidth capabilities for the fibre we have at the moment. “One solution would be to increase the amount of power we are using to send signals but the danger is [that] that can corrupt the information being transmitted.” At Tyndall, Kavanagh and her colleagues are working on creating new kinds of fibre cables that are hollow rather than solid glass. “This would be structured similar to a drinking straw, where the glass surrounds the hollow core, and that’s where the light travels through the air, rather than through a fog of glass. “This reduced interaction of light with the material means you can send much higher amounts of power too. At present, light travels along fibre at 70pc of full speed, it’s akin to trying to jog through water. “But when travelling through hollow air, that speed increases to 99.7pc. One of the biggest industries interested in this type of fibre is the financial markets, particularly the stock markets of London and New York,” Kavanagh said. Kavanagh agrees with Haas that it is a race against time. “Fibre to the premises is happening and we need to stay a few steps ahead of the demand. The way networks are structured at the moment, they don’t scale upwards very easily. We have groups here at Tyndall who are looking five to 10 years down the line and are designing the network architectures and infrastructure to be simpler and more upwardly scalable so we continue to expand into the future. “Technologies like Li-Fi can have such amazing benefits, but at the end of the day the data still needs to go through the fibre optic link so the battle is staying a few steps ahead,” said Kavanagh. Her vision of fibre being core to telesurgery of the future is already a reality. “They did a surgical operation between France and America in 2001 called Operation Lindbergh. There are surgeons in Canada and the US who regularly operate over distances of 400km. Robotic surgeons are becoming more and more commonplace and at Cork University Maternity Hospital, for example, we have a robot called Da Vinci that is used for gynaecological operations with the surgeon just a few metres away. But if we want to make robotic surgery a reality across our planet, low latency fibre is the key.” The wireless world beckons Dr Ronan Farrell, head of RadioSpace and the SFI CONNECT Centre at Maynooth University. He believes 5G will not arrive as fast or as easily as people think. Because fibre will underpin everything that is transmitted (even wirelessly) to the human eye in the coming years, the days of messing with cables to connect devices like TVs and computers to networks will come to an end. This is already happening thanks to Wi-Fi and 4G but it is going to become even more profound. New spectrum ranges will be unlocked to accommodate 5G-related technologies, and a mysterious new wireless technology called E-band, a former NATO radio spectrum between 71GHz and 95GHz. ‘If you really want to get to a point where 1Gbps to the phone is the reality or the reality between TVs, computers and other systems, then that technology is going to be E-band’ – DR RONAN FARRELL “5G is mainly a branding term and it is going to have five physical challenges,” explained Dr Ronan Farrell from the SFI CONNECT Centre based at Maynooth University. “The first challenge is latency, then there is throughput, connectivity, mobility and density. “Latency is the term for when you ask for data and how fast you can get it back. At the moment, it is in the tens or hundreds of milliseconds range, which is faster than you or I can observe from a human perception perspective. But you will need data to travel much, much faster if we are talking about self-driving cars. If artificial intelligence in the cloud is going to be in our lives, then you will need extremely low latency links. “None of the existing telecoms systems will do that. If you really want to get to a point where 1Gbps to the phone is the reality or the reality between TVs, computers and other systems, then that technology is going to be E-band.” As part of the CONNECT national research centre for telecommunications, Maynooth University is to be the site of a new national radio test facility with aims of developing devices for 5G connectivity and the IoT. The centre, to be known as RadioSpace, will provide a large-scale, interference-free facility that will allow scientists and engineers from industry and universities to develop new 5G communications technology. Farrell, who is leading RadioSpace, said that 5G could be further off than people believe. “It is very far from deployment and I believe 4G will play a role for some time. What needs to happen is more and more cells with smaller and more numerous base stations. And who is going to pay for that? “I think it is telling that Google is putting Google Fiber’s expansion on hold because the profit margins aren’t there and the infrastructure is expensive. European telcos are seeing roaming charges being removed and SMS is being killed by WhatsApp. One of the headline claims is that 5G will deliver 1Gbps to your phone, but it could be 10 years before we see the rollout of such networks. “My prediction is that 5G, which will constitute many different technologies and standards, may not happen the same way as 3G and 4G. “What we are seeing instead is an unbelievably rapid advance in E-band technologies, which can deliver 1Gbps to 2Gbps in short range links. This will be critical to the future of self-driving cars because it will enable car radar, for example. Samsung has demonstrated 1Gbps E-band speeds over 100-metre ranges. The mobile operators are taking interest and fibre backhaul will be the key to everything.” In conclusion, Farrell said that research teams at Maynooth University’s RadioSpace are exploring E-band and other ways that the IoT can flourish, even using satellite. He predicted that the future of networks will be a world without wires, where small hospitals and digital homes will have equipment connected using either E-band, 5G or other new wireless standards. Underpinning all of this, he said, will be fibre. “We are entering the fibre to the premises world. We have spent most of our lives carrying mobiles. And now, our homes will be invaded by the IoT. “5G or E-band or whatever comes next will happen in the next 10 years. “But prepare to be surprised. Some homes today can get 60Mbps broadband. 15 years ago that was the total bandwidth into the country. Our expectations keep changing.” In-Depth: Comms Week Related: Fibre, telecoms, wireless, Tyndall National Institute, physics, Wi-Fi, research, funding and investment, radio, government & policy, networks, Maynooth University, higher education Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Trending Amazing interactive map with Wi-Fi passwords for world’s airports 8 Oct 201660 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Be part of a globally successful team A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share Comms What are the 10 most valuable telecoms brands on the planet? 7 Oct 2016179 Shares Jobs The 8 hottest jobs in telecoms 7 Oct 201671 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Pokémon Go grew to a massive 45 million daily active users per day after two months in the market, with the market reaching $250 million for the vendor Niantic by September 2016 after two months starting from zero." Phenomenal growth is anticipated to come from implementation of step-by-step procedure virtual reality modules that are used to manage systems. Every business executive in the world wants to have an IT structure agile enough to manage phenomenal growth, should that be necessary, the aim is to construct augmented reality modules that address the issues brought by the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT takes the data from sensors, superimposes analytics on collected data, turns the data into information, and streams alerts back to users that need to take action. Augmented reality enhances our sense of reality, it further explains what is going on around us, it does not support illusion, it supports getting in touch with what is real, what is really out there. Pokemon Go is so much fun because it gives us little animals, little characters to play with in our exact location, it enhances the experience of our neighborhoods. It has large beautiful birds that flap their wings and look magnificent. AR is in the early stages of an explosive growth cycle. The Pokemon Go phenomenon raid adoption raised awareness and expectation for the vision of augmented reality AR and digital enhancement of the surroundings.

(Reuters/Francois Lenoir) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong October 03, 2016 The European Commission has three outstanding antitrust charges against Google. They are far from settled, but documents leaked to Reuters Oct. 1 provide some clarity on how the European Union’s executive arm plans to deal with Google’s alleged abuse of dominance. According to the leaked documents, the commission plans to impose a heavy fine on the search giant at a level “which will be sufficient to ensure deterrence.” Google could be fined a maximum of 10% of its annual global revenue, or as much as $7.5 billion based on its 2015 revenue. The EU’s biggest fine for abuse of a dominant position was levied on Intel in 2009 at $1.44 billion. The biggest antitrust fine ever levied by the EU stands at $3.23 billion and was imposed on Daimler, Volvo, MAN, and others in July for participating in a cartel that was fixing prices. Here’s a quick recap of the EU’s cases against Google: April 2015—Shopping: Google is accused of favoring its own comparison-shopping service in its search results. This set of charges was reinforced in July 2016 after Google had a chance to reply. April 2016—Android: The EU says Google is manipulating handset-makers and telcos by requiring them to agree to exclusive deals to pre-install key Google apps. The company also is accused of paying telcos and handset-makers to pre-install Google Search, and preventing the sale of handsets using non-Google flavors of Android. July 2016—AdSense: Google is accused of preventing publishers who use AdSense from displaying ads from other advertising platforms. The Reuters documents refer to the Android and shopping cases. The documents are called Statements of Objections, which are lists of charges levied by the commission, and they were sent last week to companies that had complained about Google so that the commission could received feedback. Google received these charge sheets when the investigations were made public, on the dates listed above. The commission declined to comment on the Reuters story. The Android charge sheet shows that the commission proposed stopping Google from paying mobile operators and handset makers in return for pre-installing Google Search and Google Play, the official channel for Android users to obtain new apps. Additionally, the commission wants to stop Google’s “anti-fragmentation” agreements, which prevent handset-makers from using non-Google versions of the Android mobile operating system if they want to pre-install the commercially important Google Play on their machines. Google also will not be allowed to “punish or threaten” companies who don’t follow its rules. The charge sheet for comparison-shopping was heavily redacted by Google, a process that the commission allows to prevent confidential information from being seen by complainants. The commission intends to ask Google to rank search results from Google Shopping the same way it treats results from competing services, the document said. The commission said it would rule in the future on whether Google could ask competing services to pay for more prominent placement. The charge sheets aren’t the commission’s definitive plans. Based on Google’s defense, which can include requesting a hearing with an independent arbiter—as Qualcomm, facing a fine of up to $2.5 billion is doing—the EC could modify or drop charges. The next step is for the commission to create a draft decision, which will set out concrete actions it wants Google to take, and the size of a fine, if any. After that, Google could still appeal, as Intel is doing. In other words, there’s a long road ahead in the battle between Google and the EU.

Linux 4.9's CPUFreq To Make Greater Use Of Scheduler Info, IOWait Boosting Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 3 October 2016 at 06:34 AM EDT. Add A Comment The past few kernel releases there's been a redesign of CPUFreq and P-State code for being able to make use of the kernel's scheduler utilization data by these CPU frequency scaling drivers. That work also led to the introduction of the Schedutil governor. Work along this line has continued for Linux 4.9. Rafael Wysocki sent in the ACPI and power management pull requests on Sunday night for the Linux 4.9 kernel. With the power management updates, the CPUFreq driver was changed to allow the scheduler to pass hints to the governors' utilization update callbacks. This latest work adds support for IOwait boosting to the Schedutil governor and the Intel P-Sstate driver for boosting the performance if the enqueued task was previously waiting on I/O. The power management pull request also has some fixes around the Schedutil code, support for more ARM platforms in CPUFreq-DT, and a variety of other updates. The ACPI update has ACPICA code updates, a new ACPI WDAT (Watchdog Action Table) driver, and other ACPI updates and fixes. Details on that here.

Comedian Amy Schumer has been named the Most Dangerous Celebrity according to McAfee's annual list. The list was published by Intel Security.

Photograph: Kind Courtesy Britney Spears/Instagram Pop star Britney Spears says she has a huge snake phobia. This news comes as a surprise as Britney has performed with the reptile at one of her concerts 15 years ago. The 34-year-old singer, who performed at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards with a huge albino python draped over her shoulders, revealed that she feared the snakes back then and still does, reported FemaleFirst. "I think it was great but I wouldn't do that now. Never! I'm totally scared of snakes but I was completely fearless. It was cool. "I was (scared of snakes back then), but I was just so excited that I was like, 'Whatever'," she said. **** Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters Reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian is reportedly pregnant with on-and-off boyfriend Scott Disick's fourth child. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star's pregnancy is the reason why they have been spending a lot of time together,reported Radar Online. Kardashian, 37, apparently shocked the entire Keeping Up with the Kardashians clan when she dropped her baby bombshell. A source revealed that Kourtney wants a large family. According to the source, the couple was totally back on, during their recent trip to Miami. A representative for Kourtney has not commented on the pregnancy rumors yet.  **** Kylie's phone available on Twitter! Photograph: Kind Courtesy Kylie Jenner/Instagram Reality TV personality Rob Kardashian has reportedly shared his half sister Kylie Jenner's phone number on social media for not inviting his pregnant fiancee, Blac Chyna to the baby shower planned for the couple. The 29-year-old TV star took to Twitter to blast Kylie and other family members for mistreating Chyna again. "Didn't invite the mother of my child to a baby shower you all were trying to throw for me! You all must have lost your damn minds," he wrote. In a series of tweets he shared what he claimed was the phone number of the 19-year-old model. None from the Kardashian-Jenner clan has responded to Rob's tweets so far. Meanwhile Kylie and Kendall Jenner have added matching Ferraris to their car collection. The sisters shared the shots of their black and silver luxury cars on Snapchat. Kylie, 19, posted a photo of Kendall, with the caption "she so corny" and a video in which the 20-year-old model decked out in Ferrari gear.

When it was first announced, it was revealed that the game would not be sold separately. However later it was speculated based on comments that maybe Modern Warfare Remastered could be sold separately after all. If you were hoping that would be the case, you might be disappointed. According to a post on Charlie Intel, they have noted the fine print on Call of Duty’s website that states that not only will you need Infinite Warfare to play the game, but you will actually need to have the disc inserted in order to play the game, presumably as some kind of verification/authentication tool. The fine print reads, “Modern Warfare Remastered is a full game download (game disc must be inserted to play Modern Warfare Remastered).” Now for those who were planning on buying Infinite Warfare anyway, we guess this doesn’t really change anything. However for those who are only interested in Modern Warfare, there does not appear to be any other way to acquire the game for now. The folks at Polygon have reached out to Activision to clarify the fine print, but until the publisher states otherwise, like we said, gamers have only one way of acquiring the remastered copy of Modern Warfare for now.

I have fond memories of hosting him here in Atlanta a few years ago. He got separated from his luggage on the flight, but had his sax as carry-on and a laptop. We had to stop to do some clothes shopping before his talk. The gig went very well, except he just did one short sax number. I had been able to stitch together some of the Christian Palestinian movement, the peace loving Quakers, and Cynthia McKinney even showed up. The best part was being able to bring my TV camera and be able to set up close enough to pick up his audio with a shotgun mic, so I have some great archive footage. Gilad is a great stand up comic, with good timing and schmoozing an audience. They loved every minute of it.

Kara Swisher: Today in the red chair is someone I've tried to get here for a long time, it's someone I've known for a very long time: Bill Gurley, general partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. He's invested in companies ranging from GrubHub to Zillow to Uber and serves on several board[s] of directors. Before he joined Benchmark in 1999, Bill worked at Compaq and spent four years as a tech analyst on Wall Street. Bill, welcome to the show. Bill Gurley: Thanks for having me. We have known each other a long time. Very long time. I knew you as an analyst, I think. Yes. I don't know if I knew you at Compaq, because I didn't cover Compaq. But I did cover, I remember, the CEO at the time. There's so much to talk about; I think people know you really well here in Silicon Valley, but some of our listeners don't. So walk through how you got to Benchmark. I wrote the story when you went to Benchmark, if you recall, in 1999 for the Wall Street Journal. You had been at another venture capital firm. How far back do you want me to go? Well, how did you get into [being a] tech analyst? Let's start with tech analyst and Compaq. I had a computer engineering degree in undergrad, and my sister was a double E [electrical engineering major] out of Rice and was employee 63 at Compaq, so I was exposed … Wow. Where did you grow up? In Houston. So yeah, of course. My father was in the space program, worked at Johnson Space Center. And Compaq was there, right? In Texas. Yeah, and her going through that obviously brought a lot of exposure into our family of being at a startup, and she was given options. And Kleiner was an investor. Oh yeah. I wouldn't have expected to have that exposure that early in my life. I also — like everyone you've probably had in this chair — had a Commodore VIC-20 and used to code out of magazines and stuff like that. I ended up at the University of Florida where I rode the end of the bench on the basketball team and got a comp sci degree. I went to Compaq, where I'd spent some summers, and worked there for a couple of years, and I found I was drawn to a broader calling. I started work on the third PC and it looked a lot like the second and the first. What did you do? I worked in a team that did problem solving. So when a new computer was coming to market, they'd put it into test and it would fail. And my team, we'd get thrown in a room with a logic analyzer — Like, "why isn't this working?" Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it was fun. It was fun. This was the '80s, right? Yeah, this was '89 to '91. I remember AOL was on that one computer ... I can't remember. They were all small computers. I had a Prodigy account when I was working there, and I used to trade stocks. I ended up going to business school and then I started trading stocks — Borland went public during that time. And so this combination of being fascinated with technology, looking for a broader thing to do, and then getting interested in investing and tech and disruption, that kind of thing. So I went to business school, I thought about trying to get into venture at business school. I went and met with some Austin Ventures people who said, "Kid, you're way too young, go get 20 years of work experience." Right, because they had operators. That's what they said, yeah. Which is ironic, and I can come back to that, based on how we choose people at Benchmark now. But anyway, while I was at business school, everybody cracks open every Fortune and Businessweek and they read everything because they want to think they are professional business people. And so I was reading about all these amazing analysts at Goldman Sachs at the time, Dan Benton and people like that. And Rick Sherlund. And they were always quoted, like, opining, and I just got interested in it. You wanted to opine. Yeah, I went to Wall Street and just knocked on doors. Like cold, like what you read about. And got very lucky that [Credit Suisse] First Boston gave me an opportunity. Right, which was a big deal at the time. And then two weeks after I joined, Charlie Wolf was there covering PCs, and he announced he wanted to resign and back off. So I went into my tiny little apartment with no air conditioner and wrote a 20-page assessment of the PC industry. What did you tap away on? I don't remember, probably some kind of luggable. I'm thinking Kaypro, perhaps, around then. Trash-80. And I went in and begged for Charlie's job, and was very fortunate. Not only did Charlie share with me all his models, but two of the other ranked analysts, David Course and Dan Benton, who still comes to your conference every year, they gave me all their models and they've all left the field. Oh, where did they go? Dan and David when to the buy side and Charlie went into academia. They just like got out. "We're leaving." Wasn't that a signal to you? "Uh oh, I better get out of here?" It couldn't have been more fortunate, right? Because I moved up through the ranks very quickly. It's an opportunity. That's somewhat how I got my job at the Washington Post. People retired or left. So that was a big event. And then the other big event was at Stewart Alsop's conference, which Charlie helped me get into. Which was the big deal, Agenda. Oh man, you're standing at that first dinner, and there's Bill Gates and Larry Ellison and all this stuff, and you're like, "I'm just a nobody, this is crazy." But anyway, one of those first few years, they were selling a Palm Pilot. And it had the attendees’ contact information in it. Ahh, aren't you clever. And I had just started this newsletter called "Above the Crowd," which was a fax at the time. And so I was just like, "Oh wait, this is too easy." So I paid like $200 for this Palm Pilot and I spammed everybody … … with "Above the Crowd." It was a great newsletter. The most important people in the technology industry. Yeah, you've always been a writer. We'll talk about that soon. It came from the analyst days, because I had to write big, long reports. Absolutely. But they used to write reports a lot better then. There was a lot of people, you know, Mary, you, even Henry Blodget wrote some fantastic stuff, though it didn't end so well for him there. So then — I should hurry this along — so after three years of doing that, I was getting burned out. It's a tough job being an analyst. And I was thinking about going to the buy side and, in fact, had been interviewing with Capital Group in LA ... Right, that's Gordon Crawford. ... who I still have a ton of respect for. And Frank Quattrone called me ... out of the blue, and he had left Morgan Stanley on, I think, Good Friday in '96. We ended up sitting down and he said that he'd like me to join their new firm. And I said, "You know, I'm kind of burned out on this analyst thing." And he said, "Well, what do you want to do, long-term?" And I said, "I'd love to be a venture capitalist." And Frank said, "Why don't I move you to Silicon Valley? You can cover any sector you want, and I'll introduce you to every venture capitalist I know." Well, that's an offer. Yeah. What did he do, take your soul? [BG laughs] Frank kind of looks satanic, so did he say, "You must ..." You know, there are people that are super loyal to Frank and I'm one of them. And when someone makes a commitment like that and helps you get your dream job … And you worked for them. Yeah, I did. And we were very fortunate. We were lead-left on the Amazon IPO, which would be a famous trivia question one day. "Who took Amazon public?" Frank was in the middle of all this. Or else buying and selling companies. He was involved in a lot of that during that time. Yes, and [Jeff] Blackburn was the banker that worked alongside me who then went to Amazon. Before we get ahead of ourselves, what was that period like? Because I was here too. I remember these things. And at the risk of sounding aged, it really was an exciting time. Well, for me, it was my real first exposure to Silicon Valley. I'd been out here a couple times as a PC analyst, but the PC industry wasn't really centered in Silicon Valley. No, it wasn't. IBM and Compaq, and even AST was in Irvine. And Gateway was in Sioux Falls. So I didn't travel here all that much, and then I was just suddenly put here. Because internet, that's why. And by the way, that's the sector that I asked Frank that I wanted to cover, and of course I knew nothing about it, so I went and bought all those TCP/IP books and stuff, which I don't think helped me at all, but I read them anyway. And it was super exciting, you know? And I knew a few people. Like when Frank called me, I called [Roger] McNamee because he had been at T. Rowe, so he was someone I had known from the buy side. And there's a few others like Glen Kacher and some of the Tiger guys. So I called Roger and I said, "I don't know Frank." He's like, "Take his meeting immediately. You have to. This'll get you to Silicon Valley." So it's been great. Roger's always been someone that I've called along the years to help me think through decisions. Yeah, it was so exciting. Like I remember one of the first meetings was in a train caboose for CNET with Halsey [Minor] and Shelby [Bonnie]. And I knew nothing about media or advertising. Right. That doesn't stop many people. And Halsey was just remarkably upset that I wasn't getting it faster, and Shelby, God bless him, was just super calm and casual, bringing me along and teaching me. That was interesting. He used to call me in the middle of the night because he was like, "Why is my story on [page] A22 of the Wall Street Journal and Yahoo's on the front?" Or whatever. And I said, "You're lucky you're on A22, because I got you on A22 or else you wouldn't be there at all." But that didn't end well for Halsey. No. But I've stayed in touch with Shelby. I consider him a wonderful gentleman. Yeah. So then you shifted over to venture capital. I was with Hummer Winblad for 18 months and then came to Benchmark. So that was a big deal, I remember. That was like, gaaah. Like, "You left there?" And they were shifting at Benchmark at the time. Yeah, two weeks after I announced the Hummer Winblad position, Andy Rachleff cornered me at a conference and said, "Dude, why didn't you call me?" And quite frankly, I would have to say I was so fixated [on] being a venture capitalist [that] when someone started to ask me, I'd say, "Yes!" Yeah, take the first date. And they were a well-known firm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'm still very close friends with John [Hummer]. I think the cultural fit with Benchmark is just [better]. Yeah. I remember tall, white guys, essentially. Well ... Come on. I sat across from them when they were talking about eBay. When someone approaches you that works for an equal partnership … because everyone else that's working their way into venture starts at the bottom with only a piece of the action, you’ve got to work your way up. Someone else's name firm. It's a pretty compelling offer when someone comes and says, "We want you to be one of us." Absolutely. And you were the tallest of all those tall men. But it did cause reverberations. Everyone was sort of talking, I remember, it was a big deal because you were sort of the bright young thing at the time. Well I guess now that I've been here something like 16 or 17 years, it's probably the right place. Yeah. And it was changing also. It was starting to shift. To a certain extent, the beginning of my venture career was a little bit like being near the top of a roller coaster: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. And then it just slammed down before I ever had a chance to really establish myself and build a track record. This was the end of the first internet bubble. And when I first arrived at Benchmark, it was like, "Nothing can go wrong." There was an IPO every week. And they had done eBay. And then, wham! Man, the door came down hard. So what was that like? Because you do write a lot about bubbles. You're like the worrywart of Silicon Valley. And we'll talk about that in the next section. But what was that like, as an early venture capitalist, when you have that happen to you? It's intimidating. I mean, I think for anyone that breaks into venture, years two, three and four, unless you're as lucky as, say, [Matt] Cohler with Instagram or Roelof [Botha] with YouTube, are just anxiety-ridden. People use the metaphor of children: You basically have a bunch of middle-aged teenagers with acne that are awkward and clumsy. And you haven't proven anything. That's if you do early-stage. And so it's a gut check. And it's really helpful — at least it was helpful for me at Benchmark with the equal partnership — there's just this kind of team orientation where, if you feel like you're struggling, people are getting beside you. Yeah, because they all have a stake in it. Yeah, they have a stake in you doing well. It's not an eat-what-you-kill kind of situation. Not at all. So what was your investment? My first investment at Hummer Winblad was a company called Employease, which was SaaS HR. Ah, early. Way before its time. It was like Workday, 10 years early. Or Zenefits. I was just visiting their offices. Very similar. Because we didn't charge the same way, but the same customer set. But it was the beginning of that idea. And ADP ended up buying it for 150 [million]. But we didn't make nearly as much money. And we made a huge mistake by choosing HR instead of sales, because HR is a corporate purchase by someone who doesn't have any authority. And sales is a credit card purchase by someone who has all the authority. So, hard lesson. So you did that. And what was your first at Benchmark? What were you involved in? It was Epinions. Epinions, oh my god. Was that a success or a failure for you? We ended up merging it with Dealtime, it went public, and eBay bought it for $600, $700 million. Yeah, so you feel good about that. But that was a hit company, and then sort of not. It was. It was covered in the New York Times Magazine, and then the bubble burst and then there was a founder split and … Explain Epinions for people who don't know. I remember you on the covers. It was always on the covers, that guy. Epinions was a big UGC idea at the beginning of the internet, which was basically to allow UGC reviews of anything and everything. And they started in the categories more like products. They did experiment with services. And the CEO was? The CEO was Naval Ravikant. Naval, yeah. That's right. An interesting story about him: We ended up splitting from him and there ended up being a lawsuit. And this was, I don't know, 16, 17 years ago. I'd always thought of Naval as one of the smartest people I'd ever met, but when someone sues you, you tend to get on the other side of things. And just this past winter, I was at a ski event that Chris Sacca put together, and he was invited and we sat down and talked for the first time in [ages]. Oh wow. And? It was great. Hugged it out? Yeah, it was awesome. It reminded me of why we worked together in the first place. But I regret that we spent 16 years not chatting. And he's obviously gone on to do some spectacular things. In the next section, we're going to talk a little bit about your philosophies, what you write about, because you write about bubbles and things like that. But what was your philosophy on investing then? What were you doing in the early days? And we'll talk later about how it changed. I think when I was on Wall Street. just devouring any book I could in investing philosophy — I think I bring a structured approach. You're almost academic in the way you think about it. And the way I think about it, which will sound trite, but I'm always looking for some kind of competitive advantage, like some type of unfair ability to compete in the marketplace. I don't get drawn to the kind of enterprise deals that are just, "Who has the better Salesforce, knock them down," kind of thing. People make money doing that. It's a valid approach. I remember the OpenTable scenario. We're meeting with Chuck [Templeton], and he's in, like, three restaurants, and we're like, "How could this ever work?" And you're like, "Well, it can work if we tip it into a network effect and then everyone has to buy it." And that's what played out. It's that kind of thing. So is that what convinced you? Like, what advantage do you mean? In that case, we were betting on the existence of a network effect. And people talk about network effects all the time, but you come up with ways to try and analyze whether it's possible or not. Will more diners lead to more restaurants, and will more restaurants lead to more diners? Are there ways to measure and study that? Or to implement the go-to-market strategy such that it exploits it as much as possible? So does your analytical approach hurt you sometimes? You're not the gut investor that some people are. It can. I think venture's really hard. And there's a lot of luck involved. And mistakes that you make — especially missing ideas — are ... it's called asymmetric returns. But if you invest in something that doesn't work, you lose one times your money. If you miss Google, you lose 10,000 times your money. You have to orient yourself toward — Bruce [Dunlevie] uses the phrase, "What could go right?" And you have to kind of think that way all the time. Oh, that's interesting. And you're more likely, being overly analytical, to talk yourself out of things. Right, right, that's what I mean. And so you have to twist your brain in the right way. Yeah, because you can think of all the wrong things, "What could go wrong?" Yeah. And by the way, the Google example is one that kind of fit that at the time. That was 1998, yeah. Excite was going bankrupt. Yup, they were. And Yahoo's stock had fallen from like 82 to 10. So search didn't look that interesting. And you had two academics and ... There's a venture rule book: "Don't back academics who insist on being CEO." [laughs] So there was a number of things that said, "Don't do it." But two of the smartest investors ever — … Sequoia and Mike Barnes ... — stepped up and did it. They also wanted a price that was seemingly ridiculous, obviously a very good investment. Did you pass on that one? We failed to pursue it. It's always important to state it that way. Because to say "pass" made it sound like we had a chance. I don't know if we had a chance. They presented to us and we failed to pursue it. And if we had, we would have had to compete with two of the best. Right. Absolutely, I remember visiting that garage, Susan Wojcicki's garage at the time. There were 25 employees when I met with them. And they were crazy, let's be clear. They were. And there were a lot of search things that had gone wrong. And Yahoo still was very strong. And, in fact, their big break was when they put Google on the Yahoo platform as the search engine. I remember. And it was a fatal error for Yahoo at the time, even though they got a big stake in it. Yup. So all right, when we get back we're going to talk about how you've developed as a venture capitalist and also some of your writings. Because you always create sort of a big old mess. Like, people start talking about the things you write, especially around bubbles. Recently you've been writing about bubbles, and you've written about them several times. You're sort of the voice of warning in the industry. When we get back with Bill Gurley of Benchmark. [ad] We're here with Bill Gurley of Benchmark, who I've known a long time. We're talking about investing, philosophy and writing about it. Now, you've been very public about your opinions. A lot of venture capitalists are super secretive. You haven't been. You were an analyst before, so you're used to writing and putting your opinions out there, and at various times you've caused sort of a kerfuffle talking about the bubble, right? At the top, where everyone's feeling good, you're like, "Just a second." Sort of like the aunt at a garden party sometimes, talking about how you had written about the trouble a-comin’. This was about six months ago? Yup. I would tell you — as a backdrop, and then I'll dive into it — that I have a philosophy that the very best entrepreneurs are disserved by bubbles. In other words, they would raise money at any time. When bubbles come along, almost anyone can raise money. And so it creates excessive competition, you get companies that are misbehaving and doing things that can disrupt markets. And so I've found, and maybe I'm just a contrarian, but I've found that like 1999 and 2015 were two of my least favorite times in Silicon Valley. Some of it I would tie back to just the behavior you see. You once said — I read something you wrote — you said, "Too much arrogance, too much bullshit will be the downfall of Silicon Valley." And it's interesting because that reminds me of a conversation I was having with Rachel Whetstone, who now runs comms at Uber. Shortly after we met, she said, "Do you watch HBO's ‘Silicon Valley?’" And I said, "No, I don't, I tried to watch the first episode and I didn't like it." And she said, "You have to watch it." And I said, "Why do I have to watch it?" She said, "The rest of the world is laughing at us." And I still to this day think half of the people in Silicon Valley don’t know that it's a parody. Ah, it's true. They like it. They like being paid attention to at all, I think. I'll give you another example of the kind of stuff that just makes me cringe. I was at an investor conference last year in Vegas, a private investor conference. That one, I know which one. Where everything leaks out. That private one. So unicorns are presenting, right? One after another. And I probably sit in on eight unicorn presentations, and five of them use the world "trillion." Now I don't think I had heard the word trillion in an investor presentation before that day. That's a big dream. But we had done something in the ecosystem to encourage this type of outlandish promotion — Going to the moon. — where you feel like you need to use words like trillion. And I think it's dangerous when we act like we have the right to disrupt everything or eat every industry, but we're not willing to play by the rules of profitability or GAAP accounting or being public. We look like entitled brats. And I think the end state, the really bad end state of that type of behavior, is we invite regulation from Washington that I prefer we not have. But I think that's possible if we play it too loose. If we play it too loose, if we talk about all these numbers ... Every three or four years, the [Wall Street] Journal has a story about the parties. I think they just recycle the same story, I don't know if it's so much the party ... What I was talking about in that quote was, I was interviewing an author who was writing about how innovation dies and how it's created. And someone asked me, and I said, "Well, it's going to be that. It's the same thing every time." And people discount risk slowly. Like they forget about pain and they forget about layoffs and they forget about that this is supposed to be hard, you need to profitable. And the younger generation, they're taught in very short time windows. So most of the entrepreneurs today weren't around in '99. So they've forgotten. They have no muscle memory of it whatsoever. There is also a mentality, though. If you have a depression-era mentality, you don't do anything, too. That's true, that's true. Absolutes on either end aren't going to get you anywhere. And, in fact, I would suggest that there are two types of entrepreneurs. There's the incredible operator who might be a COO, they hate these times. Because they can't promote. And then there's this hyper-promotional person that only comes to Silicon Valley when the time is right, and then they go away. And boy, those drive me crazy. You start to see the scammers. And you see it in the deal flow, so it goes from being 10 percent hyper promotional to 90. And I've even heard stories that I find hard to believe, but I've heard stories of reputable people in Silicon Valley, "You should overstate your numbers in your fundraising because everyone's doing it and everyone's just going to discount them anyway." If people are really doing that, it's distasteful, you know? Let's talk about what you wrote about the bubble. What were your main worries, and how do you look at them now? There was just an article in the Journal talking about how people are fixing themselves. Do you think that's the case? Somewhat, yeah. I mean look, the piece that Sequoia did, the deck that Sequoia did in ‘09 was extremely helpful to the Benchmark portfolio. Because you went into that next board meeting and everyone had kind of reevaluated where they were. And Katie Benner — who wrote that story that you're talking about — called me and said she started researching this topic and she started calling entrepreneurs, and some of the stuff I had written had inspired them to change their behavior. So that actually means a lot to me if that was a result. If we play these bubbles out, if we just get extremely promotion-to-the-end-state, then you have the type of crash you had in '01, which is complete wipeout. Like, 50 percent of people get laid off. And it'd certainly be better if we can avoid that kind of thing. Are you, as venture capitalists, sort of responsible and indulgent of these entrepreneurs? Because you have Mark — and you were talking about it, but Mark's knocked up the prices. You all knock up the prices quite high. I think everybody, to a certain extent, has to play the game on the field. I like to use the example of Hortonworks and Cloudera. So we're in this company Hortonworks, it's a Hadoop company. Cloudera raises $950 million from Intel. What do you do? You could sit around and say, "We're going to get to profitability," but you're not going to matter. You might as well lock the door and leave the building. So you're forced into a game of capital warfare that you may have not been ready to play. And so I don't know that any one person is responsible. Silicon Valley and venture capital have always been cyclical. And so there's something about human nature that causes us to be increasingly risk-seeking until someone comes along and really punishes everybody. There was that study in Iceland where the banks started taking risks — it's often men, I'm sorry to say, but women don't take the same risks. [Men] underestimate risk rather severely. Right, and there's tons of books that have been written on different types of asset bubbles. There's another contributing factor, I think, right now, which is [that] we've had low global interest rates for the past seven years. And I was fortunate enough this summer to meet Warren Buffett — Chamath [Palihapitiya] was the one that made that happen. But we only had one question each, and I said, "You know, in our industry we're seeing that low interest rates are leading to overt competition that's irrational." And he says, "You bet it is." And he's seeing it in his business as well, and I think it's played out in natural gas and all these other pockets. Real estate in Silicon Valley, right? All these asset prices, because with interest rates so low you just have people looking for yield, so money sloshes around. I always say there's not enough rat holes to shove it all down in Silicon Valley. It's true. I would have never imagined in my life as a venture capitalist that the biggest problem would be too much capital everywhere. So what do you do? Here you are, trying to compete with your Hadoop company and others, what do you do? Do you discipline yourself or do you just go along for the crazy ride? I write about what could go wrong in the hope that it might correct something, but I may not have been very successful at that. You play the game on the field, and the game on the field may be particularly sloppy. You're trying to outraise one another, which perpetuates the problem. You out-hype each other. Yeah. You try and spend more efficiently, even though everyone's losing way more money. And one of my biggest things that I've said about this current time is the risk we're taking because of the size of the losses. If you go back to ‘99, there were a whole bunch of companies going public and everything, but people were still moving towards profitability at $30 or $40 million in revenue. And this is way different. There's way fewer companies, whatever the number of unicorns is, but they're being given piles of money. Hundreds of millions. And burn rates are areas we've never seen before. And steering those back towards profitability, if capital ever becomes scarce, is going to be a really difficult exercise. So how are you going to do that? I don't know. "Put down that free kombucha shake right now!" And look, there's been some things that I think have been super helpful. Tomas speaking out on Kind bars and brick walls, and then you know, this summer over at Dropbox, Drew Houston went out, it looks like he did a press tour about cutting $35 million of perks out of Dropbox and did it in a way that he was proud of. And you've had the Evernote thing as well, where they've corrected some of that stuff. And seeing him as a leader talk about that as a smart exercise is awesome. And a sign, like some of the stuff that Katie wrote about, that we're moving back in the right direction. Do you ever feel you can do anything else to impact entrepreneurs besides writing? What would you write right now, if you were doing that essay? I've got an unwritten blog post about unit economics. One of the things that Silicon Valley does when it gets risk-seeking, which it did in '99 and now, is they invest in businesses with lower and lower gross margins. And that's riskier. And a lot of times those involve consumer products. And then what they do is they start selling them heavily discounted. And there's this old saying about selling dollars for 85 cents. But there's a truism to it. You can create infinite revenue if you sell dollars for 85 cents. And if you give consumers more value than you charge them for, they will love you. And I remind entrepreneurs all the time that Webvan had the highest NPS scores of any company I've ever known. It wasn't that the consumer proposition didn't work, it was that the economics didn't work. They weren't charging enough for the service level. What's interesting about that is that conceptually, it was the right idea. A lot of things are directionally correct, but it wasn't working out on an economic basis. They should have been charging more money, basically. Anyway, we're in one of those time frames. Some of that's starting to get cleaned up. There's probably been more shutdowns this year than in the previous three. Or sales. Or sales. And layoffs. You're starting to smell for the first time. I've heard signs of some real estate correcting. I'm hopeful that it can be a soft landing. Historically, it hasn't been. Right. What could happen? Oh, what could happen? I mean, macro is really hard to get right. And Buffet and those guys don't even try. We've got an election, we've got so much going on. I think the European situation is probably a bigger hotbed. If Italy or something defects from the EU, and the kind of thing that could cause. China's GDP, a lot of people are worried about. I don't have enough knowledge to know whether that could be the catalyst, but it could be. We're talking to Bill Gurley about investing and the bubble and some of the things he's written about it. When we get back, we're going to talk about his current investments and some other thoughts that he has going forward. [ad] ************* We're here with Bill Gurley, the well-known venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who works at Benchmark. He's been involved in lots and lots of companies. He was an analyst before that, but he's one of the most high-profile venture capitalists, VCs, in the Valley. Today, the Journal had a piece about how you guys are doing pretty well. Little bit of smack-around of Andreessen Horowitz. How do you judge yourselves? It's difficult. The venture industry, as I mentioned earlier, you have to be very fortunate to fall on what people sometimes refer to as positive black swans, these break-out plays. And I think you could spend your whole career and do extremely well and never get behind one of the ones: A Facebook, a Google, that kind of thing. And it's almost impossible to predict ahead of time what's going to turn into something like that. And so it just creates a ton of anxiety. I would also say that it's an extremely cyclical business and so you might be doing well in '99 and really eating crow in '01 or '02. And so it goes up and down and it's hard. What we try and do internally is we keep track of what we're doing, what our competitors are doing and what are the deals or investments that we regret not doing. And we just constantly talk about it. What are the regrets? What are the investments? We'll talk about the ones you've done. Right now? It's the obvious ones. It's Airbnb, Pinterest, Slack, GitHub is one that we're fascinated with. I think the Collison brothers at Stripe are … Which you didn't do? Which we didn't do. I like them more than their business, but I really like them. Pinterest? On them, it's just like the thing I said about growth mindset. Like, learn-it-alls. They're nuts. They're just begging for information, which I love. I think with Pinterest it's just the size and scope. It got way bigger than we would have predicted. And the others? Slack, I think it's fairly obvious. It's a viral enterprise tool. And you didn't think that would be. Well, there had been Yammer. It was a pivot, it was a game company. Yeah it was, I remember. You can't kiss them all. And Airbnb, you know, Matt brought it in like his first week he had joined us. And we got caught up on one of our rules about ownership and redid it for a lower ownership. One of your rules. Do you think you should have rules? What are your biggest rules? You try to maximize ownership, take a board seat. There aren't that many [rules]. No academics in garages. You can get into trouble. And one of the games you play in venture is to know which rules to break at the right time. And so we constantly challenge ourselves. Like, "Should we maybe be dropping this rule at this moment in time because things are changing?" Does that make you the most insecure people on the planet? It might. It feels like it sometimes. Chasing the breakout. And when the close happens on one of those, it's actually a really perverse element of the venture industry. Like the moment that John Doerr and Mike Moritz closed the Google investment, which was probably all of a week and half, it was the biggest event in both those firms for over a decade. Yeah, without even knowing it at the time. And something had happened in a week and a half. And for a lot of those companies, and I'll include the ones we're in, if you worked there it probably would have come out that way anyway. So the seminal event was that closing event that was very quick. Right, and decisions were made quickly. Often on a instinct, actually. And in that case, like we talked about previously, most people's instincts would say, "Don't do it." So talk about what you did do. Obviously your biggest — there's a couple at Benchmark, but Uber is one of your big ones. I've talked to all of you about how that happened and various people, of course, take credit all the time and this and that. But it really was Matt and then you others there. And it went back and forth actually, initially. Having come out of OpenTable being successful, I was trying to think of other industries where, if you put a network on top of [it, that] would absorb waste and make it more efficient and more usable. And the thesis of cars had come up, and we had met with several taxi [startups] — there were actually taxi startups before Uber. And we had quickly come to the conclusion that doing it on top of taxi wasn't the right way to do it because prices were fixed, they’re oligopolies, there's regulation, and if anyone did it on town cars, we would pay attention. So that was a thesis we had internally when they popped up. Which was a town car kind of offering. Ride in style, whatever it was. Yeah, so we immediately cold-called them, and I remember meeting with Ryan and Travis at a restaurant and then I brought them [in]. This was before their seed round, and this is the part you're talking about about going back and forth. And they presented the company to us for the seed round and we chose not to do it at that point in time. And then for the next three or four months … What that like, Calacanis and Sacca were in that one, right? That's right. And then over the next three or four months Matt became, I think, the No. 1 rider on Uber. And as he's done many times in our partnership — … This is Matt Cohler ... — he came into the room screaming, "We have to do it! We have to do it! We have to do it!" And so we got aggressively in front of the series A. And what did you think at the time? What would happen here? Of the entrepreneur, Travis, and obviously Garrett Camp was involved and others. Between the time we looked at the seed and when we did the A, Travis had moved into the CEO position. At the beginning we were just studying him as an angel investor in the thing, and probably by the time the A came around he was the CEO. It was hard. Like I said, we had a theory that it could be like OpenTable. So you know, OpenTable was sold for like $3 billion or something. So I'd be inaccurate if I suggested we had a vision that it could one day cause people to question car ownership. I never had considered that. And what do you think of the person? He's quite aggressive. He is, he is. So Matt had known him for a while. I actually called Mark Cuban, because Cuban had been an investor in Red Swoosh, and they had ended up in a disagreement, yet Mark had walked away thinking Travis was remarkably professional even though they had different points of opinion, which I took as a positive. I like to think I knew how passionate he was. But I didn't. We were taking a chance. I'm remarkably thrilled, now that we're involved, to see a guy who's just so committed to what he does. Right, but some say too committed, too aggressive. Do you provide, "Slow this the hell down, stop arguing with people." You know, it's funny, in the book I mentioned earlier, "Grit," this woman Angela Duckworth had studied all these people that have been successful. And she claims, and there's a big TED video that's only six minutes which is quicker to watch than reading the book, but she says the key characteristic that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful isn't IQ, it's grit. And she describes grit as passionate perseverance. And on those two dimensions, I think Travis may be completely on the far rail. One of the board members described him as "remarkably all-in." You know? Yeah. But that can become abrasive and irritating, which to many it has. Completely understand. I do think that most VCs would probably yearn for most of their founders and CEOs to have some of this grit. Does that have to change, and do you have an impact on that? I think every one of the entrepreneurs that gets thrown into the limelight in the way that he has — And with failures before. He really did have a lot of trouble. By the way, I think those contribute to the grit. Oh absolutely, I think it's right at the heart of it. He spent so much time on these startups and one of them went bankrupt and one he sold for $20 million. And in the first one he sort of got screwed by his investors. Absolutely. And just years and years of trying. I often think that the grit is driven by some kind of obligation to the Entrepreneur Society of America. Because he knows how hard it is to be on one of the ones that's not working. Yeah, I felt it was rage. It was just like, "This one's going to work." And so you get on one that has the wind at your back instead of your face and you're like, "I'm going to play it for all it's worth." And I do feel like that's part of the motivation. So, just finishing up on Uber, obviously you're on the board, correct? Correct. When is it going public? You know, I don't think that we're going to be going public anytime in the near future because of all the issues that we just talked about. We have a large number of competitors, even with the deal done. Well done, by the way. Thank you. [Competitors] who are very deep pocketed, who have decided that their primary form of competition is not going to be like building a different app or a differentiated service or a different level, it's just price. And so there are intense subsidy battles going on. All over the world. All over the world. And those companies, when they approach investors, tell them, "Uber is going to go public, and then they're going to have to be profitable, and then we're really going to sneak up on them with these discounts." While that's the game on the field, and it's one that I find to be remarkably messy and ugly, I don't think it would be in our best interest. So raising more money is the way to go. I don't know if we need to. We have $9 billion in the bank and $2 billion of debt, which is the most any private company has ever raised. Does that frighten you? Yeah, but two things. One, I do think that it is one of the best product market fits that has ever come along. And as I've come to realize what's possible here, there is a real opportunity to literally change the face of America. You talked about that early on, I remember. Like car ownership has gotten way too far in our country. 2.3 per household. I agree. And parking lots. Houston has like 4.5 parking spots per car. And there's an opportunity to change it. You can actually lower housing pricing if you remove parking requirements. So we're doing deals now with developers and getting cities to approve them to have parking-free housing. It's definitely hit into a bigger trend. A bigger, more important trend. And if you survey people, Recode had an article about a survey, and even though the Recode article was a little dismissive, it said 8 percent of the people in the survey said that ride-sharing had a strong likelihood to impact car buying decisions. That's 8 percent. This stuff only existed five years ago. Yup, it's like smartphones, early on. Yeah, what will that number be five years from now? Absolutely, I don't drive my car anymore. I think it's a leading edge. I know a ton of people who have gotten rid of their cars. Does that ruin the idea of public [transportation]? I was at a meeting the other day talking about how private transportation companies do not take the place of public transportation. I think most of the ride-sharing companies, if you look at heat maps, and they've published some of these, have huge red areas around public transportation. So most of the effective public transportation, which isn't buses, it's the subways and rails, they can't get to that last mile. And there have been studies done that suggest they're symbiotic. That they actually drive more usage of each. So let's talk about — we're going to finish up in just a minute — what else are you in now that you think is very exciting? What makes you excited? A couple. I'd probably mention three. So, Nextdoor, which is a social network for the local neighborhood that's really starting to grow. Which also has issues around racism ... They've done a really good job of addressing those in the past couple of weeks. They're trying. It's like Twitter, it's humanity, right? Absolutely. Although mine is just horrible. Is there any black person who can walk down the street that's not suspect? I'm like, "Can you stop?" Yeah, they've just come out with a whole bunch of new programs on this front. I think some of the initial people that were upset have come around and sanctioned what they're doing. So I feel good about how they've done that. Tools are important. Why do you like that one? If you go back to like 2006, the local advertising market was like 110 billion. And many of the avenues people would use to microcast advertising were radio, newspapers, magazines. They've come under threat from digital disruption, and there's not a place for people to bring that out. I also think by having a social network in the neighborhood, there's lots of features that you can implement over time. We're starting to do some of those now. And also because we're not dependent on anyone. We're not an SEO company, we didn't build on the back of Facebook Connect, we built this out ourselves. Right. It's a bulletin board. It didn't work with AOL, with Patch, which was interesting. Well, Patch is more heavily content-oriented. They did a bunch of anti-intuitive things to make the liquidity come alive. Intuitive funds were from Epinions that had built the UGC network before. I'll mention two others. Stitch Fix is just an incredible company. She's amazing. Katrina Lake's one of the best I've ever worked with. It's right here in the city, most people don't know about it. Explain it. They've built personalized women's fashion. Although they're moving into beta on men's now. And I like to think about it — no woman that's buying fashion wants to think about it this way — but I like to think about it as Moneyball for women's retail. And for every woman that comes in, they fill out a 15-page questionnaire to suss out size, fit, style, whether it's for work or social, and then for every item, we measure 66 characteristics. And then there's a data science team that's over 70 people now. In fact, Stitch Fix is the No. 1 competitor of Uber for data science talent in Silicon Valley. Eric Colson, who runs that group came from Netflix and did all the recommendation stuff there. And so when a customer comes in to ask for a new Fix, which is an interesting drug metaphor, and this package comes to them, we have a predicted keep score for every item in our inventory. Which is a level of analytics brought to this industry that's maybe one or two orders of magnitude above what everybody else is [doing]. Did you know I covered retail for seven years? And one of the companies was hot, and then it wasn't, and I went to the CEO after — it was a teen company, these things go up and down — I said, "What happened?" He goes, "Pedal pushers. I picked pedal pushers and not culottes. And that was the end of me." [laughs] I'm like, "Why?" He's like, "I just guessed." It was really funny, I'll never forget that, "pedal pushers." And that's what retail's been. We're now working with merchandisers who have ideas. And they test the ideas against the algorithm instead of ever shipping them. And so it's really cool. There's an article written on her recently called "Moneyball Fashionista" that has the whole [thing]. Huh, interesting. There's all kind of interesting experiments going on in retail. Yeah, it's really cool. All right, you get one more. What else? I'd probably talk about HackerOne. Oh, I don't know that one. So Sheryl once said that the smartest thing Facebook ever did on the security front was start a bug bounty program. And bug bounty means you basically pay the hackers to find the holes before the bad guys do. Yeah there's all kinds of crowd-sourcing on this. Yeah. Microsoft, Facebook, Mozilla, there've been people who have done this before, but they all did it kind of holistically within their own firm. Alex Rice, who worked on these programs at Facebook, created a startup that will allow anyone to have a bug bounty program. So in like 18 months, we've got over 500 customers including Priceline, Salesforce, Uber, GM, Home Depot, the Pentagon. And they're all now running bug bounty programs. And then we have a marketplace of all the hackers and all the reputations and skill sets. And it's really cool. And I think you look at the problem, huge problem, most of the solutions are defensive where you're just throwing hardware and software. And this one's offensive, right? Because you're fighting the battle in front of them. I see, interesting. It's elegant. And Mårten Mickos, who ran MySQL, is the CEO over there now. Oh, that's a really interesting company. And he's awesome. So what is overhyped? What would I say is overhyped ... You can name names. Well, some of the categories that become difficult, I would say, in this type of world, are ones where capital can create this messy playing field that I'm talking about. And one of those where I think that's happened is in the online lending space. Aha, there's a lot of those. SoFi, others. SoFi and Avant have raised a billion dollars and Lending Co. went public, and there's OnDeck and Square, and it's like, if everyone just starts aggressively giving away money, it's hard to build a business, you know? And so those are the things that get dangerous. I would say that some of the ones where we over-choreograph are difficult. Like VR, because the big guys all pull out their R&D teams and their guns, so Samsung and HTC and Facebook, they're all at the table. Most big startup breakouts are where people aren't paying attention. As opposed to where everybody's got their guns lined up. Do you like VR? I think that the screen resolution is not there yet. And a lot of the demos to get people excited are on $30, $40,000 equipment. Right, exactly. And it's hard to use. And you put on the stuff that you can buy today and it's pixelated. I had a big argument with someone about this. And so I do think there's a risk that we run into what's known as a trough of disillusionment before you get a breakout because of that. What about current companies, I'll finish up with this. Twitter. I ask everyone. You know, I'm one of the biggest optimists about what's possible out of Twitter. Most people feel that way. Primarily because the most important people in the world are curating their persona there. And you can get them to do more work than they're already doing today. Yeah, it was interesting, because Mike McCue is a former board member who is running for the board. He said it's a bigger phenomenon than it is a company. Look, it may be. I think running businesses at scale is probably the most underrated activity in Silicon Valley relative to how hard it is, you know. How hard it is? I know you guys are all like, "It's so hard." I'm like, "I thought you're the smartest people on earth." Fair enough. I don't really care because you're all rich and smart. Fair enough, but what [John] Donahoe did at eBay is really really hard. And most entrepreneurs like to take potshots at big companies in a way that I think is disrespectful. What do you imagine will happen to it, then? There's always a chance that there's a sale process. I guess Ev [Williams] was rumored in the press yesterday talking about that. I think there's a lot of opportunity to kind of micro-segment around interest groups, because today the way the feed's oriented. If I love all country music, which I do — Me too. — if Ryan Adams happens to say something at the right time, I find it. I thought you could mine the feed and build a Techmeme for everything. And so there could be an alt-country newspaper that it’s pulling from, and you have a ranking table. I've talked to Jack [Dorsey] and the team about it. I hope one day they do it. I think it could lead to something. What happens to these companies? I think the problem is a smallish company gets a lot of attention because of journalists, and then it's sort of a narrative, the way Yahoo became. Yup. It's possible. And it gets sucked up into that. Yeah. It's possible, you know. There's a lot of heat, pressure. What is a mistake that you've made and learned from, as a venture capitalist or investor, anything. You talked about being too analytical and missing some of the instinctual stuff. Is there anything you did that you're like, "Oh I shoulda done it this way?" Or what do you tell entrepreneurs? The immediate thing that comes to my mind was the Google investment, because you can't make a bigger mistake. I was trying to think of another one since we already talked about that. That's a big one. But what went on there as an investor? As I mentioned, some of the external data points lead you to have some amount of skepticism. The product usage was already starting to happen. We were all using it in our office. It was a better product, so we can't blame that. And we were already talking about, "Oh you just do what GoTo did." So the business motto really wasn't a question either. Everyone was already saying that. I think it came down to the price at the time was remarkably high, and the team was remarkably self-confident in a way that would cause you to question whether they could pull it off. But they did. And I go back, I think the learning is that if you have remarkably asymmetric returns, you have to ask yourself, "How high could up be?" And then that "what could go right?" question. Because it's not a 50/50 thing on the judgment call. Like, if you thought it was a 20 percent chance at doing it, you should still do it, because the upside is so high. Right. What do you want to invest in? What interests you a great deal now? Like AI, everyone's either terrified with it or thrilled with it. I've been spending a lot of time looking at the health care space. Ah, you're going to wade in there. Well, I look at the technologies, I look at the smartphone, I look at what we've done with UGC plays, I look at what we've done even with Zillow and real estate. And I say, "Boy, this thing's really messed up, we ought to be able to fix it." Now, my first two years of looking at stuff has caused me to step back a little bit because it is atrociously complex. And the way that regulation works, the way that the payers, the company who doesn't even really want to be in the process ... They've made quite a thicket, haven't they? Oh, it's so messed up. There are some little signs of seedlings that it could become more of a payer situation. And we're an investor in One Medical, which I think is exploiting this. Like, "The customer wants to be treated like a customer, and they haven't been in this space." And if you implement something where they feel that way ... Well, you endure a lot. Oh god, it's ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. So health care. Anywhere else? AI? Yeah, we look at that kind of stuff. I tend to like the stuff that's applied in machine learning and AI, like a Stitch Fix, rather than building something to sell to somebody. The things that Amazon is doing in both e-tailing and AWS causes you to rewrite your entire rule set. And it is changing so fast that almost everything we've done in the past, we've got to reconsider. All right, last question. Are we in a bubble, Mr. Gurley? Mr. Anti-bubble? Are we in a bub-bull? I think certainly we have taken on more risk than we realize and there will be consequences of that. Because there's so much money in these things, nothing goes away overnight. And a few very well-known companies have already been recap, which means that the investors that were on the cap chartered zero. And you don't see that. The thing is still bumbling along. I'd like to see that, you can send me those. But I think there'll be more of that over time. More of that. And sales, too. Yup. And see the sales of things as they go, like LinkedIn and others. I think those are the signs of something profound. Yeah, I think those happen because, well, two things. I think when the markets stop going only up and to the right — prior to that, a lot of the unicorn entrepreneurs were thinking infinity is the top, and so all of a sudden you shake that a little bit and they get a little more reality. And the you might be able to bridge a bit with an acquire. So Bill Gurley's still worried? I am. But maybe that's my universal state. Yeah, I think it is. All right, Bill, thank you so much for coming. No problem, thanks for having me. recode_divider More From Recode Watch Stephen Colbert destroy Apple over its $300 coffee-table book DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other. What happened?

By PTI | Published: October 4, 2016 10:36 AM IST comments Tags: lenovo make in india News Lenovo yesterday launched new range of laptops to expand in India. The models — Ideapad 510s, Ideapad 710s, Ideapad Y700, Ideapad 310, Ideapad 510 and Miix 310 — further strengthens Lenovo’s endeavor to offer innovative and breakthrough technology to its customers, the company said in a statement. The company also said that it considers India as a potential centre for manufacturing laptops. “At Pondicherry plant, where we are already manufacturing desktops, has the capacity and flexibility to manufacture laptops (notebooks). The company will have to take a call when to do it,” Dinesh Nair, director, consumer business, Lenovo India said. He said that Lenovo, which already started manufacturing at its Chennai plant, is committed to the ‘Make in India‘ initiative, which is evident from the visit of the company’s CEO and Chairman Yang Yuanqing in 2015 for a meeting with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Lenovo, which is already the third largest vendor of PCs in India in terms of market share, has redesigned its entire range of portfolio targeting the youth and the business segments and keeping the price at competitive levels, he told reporters here today. Nair said that manufacturing laptops in India would give more flexibility as at least two months were needed to ship products from China. Currently, the entire range of laptops are being shipped from China, he said. In terms of revenue contribution, the laptops segment was contributing to 85% to 88% of overall PC sales, the rest being desktops, Nair said. On market growth of PCs, he said that it remained flat in the last quarter.

"The Asia-Pacific embedded systems market size is projected to reach $81 billion in 2023 from $46 billion in 2014, while it is predicted to be $15 billion in India from $5 billion," said UBM India Group Head Apporba Kumar at a conference on electronics and embedded systems here. Noting that the Indian embedded systems community was on a growth path with a focus on creating an ecosystem, he said the industry, academia and the government were promoting 'Made in India' products across verticals such as automotive, defence, telecom and medical for global markets. "The game-plan is to establish aBrand India' and make our country a go-to destination for global majors to manufacture electronic products in India," said Kumar. Embedded engineers and designers from across the country and the world over are participating in the three-day conference-cum-expo in which 100 embedded firms are showcasing their innovative solutions and products. "The whole society is dependent on embedded software and looks to embedded systems for solutions to the problems of our time, including environment protection, energy production and delivery, transportation, and healthcare," said Digital Networking Director Rob Oshana. With the Moore's Law marching into its fifth decade, even hardware design is becoming more like software development. Largest chip maker Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore predicted in 1965 that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits would double every year and continue into the foreseeable future. "There is no doubt in my mind that the golden time of embedded systems programming is now," reiterated Oshana. UBM India is an arm of UBM Asia, a leading organiser of technology conferences and exhibitions in China India and Malaysia to provide industry platforms for buyers and sellers the world over. --IANS fb/vd (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Here’s how to reveal additional detail of your CPU from the Terminal app. UNIX Shell to the Rescue First, for comparison, here’s the CPU data on my 2013 Mac Pro from the Menu bar > Apple > About This Mac > System Report > Hardware. macOS System Report. But there’s more information on the CPU available than that. To see it, there’s a nifty UNIX shell command that provides just a little more detail on this particular CPU. (Intel has an amazing proliferation of part numbers.) sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
 You can run this command by opening the Terminal app in the Utilities folder, then copy and paste the above command after the prompt. Hit return. The result on my Mac was this: Result of the above command. A little more detail. It’s always fun, often helpful, to do things another way on the UNIX command line. Discoveries await.

Follow him on Twitter or Google+. » More about me Learn how you can contribute Keeping Linux containers safe and secure Posted 04 Oct 2016 Jason Baker (Red Hat)Feed 36up Image credits :  Lucarelli via Wikimedia Commons. CC-BY-SA 3.0 Linux containers are helping to change the way that IT operates. In place of large, monolithic virtual machines, organizations are finding effective ways to deploy their applications inside Linux containers, providing for faster speeds, greater density, and increased agility in their operations. While containers can bring a number of advantages from a security perspective, they come with their own set of security challenges as well. Just as with traditional infrastructure, it is critical to ensure that the system libraries and components running within a container are regularly updated in order to avoid vulnerabilities. But how do you know what is running inside of your containers? To help manage the full set of security challenges facing container technologies, a startup named Anchore is developing an open source project of the same name to bring visibility inside of Linux containers.  To learn more about Anchore, I caught up with Andrew Cathrow, Anchore's vice president of products and marketing, to learn more about the open source project and the company behind it. In a nutshell, what is Anchore? How does the toolset work? Anchore's goal is to provide a toolset that allows developers, operations, and security teams to maintain full visibility of the 'chain of custody' as containers move through the development lifecycle, while providing the visibility, predictability, and control needed for production deployment. The Anchore engine is comprised of pluggable modules that can perform analysis (extraction of data and metadata from an image), queries (allowing reporting against the container), and policy evaluation (where policies can be specified that govern the deployment of images). While there are a number of scanning tools on the market, most are not open source. We believe that security and compliance products should be open source, otherwise, how could you trust them? Anchore, in addition to being open source, has two other major differentiators that set it apart from the commercial offerings in the market. First, we look beyond the operating system image. Scanning tools today concentrate on operating system packages, e.g. "Do you have any CVEs (security vulnerabilities) in your RPMs or DEB packages?" While that is certainly important, you don't want vulnerable packages in your image, the operating system packages are just the foundation on which the rest of the image is built. All layers need to be validated, including configuration files, language modules, middleware, etc. You can have all the latest packages, but with even one configuration file wrong, insecurity sets in. A second differentiator is the ability to extend the engine by adding users' own data, queries or policies. What is driving the need for an inspection and analytics tool for containers? What problems are operators facing that this helps to solve? A primary concern for enterprises adopting Docker today is security, in particular, the governance and compliance of the containers they are deploying. It's almost too easy to pull an application image from a public registry, run it, and within seconds deploy an application in production without even knowing what's under the covers. End users must have confidence that when they deploy applications they will be secure, performant and easily maintained. Containers are opaque in that they are deployable ‘black boxes' that contain applications. While it's easy to treat these images as "just packaged applications," they include operating system images with up to hundreds of packages and thousands of files. As with all operating systems on physical servers, virtual machines, or in the cloud, images need to be maintained. The images may contain unpatched security vulnerabilities, outdated software that contains bugs, or may be misconfigured. To have confidence in your container deployments you need to know what's under the covers to analyze and make decisions based on the contents of your container images. The innovation around containers today is almost entirely happening in open source. Why do you think that is? What's driving the desire for openness? Over the past 20 years organizations have experienced the advantages open source brings to cost savings, reduced lock-in, improved security and faster innovation. Containers, and Docker specifically, are great examples. The team at Docker Inc. would not have been able to create this innovative new software deployment paradigm on top of a proprietary system. They would not have been able to make the required modifications to the code in a proprietary system, nor be able to work cooperatively with industry leaders such as Google, IBM, Intel, and Red Hat—all working toward a common goal. Open source and Linux have always enabled innovation and positive industry disruption. In the past, delivering a big idea required a big team and lots of resources. In the open source world, a small company with big ideas can work in the wider community and benefit from shared intellectual horsepower to collaboratively deliver real enterprise IT innovation. To illustrate the deep adoption of open source, the Anchore team recently returned from LinuxCon in Toronto, where it was incredible to see Microsoft as a diamond level sponsor presenting a growing portfolio of their products that work with or on Linux! Linus Torvalds once said, "If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I've won." I'd amend that statement to read "Open has won." The days of common standards in the container space are still very young, and there are still many competing visions for nearly every part of the stack. What challenges does that create for a startup in this space? It is important to remember that without open standards and open source we wouldn't have seen the innovation that is driving rapid container adoption and changing the industry landscape. The Open Container Initiative (OCI), comprised of industry leaders from the Linux and Container industries, is doing great work setting standards for both the runtime and image formats that will allow us to see even more innovation. Anchore is proud to be a new member of the OCI and we look forward to helping form the standards. How are you working to build an open source community around the Anchore project? The Anchore team has a rich history of building and working within open source communities, with leaders from Ansible, Eucalyptus Systems, and Red Hat. From the start, Anchore began building a strong open source community and we are applying lessons learned in the open source world. The first lesson, of course, is to release early and often. We open sourced our inspection and analysis engine back in June, far in advance of our commercial offering, to ensure that the open source project can stand on its own with features that make it useful to many end-users without having to purchase Anchore's commercial offering. There will always be opportunities to add more value with support, services, and enhanced data feeds with a commercial offering, but if the open source engine is not useful in itself then we will not see an active community. We built Anchore to be modular to allow analysis, reporting and policy plugins to be added without requiring changes to the core engine. We want to ensure that anyone can create plugins, so we chose Python as the base language for the project because it is widely used by developers and sysadmins alike. But even if you are not well versed in Python you can still create plugins using whatever language or scripting environment you prefer. If you can create a bash script then you can create an Anchore plugin. Our goal is to enable the broadest possible community to attract participation. While we encourage our users to pass these contributions back to the community we've architected and licensed the project to ensure that private plugins/modules can be created and maintained independently. The promise of containers is not just greater application density on servers or greater speed on the technical side, but a combination of different tools that together provide a different way of approaching the way developers and operators work together. As a company working in this space, how are you providing a message that resonates with both developers and operators? The container ecosystem is evolving rapidly with a growing number of runtime, orchestration, monitoring and integration products. So the first consideration we had to factor into our architecture was to not be prescriptive about Anchore deployment and usage, we need to ensure that we can fit into any CI/CD pipeline whether it's on-premise or deployed in the cloud. A common question we are asked is if Anchore will provide a container registry that includes image scanning and analysis. While this would simplify our work considerably, it would force customers into specific deployment architectures and limit customers' ability to deploy their own best-of-breed stack. We've made sure that Anchore works with all leading registries, runtime platforms, CI/CD platforms and orchestration tools. Some developers are adding operations skills and moving to DevOps roles, and we see sysadmin/operations teams that are learning more about development as they take DevOps roles. We also see teams with mixed skills. We designed Anchore to be used by development operations and security teams so they can work together to define rules and policies that can be evaluated at any point in the development cycle. Another example is the architecture of the plugins/module interface that enables anyone to easily create a module in their favorite environment—whether it is Python, Go, Perl, C or even a bash script.

(CSCO) Stock Regardless of Q1 Earnings Don’t Fret, Buy eBay Inc (EBAY) Stock on the Dip! Should You Buy Baidu Inc (ADR) (BIDU) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons View All Posts Last year saw a wave of consolidations in the semiconductor industry, and on Thursday, sources revealed that Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) may sell itself to Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). Source: Karlis Dambrans via Flickr The deal values NXPI at $30 billion, and caused both QCOM stock and NXPI stock to jump; QCOM 6.3% and NXPI stock 16.88%. Usually, when a merger occurs, the stock of the acquiring company goes down, but in this case QCOM stock went up. This signals that the market thinks Qualcomm made the right move. NXPI excels at making devices and components for driverless cars and the connected car market, which Strategy& analysts project will grow at a 29% CAGR to reach €113 billion in 2020. The smartphone industry is maturing, dragging down sales growth and margins for most phone makers. By purchasing NXPI, QCOM will grow faster, especially in the market for IoT devices such as connected cars. Qualcomm Stock Pro No. 1: Multiple Growth Drivers Qualcomm will benefit as multiple emerging technologies increase the demand for its devices and components. These include drones, robotics, wearables, driverless cars, the Internet of Things, virtual reality, cloud computing and 5G. 10 Biotech Stocks to Put on Your Radar This Quarter Qualcomm holds the leading position in 5G technology, with the strongest patent portfolio of any company. Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf sees 5G rolling out around 2018/2019. In addition to being a source of growth on its own, 5G will power IoT devices such as connected cars and digital medicine. Qualcomm recently rolled out a new strategy for IoT. QCOM normally produced chips in large batches for smartphone makers, which left out smaller players. Smartphones have fast product cycles, so Qualcomm chips would be produced for a short period of time and then replaced by newer models. This prevented makers of devices with longer product cycles from using QCOM chips. Now, Arrow Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:ARW) will distribute Qualcomm Snapdragon 410E and 600E chips through 2025. Device makers can order as few as 100 at a time, so even startups can use QCOM chips. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently chose Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) modems for the iPhone 7, a market long dominated by QCOM. But Qualcomm will also fight Intel on its home turf, entering the Intel-dominated market for data center server chips. Demand will increase as firms build infrastructure to keep up with the explosion of big data. Qualcomm Stock Pro No. 2: Reasonable QCOM Valuation Qualcomm trades at 14 times forward earnings, not bad when you consider that acquiring NXPI will boost QCOM’s growth. According to Finviz, NXPI’s earnings will grow at a 27% CAGR for the next five years, faster than the projected growth rate for Qualcomm alone. Last year, UBS removed QCOM from its list of Quality Growth at a Reasonable Price stocks, but things look better now. Qualcomm Stock Pro No. 3: Good Dividend Yield Qualcomm also boasts a dividend yield of 3.1%, above the average of 1.91% for the technology sector, as well as the 1.6% yield on a 10-year Treasury bond.

The evening Inbox debates which console has the best operating system, as one reader offers some suggestions for improving Forza Horizon 3. To join in with the discussions yourself email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   Good and bad omens I’ve seen Mafia III advertised a lot recently. I’ve seen the same advert repeatedly on TV and in the cinema, but I don’t remember any of my friends ever playing either of the two games before it or seeing them mentioned in the Inbox here. Is there a particular reason this third instalment is being pushed so much? Change of developer or publisher? I don’t even know what the games are like, I assume a GTA like game, but the previous Mafias have gone so far under my radar I don’t really know. Euclidian Boxes PS: I’ll have a Forza Horizon 3 Warthog code if there’s one available, I expect it’d be good for the Outback. GC: Publisher 2K doesn’t have much else out at the moment seems to be the simplest explanation. Plus, we’d like to think they’re confident that it’s a good game. Although their review policy suggests the opposite (see below). I’m so excited for Mafia III now after watching the trailers, really feels like a unique setting so it should be great. In contrast, I’m also looking for a new Mario Party game for the family, I bought 10 but wasn’t impressed at all. The last one I properly played was 4 so are any of the others between 4 and 10 worth playing still? Jack GC: Mario Party 9 was fairly good, certainly the best of the modern sequels. Although we did enjoy Amiibo-only mode in Mario Party 10. I heard that the Mafia III review codes are not going out until Friday, can you confirm or deny this GC? That’s usually a bad sign, but they have shown so much footage and seem really proud of their game that I don’t think I should be too worried having pre-ordered it a while ago. bigdaddy watt GC: It is true. We were told that review copies won’t be arriving until ‘close to launch’, which is usually, but not exclusively, a bad sign.   Reasonable protection I tend to disagree with the sentiment of being held hostage to play Modern Warfare Remastered. This is clearly Activision protecting their investment. They must have realised long ago that people will try to sell their Infinite Warfare discs and in order to keep strong sales introduced the failsafe. I always think free DLC or DLC tied to a special edition should be tied to the disc. So second-hand buyers don’t pay a premium for a cordless box. I would however be against the game being tied to your account (which I think it is). My copy of Super Smash Bros. is tied to my 3DS and I’m happy about that because it was a package deal. So whilst I think Activision have every right. I hope it’s implemented properly. Anthony Daniels   Bittersweet GAME Will Call Of Duty Infinite Warfare Legacy Edition be available to buy after it is released, or is it just a pre-order only edition? I’m really interested in Modern Warfare Remastered and have a lot of reward points at GAME, so I’d rather use my that than pay cash for it. But GAME won’t let you use reward points for pre-orders. I went into GAME so I could trade in my old games, (I price-checked them against CeX, so got a little extra too) but when I asked about pre-ordering Battlefield 1 and Call Of Duty, the salesperson said that the price was £10 more than it was online. So I flicked through my phone quickly, Battlefield 1 was £45.99 and Call Of Duty was £69.99. I showed the salesperson, they called the manager and he said they received a memo saying that Call Of Duty was £80 in store and Battlefield 1 was 52.99. I asked about matching the website and they said no, so I walked out. But it leaves me with £137 on a GAME account that I may not be able to use to get the game I want. I know I can get Battlefield 1 any time after release, I’m not bothered too about playing day one, it would have just been nice to get that and Call Of Duty straight after the trade-in, knowing I get them on release and that I get Modern Warfare Remastered too. I don’t want to give in to GAME and pay extra, it just makes sense to use a £50 game voucher I already had and the trade in value I got, but I know there is cheaper elsewhere too, Tesco, etc… it just seems underhanded to slap an extra tenner on a game because they can, I’m surprised they have a trade-in promise at all. Dunnston (PSN ID) GC: We don’t think the Legacy Edition is pre-order only. But even if it is we’re certain there’ll be a way to buy Modern Warfare Remastered (together with Infinite Warfare) after launch.   E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   Separate lives RE: Silverfox-75’s Black Ops III save issue. I had a similar problem when I first got Black Ops III. It’s not made clear until after you try to switch but Black Ops III treats the online campaign and offline campaign as two completely separate things and you cannot transfer progress across the two. If you started the campaign with your console online and didn’t specifically set Black Ops III to offline on the main menu then the game considers it an online multiplayer campaign even if you have no intension to play the campaign with other people online. That’s why it won’t let you continue it without the subscription. If you choose offline campaign now, you’ll have to start again from the beginning. I ran into this problem when I started the campaign while my Xbox One was offline for a few days and got the bad new when I went online to try out the multiplayer campaign. PsillyPseudonym (PsillySeudonym – gamertag) PS: The backwards compatible Forza Horizon also works with the Xbox One wheel Logitech G920 with great force feedback.   One problem I’m loving Forza Horizon 3, they really have improved almost everything from the last game except one. And that is they still have races online based on XP. I had an online championship where I came first in all races, yet at the end I was not even in the top three because other racers just hung back and drifted the whole time. You don’t even need to finish a race to get high XP. It’s made racing a bit pointless. They need to either offer a lot more XP for your position or offer a championship point system, and it can also let you know how much XP you earned as a bonus. It’s a shame as the rest of the game is excellent, but this was a problem in the last game and many online had expressed their feelings about it but still it has not changed. Hopefully they will fix it soon. Also, it would be cool if the blueprint races let you create your own routes. It seems odd that the options are less than the blueprint bucket lists. robbie.j   Sound bargain I bought ABZÛ for PlayStation 4 at the weekend. My children soon wanted a turn so I was watching my daughter play. It’s a beautiful game and rather relaxing to watch. Whilst doing so it struck me that the music was reminiscent of Journey, which has a spectacular score. It turns out that Austin Wintory composed the soundtrack for both games and both soundtracks are available on iTunes for less than a fiver each. Absolute bargain. Biglizafish   Sliding scale RE: PC building. If you spend big on CPU and graphics card, and maybe a power supply, you can get away with not having to upgrade for years. I’m still using a CPU from five years ago and had a GTX770 which was fine, but I bought into the newer 10xx hype and really there is not any difference that I can see in game performance. I play all my games on 1080p with various settings on high and medium. I refuse to pay the ridiculous price for the max performance CPU from Intel. Maybe if I come into money I will get one of those extreme i7 and a new Titan but that is a pipe dream as I couldn’t justify paying that out. PC gaming is as affordable as you want to make it. You could get a set-up for as much as a new console and later swap out the parts for better ones a year or six months later. Really is as expensive as you want it to be. Bobwallett Regarding a gaming PC. Not sure how things are now but I wanted a gaming PC about four years ago. Looked online for parts, as they aren’t hard to put together even for a novice (like me). It worked out cheaper (yes, cheaper) for a PC company called Chillblast to build mine. One thing is for sure. You will not get a gaming PC to look or run like a PlayStation 4 or Xbone game for their price, combined and then some. Basin79   Catch up on every previous Games Inbox here   Blades were best Apologies for walking the nerdier side of the road here but I’ve been thinking about console operating systems. Sony have recently added the ability to group things into folders and thank the heavens they did so because it has vastly improved my navigating experience. However, I can’t help but feel the PlayStation 4 OS is a bit old fashioned. I mean, there’s so much dead space on the screen. Why does everything have to be on a single line? Does anybody else feel this way? I liked the blades design featured on the early Xbox 360s. I don’t know why, but that look always stuck with me. Keep up the good work GC! FrostysaurusRex (YouTube) PS: RE: PlayStation 4 v Xbone – I must admit, I too am looking a little enviously at the Xbox One at the moment. Only a little. I went to a Forza Horizon 3 talk at EGX and it looked incredible. Am I right in thinking it’s essentially the same guys that made the excellent Race Driver: GRID all those years ago? GC: The developer employs many experienced racing game developers from around the UK, including Codemasters and defunct studios such as Bizarre Creations.   Christmas spirit Many thanks to the kind GC readers who have offered me Warthog codes for Forza Horizon 3. It really underlines why GC is such a great site. A huge part of this is the great community which has formed around GC. Coincidentally, as I write GC have e-mailed me with another code. Perhaps they would be kind enough to offer this one to another who missed out? Anyway, I’m off to see what mischief I can get up to in my newly acquired Warthog. Happy days indeed! Thanks again! Creepyg81 Saw creepyg81 was looking for a Warthog code and thought he could have mine since I don’t play racing games, unless I get to launch something at the opponents. Like playing retro games on the 3DS now as 8-bit graphics look sweet in 3D. In particular Streets Of Rage 3D and Starfox 64 3D. Stretchy Grunt (gamertag) Please pass on this code for a Forza Horizon 3 warthog to the lad asking for one in Monday morning’s Inbox (or as you otherwise see fit). LAMB SUPLEXER (gamertag) GC: Thanks to these and other generous readers we’ve now got multiple codes we can give away. Although it might have to wait till later in the week, as we’ve got a review event tomorrow. Our thanks and admiration to all those that donated!   Inbox also-rans RE: Last week’s Hot Topic. I’d like to have the 2013 remake of Flashback wiped from my mind. But before heading to the lab I’d leave myself a little post-it note saying ‘Do not play the 2013 remake of Flashback’. iSickle OK, so the original Zombi game was loosely based on the original Dawn Of The Dead film, which was released in France as Zombi. Which makes sense as Ubisoft are a French company. acsharp1984 GC: That’s correct! We’ve sent you the code.   This week’s Hot Topic The subject for this weekend’s Inbox was inspired by reader Ty Snowdon, and asks whether you collect and play retro video games? Assuming retro means anything from PlayStation 2 era on back, do you still buy and collect old consoles and games (emulated games don’t count)? And how much do you play them compared to modern titles? How serious are you about your collecting and how do you decide what to focus on? Do you buy imported American and Japanese consoles and games, or just stick to what was released in the UK? What’s the most expensive item you’ve collected and what lengths do you go to in order to play them authentically, in terms of peripherals and TVs?

The search giant came full force with a bevy of new devices, all aimed at bringing hardware and software together, with its virtual AI assistant in the middle. The stars of the show were of course the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The handsets feature a premium build and noteworthy camera, but they come at a price. Pre-orders start today. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the day was Daydream View, Google's own VR headset that retails for the bargain price of $79 (AU$119). Available in three colors, Daydream View also includes a remote control that slips into the headset. Check out our hands-on review of the Google Pixel Google also announced the Chromecast Ultra, a $69 (AU$99) puck that supports 4K streaming. The company revealed pricing for its Amazon Echo competitor, the Google Home, as $129. Finally, we got to meet Google Wifi, a cheap internet router that will retail for $129 for one and $299 for three. Original article below... We're just hours away from a Google event where we're expecting to see a bunch of new devices and software. The Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL smartphones are likely to be the stars of the show, but there could be something for almost any tech fan, from VR, to tablets, a whole new operating system, a new Chromecast and more. Here then is an overview of everything we think we might see today, along with thoughts on how likely each thing is to make an appearance. Google Pixel and Pixel XL The Pixel and Pixel XL are set to take the place of the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P as the latest smartphones to run pure Android. Rumors suggest that these will be real flagships, especially the Pixel XL, which is thought to have a 5.5-inch 1440 x 2560 screen and a big battery. Everything you need to know: Google Pixel | Pixel XL The standard Pixel meanwhile is rumored to have a more compact 5-inch 1080p display, while both phones are rumored to have a metal and glass build, top tier Snapdragon 821 processors, 4GB of RAM, fingerprint scanners, fast charging and 12MP cameras. We're almost certain these two phones will make an appearance, as both have been heavily leaked and teased. Don't expect them to be cheap, but there's a chance they'll undercut similarly spec'd rivals. How to watch the Pixel launch live Daydream VR headset Daydream is Google's upcoming mobile VR platform, which looks like a real rival to Samsung's Gear VR. The software has already been announced, but there's a good chance we'll see more of it at today's event, along, probably, with a Daydream VR headset. Rumors suggest the headset will be very affordable, coming in at just $79 (around £60, AU$105), which even undercuts Samsung's offering. Initially it will probably only be compatible with the Pixel and Pixel XL handsets, but Google has already confirmed that Samsung, Alcatel, Asus, HTC, LG, Xiaomi and ZTE will produce compatible handsets, so Daydream could be the first VR platform that's widely available, affordable and of reasonable quality. Google Home Google already has a place in your smart home thanks to its ownership of Nest, but it wants to be the brains of the entire system with a new product called Google Home, which it initially unveiled at its IO event earlier this year. It's a lot like Amazon Echo, consisting of a speaker which can be controlled by your voice. That allows you to play music or other audio through it, simply by giving voice commands, but also to ask questions, to which Google Assistant will reply, with information from the web or connected services. Going even further, you'll also be able to control smart home devices using your voice, add entries to your calendar, and basically do anything which Google Now already allows for, all without ever touching your phone. We're likely to see more information on it today, including potentially a price (which is rumored to be $129, £99, AU$169) and a Google Home release date. Not only could Google Home be cheaper than Amazon Echo, but with the power of Google behind it, and with Google Cast built in, it could also be significantly more accomplished. Android 7.1 Android 7.0 Nougat is already available, at least on a handful of devices, but there have been rumblings of a significant update, dubbed Android 7.1, arriving soon, and there'd be no better time to unveil it than at today's event. We wouldn't expect you'll be able to download Android 7.1 today, even if you have a Nexus device, but there's a good chance it will arrive on the Pixel and Pixel XL. While this won't be as big an update as the jump from Marshmallow to Nougat, we might see some new features added, such as support for Daydream VR. Google Assistant, which is essentially a newer, better version of Google Now, could also be at the heart of Android 7.1 and the look of the interface could change slightly, with the Nexus Launcher set to be replaced by the Pixel Launcher. Google Andromeda Alongside a new version of Android we might also see something far more ambitious, known as Google Andromeda. This is a new operating system which is rumored to combine Android and Chrome OS, adding the file system and deeper control offered by Chrome OS and other desktop operating systems, to the touch-based interface of Android. Andromeda is expected to feature heavily on hybrid laptop/tablet devices, but could also find a home on standard tablets and potentially even smartphones. There's a fair chance that it will be announced today, but it may not actually launch on devices until next year. New Nexus 7 tablet If Andromeda does land on devices this year a new Nexus 7 tablet could be the first to run it. Currently this tablet is just a rumor and hasn't been as heavily hinted at as the Pixel phones, so we wouldn't count on seeing it today. The device is said to have a 7.0-inch 1440 x 2560 screen, a metal body, a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM – flagship specs in other words, and enough that it could be a strong rival to the iPad mini 4. It's possible that the new Nexus 7 will run Android Nougat, but rumors point towards Andromeda, along with a late 2016 release date. Pixel 3 This is another device which could run Andromeda, but rather than a tablet it's thought to be a laptop and the successor to the Chromebook Pixel. Early rumors suggest the Pixel 3 won't launch until Q3 2017, so there's every chance it won't make an appearance at today's event, but if Google does show off Andromeda then it might do so on this device. Given how far we might be from release the rumors we have about it could easily change, but right now it's thought to have a 12.3-inch display, which may be detachable, 8GB or 16GB of RAM, an Intel Core m3 or Core i5 processor, stereo speakers, 10 hours of battery life and stylus support. The Pixel 3 could also come in at just 10mm thick – beating Apple's thinnest laptop, and may cost $799 (around £620, AU$1,040). Chromecast Ultra Chromecast has been making TVs smarter for very little money for a long time now, letting users stream content from their smartphone or tablet to larger screens, but it tops out at 1080p, which isn't ideal when 4K televisions and content are becoming more widespread. That's where a new device, believed to be dubbed the Chromecast Ultra, comes in, as apparently this will be able to stream content in 4K. Otherwise it's likely to be just like the existing Chromecast – a compact device with a low price, though probably not quite as low as the 1080p model. Launching a new model with 4K functionality makes sense, and if Google is going to then today's event is the prime time to do it. Google WiFi Google already makes a router, called the OnHub, but rumor has it that a new one is on the way, with a few standout features. Apparently just called Google WiFi, this new router could undercut the OnHub with a rumored price of $129 (around £100, AU$170), and would be able to link multiple networks together to make one giant network, so you can get connectivity from a single source in even the largest homes. It wouldn't be the only router with these skills, but if that price is accurate it would be among the cheapest. The Google WiFi is also rumored to have other unnamed smart features and may have longer range than rival routers. We've heard less about the Google WiFi than some things in this article, so there's a chance we won't see it today, but if it's coming this year then now is the time. Android Auto update Android Auto is promised an update, which Google outlined earlier this year but which might finally be available today – or if not we might at least hear more about it. The main new feature is for it to be powered by your phone, so you won't need to buy a supported vehicle to use it. Other upcoming features that we currently know of include the ability to launch Android Auto by saying 'OK Google', making it completely hands-free, and to connect your phone to your car over Wi-Fi, rather having it plugged in via USB, as is currently required for Android Auto.

Comments Finally, after weeks of mystery and intrigue, we know something tangible about the ghostly villain who appears to be at the center of American Horror Story Season 6's mystery.  American Horror Story Season 6 Episode 3 presented us with the history of "the Butcher," the mysterious figure played by Kathy Bates. Originally known as Thomasin White, she bargained away her soul to a woodland witch/demon/creature/thing played by Lady Gaga – who Matt also got uncomfortably up close and personal with – much to Shelby's horror and disgust. Join the round table discussion for "Chapter 3," as our TV Fanatics Yana, Amanda and Paul chat about the Butcher's backstory, what they thought of new character Cricket Marlowe, and the most horrifying moment of the week! What did you think of the Butcher's backstory? Yana: It was intense and not at all what I expected. It's a character I would love to see more of now and maybe find out what is up with Lady Gaga's character. Amanda: For such a menacing character, her backstory is actually really sad. I don't blame her for wanting revenge on those men. Unfortunately, it looks like she had to sell her soul to do it. Paul: I liked it. It gave Kathy Bates a lot of emotional scenes to work with and showed us that there was a method to her madness. New character alert! We met Cricket Marlowe this week. What did you think of him? Yana: Loved him! He brought a different energy to that house. The sad vibe was getting to be a little much. I hope we see even more of him, because he is finally introducing some answers and could lead them all to the Lost Colony. Amanda: Cricket was awesome! From the minute he started talking, I knew we were in for a memorable character. I hope he can be more than a plot device, though. Paul: Cricket was downright hilarious. I was shocked to the core when he asked for money. I hope his story has some sort of link to Murder House. Watch American Horror Story Season 6 Episode 3 Online We found out that Lee once had another young daughter, who went missing and was never recovered. Does this change how you feel about Lee? Do you think she harmed Emily, Flora, or her now-dead ex Mason? Yana: I doubt it. She is fine in the present, and it doesn't look like any charges were brought up against her for Emily's disappearance, so I don't think there is much of a story about Emily. I may be wrong, but we were told that Flora was led away by the ghosts so I don't see that being contradicted. They just needed a basis on which to get Lee arrested and shake things up. Amanda: I don't think Lee had anything to do with her children being taken from her, but I could be wrong. She's either messed up far beyond what we think or she has terrible luck. Paul: I don't think she had anything to do with it. The shock about her previous kid was the Intel we needed to understand just why she became who she was when we met her on American Horror Story Season 6 Episode 1. What was the creepiest/weirdest/grossest/otherwise most intense moment? Yana: There isn't much that shocks me on American Horror Story anymore, but this season is all about the weird pig stuff. Anything that has to do with that weirds me out. But the mask that the Butcher was forced to wear was pretty crazy too. I can't imagine having that on my head and not freaking out. Amanda: The feral boys suckling the pig... I have nothing more to say. Paul: I'm with Amanda. That was so shocking and disgusting. Matt (willingly or unwillingly) cheated on Shelby with the Lady Gaga Forest Demon Witch Thing, and Shelby called the cops on Lee. Is their marriage irreparably broken? Yana: Are we supposed to care? I was waiting to see how much longer until we got a graphic sex scene and now I have a feeling that a pregnancy will find its way into this season too. It happened during the first two seasons, so why not now? I can see both sides of the story, but in the end, they all decided to stay there so whatever happens after shouldn't come as much of a shock. Amanda: I don't think the marriage will be break. It'll be fractured, but unless they're currently divorced in the present, I don't see the marriage falling apart this early. Paul: There's no way that is it for them. They'll find a way to work through their issues. Quotables for Week Ending September 30, 2016 Start Gallery Edit Delete Caralynn Lippo is a staff writer for TV Fanatic. Follow her on Twitter.
