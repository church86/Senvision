Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45: Our first take Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45: Our first take Tag Heuer's Connected Modular 45 is a Swiss timepiece first, smartwatch second By Andy Boxall — March 25, 2017 3:00 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Astonishing attention to detail, superb build quality, and the latest tech inside: This is a true Swiss smartwatch for the connoisseur If you want the real deal, by which we mean a smartwatch with true Swiss-made credentials, there is only one choice: the new Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. It’s the second smartwatch from Tag Heuer, following the Carrera Connected last year, and once again Intel has been heavily involved with the device’s creation. But the partnership goes much deeper than simply stuffing one of Intel’s chips inside a Tag Heuer designed body. The two companies collaborated so closely, the end result combines Intel’s technical know-how and Tag Heuer’s passion for watches in a way that truly makes it stand apart from the rest. It’s easy to pass Android Wear watches off as the same experience in a slightly different body, but don’t make that mistake with the Connected Modular 45. Intel’s Jerry Bautista, vice president of New Technology, sat down with Digital Trends at the Baselworld 2017 trade show to give us a peek at the watch in detail, share how the relationship between the two companies worked, and the lengths both went to in order to produce it. Swiss build, Intel tech The Connected Modular 45 is an evolution of the Carrera Connected. For example, to ensure a round screen was used on the first model — a Tag Heuer requirement — Intel had to build the electronics that were hidden by the flat-tire screen design into the section with the “Swiss Made” inscription on the body. Tag Heuer was opposed at first, but grew to like the look, and has turned it into a design feature on the Connected Modular 45 by mirroring it at the opposite end of the body. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends While a plastic rear panel on the Carrera Connected allowed the antennas to work, the new model’s body is made entirely of titanium. The watch still has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, plus the addition of GPS and NFC; but titanium doesn’t play well with antennas, so how do they talk to the world? Look closely at the side of the screen and you’ll see two sections sandwiched together. The lower piece contains all the antennas. It was a huge technical challenge to make this work, but it not only improves the design, but also the efficiency: There’s a 70 percent improvement in Wi-Fi performance because of it. Wondering where the ambient light sensor is? The watch collects light data through the watch face, and channels it down into Intel’s sensor, which adjusts the display accordingly. A clever alternative to an ugly sensor. The end result combines Intel’s technical know-how and Tag Heuer’s passion. Tag Heuer wanted to have the same depth to the digital screen that it does on its analog watches. To do this, a 2.5mm thick piece of sapphire crystal is placed over the top of the screen, sinking the display down into the body. This was where Intel began to use its skill. Tag Heuer also wanted to build the connected watch in the same way as its traditional watches, using gaskets clamped together to hold everything in place, rather than glue and screws used in electronics. Hand-built Swiss components like the glass and the body are never the same twice, something Intel needed to change if it was to meet the requirements. So it introduced laser measurements to the process, reducing waste, and making it possible to build the Connected Modular 45 in an identical way to every other Tag Heuer watch. Wearing the Connected Modular 45 Now we’ve explained why this is a true Swiss smartwatch, let’s talk about what it’s like to wear. We’ll get the size out of the way first. It’s big. The horns extend way over my wrist, and the flat underside of the watch accentuates the overall size, making it quite unsuitable for small wrists. Once it’s on, though, it’s not uncomfortable, and it’ll fit under a loose shirt cuff. More: Our first take review of the Guess Connect Touch The titanium body keeps it light, and the sapphire crystal over the display looks superb, creating that beautiful 3D look Tag Heuer wanted with the familiar sapphire sheen to catch the eye. The build quality, as you’d expect, is superb. It’s solid as a rock, and obviously made to last. Metal, leather, and rubber straps are all options, and we really liked the blue rubber version with the blue bezel around the screen. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The design has been refined from the Carrera Connected, and more colors have been added to the range. There’s also now the chance to strip down many of the components to build a custom version, which is where the modular aspect comes in. It’s easy to do — just unclip the horns from the body, using buttons similar to those used to secure the Apple Watch’s strap in place, pull them away from the strap, and that’s it. Tag Heuer will sell you a mechanical Connected Modular 45 body, that uses the same horns and strap, for when you don’t want to wear the digital version. The super rich can even buy a version with a fancy tourbillon movement, which costs $17,000. In total, there are more than 500 possible combinations to personalize the watch using the modular components. Software and future updates Tag Heuer and Intel worked closely with Google to use Android Wear 2.0 on the Connected Modular 45, right down to striking an agreement so the Tag Heuer brand name and logo shows up when you turn the watch on. Intel uses an Atom processor inside the watch, and the software experience is smooth and slick. There are many different official Tag Heuer watch faces included. Tag Heuer and Intel are working on a very special app that will arrive on the Connected Modular 45 in early summer. It’s a time management app made specially for smartwatches, that despite living on a watch, ironically shifts away from relying on time to set and manage our schedules. Bautista gave us an example of how it will work. Say you want to remember to pick up milk on the way home from work, and set a reminder for 6pm. When the alarm sounds, you’re caught up in a meeting and dismiss it. Normally, that would be the end of it, and the milk would inevitably be forgotten. Not so with the new app and the watch. It will understand you’re caught up at work and delay the alarm. It’ll also know when you’re travelling home, and where a grocery store is, then alert you when you’re close by. Because the alert will arrive on your watch, it’s easier to spot even when you’re driving. Naturally it requires location access, but the benefits here are substantial. Conclusion There’s little doubt the Connected Modular 45 is aimed at a niche audience, but that’s not stopping demand outstripping supply. It’s not the abomination some watchmakers would like to believe it is either. It’s proof watchmakers and technology firms really can collaborate successfully, and produce a timepiece that’s true to the industry and the brand’s own ideals, while appealing to the tech fan with strong features and excellent software. It’s what scares and holds back many traditional watch firms from introducing a smartwatch. More: Our first take review of the Montblanc Summit If and when other watches arrive from big-name Swiss firms, they’re going to need partnerships as strong and effective as Tag Heuer’s, Google’s, and Intel’s, if the final product is going to meet the standard set here. Luxury smartwatches are uncharted territory, but when they’re done right, they work. The one thing we want from the next model is a better name. We’d have taken the Carrera Connected 2 over the Connected Modular 45. While we appreciate the Connected Modular 45 as a groundbreaking piece of wearable technology, it’s not the perfect device. It’s still too big and too thick, the design won’t appeal to everyone, and the $1,600 price is a lot of money to pay out for a smartwatch. However, most premium analog Swiss watches also cost a lot of money, and as we’ve learned, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 deserves to stand alongside them as a true representation of the breed.

Bigelow March 24th, 2017 @bvbigelow @xconomy Like Us Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email Reprints Roughly seven months after Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) acquired San Diego-based Nervana Systems, the chipmaker is consolidating its portfolio of artificial intelligence businesses in one group, headed by former Nervana CEO Naveen Rao. Rao (pictured above right) will report directly to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, spokesman Daniel Francisco said today. Rao plans to remain in San Diego, according to a spokeswoman for Intel Nervana. In a blog describing the formation of a company-wide Artificial Intelligence Products Group, Rao writes, “The new organization will align resources from across the company to include engineering, labs, software and more as we build on our current leading AI portfolio: the Intel Nervana platform.” In addition to bringing Intel’s AI capabilities under one roof, Rao plans to create an applied AI research lab. “We will be exploring novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to inform future generations of AI,” he writes. “This includes a range of solutions from the data center to edge devices, and from training to inference—all designed to enable Intel and its customers to innovate faster. This will be the home for AI innovation at Intel.” Rao understands the portfolio of AI technologies that Intel has acquired and developed in-house, the spokeswoman for Intel Nervana said. Intel’s technical roadmap remains unchanged, but how it will all come together is still a work in progress. When asked how the company plans to divide its AI operations between San Diego and Intel’s Santa Clara, CA, headquarters, Francisco responded in an e-mail, “We aren’t being more specific than this on how we’ll be aligning our AI resources; that’s the work that is under way.” Rao has broad experience in the computer industry and in neural-based processing. He started his career at Sun Microsystems, and worked at a number of Silicon Valley startups in micro-processing, networking, and video compression before getting his doctorate in neuroscience. He joined San Diego-based Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) in 2012, and led both R&D and business development in neuromorphic machines. At Nervana, Rao and co-founders Arjun Bansal and Amir Khosrowshahi (who also were Qualcomm expats) set out in 2014 to build a new type of neural-based processor. To get there, though, Nervana first developed AI software to run on Nvidia graphics processors. To generate revenue and test their design concepts, they offered Nervana’s cloud-based “machine learning as a service” for a variety of beta customers. One customer used Nervana’s technology to enhance the development of its oil exploration software. Another used it to spot fraudulent trading activity. Intel acquired Nervana, reportedly for more than $408 million, just as the startup was moving from its software model to semiconductor design. Intel recently announced plans to acquire Israel’s Mobileye, a leader in computer vision technology for autonomous driving, for $15.3 billion. In 2015, Intel paid $16.7 billion to acquire Altera, a specialist in chips known as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that can be re-programmed to run new tasks (and are key to training deep neural networks). Intel also has been investing heavily internally to advance its Xeon and Xeon Phi processors. It’s now Rao’s job to pull these far-flung technologies together and set the course for Intel’s AI development. Bruce V. Bigelow is the editor of Xconomy San Diego.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 25, 2017 at 9:22AM Analysts often talk about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) suppliers in terms of their content share gains in the latest iDevices and their revenue growth potential. Those factors are certainly important, but those discussions seldom focus on dividends. So today, we'll examine five companies that supply components for Apple and offer reliable dividends. Qualcomm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) was the exclusive supplier of the iPhone's baseband modem between 2011 and 2016. Apple split modem orders between Qualcomm and Intel after that deal expired, but Qualcomm's modems are still reportedly faster than Intel's -- which means that Apple probably won't stop using them anytime soon. Image source: Apple. Qualcomm currently trades at 17 times earnings, which looks cheap relative to the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies. It pays a forward dividend yield of 3.7%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 63%. It's raised that dividend annually for 14 straight years. Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) supplies a wide range of analog and embedded chips for Apple, including display drivers, charging controller ICs, and power management ICs for iPhones. TI produces these components at a lower cost than many rival chipmakers, thanks to its recent shift from 200mm to 300mm wafers -- which reduced its production costs by about 40%. Texas Instruments has a P/E of 23. It pays a forward yield of 2.5%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 47%. It's raised its dividend annually for 13 straight years. The company has also repeatedly stated that it is committed to returning "all" of its free cash flow to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) won a major victory against Samsung when it became the sole supplier of Apple's A10 chips last year. Multiple reports also indicate that TSMC will also be the sole supplier of this year's A11 chips. Those design wins were likely related to the ongoing battles between Apple and Samsung, as well as reports that Samsung-produced A9s were less power-efficient than TSMC-produced A9s. TSMC's ADR shares currently trade at 16 times earnings, which is much lower than the industry average of 22 for IC manufacturers. The company currently pays a forward yield of 2.9%, and has a payout ratio of 52%. However, TSMC pays its dividend annually instead of quarterly, and it's only consistently risen annually since 2013. Analog Devices Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) sells capacitance sensor controllers for Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure a user applies to a display or trackpad. The feature is widely used in current-gen iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches. The Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. Analog Devices is listed under the same industry as TSMC but trades at a much higher 28 times earnings. But looking ahead, rising sales of its Force Touch controllers and other components should lift its earnings, so its forward P/E of 18 looks more reasonable. Analog Devices pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%, has a payout ratio of 57%, and has hiked its payout every year since its IPO in 2012. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), the company formerly known as Avago, supplies Apple with power amplifier modules and film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) hexaplexers for three-band carrier integration. Pacific Crest Securities estimates that those components boosted Broadcom's content share from 25% in the iPhone 6 to 30% in the iPhone 7. Broadcom has a negative P/E due to acquisition expenses and earnings distortion related to Avago's purchase of the "old" Broadcom last February. But looking ahead, Broadcom trades at 14 times forward earnings, which is a below-average multiple for a broad line semiconductor company. Broadcom pays a forward yield of 1.9%, and the company has raised its dividend annually for seven straight years. Look beyond Apple and dividends... These five companies are all Apple suppliers with decent dividends, but investors who are interested in investing in these stocks need to understand the other headwinds that they face. Qualcomm's chipmaking and licensing businesses all face tremendous pressure due to competition, regulatory probes, and major legal clashes with Apple. TI and Broadcom both rely on other industries for growth, which may or may not offset their iPhone gains. Analog Devices could eventually face competition from other capacitance sensor controller makers. Therefore, investors should fully understand these risks before buying these stocks for their dividends or exposure to Apple's supply chain. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

But unlike last year, this year you have to pay up. The men's college basketball championship—otherwise known as March Madness—will be broadcast in virtual reality again this year, this time thanks to a new partnership between Intel, TV broadcasters, and the NCAA. Similar to Microsoft's arrangement with the NFL to supply coaching staff with Surface tablets, Intel will be setting up its True VR and 360 Replay technology at March Madness games starting with the Sweet 16 round. Fans can watch via the NCAA March Madness Live VR app, downloadable in the Oculus store for the Samsung Gear VR headset. Related Intel Tech Will Let You 'Be the Player' This Super Bowl Sunday Intel Tech Will Let You 'Be the Player' This Super Bowl Sunday Unfortunately, while the app showed March Madness games last year for free, you'll need to pay for the privilege now that Intel is the NCAA's exclusive VR live games provider. A Gold membership costs $2.99 per game. It offers fully produced VR coverage from multiple camera angles, much like you'd expect from a traditional TV broadcast. The Silver membership, meanwhile, costs $1.99 per game, and will give you access to a 180-degree feed from a single courtside camera along with commentary from CBS's usual gaggle of announcers and reporters, including Jim Nantz. This might be the option to consider if you're prone to motion sickness in virtual reality, since you can control your position in the virtual world. To capture all of the action, Intel will use 48 cameras grouped into pods of 12 each for the Sweet 16, and 84 cameras for the Elite Eight and later rounds. There will also be 28 5K cameras devoted to capturing footage for Intel's 360 Replay technology, which affords close-ups of a game clip from every angle and requires servers capable of processing up to 1 terabyte of data per 15 to 30 second clip.

The Intel DRM driver is still being wired up to take advantage of this better support under Linux. Intel's Michael Thierry published the fifth version of these patches on Friday. While there has been GPU reset support within the Intel DRM driver in case of hangs, this new engine-reset support is superior as it can reset a particular engine rather than performing a full GPU reset. Thierry explained the benefit in the patch series, "This is also referred to as Timeout detection and recovery (TDR). This complements to the full gpu reset feature available in i915 but it only allows to reset a particular engine instead of all engines thus providing a light weight engine reset and recovery mechanism. Thanks to recent changes merged, this implementation is now not only for execlists, but for GuC based submission too; it is still limited from Gen8 onwards...If engine reset fails to recover engine correctly then we fallback to full gpu reset." It's 18 patches implementing this partial GPU reset support for Broadwell hardware and newer.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware Intel Launches Optane SSD DC P4800X, Enters Revenue Quarter For 3D XPoint, Storage Roadmap Detailed By Usman Pirzada Mar 21, 2017 24Shares Share Tweet Submit Today, Intel unveiled the Intel® Optane™ SSD DC P4800X Series and Intel® Optane™ SSD DC P4800X Series with Intel® Memory Drive Technology, enabling new possibilities to transform storage and memory architectures for the data center. The first Optane SSD is out, and yes you can also use it as RAM; Intel estimates less than 10% of Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group to be driven by 3D XPoint based products Intel has previously revealed (in their quarterly earnings webcast) that they were shipping 3D NAND from our Fab 68 and had qualified the first 3D XPoint base Optane SSDs, which were expected to ship for revenue in the first quarter. The DX P4800X is the realization of this statement and means that indeed, Intel has entered the first revenue quarter for this platform. Intel has also previously stated that they expect less than 10% of their Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group to be driven by 3D XPoint products. In the same earnings call they had also mentioned that their 3D XPoint memory DIMM will be shipped as sample to data center customers at the same time, so we assume that that is something that has already happened as well. Related Intel To Introduce New 3D NAND Based SSDs in 2017 – Complete Storage Roadmap for 2017 Leaked, Including Optane SSDs There is not much to report on apart from the specs so here they are: Deployed as blazing fast storage or caching tier, Intel® Optane™ SSD DC P4800X breaks the confines of traditional storage to significantly increase scale per server and accelerate applications. When deployed as extended memory, this drive expands the system memory pool, creating bigger, more cost-effective memory to gain higher quality insights. An industry-leading combination of high throughput, low latency, high quality of service and high endurance enable the creation of solutions that remove data bottlenecks, unleash CPU utilization and deliver unprecedented insights. Intel® Optane™ SSDs offer unrivaled performance at low queue depth, where the vast majority of applications generate storage workloads, which means CPUs are more active and more fully utilized. Intel® Optane™ SSDs for the data center let users do more work with the same servers, improving TCO or expanding capabilities. And because the drive is extremely responsive under any load, it is highly predictable and delivers ultra-fast service, consistently. Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X Specifications Capacity 375 GB Form Factor PCIe HHHL or 2.5" 15mm U.2 Interface PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe Memory 128Gb 20nm Intel 3D XPoint Typical Latency (R/W) <10µs Random Read (4 KB) IOPS (QD16) 550k Random Read 99.999% Latency (QD1) 60µs Random Read 99.999% Latency (QD16) 150µs Random Write (4 KB) IOPS (QD16) 500k Random Write 99.999% Latency (QD1) 100µs Random Write 99.999% Latency (QD16) 200µs Endurance 30 DWPD Warranty 5 years MSRP $1520 Release Date March 19 (HHHL) Q2 2017 (U.2) Intel Storage Roadmap Detailed: 3D NAND SSDs It goes without saying that the Optane SSD platform is going to pose a serious business risk to existing players including Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Toshiba just to name a few. Once the technology matures, its price/performance characteristics should outstrip typical SSDs by a long shot. However, Intel can still have a piece of the pie by updating its current lineup with brand new products using 3D NANAD that are targetted alongside the Optane platform (expected to land in 2017). Related Intel Optane Memory Specifications and Roadmap Update – Intel 8000p Revealed, Will Have Sequential Read of up to 1600 MB/s First Quarter 2017 For February and March 2017, Intel’s DC P4500/P4600/P4600 LP/P4500 LP will enter mass production and their end-of-life-cycle (EOL) is set for the first quarter of 2019. Second Quarter 2017 Intel will add DC S4600/S4500-series and the entry-level DC S3110-series to its SATA-based SSD product line in the second quarter of next year. Third Quarter 2017 For the consumer market, following the release of the 600p in September 2016, the CPU giant will release a BGA-version 600p and SATA-based 545s in the third quarter of 2017 For its PCI Express-based solid state drive (SSD) product line, following the releases of its DC D3700 and D3600-series NVMe SSDs in 2016, Intel will add a top-end series with a lot more storage space in the third quarter of 2017, featuring a 2.5-inch size, U.2 interface and storage options of 2TB, 4TB and 8TB. For the embedded market, Intel has prepared the 5430S-series for April 2017 and an M.2 form factor-based version of the 5430S for July 2017. Fourth Quarter 2017 For the professional market, Intel will launch PCIe/NVMe-based Pro 7600P and SATA-based Pro 5450s in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, Intel will release the 20nm MLC-based E 6500p, and existing E 5400s/5410-series will both enter EOL in the first quarter of 2018, while the E 6000p will stop supply in the third quarter of 2018. Intel Optane Roadmap 2017: Arriving under Mansion Beach and Stoney Beach platform The Intel Optane Memory 8000p will come in two categories: 16 GB and 32 GB. Since we are not talking about DIMMs here, I have to assume that they are referring to the block size which means that this is a significant increase over the current SSD standard and will result in large SSD sizes. PCI Gen 3.0 is supported as well as the M.2 2241 and 2280. The 32 GB variant is the superior one while as the 16 GB variant offers slightly lower performance numbers. Both, however, easily outstrip mainstream SSDs on the market right now (I took the liberty of adding a comparison table at the end). The Optane Memory 8000p series will feature random read in the range of 285000 to 300000 IOPs which is an almost three times increase over conventional SSDs. Random write on the other hand is ranged between 75000 to 120000 IOPs and the lower value is about the same as conventional SSDs while the top end is slightly more.The 8000p series features a sequential read speed of 1400 MB/s to 1600 MB/s and is roughly 2.5-3 times greater than the sequential read of mainstream SSDs. Something very interesting, however, is the sequential write speed, which ranges between 300 MB/s and 500 MB/s and is exactly what you would expect from any decent SSD. Advertisement Since Mansion Beach and Stoney Beach are set to arrive first, it would be a fair bet that 8000p series is part of them. Logic would dictate that the 8000p is part of the Stoney Beach series of SSD. Both platforms are supported under Kaby Lake and we expect them to hit the market once KBL gets market-wide availability. We don’t have any news on pricing at the moment although its a safe assumption that they will be more expensive than high end ssds in the beginning. Micron is also working on their own 3D XPoint based memory solutions and calls them QuantX memory. We already know that: The Intel Optane technology platform will have the nomenclature ending with the word “Beach”. There will be two types of products at launch (SSD and Memory), however only one will be available to enthusiasts initially (SSD). The roadmap of Optane based SSDs and Memory has been aligned with the overarching architecture that will be in play at the given time. This means that we are going to see Optane for the first time sometime near the end of 2016 (or early 2017 if Intel faces any delays). At the end of this year, Intel Optane is going to debut for the mainstream side of things with the Mansion Beach platform under the overarching roadmap of Kaby lake. The Mansion Beach platform will be for the very first mainstream SSDs based on Optane tech and supporting the NVMe PCIe Gen 3 x4 configuration (4 lanes support). Mansion beach will also have a relatively lower end variant: the PCIe 3.0 x2 variant by the name of Brighton Beach. All other specifications will remains the same, only the amount of PCI lanes the SSD can access will change. Mansion Beach will remain as is all through Kaby Lake (and Q1 2017) and will be refreshed when the time comes in 2018 and on wards under Cannonlake architecture. Brighton beach however, will be succeeded by Carson Beach platform that introduces PCI 3.0 x4, the M.2 as well as BGA configuration support. At about the same time, Stony Beach is going to debut for the enterprise side of things with the very first Intel Optane powered memory tech designed to be used as ‘system accelerators’. The Stony Beach platform will be configured as PCIe Gen 3 x2 (along with support for the M.2 controller). Interestingly, the roadmap also specifies “System Acceleration Generation 1.0” which appears to be a brand new standard as far as the platform is concerned. Stony beach will be succeeded by Carson Beach with pretty much the same specifications as the Enthusiast side of the platform with the added benefit of System Acceleration Generation 2.0. That’s not it either, the roadmap also reveals Intel’s plans for its usual 3D NAND platform. The Pro 600p and 600p SSDs with PCIe 3.0 x4 (M.2) support will be in cycle till the first half of 2017. At which point, production will stop for the remaining half year. Intel will debut its 2nd Generation 3D NAND based SSDs under the Cannonlake architecture (approximately in 2018) with configurations in the PCIe and SATA flavors. Intel Optane SSDs and 3D XPoint Overview Intel has previously talked about its 3D XPoint memory and Optane based SSDs as well as released benchmarks of the same – both of which aim to be part of its framework in the future. The 3D XPoint memory technology has 1000x the endurance of NAND flash and is 10 times denser and in some cases upto 1000x faster as well. The 3D XPoint memory will be available in market during next year and will revolutionize the tech industry with the latest 3D XPoint based Optane SSDs and DIMMs. The Optane SSD was able to achieve 7.2x times more IOPS at low queue depth and upto 5.21 times the IOPs of conventional SSDs at high queue depths. Optane SSDs also provide 8.11x times lower latency than conventional NAND solutions. An Optane Technology based SSD has 10x times the density of conventional SSD drives. The marketing material also claims it is 1000x faster than the competition available on the market but it isn’t clear to what exactly they are referring to. Optane SSDs will have 1000x the endurance – which, if true, should mean the device has virtually unlimited life span for practical purposes. All Optane based devices will feature a cross point array structure, which consists of perpendicular connectors connecting around 128 Billion memory cells (16 Gigabytes per chip). This “3D” method is the reason why Optane based devices have 10x times the density of conventional solutions. Like DRAM, Optane memory is stackable in nature. One of the biggest changes in this technology, however, is that it eliminates the need for transistors – accessing the memory cells by varying the voltage sent to the particular sector. Basically, using the bulk of the material itself.

According to CNET, Dell XPS 15 (2017) models with 1050 GPU have prices ranging from US$1,250 (AU$2,500 approx) to US$2,550 (AU$3,700). A 4K UHD Display would cost AU$3,000. Dell Australia is offering a further discount of AU$450 on the 4K model. The laptop has a 15.6-inch display with a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. The display is touch-enabled. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics processor uses the latest Pascal architecture. This provides an exceptional gaming performance. Pascal also has improved battery optimisation over its predecessor. The XPS 15 (2017) has a terrific screen, svelte design, premium build and comes with a full feature set. It has the latest processors from Intel and NVIDIA. Many experts have found the laptop to be much more sedate than multipurpose hybrids. However, it has all the power and features that cannot be packed into hybrids. Be it photo-editing, graphics work or gaming, the Dell laptop, according to many, surpasses even Apple MacBook Pro 2016 and HP Spectre x360. The Dell XPS 15 (2017) laptop is also less-expensive than the Apple one. The seventh generation core processor contributes a lot towards the battery life of the device. However, the graphics processor is not VR-ready. Many have found the touch pad to be hyper-sensitive. The backlit keyboard is also a great addition. Set of connections include two USB 3.0, one USB-C which supports external monitors, HDMI out and a headphone jack. The speakers sound pretty cool. Meanwhile, the highly-advanced hybrid, Microsoft Surface Pro 5, could be the fastest from the Redmond tech giant. It is believed to be coming with the all-new AMD Ryzen chip. Moreover, the hybrid will be the right platform to show off the power of Windows 10. It is also possible that the Surface Pro 5 will go with the Intel Kaby Lake architecture, or release both processors via two variants. It is expected to come in 4K UltraHD display. The screen could be the same 12.3 inches. Other rumoured specs include 16GB RAM, 512GB internal storage, highly-upgraded Surface Pen and wireless charging. While the device is expected in October, Microsoft may surprise fans by releasing it right after the Windows 10 Creators Update in April. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Dell XPS 15 (2017) and Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Dell's new XPS 13 2-in-1 device now available… Dell's new XPS 13 2-in-1 device now available with enterprise-grade features By Kevin Parrish — March 21, 2017 2:45 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Businesses that were interested in Dell's new XPS 13 2-in-1 now have a good reason to make the investment. At the request of its customers in the business sector, Dell is now offering new configurations of its XPS 13 2-in-1 device that pack security and manageability features specific to that market. These features include the option of using vPro-enabled processors, access to Dell ProSupport Plus, Dell-enhanced security, and more. The Dell XPS 13 made its first appearance during CES 2017 in January. Dell currently provides two configurations based on Intel’s Core i5-7Y54 processor that doesn’t support vPro, and two configurations based on Intel’s new Core i7-7Y75 chip that does support vPro. Thus, customers wanting vPro support will see a starting price of $1,350 whereas the Intel Core i5 configuration has a starting price of $1,000. Unfortunately, customization appears to be extremely limited across all four configurations. Here is the semi-locked list of hardware for the $1,450 configuration: Screen size: 13.3 inches Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 with Touch Processor: Intel Core i7-7Y75 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 615 System memory: 16GB LPDDR3 @ 1,866MHz (optional 32GB) Storage: 256GB PCI Express SSD (optional 512GB) Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Bluetooth 4.2 Camera: Widescreen 720p Ports: 1x Thunderbolt 3 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Headphone jack Security: Fingerprint reader Noble Security Lock Slot Battery: 46 Watt hour Dimensions: 0.32-0.54 (H) x 11.98 (W) x 7.81 (D) inches Weight: Starting at 2.7 pounds Color options: Silver Operating system: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit The XPS 13 2-in-1 device sports an edge-to-edge display complemented by a steel 360-degree hinge capable of four flexible positions: tablet, tent, laptop, and stand mode. Along with touch capabilities, this flexible form factor makes presentations and collaborations extremely easy in an office environment. The screen is protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 4 and is enclosed in a chassis based on machined aluminum and carbon fiber. “We don’t want the XPS 13 2-in-1 to be the rogue device in the company, but rather an integral part of an organization’s IT portfolio,” said Raza Haider at Dell. “That means IT departments can effortlessly integrate XPS for the first time, with one of our most exciting designs, the same way they do with other Dell commercial products.” More: Dell Inspiron 15-inch 2-in-1 laptop now on sale for only $399 (20 percent off) The security features supported by the XPS 13 include the Dell Client Command Suite, which is a set of free automation tools for monitoring, deploying, and updating devices. There’s also Protected Workplace multi-key encryption to protect data down to the end-user level, and Dell’s Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise service for preventing threats and blocking malware. Thus, Dell calls the XPS 13 “the world’s most manageable laptop” for the enterprise sector. As a refresher, here are the hardware specs of the two featured Intel processors: Core i5-7Y54 Core i7-7Y75 Cores: 2 2 Threads: 4 4 Base speed: 1.20GHz 1.30GHz Max speed: 3.20GHz 3.60GHz Max power draw: 4.5 watts 4.5 watts Cache: 4MB 4MB Integrated graphics: Intel HD Graphics 615 Intel HD Graphics 615 Graphics base speed: 300MHz 300MHz Graphics max speed: 950MHz 1.05GHz vPro support: No Yes Intel Virtualization Tech: Yes Yes

The drive is now shipping to selected customers with a 375Gb capacity.  Intel claims the new Optane SSD offers improved throughput, lower latency and improved endurance. The write endurance is particularly valuable for enterprise customers with an expected lifetime of 12.3 Petabytes written. Intel has very high hopes for its Optane technology which it claims can eventually replace conventional SSD’s and DRAM. Intel has previously spruiked about potential benefits including being up to 1000 times faster than traditional NAND, whilst being cheaper and consuming less power. Conventional memory is volatile, meaning it doesn’t retain data when it is powered off. Optane based memory would retains its data.  Unfortunately if you have an older system, for now you are out of luck with only the new Kaby Lake platform capable of supporting Optane. While there are still a lot of unknowns about how Optane works and how it will be implemented, we are getting closer to actual products. The P4800X drive is shipping in a PCIe 3.0 x4  NVMe form factor with additional form factors rolling out in Q2. Widespread availability of the P4800X is expected in the second half of the year.

The Wall Street Journal first reported James Woolsey's comments former national security adviser Michael Flynn's firm allegedly made about Fethullah Gulen, and posted a video interview with Woolsey late Friday. A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey's claims are "false" and that "no such discussion occurred." In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing Gulen from the U.S. without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen's extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. Gulen lives at his Golden Generation Worship and Retreat Center in Ross Township, Monroe County. The U.S. government has rebuffed the request to extradite Gulen and the cleric has denied involvement in the attempted coup. MORE: Rare look at exiled Turkish cleric living in the Poconos (PHOTOS) Woolsey described the discussion as "brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law." Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion "did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act." Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group's work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. "The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn or anyone else in attendance discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false," Floyd said. "No such discussion occurred, nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend and afterward." The meeting was part of lobbying work Flynn's firm was conducting on behalf of a company, Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Earlier this month, Flynn and his firm registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for the work for Alptekin, saying that it could have benefited the Turkish government. Flynn's firm was paid $530,000 over the course of the contract, which ran from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. Alptekin has told the AP that Flynn's firm registered as a foreign agent under pressure from the Justice Department. As the AP reported earlier this month , Flynn's attorneys twice disclosed to advisers to President Donald Trump after the election that it was likely Flynn would need to register as a foreign agent for the work. The first discussion was with the Trump transition team while Flynn was being considered for the top national security post. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, his attorneys then informed the White House counsel's office that Flynn's foreign agent registration was imminent. The White House has confirmed both contacts. In the video interview, Woolsey said he didn't know if he missed a caveat to the discussion because he arrived late to the September meeting. In addition to Woolsey and Flynn, others present included Alptekin, Flynn's business partner, Bijan Rafiekian, and two Turkish officials: Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law. Alptekin has told the AP that he arranged the meeting. Woolsey said he doesn't remember if Flynn actively participated in the discussion. "I don't recall who said what," Woolsey said in the Journal interview. Though in an interview with CNN, he said there "was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting to the Turks" that the U.S. would be able to get ahold of Gulen. "It was suspicious. It was concerning, and I felt I needed to say something about it to someone, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No," Woolsey said during the CNN interview . Woolsey has said he informed then-Vice President Joe Biden about the meeting through a mutual friend. Representatives for Biden declined to comment. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton and briefly was a member of the Trump transition team, said he served on an advisory board for Flynn Intel Group but never did any work for the firm or received any payment from it. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians.

A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey’s claims were “false” and that “no such discussion occurred.” (Carolyn Kaster, File/Associated Press) By Chad Day | AP By Chad Day | AP March 25 at 12:38 PM WASHINGTON — Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey’s comments and posted a video interview with him late Friday . A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey’s claims are “false” and that “no such discussion occurred.” In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn’s firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the U.S. without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen’s extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as “brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law.” Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion “did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act.” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group’s work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. “The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn or anyone else in attendance discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false,” Floyd said. “No such discussion occurred, nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend and afterward.” The meeting was part of lobbying work Flynn’s firm was conducting on behalf of a company, Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Earlier this month, Flynn and his firm registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for the work for Alptekin, saying that it could have benefited the Turkish government. Flynn’s firm was paid $530,000 over the course of the contract, which ran from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. Alptekin has told the AP that Flynn’s firm registered as a foreign agent under pressure from the Justice Department. As the AP reported earlier this month , Flynn’s attorneys twice disclosed to advisers to President Donald Trump after the election that it was likely Flynn would need to register as a foreign agent for the work. The first discussion was with the Trump transition team while Flynn was being considered for the top national security post. After Flynn joined the Trump administration, his attorneys then informed the White House counsel’s office that Flynn’s foreign agent registration was imminent. The White House has confirmed both contacts. In the video interview, Woolsey said he didn’t know if he missed a caveat to the discussion because he arrived late to the September meeting. In addition to Woolsey and Flynn, others present included Alptekin, Flynn’s business partner, Bijan Rafiekian, and two Turkish officials: Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and Energy Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan’s son-in-law. Alptekin has told the AP that he arranged the meeting. Woolsey said he doesn’t remember if Flynn actively participated in the discussion. “I don’t recall who said what,” Woolsey said in the Journal interview. Though in an interview with CNN, he said there “was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting to the Turks” that the U.S. would be able to get ahold of Gulen. “It was suspicious. It was concerning, and I felt I needed to say something about it to someone, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No,” Woolsey said during the CNN interview . Woolsey has said he informed then-Vice President Joe Biden about the meeting through a mutual friend. Representatives for Biden declined to comment. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton and briefly was a member of the Trump transition team, said he served on an advisory board for Flynn Intel Group but never did any work for the firm or received any payment from it. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report. ___ Submit reporting tips to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Why does everyone insist on keeping it a so-called "secret"? Mobileye teams up with BMW, Intel to bring fully autonomous driving by 2021. (photo credit:BMW PICTURES) The sale of Mobileye to Intel for the whopping amount of $15 billion is the latest in a long list of exits by Israeli high-tech companies acquired by large foreign corporations. Over the past decade alone, dozens of Israeli high-tech companies have been sold at prices ranging from $25 million to $1b. (Waze). Most were acquired by world-renowned corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Groupon, and a few large cybersecurity companies. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. In total, the amount spent on Israeli companies in the past decade comes to about $200b. In addition, a number of other Israeli companies, such as ISCAR , have been sold for incredibly high amounts. However, beyond the glamorous success story of Israeli software companies and their huge exits lies a different story that is just as fascinating. This story is an open secret that has not been written about much in the media. It’s a story about the training of the brightest computer and software geniuses, who then went on to found the most successful start-ups our planet has seen. It just so happens that 80% of them served in the Israeli military and contributed to the security of our country before they ventured out into the business world. It is well known that Israeli schools are not doing a very successful job of educating students in math and sciences. There is something in the Israeli educational system that makes it difficult for gifted students to excel in school. For the most part, they are left to suffer from intense boredom in mediocre math classes, which is the norm in Israeli schools. But then something surprising happens: these bright young kids are recruited into elite IDF intelligence, technology, computer and cyber units where they can finally put their high-level capabilities to use. In a long and cumbersome process, the IDF identifies, summons, examines and chooses the best and brightest young Israelis who are most suitable for these positions. The IDF inducts and trains these young recruits for a long period so that they can serve in elite security units, dealing with such matters as aerospace technology, cyber-warfare, cryptography and more. Most of these recruits serve in the intelligence branch of the army, while others are inducted into air force or navy intelligence, or even the Mossad or Shin Bet (Israeli Security Agency). These special units incorporate new recruits to work in conjunction with more seasoned soldiers to create amazing technological developments to help ensure that Israel is kept safe. The State of Israel’s intelligence and operational needs require that it remain at the forefront of technology. Technology and computer engineering are our best weapons and are integral to our fight to survive in the dangerous world in which we live. The IDF is developing a wide range of software and technologies that can identify unusual patterns; locate terrorist suspects and weapons; uncover cyber attacks and launch counter-attacks; recognize irregularities that signal security breaches, both physical and virtual; build cybersecurity systems; and create software programs that can extract huge amounts of information. There are many incredible technologies currently being developed in IDF units by young conscripts, as well as by veterans employed by military institutions. These unique and powerful developments could easily be sold for billions of dollars to international buyers and make headlines. Instead, they are kept secret and are used for the benefit of the Israeli military. Over the years, these advances are honed and improved and a portion of the military start-ups move over into the civilian world where they become available for acquisition by global giants. And in some cases, civilian companies are involved in the manufacturing and development of security technologies used by the IDF. Over the years, the IDF and Israeli intelligence organizations have provided their engineers and employees who work together to develop these technologies suitable work environments, great benefits and incentives on par with private-sector high-tech companies (well, maybe not with the same salaries). Despite these great conditions, many soldiers who serve in such units still end up joining the private sector when they finish their required years of military service. For example, people who served in Unit 8200 went on to set up a non-profit organization that encourages veterans of this unit to found start-ups in which they can design new technologies and eventually be acquired for billions of dollars by international corporations. This is possible because the knowledge and experience they gain during their IDF service, combined with their incredible talent, are excellent preparation for succeeding in the business world. In a certain sense, it could even be said that the State of Israel is developing and nurturing a future generation high-tech and software entrepreneurs through its military training tracks by enabling these talented young people to take part in the development of unique cybersecurity technologies. This type of opportunity doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world for 18-year-olds. There’s nothing wrong with this setup – in fact it’s a win-win situation. The Israeli security establishment is able to develop cutting-edge technologies and young Israelis gain once-in-a-lifetime work experience that helps them build their careers. And the country benefits every time a company is acquired by receiving huge amounts in direct and indirect taxes. Perhaps this model should be adopted for Israeli sports teams, too. The writer is a former IDF brigadier-general who served as a division head in the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency). Translated by Hannah Hochner. Relevant to your professional network?

Though in an interview with CNN, he said there “was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting to the Turks” that the U.S. would be able to get ahold of Gulen. “It was suspicious. It was concerning, and I felt I needed to say something about it to someone, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No,” Woolsey said during the CNN interview . Woolsey has said he informed then-Vice President Joe Biden about the meeting through a mutual friend. Representatives for Biden declined to comment. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton and briefly was a member of the Trump transition team, said he served on an advisory board for Flynn Intel Group but never did any work for the firm or received any payment from it. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. ___ Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report. ___ Submit reporting tips to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Topics: All News Defense Government News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Ex-CIA chief: Flynn's firm… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1958: Elvis Presley inducted into the U.S. Army Federal News Radio presents a daily update of important moments in the history of the U.S. government.

Seco is prepping its first SBC based on the 101.6 x 101.6mm (4.0 x 4.0-inch) Embedded NUC (eNUC) SBC standard from the Standardization Group for Embedded Technologies (SGET). The eNUC form factor offers superior industrial grade characteristics, long term support, and efficient heat dissipation, claims Seco. The Linux- and Android-supported board supports applications including IoT gateways, home automation, robotics, digital signage, and HMI. SBC-B47-eNUC (left) and SGET’s eNUC mounting hole and dimension requirements (click images to enlarge) The eNUC standard has not seen much uptake since it was ratified by SGET in 2015. Hectronic offers a few Bay Trail, Braswell, and Haswell based eNUC boards with no OS support listed. Pentair offers some eNUC cases as part of its Schroff line, and posted a white paper (PDF) on the standard. SGET, which is known for its SMARC and Qseven COM standards, found inspiration for its first SBC form factor standard from Intel’s 4.0 x 4.0-inch NUC (Next Unit of Computing) mini-PC form factor. eNUC requirements extend beyond the 101.6 x 101.6mm dimensions to include PCB mounting concept, predefined connector areas, single voltage power supply, and minimum interface, feature set, and temperature support. The eNUC standard appears to have done better than the 147 x 140mm 5×5 form factor that Intel briefly floated back in 2015 to fill the gap between NUC motherboards and 170 x 170mm Mini-ITX boards. The Seco SBC-B47-eNUC is built around the Qualcomm Snapdragon 410E, the same quad-core Cortex-A53 SoC that drives F&S Elektronik Systeme’s armStone A53SD Pico-ITX (100 x 72mm) SBC. Qualcomm released the Snapdragon 410e and 600E last September as embedded versions of its Snapdragon 410 and 600 SoCs. The 1.2GHz 410E is almost identical to the Snapdragon 410 found on boards like the DragonBoard 410c, but offers 10-year availability. SBC-B47-eNUC block diagram (click image to enlarge) The Seco SBC-B47-eNUC provides up to 2GB soldered LPDDR3, with a microSD slot and optional eMMC. A 10/100 Ethernet port is supplied along with WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, and a mini-SIM slot. You get DisplayPort and LVDS interfaces, as well as dual MIPI-CSI camera interfaces. There are plenty of audio options here from I2S to a standard analog jack. The board provides dual USB 2.0 host ports, and a micro-USB client port. Other I/O includes serial, GPIO, and an Arduino interfaces. The 12V board ships with a battery connector. Specifications listed for the SBC-B47-eNUC include: Processor — Qualcomm Snapdragon 410E (4x Cortex-A53 cores @ up to 1.2GHz); 512KB L2 cache; Adreno 306 GPU @ 400MHz; Hexagon QDSP6 DSP Memory/storage: Up to 2GB soldered LPDDR3 RAM Optional eMMC MicroSD slot Multimedia I/O: DisplayPort up to 1280 x 720 LVDS up to 1280 x 720 Touchscreen connector 2x MIPI-CSI (2- and 4-lane) 2x I2S audio headers li>Audio line-out/mic-in combo jack li>Speaker and mic headers Wireless: WiFi Bluetooth 4.0 LE Mini-SIM slot combo with microSD CIR sensor Networking — 10/100 Ethernet port Other I/O: 2x USB 2.0 host ports Micro-USB 2.0 client port USB 2.0 header RS-232 or RS-485 connector Debug UART header 8x GPIO Arduino interface 2x I2C 2x SPI Other features — Watchdog Power — 12V DC input; Li-Ion battery connector Operating temperature — 0 to 60°C Dimensions — 100.5 x 100.6mm; eNUC form factor Operating system – Linux; Android   Further information The SBC-B47-eNUC is “coming soon.” More information may be found on Seco’s SBC-B47-eNUC product page.   Related posts: Pico-ITX SBC runs Linux on quad Cortex-A53 Snapdragon Snapdragon 410E SBC offers long lifecycle support at $85 Extended temp COM offers Snapdragon 410E, WiFi, BT, and LVDS Linux/Android module offers embedded version of Snapdragon… Tiny μQseven module aims Bay Trail Atoms at IoT Tiny, rugged COM runs Linux or Android on Snapdragon 820 Compact Cortex-A9 SBC expands on its inner Udoo Dev boards run KitKat on quad-core Snapdragon 805 Tiny Snapdragon 600 module includes WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS Pico-ITX SBC runs Android 4.4 on Snapdragon 805 (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Billy Steele, @wmsteele 03.21.17 in AV Comments 311 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Turner Sports Last year, the NCAA streamed the Final Four and championship game in virtual reality for free as March Madness came to a close. For the 2017 tournament that's already in progress, the college sports governing body is teaming up with Turner Sports and CBS Sports to offer VR streaming of not only those final three games, but of the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 as well. Those two rounds begin this Thursday, March 23rd and run through the weekend. The live games will be available from the March Madness VR app inside the Oculus store that's available for download today. Once inside, you'll need to buy a "premium ticket" to watch the immersive action on the hardwood for $2 or $3 per game. For the cost of admission, you'll get a virtual courtside seat where you can expect multiple camera angles, sound from inside the arena and dedicated commentary on the pricier Gold level. If you want to pay up all six games for this tier, you can hand over $8 to do just that. At $2 per game, you'll get access to a single 180-degree camera angle and the regular CBS broadcast commentary from Jim Nantz and crew at the Silver level. The tech that drives the whole thing is Intel's True VR, formerly known as the live events-focused virtual reality setup from Voke, a small company that the chipmaker purchased late last year. Intel says that with Voke's technology it can use VR to offer both live and on-demand games and highlights that will "bring the in-stadium experience to life from any location." If you'll recall, Voke powered the March Madness virtual reality streams in 2016. True VR will employ so-called pods that contain a dozen cameras each for the Sweet 16 and Elite 8. The plan for those two rounds is to use up to 48 cameras for the games. For the Final Four and championship game, Intel is bumping that total up to 84. This is only the beginning of VR events with the NCAA, Intel, Turner and CBS. Part of today's news is that this year's March Madness coverage is the start of a multi-year deal between all four with Intel being named the exclusive VR live games partner of the NCAA. Even if you're not a huge fan of VR, you can still expect to see Intel's 360 replay tech during broadcasts of the Final Four and championship game on CBS.

The new rumors are coming from Reddit, with someone posting some diagrams of the alleged X390/X399 chipsets.     Starting with the X390 motherboard, which is an ASUS made board - it features a much larger 'AM44' socket - which could be a typo, but maybe 4+4 = 8 and we're looking at the AM8 socket? On top of that, the purported ASUS-made X390 motherboard features their awesome Aura Sync technology, for RGB LED goodness - and 8 x DIMM sockets for a massive amount of RAM. We have 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes on the X390, compared to just 40 lanes on Intel's HEDT chipset in X99.     Moving onto the X399 chipset where things get really interesting, as the X399 chipset is destined for dual-CPUs - like the upcoming Naples CPU which is a workstation/server processor, with ECC support. AMD's purported X399 chipset would take 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes per CPU, for 88 PCIe 3.0 lanes in total. Madness.   From these rumors, it looks like the X390 chipset would take in the purported Ryzen CPU with 16C/32T that AMD will reportedly launch later this year to tackle Intel's flagship Core i7-6950X. The X399 on the other hand, if it were to reach the consumer market, could offer much cheaper dual-CPU systems to people compared to Intel's Xeon platform.

"The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn, or anyone else in attendance, discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false. No such discussion occurred. Nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend, or afterwards," Floyd said in an emailed statement to The Hill on Friday. Earlier in the day, The Wall Street Journal reported citing former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director James Woolsey that Flynn held talks with Turkish officials while serving as an adviser to the campaign of US President Donald Trump, discussing ways to remove Gulen, who is suspected by Ankara of masterminding the July 2016 coup attempt, from the United States. Gulen has been living in the US state of Pennsylvania since 1999. He has denied the allegations of involvement in the military coup attempt in Turkey. The failed coup attempt in July 2016 left over 200 people killed and thousands wounded. Following the attempt, the Turkish authorities detained tens of thousands of people, the majority of whom were accused of ties to the Gulen movement. Ankara has repeatedly asked the United States to extradite Gulen. ...

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Asus Transformer Pro T304 is a Surface Pro 4… Asus Transformer Pro T304 is a Surface Pro 4 look-alike that can be ordered today By Mark Coppock — March 24, 2017 11:38 AM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been waiting for a Windows 10 2-in-1 that adds seventh-generation Intel CPUs and USB Type-C to the Surface Pro 4, then Asus has the machine for you. Microsoft has demonstrated in a number of ways that its Surface line of innovative Windows 10 PCs is meant to lead its OEM partners to make better machines. There’s no OEM that has embraced this more than Asus, which with its Transformer Pro line has created nearly identical copies of Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4. The latest model is the Asus Transformer Pro T304, which from a distance is nearly indistinguishable from Microsoft’s version. Asus announced the machine some time ago, and it’s now available for ordering, as Liliputing reports. More: The Asus Transformer 3 Pro is a slightly bigger, slightly better Surface Pro The Transformer Pro T304 is a Windows 10 2-in-1 that follows Microsoft’s “tablet that can replace your notebook” tagline. That is, it’s a tablet PC first and foremost, with a 12.6-inch IPS display running at 2,160 x 1,440 resolution that’s the same 3:2 aspect ratio as the Surface Pro 4. Like all good tablets, the Transformer Pro is also a light machine at 1.8 pounds, it’s quite thin at 0.34 inches, and it utilizes a very Surface Pro-like built-in kickstand to let it stand upright or angle down to a 155-degree stance. The device transforms into a notebook-like PC when you snap on the detachable keyboard, which offers 1.4mm of travel, and so it’s close to the sweet spot for touch typists of 1.5mm, and it also includes a decently sized multitouch touchpad supporting Windows 10 gestures. In terms of specifications, the Transformer Pro can be configured with seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB PCIe x4 SSD. Connectivity is provided by a single USB 3.1 Type-C port, a USB 3.0 port, a full-size HDMI connection, and an audio jack. In this respect, at least, it’s superior to the Surface Pro 4 with its single USB 3.0 port. Windows 10 Hello support is provided by a fingerprint scanner, while an array microphone provides for Cortana voice input. Finally, the Asus Pen is the final piece of the puzzle, offering up support for Windows 10 Ink. One area where Asus hasn’t followed Microsoft’s lead lately is with pricing. While the Surface line is usually a price leader on the high end, Asus has actually priced the Transformer Pro T304 a bit closer to the stratosphere. The model with an Intel Core i5-7200U CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is priced by retailer NCIX at $1,450. That’s more expensive than the Surface Pro 4’s retail price and even more so than the discounted prices Microsoft has been offering lately. Note that Asus includes the keyboard and pen. You can order the Asus Transformer Pro T304 from a few vendors and get it in a week or two. Note that Microsoft could be announcing its own Surface Pro 5 sometime soon, which could offer seventh-generation Intel processors, a higher-resolution screen, and its own USB Type-C connection, if rumors hold true. If you’re not willing to wait, then the Transformer Pro might offer some of the same advantages.

Most Indian parents want their children to become doctors, but not her parents. Das, who calls herself a "rebel", recalled to IANS that her parents had told her: "Whatever you do, don't be a doctor. Don't become a doctor, it's long and expensive." "So I decided I wanted to be a doctor," she said. And that rebellious ambition led her to her medical-oriented science project. Her parents Bidyut and Tanima Das, who are from Kolkata and now live in Oradell, New Jersey, are bankers by profession. The 17-year-old, who is in the final year of high school at the Academy for Medical Science Technology in Hackensack, said she wants to become a doctor who simultaneously does scientific research. "I want to be physician-scientist," she said. "I would like to see patients, but I would also like to do research." Her project on finding ways to treat damage to the brain from injuries or disease won her the top prize earlier this month in the nation's foremost science contest sponsored by Regeneron and conducted by Society for Science and the Public (SSP). Nicknamed the "Junior Nobel Prize", the Science Talent Search competition was originally sponsored by Westinghouse in 1942 and Intel took it up from 1998 till last year. Twelve of the contest alumni have won Nobel Prizes. Indian American teens took five of the top ten awards in this year's competition in which 1,700 high school students participated. SSP President Maya Ajmera said Das's "dedication to making the world a better place through science -- whether through her research on treating brain damage or volunteer work in her community -- is truly inspiring". Explaining her research, Das said that when Alzheimer, Parkinson's, stroke or a traumatic injury affects the brain, the neurons, which are the main signal cells of the brain, are killed. Next the supporting cells -- astrocytes -- that are supposed to nurture and protect the neurons, go awry and create a toxic chemical environment, poisoning the neurons. "My work concentrates on getting these supporting cells to behave correctly," Das said. "I found one way it can be made better, essentially by increasing one protein at the membrane of these supporting cells." "It pushes these supporting cells with treatment to create a chemical environment that is safer and cleaner for neurons to grow in" after a damage to the brain, she said. There are several steps before a medical treatment based on her research can become available to patients. "First thing I will need to do is use my treatment in animal models," Das said. "So I will have to work on increasing the complexity of my models." She said that she wants to find out where and how exactly the treatment is effective. "Finding how it works will will help me back-track and understand this whole injury condition better, which is something nobody really understands," she said. Her school is equipped with a cell culture facility for her research. Her mentor, Donna Leonardi, was her biology teacher. She is a former lab director at New York Presbyterian, a major medical facility affiliated with Columbia and Cornell universities. In preparation for a medical career, Das got certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) last year. As a volunteer EMT she goes out on ambulances to attend to emergencies as a first responder. Besides her studies and research, she manages to find time for non-medical activities too. "I play the trumpet," she said. "I enjoy skeet-shooting, weightlifting." And one of her ambitions for college? " I hope to play rugby in college," she said. "I told you I was a rebel."

Updated 11 hours ago WASHINGTON — Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey's comments and posted a video interview with him late Friday. A Flynn spokesman said Friday that Woolsey's claims are “false” and that “no such discussion occurred.” In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, late in the evening of Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the United States without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep the cleric out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen's extradition from the U.S. after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as “brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law.” Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion “did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act.” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Associated Press that Flynn Intel Group's work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. He confirmed that Woolsey attended the meeting but denied that it involved subverting the legal process. Flynn, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the United States. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians.

Most Indian parents want their children to become doctors, but not her parents. Das, who calls herself a "rebel", recalled to IANS that her parents had told her: "Whatever you do, don't be a doctor. Don't become a doctor, it's long and expensive." "So I decided I wanted to be a doctor," she said. And that rebellious ambition led her to her medical-oriented science project. Her parents Bidyut and Tanima Das, who are from Kolkata and now live in Oradell, New Jersey, are bankers by profession. The 17-year-old, who is in the final year of high school at the Academy for Medical Science Technology in Hackensack, said she wants to become a doctor who simultaneously does scientific research. "I want to be physician-scientist," she said. "I would like to see patients, but I would also like to do research." Her project on finding ways to treat damage to the brain from injuries or disease won her the top prize earlier this month in the nation's foremost science contest sponsored by Regeneron and conducted by Society for Science and the Public (SSP). Nicknamed the "Junior Nobel Prize", the Science Talent Search competition was originally sponsored by Westinghouse in 1942 and Intel took it up from 1998 till last year. Twelve of the contest alumni have won Nobel Prizes. Indian American teens took five of the top ten awards in this year's competition in which 1,700 high school students participated. SSP President Maya Ajmera said Das's "dedication to making the world a better place through science -- whether through her research on treating brain damage or volunteer work in her community -- is truly inspiring". Explaining her research, Das said that when Alzheimer, Parkinson's, stroke or a traumatic injury affects the brain, the neurons, which are the main signal cells of the brain, are killed. Next the supporting cells -- astrocytes -- that are supposed to nurture and protect the neurons, go awry and create a toxic chemical environment, poisoning the neurons. "My work concentrates on getting these supporting cells to behave correctly," Das said. "I found one way it can be made better, essentially by increasing one protein at the membrane of these supporting cells." "It pushes these supporting cells with treatment to create a chemical environment that is safer and cleaner for neurons to grow in" after a damage to the brain, she said. There are several steps before a medical treatment based on her research can become available to patients. "First thing I will need to do is use my treatment in animal models," Das said. "So I will have to work on increasing the complexity of my models." She said that she wants to find out where and how exactly the treatment is effective. "Finding how it works will will help me back-track and understand this whole injury condition better, which is something nobody really understands," she said. Her school is equipped with a cell culture facility for her research. Her mentor, Donna Leonardi, was her biology teacher. She is a former lab director at New York Presbyterian, a major medical facility affiliated with Columbia and Cornell universities. In preparation for a medical career, Das got certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) last year. As a volunteer EMT she goes out on ambulances to attend to emergencies as a first responder. Besides her studies and research, she manages to find time for non-medical activities too. "I play the trumpet," she said. "I enjoy skeet-shooting, weightlifting." And one of her ambitions for college? " I hope to play rugby in college," she said. "I told you I was a rebel."

Vulkan Multi-GPU One Ups DirectX 12, Works Pretty Much Everywhere Logan Booker Mar 26, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories direct3d direct3d 12 directx directx 12 gpus nvidia pc vulkan Share Image: Supplied It's still very early days for DirectX 12 and Vulkan, the main graphics APIs fighting for superiority. It's not quite Blu-ray versus HD-DVD; even if one does pull ahead with developers, the other won't suddenly vanish. A lot of factors can decide the battle, with one of the more interesting being support for mixed hardware, multi-GPU setups. On this front, Microsoft scored points with DirectX 12, but Vulkan has done one better by supporting multi-GPU on all the important platforms, not just Windows 10. An announcement by the Khronos, the working group that oversees OpenGL and Vulkan and comprised of industry heavyweights including AMD, Valve, Google, Intel and NVIDIA, among many others, has made it clear that the API's multi-GPU functionality will play nice with Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, as well as Linux. Apparently, the question was a popular one at this year's GDC, so Khronos thought it best to clarify the situation in writing: The good news is that the Vulkan multi-GPU specification is very definitely NOT tied to Windows 10. It is possible to implement the Vulkan multi-GPU extension on any desktop OS including Windows 7, 8.X and 10 and Linux ... Khronos always strives to make its specifications as cross platform as possible. Of course, what products ship on which OS is up to the implementers of each specification, but Khronos is already aware of vendor plans to ship multi-GPU functionality on platforms other than Windows 10, including Linux. The rest of the statement is mostly technical, but the gist is that there's nothing really stopping Vulkan's multi-GPU support from working, well, anywhere. Sure, certain operating system features can make it easier to implement, but there are no hard locks in the way. Putting aside technical limitations, there's no mystery behind Microsoft's decision to restrict DirectX 12 and hence, mixed-vendor multi-GPU support, to Windows 10. But if a developer was on the fence about which API to go with, Khronos has made Vulkan just that much more appealing. Vulkan Multi-GPU Support — Not Just for Windows 10 [Khronos] Comments welbot @welbot Mar 26, 2017, 1:23pm I'm certainly keen to see some more games get in on the Vulkan action. Given I can run Doom at 2160p @ 120fps using Vulkan certainly makes it appealing to have more games use it :) Reply 1 justachap @justachap Mar 26, 2017, 2:19pm Gotta see more games have Vulkan as an option. Many of the games that have included DirectX 12 however have not had very good impressions. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Mar 26, 2017, 2:38pm Is multi gpu still popular? With quite powerful cards these days I'd say this would affect the majority of people. If you don't multi gpu this hardly would make up your mind. But that said Vulcan had been quite impressive so far and I do have limited use of dx12 to my knowledge. Reply 0 welbot @welbot Mar 26, 2017, 3:29pm It's popular among enthusiasts who can afford it, but I think this will open it up to a lot more people. Last I checked, you could only use multi card setups for SLI/Xfire if they were from the same generation (like a 980GTX and a 960GTX would work together) but if one of your cards was a different gen (say a 980GTX and an 880GTX) you couldn't use them for SLI. You could use the 880 as a dedicated Physx processor though, which does have its advantages, but only of course, if the game actually uses Physx. Given they haven't released all the details of what they're doing, it's hard to say for sure, but by the sounds of it, this may open up multi GPU setups to cross generation cards, or maybe even a mix of AMD/nVidia cards. If that's the case, a lot of people who've previously upgraded their GPU's, may well have a second card lying around, and be able to use it for more than just Physx. Reply 0 James @jamesh Mar 26, 2017, 6:54pm It might provide a less hackish way of handling laptops with both an integrated Intel GPU and discrete Nvidia/AMD GPU. Depending on the workload, you might even benefit from using both at once. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

CNN Analyst Claims He Might Have Chuck Ross Reporter 7:15 PM 03/25/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5554215 Social media erupted on Saturday after a CNN analyst and former Homeland Security official said that sources have told her that former national security adviser Michael Flynn may have struck a deal of some sort with the FBI. “It is starting to look like, from my sources and then also from open reporting, that Mike Flynn is the one who may have a deal with the FBI and that’s why we have not heard from him for some time,” Juliette Kayyem, an assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs in the Obama administration, said in a panel discussion on Friday night. Kayyem noted that of the four former Trump advisers who are said to be subjects in an FBI investigation of potential ties to the Russian government, Flynn is the only one who has not volunteered to testify to Congress. The other three advisers, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone, offered to testify earlier this week. Kayyem did not indicate who her sources are. Nor did she say if they are claiming that Flynn has struck a deal or that it merely appears likely that he has. Nevertheless, her claim went viral on Twitter, with clips of her CNN segment receiving thousands of shares. So is her claim true? A spokesman for Flynn declined to confirm or deny that it is. “I don’t have anything on that,” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd told The Daily Caller when asked for comment on Kayyem’s claim. When pressed for clarification if he was denying the claim or was was merely not responding, Floyd said: “Not responding.” A confirmation that Flynn has struck a deal of some sort with the FBI would be a major blow against the Trump White House. But if Flynn has not, CNN’s credibility would suffer a hit. Flynn has been involved in two scandals involving foreign governments in recent weeks. He was fired as Trump’s national security adviser after 24 days on the job last month because he misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying For Obscure Dutch Firm With Ties To Turkish Government) And earlier this month, the retired lieutenant general took the unusual step of retroactively registering as a foreign agent of the Turkish government. He disclosed that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, signed a $600,000 contract with Inovo BV, a Dutch shell company linked to the Turkish government. Former CIA director James Woolsey, who served as an unpaid adviser for Flynn Intel, came forward Friday with some troubling details about Flynn’s work for the Turkish government. Woolsey told The Wall Street Journal that he sat in on a Sept. 19 meeting with Flynn and two ministers of the Turkish government in which the subject of the extrajudicial removal of a U.S.-based cleric named Fethullah Gulen was discussed. The Turkish government desperately wants the U.S. government to extradite Gulen. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, blames Gulen for a failed coup attempt last July. The extradition process would be handled through the Justice Department and federal court system, but the Turkish government has pressed both the Obama and Trump White Houses to intercede. Woolsey, who led the CIA under Bill Clinton, said that Flynn and the Turkish ministers discussed “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away.” (RELATED: Michael Flynn Discussed Covert Extraditiion Plan With Turkish Government) He says he told a mutual friend of then-Vice President Joe Biden’s about the discussion. Woolsey stepped down from the Trump transition team on Jan. 5. Floyd pushed back against Woolsey’s claim, saying that the extrajudicial removal of Gulen was never discussed at the Sept. 19 meeting, which was held at Essex House hotel in New York City. “I can say that at no time did anyone discuss what Woolsey passed onto the WSJ,” Floyd told TheDC. “Of course, even he has backed away from that now,” he added. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Woolsey said that he entered the meeting after it had been going on for 45 minutes. He said that he does not recall any specific plans to get custody of Gulen. In its contract with Inovo BV, Flynn Intel agreed to conduct research on Gulen using an “investigative laboratory” consisting of several former intelligence officials, including Woolsey and Brian McCauley, a former deputy assistant director for international operations at the FBI. (RELATED: As Foreign Agent For Turkey, Flynn Agreed To Form Elite Investigative Team, Make ‘Criminal Referrals’) Woolsey was unaware, until informed by TheDC earlier this month, that he was listed in the contract or as part of an “investigative laboratory.” Flynn also agreed to potentially make “criminal referrals” based on its research of Gulen. The consulting firm also agreed to make a documentary about Gulen. Update: Kayyem commented on her remarks in a Facebook post Saturday evening.  “There is a lot of attention today on the CNN segment last night,” she began. “To be clear, I did not say on this segment that I have any confirmation that [Flynn] is actually cooperating [with the FBI] or that I have talked to anyone who does. My informed analysis of this case is based on my years of experience in the national security arena,” she wrote.  Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Donald Trump, James Woolsey, Michael Flynn Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

See Offers Nation & World Posted Yesterday at 7:21 PM Updated March 25 increase font size Ex-CIA chief: Flynn, Turks discussed bypassing extradition to expel cleric Turkish President Erdogan has accused Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the U.S., of directing a failed coup last year. By CHAD DAYAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — Former CIA Director James Woolsey has accused the Trump administration’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, of participating in a discussion with Turkish officials about possibly subverting the U.S. extradition process to remove a Turkish cleric from the United States. The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey’s comments and posted a video interview with him Friday. A Flynn spokesman said that Woolsey’s claims are “false” and that “no such discussion occurred.” A spokesman for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, above, denies there were any discussions about removing the cleric by any means other than extradition. Associated Press file/Carolyn Kaster Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → In the Journal interview, Woolsey says he walked into the middle of a discussion between Turkish officials and members of Flynn’s firm, Flynn Intel Group, Sept. 19 at Essex House hotel in New York City. Woolsey said the discussion generally involved removing cleric Fethullah Gulen from the U.S. without going through the lengthy extradition process, though he said it stopped short of outlining a specific plan to sweep him out of the country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought Gulen’s extradition after accusing the cleric of directing a failed coup last summer. The U.S. government has rebuffed that request, and Gulen, who has a green card and lives in Pennsylvania, has denied involvement. Woolsey described the discussion as “brainstorming, but it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law.” Though, Woolsey noted that the discussion “did not rise to the level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act.” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd said that Flynn Intel Group’s work never involved discussing removing Gulen from the United States by any means other than the extradition process. “The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn or anyone else in attendance discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false,” Floyd said. “No such discussion occurred, nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend and afterward.” The meeting was part of lobbying work Flynn’s firm was conducting on behalf of Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Earlier this month, Flynn and his firm registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for the work for Alptekin, saying that it could have benefited the Turkish government. Flynn’s firm was paid $530,000 over the course of the contract, which ran from August through November while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. Alptekin has told the AP that Flynn’s firm registered as a foreign agent under pressure from the Justice Department. Woolsey, who served as CIA director under President Bill Clinton and briefly was a member of the Trump transition team, said he served on an advisory board for Flynn Intel Group but never did any work for the firm or received any payment from it. Flynn as fired by Trump last month after Trump said Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Despite the name, the Galaxy Book is not a laptop, but is instead a tablet with a keyboard cover. Today, the firm has released a video that gives the world a more formal introduction to its latest Windows 10 device. There isn't much information in the video about the actual product, but it does show us the beauty of it. Although short, you can watch the Galaxy Book come to shape in under a minute's time. If you're unfamiliar, the Book will arrive in two different sizes, a 10.6-inch and 12-inch variant. While the two have similar looks, it's the 12-inch model that will get the more powerful features, like an i5 processor and Super AMOLED display. You can check out the full specifications below.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Salesforce looks for a future beyond its walls with rising VC investments and acquisitions Chris O'Brien@obrien March 25, 2017 12:10 PM Tags: acquisitions, Salesforce, Venture Capital When it comes to investments and acquisitions, Salesforce has made headlines lately for deals that didn’t happen. The company’s rebuffed $26 billion bid for LinkedIn last year and a run at Twitter that never got off the ground would have ranked by far as Salesforce’s largest deals. But those non-deals overshadowed the things Salesforce has been doing, namely ramping up its venture capital investments to grow an ecosystem of partners as well as making the most acquisitions ever in its history last year. Even as Salesforce itself continues to grow organically, these aggressive moves are a sign of how the company continues to look beyond its own walls for how and where it might grow. In a recent conversation, Alex Kayyal, European head for Salesforce Ventures, said nurturing an expanding ecosystem of partners and developers has become a critical part of the company’s success and strategy. “Salesforce has been on a phenomenal growth trajectory,” he said. “But so much of what we do is partnering with others. And it’s just blown my mind to see the power of that ecosystem.” Perhaps the most visible part of that ecosystem is the Salesforce App Exchange, which now has 15,000 apps that extend the company’s core platform. It is this rapidly growing ecosystem that research firm IDC dubbed the “Salesforce Economy” in a report last September. According to IDC, that ecosystem could be responsible for creating 1.9 million jobs by 2020 and contributing $389 million to global GDP. To foster and continue that momentum, Salesforce has opened its wallet. Salesforce Ventures was officially launched in 2011, but the company actually began making venture investments back in 2009. In a recent securities filing, Salesforce noted that it has minority investments in over 180 companies as of January 31, 2017. According to CB Insights, Salesforce is the third largest corporate VC, behind Google Ventures and Intel Capital. The size of the investments reached such a point this past year that Salesforce felt the need to warn investors about the potential risks in its securities filings: “Because of the inherent risk in investing in early-to-late stage technology companies, our individual investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.” As part of that expanding portfolio, Salesforce announced a separate $100 million fund in 2015 to target European startups. Overall, the company has made 30 investments in Europe, including 15 in the 2 years since the fund was announced. Kayyal said that, in general, the company’s attention was drawn by the rapidly accelerating ecosystem in Europe and the emergence of numerous startup hubs across the continent. “The pace and level of innovation we are seeing on this side of the pond is incredible,” he said. “And we’ve been really excited about the reception we’ve seen.” Salesforce Ventures also looks primarily for companies that are doing some sort of cloud-based service, typically B2B. The emergence of a number of cloud-based startups in Europe was another reason the company decided to focus more effort here. And while the venture arm operates somewhat independently, it’s also aware of the company’s shifting priorities, such as a growing interest in artificial intelligence, Kayyal said. In addition to the money, the company tries to foster a true sense of partnership between the portfolio companies, to create what Kayyal calls a “mesh.” And it’s also looking for companies that can get help it get into new markets or technologies. That was the case, for instance, with its investment last year in France’s IoT startup Sigfox, which is building a communications network for connected devices. Over the past eight years, Salesforce has built a solid track record. It has seen 50 of its investments get acquired and 7 have IPOs. The VC investment is not necessarily a scouting operation for acquisitions, however. Salesforce makes it clear that any of its companies are free to pursue any attractive offers. That said, it has acquired a handful of its investments. And in general, Salesforce has also been making more M&A deals. Last year was the biggest in its history. Those acquisitions in 2016 included: SteelBrick, which develops apps to automate the quote-to-cash process, for an undisclosed sum. MetaMind, which developed natural language processing and image recognition for cloud services, for an undisclosed sum. BeyondCore, which made tools to analyze structured data sources, for an undisclosed sum. Demandware, which expanded its position in CRM and pursue the digital commerce market, for $2.9 billion. Quip, Inc., which developed productivity tool, for $412.0 million. Krux Digital, Inc., which created a data management platform, for $741.8 million. Before 2016, Salesforce’s biggest deal was for ExactTarget in 2014 for $2.5 billion. All this speaks to the company’s growing appetite and ambition. Its ability to balance these expanding investments and digest these acquisitions may determine whether Salesforce can succeed in striking in a balance that few maturing companies manage to find: Maintain an innovative culture, continue to grow its core services, and be ready to adapt as markets and technologies evolve in sometimes sudden and expected ways.

TV MOVIES TOP TENS MUSIC LIFESTYLE Louise Mensch defends Islam as Bill Maher cuts short Overtime on Real Time 25th March 2017 by April Neale Share with friendsTweet GoogleWhatsappStumbleuponMail Mensch’s insistence that the London terrorist act had ‘nothing to do with Islam’ set Maher off, and off set eventually On an electric Real Time with Bill Maher last night, Maher hosted a boisterous and controversial group with conservative Matt Schlapp, left of center reporter Chris Hayes, writer Max Brooks, conspiracy reporter Louise Mensch and academic Timothy Snyder. In two particularly heated moments, one during the main show and one during the online Overtime segment, Maher literally shut down Mensch and Hayes on the topic of Islam. During the main panel discussion, Maher brought up Wednesday’s London terror attack in which a 52-year-old British-born islamist terrorist – who had been previously investigated by British Intel – killed four people outside of London’s Parliament. “It has nothing to do with Islam? an incredulous Maher said to Mensch who said it did not. He dismissed her referenced past history with the IRA bombings and said, “that was the PAST.” Maher then repeated to her: “Are there Christian terrorist armies like Isis? Can we not f*** around anymore can we please get real about this?” and cut off Mensch mid-sentence. Mensch spent the better part of her time damning Vladimir Putin as being the one responsible for Trump’s unethical motives and the woes of the EU.   A shocked Maher challenged her mocking a machine gun spray at the end of his remark, saying: “Every time some bomb goes off, before it goes off, somebody yells ‘Allahu Akbar.’ I never hear anybody go ‘Merry Christmas, this one’s for the flying nun!’ Trump supporters are having massive buyers remorse, according to Bill In the monologue and before things got tense, Bill goes into a deep dive on how “Mad King” Donald Trump the con man is being found out by even his most ardent supporters.   Up at bat first was Matt Schlapp, a conservative who Bill had on to discuss Trump and other issues like lying on a scale of which we have never seen before. When asked about Trump’s lying and degradation of the White Office, Schlapp said: “I think everything’s fair and I think you I think with people who fear Donald Trump want to know is, you know is he full of a little bullshit sometimes and a little bit of hype? or is there something else there that you’re worried about a little more?” “I would say as a Trump supporter that I actually think it is part of someone who has not been involved in politics who’s coming to the system has had amazing success in a very short period of time…he became the president, political success.” Maher interrupts him and says: “Yes, he fooled people.” The two discuss the intelligence agencies and the committee that appears to be compromised by the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Devin Nunes’ actions this week:   Maher opened New Rules admonishing Trump supporters to open their eyes. He said: “I know you ‘real’ Americans hate being called stupid, but you gotta meet me halfway and stop being stupid!” New Rules was all about the long con of Trump, where Maher highlighted every lie, exaggeration, and falsehood exposed in video clips for Trump.   Overtime, where Bill finally has had it with Louise Mensch’s PC soft stance on Islam and how Sharia law and that particular faith (unlike Judaism and Christianity) will most certainly eat away at Britain’s national culture if the country becomes 51% or more Muslim. Maher said: “If a European country sometime in the future became 51% Muslim, would it be the same country? Would it have the same values, the same laws? Would the laws change?” Not stopping her arguments, Mensch was adamant that the fear over different cultures is the issue, which was one of several moments Maher had it with her: “I’m talking about our fundamental principles like equality of women, separation of religion and state, respect for minorities, rule of law, as opposed to religious rule.” Then when the subject is broached again in Overtime, Bill literally throws his cards down and cuts short the entire segment in frustration over her defense of Islam. Joining Mensch in defense of Islam was MSNBC’s Chris Hayes who was trying to “get” Matt Schlapp over Indonesia’s Islamic majority when Maher shut him down hard saying that women wanting to enter the police of military enter they must submit to the demeaning two finger test to prove they are virgins:   Real Time with Bill Maher airs Friday on HBO.

Allowing for fully automated submission of software escrow materials on an ongoing basis, the new services benefit both licensees and vendors. Licensees can be confident that each software escrow will be updated more regularly and accurately, with mistakes resulting from manual processes being eliminated. Software vendors benefit from a streamlined escrow submission process that is far easier to manage and which does away with human error. As a leader in the field of software and intellectual property escrow, EscrowTech serves clients including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Walmart, and Verizon. The company's new fully automated software escrow update services are available to clients now. "Software escrow is an increasingly important concern in the modern, highly digital realm of business," said EscrowTech Vice President Jorge Sagastume, "When source code and other software-related materials are not kept up to date, however, even a well-designed escrow cannot provide the protection and security that might be hoped. Our new fully automated software escrow submission service improves greatly on the slow, labor-intensive processes that have traditionally been the norm. In addition to eliminating human sources of error, the new automated escrow service makes it much easier to keep source code, data, documentation, and other assets up to date as development progresses. That benefits both vendors and licensees in truly significant ways." Many large companies today spend millions of dollars licensing complex, business-critical software systems from vendors that develop them. Particularly given the costs involved in acquiring, migrating to, and using such software, a large organization could become exposed to significant harm if a vendor should go out of business, lose access to related digital resources, or otherwise become unable to support a system. Software escrow is an arrangement designed to provide protection against such risks. With a trusted third party taking possession of the human-readable source code, data, and other intellectual property that makes up a software product, a licensing agreement will include provisions for the release of those assets to a licensee upon the business failure of the vendor or other defined condition. EscrowTech International, Inc., is one of the world's leading providers of secure, trusted software escrow. The company's new automated escrow submission service improves upon industry norms by enabling more regular updating of source code and other resources while removing the possibility of human-derived error. Those interested can learn more about the new service at the EscrowTech website. About EscrowTech International, Inc.: Serving over half of the Fortune 500, EscrowTech International, Inc., is one of the world's leading providers of trusted, secure, robust escrow and related services for software, SaaS, and intellectual property.

I curently have - Asrock motherboard with - 2x4gb Corsair Vengeance ( 1600Mhz 9-9-9-24 ) onboard RAM - Corsair CH600 PSU - intel 3570 CPU, and - MSI HD 7950 Twin Frozr III Boost OC GPU. As you all know, not the best stuff but running fine for me . I was thinking upgrading GPU to MSI RX 480 gaming x 8gb, ( because i like quiet cards ), but recently, i'm thinking about going one step further and get MSI gtx1070 8gb. O yeah, i'm running all this on my 1080p monitor btw. Now the question is, will my system bottleneck 1070, especialy onboard RAM, or should i just get RX 480, and maybe 8gb of onboard RAM. My brain think RX480+ 8gb RAM, and my heart 1070. I kinda like the power of 1070 and i think that card will last longer because i dont think upgrading my comp for 4 years soon. I'm AMD fan for long time now and this kinda fells hard on me changing to NVidia, but Vega is so far away and 1070 seems like normal choice for now.

Woolsey was a Trump campaign adviser at the time and attended the meeting, but said he arrived after it was already well underway. Woolsey claims that those present discussed sending Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim leader who Erdogan has accused of being behind a failed military coup to overthrow him, back to Turkey to face charges — possibly outside the legal US extradition system. “What I saw and heard was sort of the end of the conversation — it’s not entirely clear what transpired because of that,” Woolsey said on “CNN Tonight” with Don Lemon. “But it looks as if there was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting that we would be able, the United States would be able, through them, to be able to get hold of Gulen, the rival for Turkey’s political situation.” A spokesman for Flynn flatly denied Woolsey’s characterization of the meeting. “The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn, or anyone else in attendance, discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false,” Flynn spokesman Price Floyd said in a statement. “No such discussion occurred. Nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend, or afterwards.” The Wall Street Journal first reported Woolsey’s claims Friday. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign at the time. He became national security adviser after Donald Trump became President in January but resigned in mid-February, after he reportedly misled administration officials about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Woolsey, who was CIA director under President Bill Clinton and was on President Trump’s team for about five months before quitting in January, said he didn’t hear enough of what was said to make any definitive statements about what happened before he got there. “The reason I’m being cautious about how this was worded is because I wasn’t there for much of this meeting,” said Woolsey, who nevertheless described the meeting as “suspicious” and “concerning.” “I felt I needed to say something to somebody, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No,” he said. The White House acknowledged earlier this month that Trump’s transition team was aware Flynn engaged in work that would likely require him to register his consulting firm as a foreign agent before he was tapped to serve as national security adviser. Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from a Turkish-owned company based in the Netherlands and earlier this month registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department, acknowledging that the work may have benefited the Turkish government, according to foreign agent registration paperwork filed with the department. Flynn’s firm was not compensated by the Turkish government, but by Inovo BV, a company owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, according to the Justice Department filing. Alptekin is also the chairman of a US-Turkish business council. However, as part of that work, Flynn met with Turkish government officials in September 2016, including Turkey’s ministers of foreign affairs and energy, his firm disclosed in the filing. The meetings came around the time when Flynn traveled regularly with Trump on his private plane and frequently introduced him at campaign rallies.

Critical Link announced a Linux-driven “MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit” for automation, robotics, motion control, and vision applications based on its Intel Cyclone V based MitySOM-5CSx COM and baseboard. The latter has been upgraded with an add-on board designed to connect with Basler’s BCON dart embedded area scan cameras. The MitySOM-5CSx baseboard plugs directly to a DisplayPort monitor with no need for a PC intermediary. MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit (left) and MitySOM-5CSx (click images to enlarge) The SODIMM-style MitySOM-5CSx module was originally announced as the MityARM-5CSX back in 2013. The 82 x 38mm COM is based on Altera’s Cyclone V SX-U672 ARM/FPGA SoC, now owned by Intel. The Cyclone V SX provides a “Hard Processor System” (HPS) with dual 800MHz Cortex-A9 cores, as well as an FPGA on par with Altera’s Stratix V. MitySOM-5CSx block diagram (click image to enlarge) Both subsystems share 1GB of DDR3 RAM, and the FPGA can draw upon an optional 256MB of DDR3. The module provides two GbE controllers, 4x PCIe lanes, and up to 145 GPIO lines. General purpose MitySOM-5CSx Development Kit detail view (does not show camera add-on board) (click image to enlarge) The COM’s 314-pin MXM 3.0 edgecard connector connects with the 177.8 x 101.6mm baseboard that forms the basis of the MitySOM-5CSx Development Kit. The baseboard provides a GbE port, a micro-USB 2.0 OTG port, and a USB Blaster-II. There’s also a SATA connector, a console port, and dual isolated CAN ports, among other I/O shown in the diagram above. An SD slot is located on the back of the board. The MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit uses the same board, but adds an adapter board for the Basler BCON dart cameras. BCON is the name of Basler’s custom LVDS-based interface, which is offered as a leaner, more affordable alternative to the cameras’ USB 3.0-based USB3 Vision Standard compliant interface. MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit block diagram (click image to enlarge) The imaging kit’s baseboard hooks up to the BCON interface via its FPGA linked HSMC transceivers. There also appears to be a new DisplayPort adapter linked to the FPGA. The Basler BCON dart cameras start at 99 Euros ($107, and come in S-mount, CS-mount, and bare-board variants. The latter measures only 27 x 27mm and weighs 5 grams, while the S- and CS-mount versions are 29 x 29mm and 15 grams. The cameras available on Critical Link’s imaging kit use e2v and ON Semiconductor CMOS sensors with resolutions of 1.2- to 5-megapixels and up to 60fps video. To develop on the MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit, you can draw on the module’s Linux BSP, as well as Intel/Altera’s VIP Suite and OpenCL tools. Basler’s “user-friendly pylon” Camera Software Suite is included for free. Later this year, Critical Link plans to launch a 2nd gen imaging kit with “out-of-the-box synching of up to 4 darts,” said a company spokesperson.   Further information The MitySOM Embedded Imaging Dev Kit for Basler’s BCON dart cameras will ship early in the second quarter. Critical Link will demonstrate the product at Automate, April 3-6 in Chicago at booth #2666. The demo shows an edge detection application featuring real-time image processing and leveraging of IP Cores from Altera’s VIP Suite.

In 2016, India and China are still positioned as the leaders of software outsourcing industry. In spite of their dominance in market share, Vietnam is considered as an emerging software outsourcing destination. [ClickPress, Fri Mar 24 2017] The Growth of Vietnam Software Outsourcing in Recent Years Offshore software development nowadays is becoming a smart approach of global companies. In 2016, India and China are still positioned as the leaders of software outsourcing industry. In spite of their dominance in market share, Vietnam is considered as an emerging software outsourcing destination. The Vietnam software development market is recognized as a high quality and low price software development market. Vietnam software outsourcing services are about 90% cheaper compared to Western rivals and 40% cheaper compared to competitors from India and China. According to a report from Vietnam Software Association (VINASA), in the IT home market, there was a decrease in the number and scale of clients (in two segments: state-owned agents and private businesses) because of budget cuts for IT services. Meanwhile, the export markets growth rate increased by 30 to 40 percent per annum, and the US and Europes growth rates were stable at 20 to 30 percent. Some domestic software developers are optimistically expecting that North America will become the second largest Vietnamese outsourcing market, after Japan. Vietnam was ranked among the top 10 most attractive software outsourcing spots of the Asia- Pacific region by Gartner, a reputed US market researcher. The Advantages of Vietnam Software Outsourcing Many multinational electronics corporations such as Intel, Samsung, LG, Renesas, Fox, Canon, and, Panasonic have already been optimistically growing their manufacturing operations in Vietnam for decades. Foreseeing the markets potential, HP, CSC, Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco, Avaya, NTT, Toshiba, NEC, Panasonic, Sony, Sharp, Hitachi, Boeing, and Deutsche Bank also have Research & Development to further investigate the Vietnam market. Vietnam is seen as a large pool of talent and an emerging high tech center. Every year there are about 40,000 graduates, from 290 universities across the nation, who are well trained and equipped with the technical skills needed for the industry. The flourishing of skilled manpower and low labor costs contribute to a competitive advantage with regard to service quality and price. In addition to the stable and secure economy, the Vietnamese government has also established tax incentives, encouraged heavy high-tech zones, built software parks, and implemented human resource development strategies. Some Challenges of Vietnam Software Outsourcing In spite of Vietnams favorable conditions for IT product development and outsourcing services, some domestic IT firms are facing financing shortages and poor market strategies. To some extent, IT engineers have not satisfied the international market demands. The Ministry of Information and Communications is looking for solutions for the developing IT sector by promoting competition; building mechanisms to support IT and IT startup companies; offering more FDI for IT in general, and particularly for software outsourcing; and workshops for business matching between Vietnamese and IT foreign companies. Top 10 Vietnam Software Outsourcing Companies According to statistics from Vietnam Software Association (VINASA), Vietnamese companies specialized in outsourcing and software solutions have revenue accounting for a high proportion of total sales, more than 1/4 of software industry and digital content in 2015. The top 10 companies in Vietnam software outsourcing are: 1. FTP software 2. TMA Solutions 3. Harvey Nash Vietnam 4. Global Cybersoft Vietnam 5. KMS Technologies Vietnam 6. LogiGear Vietnam 7. Phu Si Computer Network (FUJINET) 8. Sunrise Software Solutions 9. IVC / ISB Vietnam 10.

This new 12C/24T chip will probably end up competing against the newly-rumored X390/X399 chipset for the higher-end Ryzen CPUs.     The new Ryzen 12C/24T processor was spotted inside of the Alienware Area 51-R3, and for comparison sake the Area 51-R2 features Intel's Core i7-6800/6850K. This isn't the server CPU processor, but it does sport a new socket - and a 3.2GHz Turbo clock, not bad for a 24-threaded CPU.

Lindsey Graham addresses a South Carolina town hall audience on Saturday. (AP) By Todd Beamon   |   Saturday, 25 Mar 2017 05:24 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Sen. Lindsey Graham said Saturday that Russia needed to be "punished" for its involvement in the presidential election — telling constituents at a town hall in South Carolina that "I've been more than on the case when it comes to Russia." "I have stood up for the idea that I'm not going to sit on the sidelines and wait for the Russians to try to undermine our democracy," the three-term Republican said at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center in the Palmetto State's capital city. Graham called Russian President Vladimir Putin "a crook and thug. "He's trying to break the back of NATO, the European Union — and he tried to interfere with our election. Don't you think we should push back?" The crowd cheered. Graham said he has legislation pending that would slap stronger economic sanctions on Moscow — and he called for it to be approved before elections take place in France and Germany later this year. "I hope to pass that bill and put it on President [Donald] Trump's desk in September to punish the Russians so they won't do it again," he said. In a wide-ranging session, Graham also slammed Obamacare — and talked about the failed GOP bill to replace it — while also attacking the heads of the House Intelligence Committee for their actions this week in their investigation of possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Moscow. He also was booed for declaring his unequivocal support for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and vowed to back the "nuclear option" to break any Democratic filibuster. "Judge Gorsuch was one of the finest people, I think, President Trump could have chosen," Graham said as the crowd booed. "I'm going to enthusiastically support him — and if the Democrats try to filibuster him, they will be making a huge mistake. "Let me tell you a little bit about the judge," he continued as the opposition grew louder. "You don't want to listen?" Graham then discussed the nominee's record and his endorsement by the American Bar Association, as well as his previous votes for Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. "To everybody that boos Judge Gorsuch, you're not persuading me at all," the senator declared. "If you can't understand that this is a qualified nominee, then you're not listening. "If you don't understand that elections matter, then you don't understand America," he added. "If you think that only liberals can get their nominees and a conservative can't, then you don't understand America." On the FBI investigation on possible ties between Moscow and the Trump campaign, Graham said that "it goes wherever it goes. "No politician should stand in the way. We should let the FBI do their job — and what happens is what happens." However, he slammed the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee — Republican Chairman Devin Nunes and ranking Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, both of California — for their actions on their own probe. "The House Intel Committee is about to fall apart," Graham said. "I don't know if they can get it back together. I hope they can. "I didn't like it when Nunes went down to the White House and started talking about things I'm not familiar with. I didn't like it when Schiff keeps telling everybody there is evidence, circumstantial in nature, that there is collusion. "That's really not the appropriate function of either one of these guys," he said. "I hope they can get it back together." Graham ripped Obamacare as a system that is about to collapse from skyrocketing premiums and deductibles for middle-class Americans, while "somebody else is getting it for free. "That ain't healthcare reform." But neither is the American Health Care Act, which President Trump ordered pulled from a second House floor on Friday because of strong Republican opposition, he said. "If the House had passed that bill, I'm not so sure it would have made things much better," he said. "The process was not what I wanted it to be. "Does it sound familiar that people were being threatened to vote 'yes'? Some people being bribed to vote 'yes.' "Sounds a lot like Obamacare to me," Graham said, referring to the intense lobbying by the Obama administration in 2010 to get the Affordable Care Act passed. "That's why I didn't like it." That was met with more boos from the crowd. "I don't think one party is going to be able to fix this by themselves," Graham continued. "I think the president should reach out to Democrats. "I should reach out to Democrats — and we should say, 'Let's take a shot at doing this together.' "Because it ain't working doing it by ourselves."

But enrollment in UIC's computer science department has grown twice as fast as in Urbana-Champaign over the past five years. The latter is twice as big at 1,686 students. But there's no denying the boom at UIC. "We're bursting at the seams," says UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. "We're fighting over closet space." U of I's board of trustees just gave final approval to build a $34 million building on Taylor Street for 50,000 square feet of ​ new labs and office space for the College of Engineering. It's the first new academic building on the main campus since 1991. The university has even bigger plans for computer science, which became the largest major in the College of Engineering this year and is the fastest-growing program on campus. Peter Nelson, the college's dean, wants to build a 168,000-square-foot home for computer science by 2021. Preliminary drawings are done, and he is working donors and alumni to raise $15 million for a building with an expected $68 million price tag. If he can get the new buildings, Nelson says UIC's engineering enrollment could grow to 6,500 from about 4,500 today. In 2005, the program had just 2,600; the first class of engineering graduates from UIC in 1968 totaled 75. "The demand is there," Nelson says. It's remarkable that UIC is talking about building anything, given the financial condition of the state, which has $13 billion in overdue bills and hasn't passed a complete budget in nearly two years. But the irresistible force that is demand for computer science talent is greater than the immovable object that is political gridlock. Nationally, undergraduate computer science enrollment more than tripled between 2006 and 2015, estimates the Computer Research Association. UIC's enrollment nearly quadrupled, rising by 292 percent, compared with a 20 percent gain in the school's overall student population. University of Chicago's computer science enrollment grew 643 percent, and Northwestern University grew 453 percent, though they have far fewer students than UIC. "We're at the right place at the right time," Amiridis says. The tech industry is exploding in Chicago as it is in other cities. And UIC is just across Interstate 290 from a fast-growing neighborhood that's home to Google and dozens of tech companies. Although Willis Tower looms over UIC's home on the West Side, the school is overshadowed by the flagship U of I campus in Urbana-Champaign, as well as Northwestern and U of C. "Whenever you say 'engineering,' everyone thinks Champaign," says Nancy Sullivan, CEO of Illinois Ventures, the U of I venture fund, who previously worked at Northwestern. "They do some great stuff at UIC. But they don't have the history and the legacy (of the flagship)." U of I in Urbana-Champaign is fifth-best among the computer science programs ranked by U.S. News & World Report. Northwestern and U of C tied for 34th on the U.S. News list; UIC is tied with University of Notre Dame at 60th. Nelson has to hustle for students. In 2013, the school launched a guaranteed paid internship program for incoming freshmen. Two-thirds of the internships are on-campus, but corporate employers include Google, Here, Nokia, ComEd, Amazon, Argonne, Microsoft, BMW, ITW, Intel, HP, PayPal and Zebra. "It's a big selling point," he says. Rohit Pasam, a UIC alum with a master's in bioengineering, has frequently tapped his alma mater for talent as he builds a security-software startup. "We have two top engineers from UIC on our team," says Pasam, co-founder and CEO of Xaptum. "We got amazing interns from UIC, who now work for top companies. They were hidden gems." Cybersecurity, as well as data mining and data visualization, are among UIC's strengths, along with its location. Philip Yu, who joined UIC in 2008 from IBM's Watson Research Lab, is a top expert in data mining. "Because of our location, we're able to hire better people than you'd expect, based on our ranking," Nelson says. "Our kids also want to study in an urban environment." Like most university administrators, he has a love-hate relationship with rankings but recognizes the reality that they matter to students, faculty and alumni. Nelson wants to one day become a Top 25 program, which is way beyond a stretch goal, given the glacial pace at which rankings change. The 54-year-old doesn't lack for ambition. A specialist in artificial intelligence who did his graduate work at Northwestern, Nelson joined UIC in 1988 and became head of computer science in 2001. He was named dean of engineering a decade ago. "He is a top-drawer guy," says Dennis Roberson, a computer science professor and former vice provost at Illinois Tech, which ranks 101st on the U.S. News list. "He also is absolutely driven to win." Nelson is quick to point out that UIC has an older, more diverse and less affluent student body than many of its peers. You won't find it near the top of anyone's list of party schools. (The Urbana-Champaign campus ranks No. 3; it was No. 1 in 2015.) Fifty-six percent of students are eligible for Pell grants, or need-based federal scholarships. At the Urbana campus, it's 22 percent. As tuition rates soar, that puts more pressure on students, but it also makes UIC more appealing. Transfers to UIC have doubled since 2009. "Our job is to provide students access to excellence," he says. "To maintain that access, we have to grow."... To see the full article, subscribe or log in.

It’s been an action-packed week across the tech world, filled with exciting news, spicy rumors, and one or two surprises. But don’t worry if you’ve struggled to keep up with it all – 7 Days is here again to walk you through what’s been happening, and bring you up to speed. Our global tech odyssey begins this week with WikiLeaks, which contacted major tech companies including Apple, Microsoft and Google, offering to work with them in patching exploits used by the CIA, revealed in its recent 'Vault7' leaks. However, WikiLeaks attached certain conditions to its offer of cooperation - and since then, those companies have not responded favorably to the organization's requests. In an unsettling move, the US Senate voted to allow internet service providers to share and sell users' browsing histories without their explicit permission. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, a judge granted a warrant to a local police department requiring that Google provide the personal details of literally anyone, anywhere, who looked for a specific name using its search engine. Google apologized earlier this week after YouTube's 'Restricted Mode' - which is intended to filter out inappropriate content for certain users - began indiscriminately blocking videos from the LGBTQ+ community, without explanation. The company apologized, and later said that the feature "isn't working the way it should", promising to fix it. Over on the Google Play Store, a mystery has been brewing. WhatsApp recently received a flood of thousands of five-star reviews on the store - but they refer to the app as a "game", and describe how the reviewers "enjoyed the gameplay", which certainly raises some questions. Speaking of five-star reviews, Netflix is dropping its star-based ratings system in favor of a simpler thumbs-up/thumbs-down method for rating its shows and movies. Qualcomm announced its new 205 Processor Mobile Platform, a dual-core chipset that will bring 4G LTE to affordable feature phones. British telecommunications giant Vodafone is joining forces with Idea, one of India's top mobile operators, to form the country's largest carrier, with almost 400 million customers, and around 40% of the nation's mobile revenue. It also seems that Apple is preparing to start manufacturing iPhones in India. However, over in New Zealand, Apple has come under fire for having sold $4.2 billion (NZD) worth of products in the country since 2007, but paying no taxes there at all. Tuesday was a big day for Apple as it made a series of product announcements. It launched new (PRODUCT)RED special editions of its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, contributing to the fight against the spread and the effects of HIV/AIDS. Aside from the rather striking new lick of paint, though, they're technically identical to the 'standard' iPhone 7 models that it launched last year. It also doubled the storage of its iPhone SE range at no extra cost, finally eliminating the scourge of the 16GB iPhone from its line-up. And it brought an end to its 9.7-inch iPad Air range, replacing it with a much cheaper 9.7-inch tablet, simply branded "iPad", and starting at $329. It also ditched the iPad mini 2, and doubled the mini 4's storage. Huawei released an update for its Mate 9 handset to enable Amazon's digital voice assistant, Alexa, allowing users to control smart home devices and more. Sony unexpectedly announced the Xperia L1, with a 5.5-inch display and Android 7.0 Nougat. But even more expected was an announcement from VAIO, which of course used to be owned by Sony. A year after launching the Phone Biz with Windows 10 Mobile, VAIO announced the Phone A, with virtually identical (and now somewhat outdated) specs, and running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow (!!), which was originally released in December 2015. HMD Global said that its Nokia 3, 5 and 6 Android smartphones will be made available in the US, as part of plans for a simultaneous launch of its devices in 120 markets in Q2 2017, which it described as "ambitious". That is something of an understatement. Details of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 flagship continued to emerge in recent days: Performance benchmarks hint at fierce performance for Galaxy S8 Samsung announces Bixby, its new digital assistant, launching on the Galaxy S8 Screen resolution options Samsung's upcoming DeX desktop docking station for the S8 may include active cooling fans Samsung releases UNPACKED 2017 app ahead of launch event Galaxy S8 may be smaller than the Galaxy S7 edge The Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on T-Mobile, and the LG V10 and G5 on AT&T, all received Google's latest security updates for Android this week. Google published its Android Security report for 2016, acknowledging that "there's still a lot of room for improvement" in how devices are updated, but insists that it's made good progress, and will continue to do so. Seven months after Android 7.0 was released, Nougat is now installed on just 2.8% of active Android devices. The Nougat update continues its long, slow rollout, making its way this week to: Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ Galaxy S7 and S7 edge on Rogers and Telus in Canada HTC One M9 on T-Mobile in the US Nextbit Robin Google also released its second beta of Android 7.1.2 for supported devices. But the biggest news of the week on the Google front came as the company revealed details of the next major version of its ubiquitous operating system. On Tuesday, it announced Android O, which will include a wide range of new features and improvements. It also released its first Developer Preview for a handful of devices, and promised a wider beta program in May, ahead of Android O's general release in Q3. You can find out how to install the Developer Preview right now - but it's not recommended for inexperienced users. Also on Tuesday, Microsoft released its latest Insider Preview for the Windows 10 Creators Update, build 15063, to PCs and phones in the Fast ring. A couple of days later, it released the same build to the Slow ring. With the Creators Update due to be released next month, this week's leak of the SDK and Mobile Emulator for build 15063 appeared to confirm that it will be the final 'RTM' build for the new version of Windows 10. Microsoft also released two cumulative updates for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update - the current version of the OS: build 14393.969 on Monday; and 14393.970 on Thursday. In China, Microsoft said that its specialized government-approved version of Windows 10 "is now in a good position" to serve the country's public sector. But in India, there was bad news for Windows phone owners. With just one week's notice, Microsoft is ending its support for carrier billing there. Over in the US, Cricket Wireless briefly offered pre-owned models of the Microsoft Lumia 650 for just $0.99 (yes, that's 99 cents - not a typo) - but it's since removed that listing. Users with older versions of Windows and Windows Phone will no longer be able to access the Microsoft Translator app from next month. Some users will be able to download "new versions" of the app to continue using it - but these changes do not affect Windows 10 devices. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of Microsoft's near-endless stream of deals on its Surface devices. In the US, it cut $100 off the entry-level Surface Pro 4 without the Surface Pen; and then a few days later, it reduced the price of another model by $200. Over in the UK, literally two minutes after ending one deal, it launched another one, offering up to 24% off select Surface Book and Pro 4 models. Earlier this week, there were five separate deals available on the Surface Pro 4 at the same time in the UK. Nonetheless, the Surface Pro 4 appears to be selling well. According to the latest AdDuplex report, it's the most popular device in Microsoft's range - but HP is the world's biggest Windows 10 PC maker. The US Army has ordered almost 10,000 rugged Windows 10 tablets, including Intel's latest Core processors, and a variety of security features. A company founded by a former Microsoft employee has started a crowdfunding campaign, aiming to launch an 8-inch Windows 10 ultra-mobile PC with an ARM-based Snapdragon 835 processor, 4G LTE, and an integrated keyboard. Priced at up to $750, the company behind the device hopes to launch the Windows 10 model in January 2018, a few months behind the cheaper Android model. Last year, Microsoft shipped the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with an incomplete Skype Preview app. Ahead of the Creators Update, and following months of additions and improvements to the app, the company dropped its 'Preview' tag in the latest version this week. Microsoft Edge was declared the least secure web browser after being hacked more than any of its rivals at the Pwn2Own 2017 hacking event. Google's Chrome browser emerged unscathed. Microsoft said that "security is a process, not a destination", and outlined various improvements in its browser to enhance its security. It also announced that it's bringing support for CSS Custom Properties to Edge in the Creators Update. For the second time in recent weeks, many users found themselves unable to sign in to services using their Microsoft account credentials on Tuesday; the issue affected services such as OneDrive, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, and more. Those login issues didn't exactly provide the ideal build-up to Microsoft's announcement that its Outlook.com Premium mail service is now available in six new markets. LineageOS emerged from the ashes of Cyanogen, offering a new alternative Android-based operating system. The OS has now reached over a million installations, and its development team celebrated by revealing new improvements and adding support for more devices. Cyanogen's Kirt McMaster revealed that Nintendo had approached the company to ask for its help in developing a custom version of Android for the console that it eventually released as the Switch this year. McMaster said he had "told them to stick it". Charming. Nintendo finally acknowledged issues affecting the connectivity of the Joy-Con controllers on its Switch console, following weeks of complaints. It described the problem as a "manufacturing variation", and is offering free repairs for affected controllers. By the way, if you're thinking of buying the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, be sure to check out our unboxing video and gallery. It's been quite a busy week for those on the Xbox Insider Program. On Tuesday, Microsoft released build 15063 - yep, the same number that's virtually certain to be the RTM build for the Creators Update - to the Alpha Ring, followed quickly by the Beta Ring, and Ring 3. A couple of days later, it rolled out build 15063.1003 to the Alpha Ring, before rapidly rolling it out to the Beta Ring and Ring 3 too. It's also released the first Alpha Ring Insider Preview of the Version 1704 update - which will come after the Creators Update. Many of the features in the new 1704 preview were outlined earlier in the week in an official announcement. Microsoft also announced the Wireless Controller Recon Tech Special Edition for the Xbox One and One S. Priced at $69.99, the company said that it's "inspired by military technology", and it's the first in a new 'Tech Series' of Wireless Controllers launching this year. The number of Xbox 360 games supported on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility feature rose to more than 350 when Microsoft added three more games on Tuesday, followed by a further three additions on Thursday, including Assassin's Creed Revelations. It was also confirmed this week that an Assassin's Creed TV show is officially in development. Photos purporting to show marketing material for Destiny 2 emerged this Thursday, apparently revealing the game's release date, and confirming an upcoming beta. The long wait for Mass Effect: Andromeda finally came to an end this week, as the game launched on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Its release had been delayed by several months. But our journey ends this week with the world's most popular plumber, who finally made his way to the world's largest mobile platform. Six months after it was originally announced, and three months after its launch on iOS, Super Mario Run is now available on Android. Better late than never? Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. First up, check out our overview of some of the new features and improvements coming in the Windows 10 Creators Update. Shreyas Gandhe shared his review of the Oukitel U15S, an Android smartphone with 4GB RAM, and 32GB storage and a rather slim design. Impressed? Don't be - Shreyas described the device as "a combination of wrong choices". Timi Cantisano had a Flashback to the Nokia N95, ten years after its release. Times have certainly changed in the tech world since then, but the N95 was quite a remarkable device when it launched a decade ago. If you're feeling in a nostalgic mood, be sure to read the article for a trip down Memory Lane. And finally, after Google announced details of its next major update for Android, we asked our readers what they think the big 'O' in 'Android O' might stand for. Which sweet snack or delicious dessert will it be named after? Join in the discussion and have your say!

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → March → ETF Strategy to Play Technology & Semiconductor Sectors ETF Strategy to Play Technology & Semiconductor Sectors March 24, 2017 at 10:52 am by Tom Lydon The technology sector has been one of the best-performing segments of the U.S. equity market to start 2017 and semiconductor stocks have been important contributors to that theme. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLK), the largest technology exchange traded fund by assets, along with rival, traditional technology ETFs such as the Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (NYSEArca: FTEC) and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSEArca: VGT) feature exposure to semiconductor stocks. While the various sector-specific ETFs provide broad exposure to their targeted segments, investors should keep in mind that there are differences in the different ETF offerings. For instance, the Select Sector SPDR line of ETFs have more focused or less diversified exposure since they take holdings from the smaller universe of S&P 500 companies. The Vanguard line may have the most diversity with higher number of components.The Fidelity ETFs, though, are the cheapest of the bunch, which may be more appealing to long-term investors. More direct approaches to chip makers among ETFs include the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEArca: SMH) and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NasdaqGM: SOXX). However, declining motherboard shipments could weight on chip stocks and the aforementioned ETFs. “Despite Intel, AMD and Nvidia having all launched new processor or graphics chip products for the first quarter, motherboard players continue to suffer decreased shipments in the quarter and demand is also unlikely to pick up in the second, according to sources from the upstream supply chain,” reports DigiTimes. Traders looking to make bearish bets on chip ETFs can consider the ProShares UltraShort Semiconductors (NYSEArca: SSG), which takes the -2x or -200% daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index and the Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bear 3x Shares (NYSEArca: SOXS), which provides a -3x or -300% performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Select Index. “Because of weak graphics card demand especially from China, players have already started cutting prices for their GTX 1060 (starting US$249) and GTX 1070 (starting US$379) graphics card to stimulate demand,” reports DigiTimes.

Uber launched a groundbreaking driverless car service, stealing ahead of Detroit auto giants and Silicon Valley rivals with technology that could revolutionize transportation. Angelo Merendino, AFP/Getty Images Internal report says its autonomous cars can't even go a single mile before a person has to take control by  David Booth  | 2 days ago Small Medium Large Here’s the reality behind all the hype you’re reading about self-driving cars: Uber’s autonomous test fleet drove 32,000 kilometres last year and, in almost every single one of those kilometres, the minder in the driver’s seat had to take over the wheel. Officially, the statistics are that Uber’s active robotic cars drove 20,354 miles and, according to Recode.net, which obtained some internal performance documents, “during the week ending March 8, the 43 active cars on the road only drove an average of close to 0.8 miles before the safety driver had to take over for one reason or another.” In other words, Uber’s vaunted self-driving cars couldn’t get you safely to the closest grocery store without one of those pesky carbon-based humans having to take back control from the computer. The reason for taking over command and control, says Recode, “can include navigating unclear lane markings, the system overshooting a turn or driving in inclement weather.” What it doesn’t include are “critical interventions,” those situations where the safety driver had to take over to prevent harmful situations, which the company defines as the car hitting a person or causing more than $5,000 in property damage. According to Uber’s own numbers, that was once in every 320 clicks. Essentially, Uber’s cars would have hit two people or had two accidents (were it not for we lowly “safety drivers,” of course) driving from Toronto to Montreal or Vancouver to Nelson. Even the robot’s ability to drive smoothly is called into question by Uber’s own statistics. According to Recode, Uber “auto-detected ‘bad experiences'” — hard deceleration or abrupt car jerks — every three kilometres or so. This was especially bad in Phoenix along the city core’s trendy Scottsdale Road, where the (not) taxis could barely get two-thirds of a mile before a lowly human had to intervene. What makes this so very interesting is that the reason Uber moved to Phoenix from its original test facility in San Francisco was California’s insistence that it report all such “disengagements” as a condition of being issued a permit to test its autonomous automobiles on public roads. RELATED Self-driving cars approved for 10 U.S. testing sites According to the author of the Recode report, Johana Bhuiyan, other suppliers and manufacturers have a little better record than Uber at keeping their cars handsfree. Cruise, the self-driving startup now owned by General Motors, reported that drivers had to take over an average of once every 85 km, Nissan once every 240 clicks and Ford only once every 300. Reasons for the interventions ranged from the potentially fatal — the software module froze or the vehicle was about to hit another car — to the innocuous — the driver simply wasn’t comfortable with the visibility of the lane demarcation lines. This last, relatively easy point in sunny Arizona, one would think, points to the challenges that self-driving cars will face here in the Great White Frozen North. At the very same time that Uber was suffering its travails in sunny Arizona — where the weather is so uniformly fair that it’s an inside joke amongst air force pilots to be grounded due to “bad weather” — I was in a luxury sedan with semi-autonomous features driving to Ottawa to take care of my folks. On the way to the nation’s capital, conditions were Phoenix-like sunny and bright (though not quite as temperate, of course). The car’s robot had little trouble navigating between the 401’s lines. The straights were handled with unwavering aplomb and corners with steady, gentle arcs. Oh, I had to intervene every 15 seconds or so with a gentle tug of the wheel (automakers disable their current systems automatically to make sure you’re paying attention), but in general, the system was pretty reliable. The only emergency “disengagement” was when an 18-wheeler abruptly moved over with feet to spare, and I didn’t want to wait around to see if the computerized pilot would get with the program before I became one with a Peterbilt. Nonetheless, the system was fairly impressive. On the way back, however, Ontario was hit with the snowstorm that wasn’t — we were threatened with 30 centimetres; only about two arrived. But even that light dusting sent the autonomous systems into a tizzy. Turns now became a nightmare of delay and over-correction, while navigating the straight sections felt like a drunken sailor weaving down a sidewalk after three nights of shore leave. Eventually, the system just shut down, a few flakes of the powdery white stuff enough to overwhelm the camera systems trying to guide its path. I should mention again that this was no whiteout blizzard, just a light dusting of snow that did not cover the lane markings — I could see them clearly despite my 59-year-old, I’m-probably-due-for-a-new-prescription eyes. How such systems will deal with a real snowfall is hard to fathom. So why then all the hype surrounding self-driving cars? Perhaps more importantly, why are the monies being spent on autonomous technology so outrageous? Intel, you may have read, recently paid US$15 billion for Israeli self-driving tech supplier Mobileye (the company, you may remember, that abandoned Tesla after its over-hyping of the Model S’s Autopilot system). You might think that’s because CEO Brian Krzanich sees the self-driving industry growing to US$70 billion by 2030. In fact, there may be an even bigger reward.  RELATED Intel buys Mobileye, instantly becomes giant in autonomous car arena “Data is the new oil,” says no less than the Financial Times; “who’s going to own it” determining the corporate haves and have-nots of the future. Between cameras (collecting between 20 and 40 megabytes per second), sonar (10 to 100 KB/sec) and Lidar (10 to 70 MB/sec), Intel estimates that autonomous vehicles will collect 4,000 gigabytes of data every day. Multiply that by the roughly 300 million cars on North American roads today and you have – well, my calculator won’t actually go that high, but you have a whole whack-load of data to sell. And finally, what makes these revelations all the more interesting is the continued ambivalence that consumers profess towards the prospect of the future’s autonomous automobiles. Study after study (the most recent by Deloitte indicating that fully three-quarters of Americans “believe fully autonomous vehicles will not be safe”) reveal a populace still strikingly uncomfortable with the prospect of a computer assuming complete control of its car. Makes you kind of wonder what the motivation behind all this automation really is. You may also like...

Turkey accuses the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of orchestrating last July's failed coup. In a video interview, Mr Woolsey told the Wall Street Journal he was present at a discussion about removal methods beyond the legal extradition process. Mr Flynn disputes Mr Woolsey's account. The meeting took place last September at a New York Hotel. Those present included Mr Flynn, then an adviser on national security to the Trump election campaign, the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, according to the WSJ (paywall). 'Brainstorming' Mr Woolsey, then also advising the Trump campaign, admitted he might not have heard "some kind of caveat" because he arrived late for the meeting. But he told the WSJ: "There was serious discussion of finding some way to move Mr Gulen out of the US to Turkey. "You might call it brainstorming. But it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law." He went on: "It was a serious and troubling discussion but it did not, repeat not, in my portion of being in the room, rise to a level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act." In a later interview with CNN , Mr Woolsey called the meeting "suspicious" and "concerning", saying: "I felt I needed to say something to somebody, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No." A spokesman for Mr Flynn, whose consulting company Flynn Intel Group carried out work for the Turkish government, disputed Mr Woolsey's version of events. "At no time did Gen Flynn discuss any illegal actions, non-judicial physical removal or any other such activities," he said. Mr Gulen has lived in the US for nearly two decades (Image copyright AP) The presence of Mr Gulen in the US has become a major irritant in relations between Washington and Ankara. Turkey has repeatedly called for him to be handed over. Mr Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, denies involvement in the failed coup. Mr Flynn was forced to step down as national security adviser in mid-February after just a few weeks in post over allegations he discussed sanctions with Russia before Mr Trump took office. Private US citizens are barred from conducting diplomacy. Mr Flynn admitted providing the vice-president with an incomplete account of his conversation with the Russian ambassador.

NCAA March Madness Live app, managed by Turner Sports in partnership with CBS Sports and the NCAA, generated an all-time record 69.1mln live streams through the first Sunday of the tournament, an increase of +24% over last year. “We aren’t seeing any real cannibalization of linear because of digital or vice versa. We see people consume more because this great tournament is everywhere a fan is,” said Hania Poole, vp, gm NCAA Digital at Turner Sports. Latency is always important with online streaming, but it’s even more critical with sports. When Poole stepped into her position four years ago, she estimates that video was behind a minute to a minute and a half on some devices. “Now I feel like it’s shortened to about 30 seconds. Maybe 45,” she said. TV has set the benchmark for streaming, Akamai CTO John Bishop told CFX. “There’s always been that 45-60 second behind line. That’s just been kind of the nature of the Internet. When you look at why, it’s largely because the pieces were fragile and immature in the supply chain. Every little element that was touching a lot of the bits created its own little safety net—and safety net in our world means buffer,” Bishop said, adding that as Akamai has expanded its investments the system has become more cohesive. “We put a line in the sand a few years ago to say let’s cut the gap from 45 seconds down to sub 20. Last year was the first year we started seeing some line of sight that it was possible. I think this year we’re getting better than television on the OTT side. In some cases, we can get a signal faster to you now than a cable TV infrastructure will.” That’s always been the goal—to get to the point where there’s parity between linear and digital. Bishop believes streaming has achieved that already in resolution and audience size. “It’s no longer a scary proposition to see millions of people concurrently come in to join a basketball game or an episodic or a debate,” he said. And on resolution, the Internet is starting to surpass TV with tech such as UHD, VR and 4K. Indeed, the March Madness app will offer enhanced VR games powered by Intel. At CSG, one big focus with its Ascendon platform is monetization of digital services. With that monetization goal in mind, CSG is keen to improve delivery of sports content as it moves into more true OTT scenarios, said Sean Casey, director of product management at CSG. ESPN is among its clients, with CSG working with the programmer on both premium sports content and premium media to be delivered directly to the consumer. Casey agrees with Bishop that delivery is getting even better, helped in part by adaptive bit rates. “It tests the user’s network speed and delivers a stream that’s best suited for that speed,” he said. “Instead of trying to deliver a big screen experience on your iPhone, it’s going to see if you’re in a poor coverage area and provide a lower quality experience but one that doesn’t buffer.” Back to March Madness, this year marks the first that Turner has used iStreamPlanet as the streaming provider for the series—a tip to Turner’ acquiring a majority stake in the company in 2015. It previously had used MLBAM. In Turner’s command center, Poole and team monitor how video is performing with the help of video optimization service Conviva, looking at how viewers are experiencing the video, network quality, what bitrate is being served, etc. Anecdotally, she’s taken note of fans posting photos on social media of them watching a game one big screen with a line of devices standing next to it showing the NCAA March Madness Live app. While most streaming is focused on mobile, it’s worth noting that March Madness is a different animal with so much viewing taking place during work hours. With that in mind, Turner Sports updated the desktop viewing experience this year. “We completely redesigned it and took it out of flash and made it into an HTML5 player. I think we’re one of the first live sports platforms to do that,” Poole said. “We made it responsive so it sizes to whatever setting your browser is on, and it has a shot chart that you can expand and some other cool features.” Turner also expanded this year to 15 platforms for the tourney from 13, adding a skill on Amazon’s Alexa (its first foray into voice) and joining its first game console through Xbox. share this article previous storyMobile Drives Ad-Supported VOD Viewing next storyEvolving to Distributed Access Architectures Featured Stories <   > Featured Stories Technology Arris Investor Day Technology WEC Wrap-Up Technology Arris at Retail Technology Road to Better Performance Technology Cablefax: The Magazine Multiscreen Issue Technology Survey Says Education May Curb Piracy Related Stories Technology Arris Investor Day Technology Evolving to Distributed Access Architectures Technology Streaming Sports: All Signs Point… The Latest Technology Trump’s Day: Before Healthcare Bill… Technology Netflix Dominates Original SVOD Content Technology Snapchat Surgery Technology Privacy Repeal: Senate Gets Ball… Technology Celebrating Cablefax’s Top Lawyers Technology Evolving to Distributed Access Architectures Technology Streaming Sports: All Signs Point… Technology 4K Baseball Get cable industry news in your inbox, daily!

Turkey accuses the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of orchestrating last July's failed coup. In a video interview, Woolsey told the Wall Street Journal he was present at a discussion about removal methods beyond the legal extradition process. Flynn disputes Woolsey's account. The meeting took place last September at a New York Hotel. Those present included Flynn, then an adviser on national security to the Trump election campaign, the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, according to the WSJ. Woolsey, then also advising the Trump campaign, admitted he might not have heard "some kind of caveat" because he arrived late for the meeting. But he told the WSJ: "There was serious discussion of finding some way to move Gulen out of the U.S. to Turkey. "You might call it brainstorming. But it was brainstorming about a very serious matter that would pretty clearly be a violation of law." He went on: "It was a serious and troubling discussion but it did not, repeat not, in my portion of being in the room, rise to a level of being a specific plan to undertake a felonious act." In a later interview with CNN, Woolsey called the meeting "suspicious" and "concerning", saying: "I felt I needed to say something to somebody, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No." A spokesman for Flynn, whose consulting company Flynn Intel Group carried out work for the Turkish government, disputed Woolsey's version of events. "At no time did Gen Flynn discuss any illegal actions, non-judicial physical removal or any other such activities," he said. The presence of Gulen in the U.S. has become a major irritant in relations between Washington and Ankara. Turkey has repeatedly called for him to be handed over. Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, denies involvement in the failed coup. Flynn was forced to step down as national security adviser in mid-February after just a few weeks in post over allegations he discussed sanctions with Russia before Trump took office. Private U.S. citizens are barred from conducting diplomacy. Flynn admitted providing the vice-president with an incomplete account of his conversation with the Russian ambassador.

President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn discussed with senior Turkish officials the possibility of removing Turkey's exiled opposition figure Fethullah Gulen, who is accused by Ankara of masterminding a coup attempt last year, according to a report. Former CIA Director James Woolsey told the Wall Street Journal that he attended a meeting in New York in September during which Flynn, who was then an adviser to Trump‘s presidential campaign, spoke with top Turkish government ministers about removing Muslim cleric Gulen from the United States and taking him to Turkey. The former CIA chief said that he was shocked by the discussions and felt the move could be illegal. The idea was “a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away," Woolsey told the Journal. "You don’t send out folks to haul somebody overseas." Flynn disclosed the meeting to the Justice Department in a filing late last month, admitting that his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, carried out research that "focused on" Gulen on behalf of the Netherlands-based company Inovo BV, which is owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin. Turkey’s US-based opposition cleric Fethullah Gulen (file photo) Recently, Flynn had to register as a foreign agent because of his work with Inovo. Flynn’s firm was paid more than $500,000 by the Dutch firm for public relations and research work, including looking into the Turkish opposition figure, who is residing in Pennsylvania. Flynn, who was forced to resign last month over his contacts with Russian officials, was involved in a business that was potentially representing the interests of a country other than the US at the time he was advising Trump on foreign policy matters during the election.

A spokesperson for Flynn denied the accusations of plotting to remove the cleric who was exiled from Turkey in 1999.  General Michael Flynn allegedly had the plan to 'whisk' away Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen from Pennsylvania and send him back to the mid east RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Tragedy as mom-to-be, 30, discovers she has terminal cancer...

Share this article Share Former CIA Director James Woolsey said Flynn plotted to remove  Fethullah Gulen (pictured) from the US The discussion reportedly did not detail exactly how to get Fethullah Gulen, who is a legal US resident, from where he was living in the Pennsylvania Poconos. Flynn allegedly wanted to avoid the US extradition process. Turkey has accused Gulen - a former ally who has turned into Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's top foe - of trying to destabilize Turkey and says his movement is behind a failed military coup in July aimed at toppling the Turkish leader. One of the people in the meeting with Flynn was reportedly Erdogan’s son-in-law.   Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup. His movement also condemned 'in the strongest terms' the ambassador's assassination. The government however, has labeled the movement 'the FETO terror organization' and has cracked down on Gulen's followers, arresting tens of thousands of people for their alleged link to the coup and purging more than 100,000 suspected supporters from government jobs.  Earlier this month, Michael Flynn admitted that his lobbying firm was paid $530,000 for work that could have benefited the Turkish government, just two months before he was appointed to the White House. Erdogan accused Gulen of organizing a deadly coup in July 2016 against Turkey Flynn's consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, was lobbying for a Dutch consulting firm with ties to Erdogan before and immediately after the US election. The military veteran stepped down in February less than a month into President Donald Trump's administration amid mounting questions over his future and his close links with the Kremlin. His stunning announcement, first reported by CNN, came just hours after sources close to the government revealed that the Justice Department had warned the new administration that his links with the Kremlin had put him in a compromising position and left him open to blackmail. Flynn made numerous phone calls to the Russian Ambassador to the US before Trump took office, and later hinted he may have gone against diplomatic protocol by discussing the rollback of sanctions.  Read more: Ex-CIA Director: Mike Flynn and Turkish Officials Discussed Removal of Erdogan Foe From U.S. - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 75 shares Most watched News videos Wrath of the Queen's Guardsman as dancing tourist gets telling off Presenter Rachel Burden silences a crying baby with utter ease People huddle together amid reports of gunshots in Bellagio Hotel Footage of the moment Khalid Masood was shot by police Andrew Neil's strong message to terrorists on BBC's This Week Dashcam captures gun-wielding woman being run over by police Violent unrest takes hold of Trump supporters at the #MAGAmarch Awkward!

The 10-year average return of VC funds in Canada for the period 1995-2005 was 2.5%, compared with 20.7% for US funds — the various Canadian government-sponsored funds made even lower returns. In 2007, while almost US$30 billion was invested in US ventures, only about $2 billion was invested in Canada (bearing in mind Canada’s population of almost 33 million then, about 1/10th of the US). Not much changed during the last 10 years. Median Canadian VC has delivered a 4% internal rate-of-return (IRR) versus comparable US returns of 12%, and the five-year numbers are 11% and 20%, respectively. This despite the mantra from all Canadian governments, federal and provincial — “innovations, innovations.”  The word appears 212 times in the 280-page federal budget tabled this week by the Trudeau Liberals, with generous taxpayer-funded spending promised in the hope that something might stick. How come not much ever did? The answer is not rocket science. First, you need a culture of disciplined, wide-ranging debate, and it’s better to start early – and certainly not prohibit it at universities. Innovation is a departure from customary ways of thinking and of doing things. Its execution is a matter of trial and error. But how do you recognize that you should go ahead with an idea and when to stop digging a deeper hole? This is best decided through debate on the merits of an idea as trials continue and debates with suppliers and potential suppliers about funding. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Asian countries can learn from repeated mistakes made by Canadian governments and institutions: drastically cutting the number of diverse sources of capital within Canada and with ill-conceived tax policies (capital gains taxes and high income taxes in particular), that reduce incentives to invest in Canadian startups. Avoid these mistakes and the countries will thrive. By taxing incomes heavily, Canadian governments helped lower the experimentation necessary for startups. High taxes prevent people from accumulating enough savings from discretionary income to become “angel investors” to whom budding entrepreneurs could turn for funding. The National Angel Capital Organization reported that in 2015 its members invested Cdn$134 million, whereas in the US the number was $24 billion. No government officials, research centers and certainly not academics can stand in for “business angels,” private investors with experience in corporate settings, as entrepreneurs, or both. Along with capital, they offer the advantages of “smart money.” They are capable of vetting and improving ideas and plans entrepreneurs put forward. They evaluate the entrepreneurs: Do they listen to advice? How disciplined and determined are they? Can they delegate so that the business can grow?When “angels” take an interest in entrepreneurs, they bring their networks of contacts as well as their managerial, operating, and mentoring experience to the table on a daily basis — something bureaucrats and the vast majority of academics do not have. Canada’s misguided tax policies prevent the emergence of a critical mass of “angels,” preventing the diverse sources of capital for startups. This doesn’t necessarily mean that brilliant young Canadian won’t become entrepreneurs. It only means they will likely move to the United States to realize their dreams. And with fewer startups and diminished financial incentives there are fewer opportunities to use venture capital and expand. Indeed, total VC investment in Canada in 2016 was $1.7 billion, the same as 2015. To put VC numbers in context: Israel, with roughly the same population as Quebec (just over eight million), saw VCs invest $4.43 billion in startups in 2015. Taxes, regulations and Canadian federal and provincial governments’ misunderstanding of the “democratization of capital” and what roles governments could — and should — play are part of the problem. The other part is the shallow debate in the Canadian educational system — universities in particular — a consequence of decades of throwing money at schools and universities while these institutions were giving up on proper selection of students and, in universities, faculty as well. Jonathan Medved, one of Israel’s main VC investors in high-tech, noted that in his meetings in “India, China, [and] Japan, Israel is a top brand — BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israeli handling of the Palestinian dispute) is important on college campuses, NGOs and some part of the church, but not in business … I was sitting with one of [the] top US hedge-fund managers and I asked him about BDS. His response? “Anyone with a brain cannot support BDS. If you do: get off Google, Facebook, your laptop, anything with an Intel chip.” Intel, Cisco, Apple, Facebook, Google, Paypal and Microsoft operations in Israel are major contributors to their companies’ product lines. The dean of the faculty I am associated with recently told faculty members they “are free to criticize the university and publish your articles in any media outlet as you see fit. I am also free not to publicize it.” It appears that while business-school faculty is encouraged to do critical analyses of Wall Street, Main Street, the rest of academia (and this particular dean) are happy to publicize them. But this dean will not publicize research critical of universities — not something you would expect from the dean of a business school in a commercial society. Her statements stand in sharp contrast to a former principal of McGill University, David Johnston, now governor-general of Canada, who is aware of the flaws in academia and universities concerning debates in particular. He has encouraged research on academic decline and has widely endorsed articles and debates on the subject both within and outside McGill. But that was 15 years ago. True, the current McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, issued a memorandum on Thursday emphasizing that disciplined debate is “the foundational principle of McGill University, as enunciated in our …statement of academic freedom.” The statement declares that: “The scholarly members of the university have the freedom to pursue research and artistic creation and to disseminate their results, without being constrained by political or disciplinary orthodoxies, monetary incentives or punitive measures as a result of their academic pursuits. They may exercise this freedom in the service of both the university and the wider society.” But as her own communication attests, the faculty dean appears never to have read or thought about the stated principle as it applies to business education in particular. What do “foundational principles” imply? And if those principles are flouted what will Fortier and the McGill board of governors do? Doing nothing or mouthing platitudes signals a further decline in much-needed debates, with repercussions far beyond already weakened universities.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 March 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life.

DeepScale raises $3 million for perception AI to make self-driving cars safe Posted Mar 21, 2017 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Pit.ai puts a financial twist on reinforcement learning to outperform hedge funds According to the World Health Organization, human error causes more than 90 percent of traffic accidents across the globe. Some 1.25 million people die in crashes, and 20 to 50 million people are injured each year. Automakers are scrambling to develop cars with advanced driver-assistance systems that are so good they’re “crash-proof,” or fully autonomous vehicles, each safer than the next. But the automakers are somewhat limited by the computational resources onboard their vehicles. Now, a startup out of Mountain View, Calif. called DeepScale has raised $3 million in seed funding to help automakers use industry-standard low-wattage processors to power more accurate perception. Alongside sensors, mapping, planning and control systems, perception, (sometimes referenced as “computer vision”) enables vehicles to make sense of what’s going on around them in real time. DeepScale co-founder and CEO Forrest Iandola previously attained a doctorate at UC Berkeley working on deep neural nets and computer vision systems. His work there focused on, among other things, making AI systems learn to do something new in just a day instead of months of training. Iandola said, “Lots of deep neural network software out there is tied to processors like Nvidia’s. They make really good libraries for running neural net stuff quickly. We built our own libraries for fast, deep neural net computation on a variety of affordable processors, Qualcomm, Intel and the like. We’re using a lot of what we learned in academia on the commercial side now.” While he did not have permission to name the companies, he said DeepScale is already working on pilot projects with some major original equipment manufacturers in automotive. With the market for automotive systems, data and services forecast to reach $70 billion in revenue annually by 2030, DeepScale is focused strictly on automotive for now. But, the CEO said, the technology could be adapted over the long term for use with unmanned drones or robotics, which also need to accurately understand and respond to changes in their environment. DeepScale’s seed investors included: Bessemer Venture Partners, Greylock, Auto Tech Ventures, Andy Bechtolsheim (who was the first investor in Google) and Jerry Yang. A partner with BVP, Alex Ferrara, said, “Cars are moving from systems today where they have a large number of small computers, called ECUs, in them, to working with smaller more powerful computers for perception. But you have all these little sensors, lidar, radar, ultrasound, and each one brings its own view of the world. There’s a really interesting opportunity here for DeepScale to pull everything together and use info from all those sensors to make computer vision accurate and efficient.” DeepScale is competing for a share of this burgeoning market versus some 800-lb. gorillas in automotive tech, like Mobileye, now owned by Intel, or Bosch, but also other funded startups like Comma.ai, Argo and Drive.ai, which are trying another approach of building their own, fully autonomous vehicles or retrofit systems.

This week, former Trump advisers Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and Carter Page all informed the committee of their desires to testify to the committee. All three have been identified in news reports as subjects of an FBI investigation of potential Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government. In testimony to the committee earlier this week, FBI director James Comey confirmed an ongoing investigation but did not name the Trump associates who are targeted in the probe. The trio deny colluding with the Kremlin, but news reports have showed a variety of connections between the aides and people who work for the Russian government. Manafort, Trump’s campaign chairman, has worked as a consultant for a former Ukrainian president allied with Vladimir Putin. Page, who served as a junior policy adviser on the campaign, has business interests in Russia and gave a speech at a Moscow university in July, while he was still with the campaign. Both are named in a dossier compiled by a retired British spy alleging coordination between the campaign and Russian government operatives. The dossier is largely uncorroborated and several inconsistencies in the document have been discovered. Nevertheless, Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, including the ranking Democrat, California Rep. Adam Schiff, cited it as fact during Monday’s hearing. Paul Manafort, August 17, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri Stone has claimed that he communicated through an intermediary with WikiLeaks, the group that released Democrats’ emails during the campaign. U.S. government officials believe that the emails were hacked by the Russian government. But the advisers appear eager to explain what they claim is a massive witch hunt. In a letter to the Intelligence Committee shared exclusively with The Daily Caller, Page said he “would eagerly welcome the chance to speak with the Committee” in order to “set the record straight” regarding allegations made against him. Manafort reached out to the Intelligence Committee through his attorneys on Thursday, chairman Devin Nunes announced on Friday. (RELATED: Trump Campaign Advisers Offer To Testify To House Intel Committee) Stone released an open letter to reporters earlier this week saying that he is eager to talk to Congress. “I am anxious to rebut allegations that I had any improper or nefarious contact with any agent of the Russia State based on facts, not misleading and salacious headlines,” wrote Stone, who is a longtime friend of both Trump and Manafort and who was an informal adviser during much of the campaign. (RELATED: Trump Adviser Roger Stone Wants To Testify To Congress And ‘Spank’ Democrats ‘Like Children) Contrast that with Clinton aides who resisted cooperating with Congress and federal investigators looking into the potential mishandling of classified information on Clinton’s server. Bryan Pagliano, the Clinton State Department staffer who set up the secret email server, infamously ignored a subpoena from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to appear at a hearing in September. Former State Department staffer Bryan Pagliano arrives for a closed hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington Sept. 10, 2015. (REUTERS/Gary Cameron) Pagliano also invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in response to several other congressional requests to testify. He pled the Fifth during a Sept. 10, 2015 meeting with the House Select Committee on Benghazi. He only spoke to the FBI after receiving limited immunity from prosecution in the case. Paul Combetta was another person on Clinton’s payroll who refused to talk to Congress. Combetta worked for Platte River Networks, the IT company that managed Clinton’s server after she left the State Department.

But the pair refused to talk to the State Department’s inspector general ahead of a report it issued on Clinton’s server in May. They also may have given inconsistent statements to the FBI about when they became aware that Clinton was using a private email server to store her work related emails.

Woolsey told the Wall Street Journal he attended a meeting between Flynn and top Turkish government ministers in 2016 where they discussed ideas to send Fethullah Gulen from the U.S. back to Turkey without following the extradition process. The Turkish government accuses Gulen, Muslim cleric, to have been behind a failed coup to overthrow Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Woolsey said he entered the meeting in New York on September 19 after Flynn and the Turkish ministers had already begun the conversation, which he said did not include any actual tactics to remove Gulen from his home in the United States. "What I saw and heard was sort of the end of the conversation -- it's not entirely clear what transpired because of that," he told CNN. "But it looks as if there was at least some strong suggestion by one or more of the Americans present at the meeting that we would be able, the United States would be able, through them, to be able to get hold of Gulen, the rival for Turkey's political situation." He said the group discussed the idea of "a covert step in the dead of night to whisk this guy away." Woolsey added that if specific plans were mentioned he would have spoken up and questioned their legality. "It seemed to be naive," he said. "I didn't put a lot of credibility in it. This is a country of legal process and a Constitution, and you don't send out folks to haul somebody overseas." Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, released a statement saying Woolsey's description of the meeting was false. "The claim made by Mr. Woolsey that General Flynn, or anyone else in attendance, discussed physical removal of Mr. Gulen from the United States during a meeting with Turkish officials in New York is false," the statement said. "No such discussion occurred. Nor did Mr. Woolsey ever inform General Flynn that he had any concerns whatsoever regarding the meeting, either before he chose to attend, or afterwards." Woolsey described the meeting as "suspicious" and "concerning," although he said he didn't hear enough of what was said before he arrived to make any definitive statements. "The reason I'm being cautious about how this was worded is because I wasn't there for much of this meeting," he said. "I felt I needed to say something to somebody, but was it a clear plot that they were going to seize him? No." Woolsey said he attended the meeting at the urging of Bijan Kian, chairman and president of Flynn's consulting firm the Flynn Intel Group. He had agreed to be on the group's advisory board and was offered a consulting fee, but turned it down based on the discussion he heard in the meeting. On March 2, the Flynn Intel Group filed with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the government of Turkey. The Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 from Inovo BV, a firm in the Netherlands owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin.
