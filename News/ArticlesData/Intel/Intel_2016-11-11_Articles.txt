In unanimous regard, the Surface Book is poised as an impressive and powerful device with a stellar battery life, but is it too expensive?  ( Microsoft ) Advertisement A year ago Microsoft unveiled its first laptop, carrying the naming scheme of its Surface tablets released previously. Upon release, many reviewers were impressed by the Surface Book, earning it glowing platitudes across publications. Now, Microsoft has released a second iteration of the Surface Book, bearing much of the same vaunted pleasantries the last year model offered: a better-than-average battery life, a svelte and premium design, a detachable display that enables tablet mode and a hinge that lets you fold the laptop all the way back, like the Lenovo Yoga Book. The biggest changes in the new refresh are mostly its increased power capacity by up to 30 percent, resting under the chassis, updated processors and under-the-hood improvements. Besides that, it's the same Surface Book released last year. Reviews have started filtering in for Microsoft's two-in-one hybrid laptop and here is a congested list of what they think about the powerful but pricier offering that directly rivals Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro. The Same Surface Book, But Slightly More Powerful The new Surface Book houses a Skylake chip, Intel's powerful sixth-generation processors. a Surface Book model called Performance Base which comes with an Intel Core i7 chip, up to 16 GB of RAM, Intel Graphics 520 and a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics card. "As you'd expect, the benchmark scores are very, very good," wrote Engadget's Dana Wollman, speaking of the laptop's performance. The Surface Book surpassed the HP Spectre x360, Asus ZenBook 3, Dell XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth and the HP Spectre 13 on standard benchmarking tests such as PCMark 7, PCMark 8, 3DMark 11 and Atto for disk reading and writing. Despite its sixth-generation Intel processors, the Surface Book remains outfitted with a dual-core chip, which is a disappointing drawback considering its steep price point. "The new Surface Book has faster performance, better multitasking, better battery performance: enough to make a difference, but not necessarily enough to eclipse the competition," CNET's Scott Stein opined, adding that the power of the Surface Book still isn't up to the task of virtual reality rigs such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, despite its separate graphics card. The Surface Book Battery Life A video playback of 16 hours seems like a bold promise but in Wollman's review and test run, the Surface Book was able to last 16 hours and 15 minutes playing a looped video with the screen's brightness set at 65 percent. "[T]here's barely anything else like [the Surface Book's battery life] on the market," she said. Many companies are guilty of claiming a battery capacity a few notches higher than its real-world performance but the Surface Book seems to stack up pretty well in that regard. PCWorld's Gordon Mah Ung mirrored the praise, heavily impressed by the Surface Book's battery life. "[I]t has stupidly long battery life that bests all the laptops we've tested," he wrote. It's important to note that users will only get the promised battery life when the display is attached to the base, since the battery is housed in the Surface Book's chassis. When detached, tablet mode can only last up to four hours, as proven in the same video playback test done by Engadget. Is The Surface Book i7 Too Expensive? "If you've been hoping for a Surface Book 2, this is not the machine you've been waiting for," wrote The Verge's Dan Seifert, as a preface note-ender to his Surface Book review. The Surface Book boasts an impressive performance that's better than the version that came before it, a battery life currently unbeatable by other laptops offering the same configurations and a beautiful, all-metal premium form that doubles as a tablet. These are all impressive and admirable for Microsoft except for the price. To get the new Surface Book models, expect to shell out a starting price of $2,399 which nets you a Core i7 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB SSD. For an even break-banking $2,799, you'll get double the RAM and internal storage. A full terabyte option is also available at a whopping price point of $3,299. Overall, there's a unanimous regard for the Surface Book as a formidable two-in-one hybrid that packs a beefy performance and a stellar, lasts-as-promised battery life. It is heralded by Microsoft as the "ultimate laptop," and the reviewers proves that it deserves this moniker. While these things might be true, the Surface Book is a very expensive laptop, especially considering that other potential customers are more likely to opt for similarly priced laptops that have more powerful configurations at a less expensive price. So unless you're willing to throw around $3,000 for the best Surface Book model, you're better off trying to look for something else that fits your budget.

By Feliciano Rodriguez III Posted on November 12, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Get ready for another Macbook Pro 2016 alternative. This time we do a smackdown between age old rivals Apple and Microsoft. In this article, we’ll compare the new and much criticized 13-inch Macbook Pro with the Surface Book. Both of the laptops are targeted at the professional users. How will they compare with each other? Which of them is the more Pro laptop? Let’s find out.

Again, comparing the new 13-inch Macbook to its Windows competitors expose the glaring outdatedness of its 6th Generation Skylake processors. Tech commentators and Apple fans can’t comprehend why Apple chose to use a one generation old processor for its 2016 Macbook Pros. The Surface Book’s 6th Generation Skylake processor is still quick and battery efficient, even one year after its release. The Surface Book can still duke it out against newer Windows laptops like the updated Dell XPS 13, which now has the newer Intel Kaby Lake processors. Both Laptops feature a generous 8GB RAM and both have gorgeous high definition displays. Check out Microsoft’s official website for a more in-depth look the Surface Book. The Surface Book has more input output options though, compared to the Macbook Pros paltry two USB type C ports. Both laptops weigh in at around 1.4kgs, and both have great build quality. The Macbook Pro has Apple’s trademark aluminum unibody design and the Surface Book is made of two magnesium blocks. The two devices look and feel premium. The Surface Book is about $200 more expensive than the base 13-inch Macbook Pro, however, the Surface Book has a touchscreen display, and is compatible with Microsoft’s excellent proprietary Surface Pen. The Surface Book also has a unique hinge wherein the display can disconnect, transforming the Surface Book into a stand alone full tablet. The Macbook Pro cannot trump this unique feature; It doesn’t even have touch screen. Conclusion If you are fully committed or invested in the macOS ecosystem, then you have no choice but to buy the new 13-inch Macbook Pro, or wait for its more advanced brothers with the much touted OLED Touch Bars. However, if you want a unique laptop with great specs, that also transforms into a tablet, then you can’t go wrong with Microsoft’s Surface Book laptop.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 12, 2016 at 8:05AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been immensely successful in the market for chips that power major data centers. It has managed to protect its nearly total dominance of the enterprise and cloud server processor markets while growing its share in areas such as networking, storage, and high-performance computing accelerators. Intel data-center chief Diane Bryant at the company's annual developer forum. Image source: Intel.  Further, with its purchase of Altera last year, Intel further broadened its portfolio of data-center technologies to include FPGAs. Such chips are increasingly being used to accelerate certain data-center workloads; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), for example, uses them to accelerate Bing searches. Intel has built a phenomenal portfolio of technologies to support its excellent processors in the data center. However, there is a risk to this business looming on the horizon that the company needs to be ready to respond to with a relatively early launch of server processors built on its 10-nanometer technology. The competition is moving to foundry 7-nanometer tech Intel's main rival in logic chip manufacturing is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). TSMC's executives have been very vocal about how makers of "high-performance computing" chips are adopting its upcoming 7-nanometer technology. The use cases that TSMC cites here are  "GPU, gaming, PC and tablet, virtual reality, server, FPGA, automotive, and networking applications." TSMC also says these customers "all have aggressive product tape-out plans, starting from [the] early second quarter" of 2017. Based on this, it would be reasonable to expect that at least one of Intel's server processor competitors will bring a product to market manufactured in TSMC's 7-nanometer technology by the end of 2018. Intel's 10-nanometer should be comparable to TSMC 7-nanometer In terms of chip area, I expect Intel's 10-nanometer technology to offer roughly the same density as TSMC's 7-nanometer technology, based on public statements from both companies. Density is important in the server market, since denser manufacturing technologies allow chipmakers to cram more cores and features into a given chip than would have been possible on a coarser technology. The power efficiency benefits that come in moving from one technology to a newer one also help, as power efficiency is a key consideration for server chip buyers. This means that to ensure it doesn't fall behind in terms of server and data-center chip manufacturing technology, and thus product competitiveness, Intel is going to need to get server processors based on its 10-nanometer technology out into the marketplace as quickly as possible. Intel's second-generation 14-nanometer server processor families, known as Skylake-EP/EN/EX, are expected to arrive in the first half of 2017. DigiTimes recently claimed they'll arrive in the first quarter. Ideally, Intel should release Cannon Lake-EP/EN/EX, the 10-nanometer follow-on products to those processors, about a year later, in the first quarter of 2018. Such a timeline would very ne aggressive, though, in light of the time it took Intel to transition from one manufacturing technology to the next over the past few generations.  Process Tech 32-Nanometer 22-Nanometer 14-Nanometer First Intel server product release Q1 2010 Q3 2013 Q1 2016 Source: Intel. It took Intel three and a half years to move its server processor lineup from its 32-nanometer technology to its 22-nanometer technology. It then took the company two and a half years to move that lineup from its 22-nanometer technology to its 14-nanometer technology. History would suggest that it'll be sometime between the third quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2019 before Intel will begin fielding its first server processors built on its 10-nanometer technology. A third-quarter 10-nanometer server chip release, though less than ideal, wouldn't be the end of the world for Intel, but any later would just be plain risky. Ideally, though, Intel ought to get its 10-nanometer server processor lineup out comfortably in the first half of 2018. What will affect the timing of Intel's 10-nanometer server chip release? Two major factors could affect Intel's 10-nanometer server processor launch timing. First is simply product readiness. The chip designs need to be finished soon to support product sampling in the second half of 2017 and product launch in the first half of 2018. If Intel's development teams just don't get the chip design done in time, then the schedule must be pushed out. Even if the design is ready in time for an early 2018 launch, another factor that could influence launch timing will be the health of the 10-nanometer manufacturing process the chips will be built on. Intel's execution with its 14-nanometer process technology was poor, and the schedule for first 10-nanometer product production has already been pushed from late 2015 to the second half of 2017. If 10-nanometer yields aren't in good shape by the end of 2017, then even with the design ready, Intel will face a difficult choice: Does it ramp up the 10-nanometer server parts and suffer from a suboptimal cost structure, or does it hold off on releasing the new parts until the 10-nanometer technology improves? If Intel's competitors are as aggressive in trying to bring products built in TSMC's 7-nanometer to this market as TSMC claims, then taking a cost structure hit to maintain product performance and power leadership would be preferable to risking the loss of significant market share and average selling price erosion.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Details About Its Specs and Features as Well As the Surface Book i7, And More! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 13, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» It’s been quite some time since tech enthusiasts have heard any news about the much-gossiped Microsoft Surface Book 2. The Microsoft Surface Book 2, has been overshadowed by another product of the Microsoft family, the Microsoft Surface i7. The newly launched Microsoft 2-in-1 laptop is indeed worthy of all the adoration it is getting. Given, its unrivaled performance specs and power, lead many skeptics to believe that the Microsoft Surface i7 is, in fact, Microsoft Surface Book 2. Here’s what we know till now, the new Microsoft Surface i7 newly launched in the Microsoft October event, to the pleasure of several laptop fans. The highlight of the device was its dual-core Intel Core i7-6600U chip, consisting of a custom NVidia GeForce GPU. It also came boasting a 1GB GDDR5 memory, according to PCWorld. It’s hyped as the “crème de lacrème,” and is manufactured by giants like Microsoft and Intel themselves. Leading many people to believe that it might be the Microsoft Surface Book 2 they have all been waiting for. Previously, people thought that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 would sport the upcoming Intel Kaby Lake processors plus, the Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. According to TechRadar, it is also believed to support 4K video and architecture. On the wish list of major upgrades and changes, what Microsoft fans wanted, was to see longer battery life of Microsoft Surface Book 2. This is because the laptop allegedly drains only after use of 4 hours. While the Surface i7 has a battery life of 16 hours reportedly. Another wish list for the Microsoft Surface Book 2 was a development on its prominent feature: the hinge, as it was susceptible to accumulate dust and receptacles. Fans wanted a separable screen, or, at the very slightest, a hinge that is functional. Although we know that expecting the Surface Book 2 to come out this year would be mere wishful thinking. However, we can certainly hope that in the coming year it will be launched alongside the also much awaited Microsoft Surface Pro 5. According to rumors The Redmond-based tech Goliath was expected to the seventh-generation of Intel processor, the Kaby Lake in this new model of the successful notebook. It will be a complete blessing for the Surface Book 2, the Kaby. It will make the use of USB 3.1 Type-C and provide Thunderbolt 3 support. The first should enable faster and more effective data transmission and battery charging. While the latter is labeled the fastest, most adaptable connection to any dock, display, or peripheral device, which ought to offer smooth connectivity and performance on the Microsoft Surface Book 2. The latest processor from Intel, toincreaseKaby Lake will also be manufactured on a 14-nanometer technology, it is to increase the performance of the chips by 12 percent about the Skylake, which is the among the initial Microsoft Surface Book and the i7 variety exhibited last month. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is also likely to have a much better display, and this will also be to the credit of the Kaby Lake because it will enhance the performance of the graphics. According to TechRadar, as far as the design is concerned, on the front Microsoft has to think of a way of detaching the display from the software-based keyboard, a less complicated job. They have to do it in such a way so that it could be done even when the device is off.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 11, 2016 at 9:22PM Over on Seeking Alpha, contributor Black Coral Research recently argued that were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to transition away from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) processors in its Mac line of computers, contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) would be a big winner. Apple MacBook Pro computers. Image source: Apple.  "TSMC is benefiting from the halo effect of solid iPhone 7 sales, but its real potential is when Apple decides to design its own silicon for its Mac," the contributor writes. "We estimate that TSMC could generate $5.5 billion in annual revenues from such a venture, leading to 20% revenue and earnings growth." This analysis doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Here's why. The current Mac supplier doesn't even generate that much The biggest problem with this analysis is that it assumes that TSMC will be able to charge Apple a whopping $300 per chip for Apple-designed Mac processors. This is absurd, because this would imply that TSMC would make significantly more from building each Apple-designed Mac processor than current Mac processor provider Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) makes on average from the chips it sells Apple. A quick way to "prove" this assertion is as follows: Apple ships roughly 20 million Mac computers each year, give or take a few million. If Intel sold processors to Apple at an average of $300 apiece, then Intel would generate roughly $6 billion per year in revenue from Apple. Per Intel's form 10-K filings for 2013, 2014, and 2015, Apple wasn't responsible for at least 10% of Intel's revenues in those years. In those years, Intel's revenue was solidly south of $60 billion, so we know that Apple pays much less than $300 for Intel processors on average. Further, even if Intel did take in that much per chip from Apple, Apple's per-unit costs would be lower for Apple-designed chips manufactured by a third party, since the third party isn't getting paid for the chip design. The iPhone opportunity is much larger than the Mac opportunity The Seeking Alpha post suggests that TSMC would have a bigger opportunity to profit from Apple's building an in-house Mac processor than it does from having a monopoly on the iPhone 7 A-series processor business -- as well as the A8, A8X, and A9X chips that currently power the iPad. That doesn't make sense. In Apple's last fiscal year, it shipped nearly 212 million iPhones and 45.59 million iPads. It shipped just 18.484 million Macs in that period. In terms of chip area, and therefore chip dollar content to TSMC, an Intel processor isn't much larger than a high-end iPhone or iPad processor. The A10 Fusion measures in at 125 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer process; the A9X comes in at 147 square millimeters. These are already large, high-silicon and thus high-dollar content chips to TSMC. Even if we assume Intel's average content across Apple's Mac lineup is twice that found in an iPad processor, TSMC's winning the Apple business over from Intel would amount to the addition of roughly 36 million iPad processors' worth of revenue. In TSMC's 2015 form 10-F filing, the company said its two largest customers, one of which is almost certainly Apple, each made up 16% of its total revenue in 2015. That means TSMC's Apple-related revenue in 2015 -- consisting of A8, A8X, and some A9 chip sales -- was around $4.12 billion. It's unlikely that approximately 18 million Mac processors could generate anywhere close to the kind of revenue for TSMC as all those other chips do combined. Indeed, even if TSMC can capture around $50 per chip for a potential Apple-designed Mac processor -- which is probably too high of an estimate -- then this would amount to annual revenue of less than $1 billion per year for TSMC. As TSMC's annual revenue approaches $30 billion, even $1 billion in incremental revenue would be good for only around 3.33% growth. That'd be good business, but hardly a game changer for the chipmaker. Indeed, capturing 100% of the A10 Fusion chip orders for the iPhone 7-series phones, up from a reportedly minority allocation for the A9 processors in the iPhone 6s-series phones, was probably a bigger deal to TSMC than a potential Mac win ever could be.

Corrales Comment News Reporting as if Democracy Matters Home Welcome to Corrales Comment Publication Dates Subscribe CC Advertise! Ad Rates Archived Articles CALENDAR COP21 Reporting From Paris ALS Cluster: Is There One In or Around Corrales? Details Published: 11 November 2016 An effort is under way through the N.M. Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau to determine whether a cluster of Lou Gehrig’s disease exists in or around Corrales. Over the past decade, concerns have been raised about the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) here which some villagers thought might be linked to chemical exposures from Intel’s microchip factories nearby. (See Corrales Comment Vol. XXIX No.23 January 22, 2011 “Five Cases of Lou Gehrig’s Disease Reported Here.”) A Corrales resident who meets monthly with Intel’s Community Environmental Working Group, Dennis O’Mara, said September 29 that data will be collected for cases of ALS in 12 census tracts around Intel; two for Corrales, six for Rio Rancho and four for Albuquerque, encompassing a total population of around 54,000. Residents are asked to self-report if they or a family member were diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease between 2000 and 2015.  The N.M. Health Department’s Heidi Krapfl should be contacted by phone at 505-476-3577 or by email at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . The person reporting should provide the patient’s first and last name, date of ALS diagnosis, the name of the primary care physician treating the patient and the name of the medical specialist seen for the condition. O’Mara said the effort officially began late last month. He hopes reporting will be able to identify the  ten cases that were reportedly found in Corrales and Rio Rancho about three years ago. “We will try to determine whether a cluster of ALS cass has occurred in the recent past in Corrales and the surrounding area,” he added.  He can be contacted at 899-0151 for questions. O’Mara reported at the August CEWG meeting that he had met August 2 with four people at the N.M. Department of Health about the proposed ALS study. He said he had invited them to attend a CEWG meeting, but that they had declined, saying there would be nothing to discuss until the study was completed. No time frame was given. In 2011, Kerrie Copelin, executive director of the  ALS Association’s New Mexico chapter, confirmed that five ALS patients living in Corrales had registered with her organization. She said that was an unusually high incidence  of the fatal disease which attacks nerve cells controlling voluntary muscles. On average, one would expect to find just two cases of ALS amid a population of 100,000, Copelin explained. Corrales has approximately 10,000 residents. She noted Rio Rancho’s entire population included five cases, and only 47 were identified throughout New Mexico at that time. Causes are unknown, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. “The cause of ALS is not known, and scientists do not yet know why ALS strikes some people and not others,” the institute’s website notes. “In searching for the cause of ALS, researchers have also studied environmental factors such as exposure to toxic or infectious agents. Other research has examined the possible role of dietary deficiency or trauma. However, as of yet, there is insufficient evidence to implicate these factors as causes of ALS.” The institute points out that while men are more often afflicted, “in 90 to 95  percent of all ALS cases, the disease occurs apparently at random with no clearly associated risk factors.” The federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a sister-agency for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, started a national ALS Registry in October 2010. The registry can be reached by calling 1-800-782-4747. Copelin said no new cases had been reported to her office since a Corrales Comment letter to the editor was published in December 2010 urging readers to contact the local chapter if they were aware of other ALS cases here. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXIX, No. 20, December 4, 2010.) The letter writer, Jen Northup, whose mother had ALS, said she was startled to learn that a near-neighbor also had the disease. While attending an ALS support group meeting in Albuquerque in 2010, Northup said she learned from Copelin that Corrales had an unusually high incidence of the disorder. Since then Northup has gathered data on the location of residents with ALS while respecting medical confidentiality. At Corrales Comment’s urging, she contacted the chief of the N.M. Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau, Heidi Krapfl, to submit the data she had gathered. Northup reported in January 2011 that Krapfl was not interested in receiving the information, nor the map showing residential locations of ALS patients. Northup said Krapfl told her the information was not useful, that any investigation would be based on fatalities, not current cases. When Corrales Comment contacted Krapfl in 2010 with an offer to forward Northup’s data, the epidemiologist was not interested in receiving the information. According to the ALS Association, initial symptoms of the disease are muscle weakness in hands, arms, legs or muscles of speech, swallowing or breathing; twitching and cramping of muscles in feet and hands; and “thick speech” and difficulty in projecting voice. In later stages there is shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing and breathing. “Since ALS attacks only motor neurons, the sense of sight, touch, hearing, taste and smell are not affected,” the chapter’s literature notes. The National ALS Association notes that “From time to time, the association is notified of a number of ALS pateints from the same community or work environment that may be  higher than the expected number of cases. “Where there is a question of a higher than expected number of people with ALS in a geographic or occupational area, the association recommends that people raise their questions of an increased incidences of ALS to one or more of the following: local, community and state public health agencies, community and academic medical center neuromuscular neurologists, epidemiologists….” O’Mara explained September 29, “This is exactly what we have done,” although the results will not determine what the cause of the higher incidence of ALS might be.   At the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) presentation in the Old Church September 2, 2015 on possible health problems related to  Intel’s air pollution, Northup recounted her own story. Northup offered sorrowful testimony to ATSDR’s lead investigator, Peter Kowalski, who gave the agency’s final community health consultation report that evening. “My mother died of ALS about three months after my next door neighbor died of ALS,” Northup said at the presentation that drew about 80 people. She contacted the ALS Association of New Mexico for information and was told “we have a high concentration.” Northup later learned of a third ALS patient within a quarter-mile of her home. She contacted the N.M. Department of Health about her concerns, but “the lady there treated me like I was from another planet.” Feeling she was being ignored, Northup was surprised when a television news reporter in Oregon called her about the Corrales ALS cases. “They were very interested in what I had found, so I sent them my map that shows a correlation between ALS and Intel. They are continuing their investigation” of a high concentration of ALS near Intel facilities in Oregon. Directing her comment to Kowalski, Northup noted, “It is strange to me that everything I tried to do was basically ignored by people such as yourself. That’s all I’ve got to say, except —you know what? I think I have it, too. I can’t raise my toes. Why can’t I raise my toes?” Kowalski promised to relay her story to other ATSDR investigators in Atlanta. He reported that research by the sister-agency National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates the naturally occurring prevalence of ALS is an average of four cases per 100,000 population at any given time. A former Intel engineer who went public back in 2004 with his concerns about the microchip facilities’ effects on nearby residents, Chris Grotbeck, responded to Northup’s remarks by noting, “Just doing a quick calculation in my head, if four per 100,000 is the national average for ALS at any given time, a community of 8,000 people like Corrales should have less than one-third of one case at any one time. “Yet this woman reports three cases of ALS within a quarter-mile of her house. That has to trigger some sort of investigation, I would think.” Detailed news reports from communities near Intel facilities in Oregon have  linked ALS to microchip manufacturing chemicals. In 2015,Portland television station KATU reported an elevated rate of ALS among Intel workers and nearby residents. ATSDR officials were asked to investigate; they responded that, without multi-year data, “ATSDR cannot determine whether any occurrence of ALS is higher than what would be expected.” Corrales Comment contacted the Albuquerque office of the ALS Association September 10, 2015 for data on the prevalence of ALS in Corrales. A spokesperson said her database showed two ALS cases in zip code 87048, and one of those already had been diagnosed with the illness before moving here. In Rio Rancho zip code 87124 around the Intel plant, one ALS patient was registered with the association; one more was in the 87114 zip code. The same data base revealed that the 87048 zip code area had six cases a few years ago, “but they have all passed away now.” Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

(Photo: Intel) Carmen Shugert is a trained civil engineer; but a few years ago she took on the challenge of teaching engineering classes to high school students. Since 2013, this labor of love has evolved into a small but mighty engineering program at Chandler High School that now includes an introductory engineering course, a principles of engineering offering and a digital electronics class. One element, however, still remains a constant in the engineering world where Shugert worked and now the academic environment where she teaches. When she looks out at the audience of fresh faces each fall, girls are still very much underrepresented. “When I was at the university, my class, when I graduated, was only 10 percent women,” she said. “We still haven’t tapped the talent of the other half of the population.” Shugert is now working to change that, not only by reaching out to girls at the high school level, but also junior high schoolers as well. With the help of an Intel Foundation grant, Shugert recently created the “Girls in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics)” program, which, in October, hosted 32 junior high girls for a week-long robotics camp. “Last year, Intel set an ambitious goal to reach full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce by 2020. We committed $300 million in support of this goal and to accelerate diversity and inclusion more broadly—not just at Intel, but across the technology industry at large. We knew supporting something like this was another step in the right direction,” said Intel Arizona’s Director of Public Affairs Carlos Contreras. So far, it appears Shugert’s efforts have made an impact. “I wanted to do something to break the mindset that engineering is hard and boring,” she said. “My goal was to have the students leave the camp and say ‘hey, this was fun.’ … I think it worked. I’m getting emails from parents saying they want their daughters to come back.” Capturing their attention With the help of Chandler Unified School District (CUSD) Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education, Craig Gilbert, and others, Shugert was able to land a $39,000 Intel Foundation Grant that funded both fall and spring robotics camps. “We always have conversations within the district about how we can improve what we’re doing and how we can introduce different programs, especially engineering, math and science to underrepresented populations,” Gilbert said. At the camp, the girls worked in teams to build Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots, then programmed them to perform unique tasks. The tasks became more complicated as the week went on, going from moving in a square or a figure eight, then through a maze, to then accomplishing tasks like going to the store and running errands. Students also programmed the robot’s arms to move and pick up items, Shugert explained. “I like to take students to the edge from the sense that they feel challenged, but then they know they can still do it,” she said. Genevieve Kelsey, a Willis Junior High eighth grader, appreciated the camp. In elementary school, she had been taught basic programming, but the camp allowed her to actually apply that knowledge to a real situation. “I never got to use it (programming) for anything like a robot. It costs about $300 for each one and you don’t have them at the schools. It was cool to learn something and actually apply it,” she said. Kelsey is currently considering a college dual major in both music and engineering. Shugert used six of her own high school engineering students as assistants for the camp. They also helped her choose the 32 participants. She and her assistants attended the junior high schools – Willis and Andersen - where they distributed flyers, posted the event on the school’s website and met with students. “Honestly, I really wanted to tap the girls who haven’t seen this before. … I wanted someone who had never thought of doing something like this,” Shugert said. What’s up next For the spring camp, Shugert is looking to possibly incorporate sensors to encourage more complex robot programming. The tasks will be even more challenging than what was expected in the fall camp. Both camps are examples of the strong and very necessary relationship CUSD has with Intel and other local tech companies. “In Chandler, our goal is access and opportunity for everyone,” Gilbert added. “We’re really fortunate to have partners like Intel. … just because, as a school district, there are always concerns about funds and resources to do things you believe are best and important for students. We are fortunate to have supporters in the community like Intel to help us bring these opportunities to students who otherwise may not be able to have them.” To learn more about how Intel supports community STEM initiatives, click here.

Lenovo's newest flagship convertible, the Yoga 910, is meant to be a stunner from the second you look at it. The company went all out in the design and specs of this laptop-hybrid, taking what it has already learned about making good convertibles and styling it up a bit with sleeker touches and high-end internals. Although it comes in a 1080p version, the Yoga 910 is Lenovo's premiere 4K hybrid, and it has paired that touchscreen with the newest Intel Kaby Lake processor. Thanks to those features and other improvements Lenovo has supposedly made, the Yoga 910 is a credible challenger to HP's new Spectre x360, Dell's XPS 13, and other flagship laptops. We spent some time with the Yoga 910 and found that many of its improvements are useful, but in some cases it falls short of its competitors. Look and feel Lenovo put the best features of its Yoga 900 into the 910, but the company updated the aesthetics. The Yoga 910 is an all-silver hybrid with brushed-metal accents that have a satin finish on the lid and keyboard deck, plus a shiny finish along all its edges. The hybrid tapers slightly from back to front when closed and only measures about 15mm thick at its widest point, keeping its profile thin and understated. Most noticeable in the design is Lenovo's signature "watchband" hinge that it uses on its Yoga family, which gives the 2-in-1 a professional yet unique look. When closed, the watchband hinge doesn't lie flat; instead it curls to a C-shape made of four grouped metal tubes. It has a smooth feel to it both when the lid is upright and closed, and the hinge also supports the display quite well. There's none of that occasional wobbliness experienced with the Lenovo ThinkPad X1, and it easily converts from open laptop to fold-over tablet with one swift movement. Specs at a glance: Lenovo Yoga 910 (as reviewed) Screen 13.9-inch 3840 x 2160 IPS touchscreen OS Windows 10 Home (64 bit) CPU Dual-core 2.7-GHz Intel Core i7 7500U RAM 16GB DDR4 2133 MHz GPU Intel HD Graphics 620 HDD 512GB PCIe SSD (upgradeable up to 1TB) Networking Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.1 Ports USB 3.0 Type-C (video-out), USB 2.0 Type-C (charging), USB 3.0 (always-on charging), audio combo jack Size 12.72" x 8.84" x 0.56" (323 x 224.5 x 14.3mm) Weight 3.04 pounds (48.6 ounces) Battery 78Wh Warranty one year Starting price $1,199.99 Price as reviewed $1,599.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, fingerprint sensor While the Yoga 910 has a size and weight similar to other 13-inch laptops, Lenovo shrank the bezels to 5mm so the 4K IPS display actually measures 13.9-inches (you can also get the display in an FHD version, too). It's easy to notice the extra sharpness of the 4K display as well as its bold colors, although its brightness is only OK. Even at 100 percent (268 nits), it doesn't feel as bright as other systems I've used, though this doesn't keep the display from being lovely to use. The 4K model also comes standard with 16GB of RAM (instead of the base 8GB) and 512GB of PCIe SSD storage (up from the base 256GB), and all of these features add $400 to the price of the machine. In this case, the price jump is justified because you're not just paying for the UHD display—but still, only power users or creative professionals will actually need those pumped up specs. The only real blemish on the Yoga 910 is the large chin underneath the display that measures nearly 1.25 inches. Having a big chin like this is common, especially since Lenovo wouldn't have had the space for a 720p webcam if it didn't leave some kind of bezel. However putting the webcam on the bottom bezel is a little awkward—hopefully your friends and family don't mind seeing up your nose when you Skype with them. That webcam will only be useful for chats like that, since the Yoga 910 settles for only a fingerprint sensor and forgoes a Windows Hello IR camera. Close to the watchband hinge on each side of the Yoga 910 are a handful of ports. The right side holds a USB 3.0 port, an audio jack combo port, and the device power button. On the left, there are two USB Type-C ports (one for charging and one for video-out), but neither supports Thunderbolt 3. This is disappointing, especially considering the new HP Spectre x360's port setup is nearly identical to that of the Yoga 910, but its two Type-C ports both support Thunderbolt 3. Keyboard and trackpad Lenovo put a spacious and generally comfortable keyboard on the Yoga 910. Key travel is easy to adjust to, typing is clicky and satisfying, and you can turn on the backlight to keep the keys illuminated in dark situations. There's just one issue I have with the keyboard: the right Shift key has been shrunk to fit the up-arrow key next to it. As a right-handed person who spends most of her day typing, this really got in my way on a regular basis. Every time I went to capitalize something, I ended up with my next sentence in the line above it. I tried to give up and use the full-sized left Shift key, but it just didn't suit my typing style. Begrudgingly, I kept using the tiny Shift key, and after typing a few hundred words, I started to get used to it. Near the less-than-full-size Shift key and below the keyboard is the fingerprint sensor, which you can use with Windows Hello to keep the Yoga 910 more private. As far as the trackpad goes, it's pretty basic: it's quick and responsive, and gestures like pinch-to-zoom work well. You have the option of lightly tapping to click (in which case, a two-finger tap would result in a left-click), or actually pressing the lower portions of the trackpad.

Software The Yoga 910 runs Windows 10 Home edition and supports biometric privacy features using its fingerprint sensor. When enabled, you can use your fingerprint to unlock the device rather than putting in a password. If you always forget your longwinded passwords, this will be a welcome feature that will speed up the process of getting into your system. This is another area where the Yoga 910 falls somewhat short of HP's Spectre x360, however. HP's convertible uses facial recognition with Windows Hello, allowing you to simply open the lid and have the webcam recognize your face to unlock the device. I would have liked to have the fingerprint and the webcam unlock options, but the placement of the Yoga 910's webcam at the bottom of the screen renders it useless for this. Lenovo doesn't bog down the Yoga 910 with a lot of bloatware, but it did include three of its own apps: Account Portal, Companion, and Settings. Account Portal uses your Lenovo ID to log you in to various Lenovo services, including forums, apps, and its store website. Unless you are a diehard Lenovo fan, you may not use this app that often. Companion and Settings, on the other hand, could come in handy more frequently. Companion teaches you tricks to using the Yoga 910 and gives you ways to optimize performance with the help of system checkups and hardware scanners. Settings is mostly a Lenovo-ified version of the regular Windows settings menu, allowing you to check battery status, change location awareness, and check connected peripherals like keyboards and mice. Also in Settings, you can adjust the two JBL speakers for specific tasks by activating different modes, including movie, music, gaming, and voice. If you're an audio stickler, you will be able to tell the differences between the modes. Mine was on music mode by default, and that seemingly elevates the volume for both voice and instrumentals. Movie mode makes sounds and instruments a bit subdued while emphasizing and projecting spoken word. Gaming is much like music mode in the sense that all audio was a bit louder, and sound effects were a bit more pronounced. Voice mode is the softest of all the modes and is probably only best for video chats.

Une mesure dispendieuse aux faibles retombées. 0 réactions Arnaud Montebourg, alors ministre du Redressement productif, au centre R&D d'Intel, à Sophia Antipolis, en juillet 2013. Pour les entreprises technologiques, ces centres sont une aubaine pour soigner leur popularité en France et cultiver leurs liens avec les pouvoirs publics.Bebert Bruno/Sipa 0 réactions Intel annonce la suppression de 80% de ses effectifs en France dans ses centres de recherche-développement (R&D) sur les sites de Sophia Antipolis, Toulouse, Aix-en-Provence et Nantes. La bombe a été lâchée en plein été. C’était le 20 juillet. Les négociations concernant le plan social doivent s’achever le 20 novembre. Mais on sait déjà que la France va payer un lourd tribut à la restructuration du géant des microprocesseurs lancée au printemps outre-Atlantique: près de 750 emplois, pour l’essentiel des chercheurs et ingénieurs, sont concernés. Le tout survient après l’inauguration en grande pompe, dans l’Essonne, d’un centre de R&D dédié au big data. L’américain avait alors concocté une jolie communication: «Pour Intel, le choix du lieu d’implantation pour ce nouveau laboratoire est inhérent à l’attractivité et à l’étendue des compétences de la technopole Teratec, ainsi qu’à l’environnement favorable en France en matière d’innovations technologiques ». C’était il y a… dix-huit mois. Opération de communication Intel n’est pas le seul. Depuis deux ans, plusieurs géants internationaux de la tech ont inauguré avec faste leurs locaux de R&D en France: Huawei, Samsung, Facebook, Salesforce… Tous louent l’excellence de la recherche française en mathématiques, algorithmes et intelligence artificielle, la forte concentration de grandes écoles, et donc de scientifiques et d’ingénieurs de premier plan. Mais derrière, cela ne suit pas toujours. Le nombre d’emplois créés reste bien souvent famélique: trente à Cisco, une quinzaine à Facebook, dix à Samsung. « Des laboratoires fantômes… », sourit un chercheur. A Facebook, par exemple, la partie recherche des immenses bureaux parisiens, dans un magnifique immeuble à deux pas de la Bourse, est bien déserte. A consulter les statistiques - en l’occurrence une note de Bercy datée d’octobre -, on observe un curieux french paradox. Le nombre de projets de R&D étrangers en France progresse: 40 en 2011, 51 en 2013, 72 en 2014, et 70 en 2015. Mais le nombre d’emplois correspondants stagne désespérément autour de 1.400 postes par an depuis 2012. Pourtant, les ambitions assignées aux centres de R&D français par les géants de la tech sont immenses. « Nous travaillons à construire un Internet plus puissant, connecter des milliards d’objets dans les prochaines années », explique, par exemple, Guillaume de Saint-Marc, directeur de l’innovation à Cisco Systems France. Pourquoi ces ouvertures opportunistes? Première raison, la communication. Chaque inauguration donne lieu à un raout, avec des journalistes, l’état-major du pays d’origine, et souvent un ministre. L’ex-locataire de Bercy, Emmanuel Macron, excellait dans cet exercice : « La France est de retour. Nous avons un avenir industriel », lançait-il avec les dirigeants de Samsung, en juin 2015. Pour ces entreprises technologiques, l’occasion est belle de soigner leur popularité en France et leurs liens avec les pouvoirs publics. Depuis juin 2015, le champion chinois Huawei, encore méconnu en France il y a cinq ans, a ouvert quatre centres de R&D tricolores, de quoi asseoir sa marque dans le pays. Deuxième raison: l’entrisme. « Ces laboratoires permettent de capter, à la manière de la CIA, tous les signaux des évolutions dans un pays: en termes de législation, de tendances émergentes ou de nouveaux usages », estime un chercheur de haut niveau. Pratique. « Avec ces entités, ils sont présents dans les projets de recherche européens », précise Pierre Bitard, responsable du club innovation et compétitivité de l’Association nationale recherche technologie (ANRT). Sensible sujet politique La troisième raison, celle qui fait souvent pencher pour de bon la balance en faveur de la France, c’est la… fiscalité. Depuis une trentaine d’années, la France est un pays privilégié par des groupes étrangers pour y implanter leur R&D à cause d’une pépite: le crédit d’impôt recherche (CIR). Comme son nom l’indique, c’est un crédit d’impôt: les entreprises ne touchent pas directement de l’argent à investir dans la recherche, mais c’est une somme qu’elles peuvent ensuite déduire de leurs impôts. Il peut être cumulé avec d’autres aides versées par les collectivités locales, ou encore le contrat Cifre qui finance des postes de doctorants. Ce CIR est un tel succès qu’il finit par représenter un manque à gagner important pour des finances publiques exsangues. En 2015, il pesait près de 6 milliards d’euros sur les 30 milliards de dépenses de R&D attribuées aux entreprises. Contre moins d’1 milliard en 2005! De fait, depuis sa réforme en 2008, les investissements étrangers en R&D ont été multipliés par 3,4. Le CIR rend donc la France follement attractive. Et en fait un des pays les moins compétitifs en termes de chercheurs, bien loin derrière les flambées salariales de la Silicon Valley: elle est en cinquième position mondiale derrière l’Inde, l’Espagne, la Chine et Singapour. Au fil des années, le CIR est devenu un totem. Quiconque veut s’en prendre à cette niche fiscale est suspecté d’en vouloir à la compétitivité et à l’attractivité du pays. Une commission d’enquête du Sénat, l’an dernier, s’est constituée pour étudier le dispendieux dispositif épinglé en 2013 par la Cour des comptes. Mais le rapport d’enquête n’a pas été publié, faute d’accord entre les parlementaires, du jamais-vu depuis dix-sept ans. « Il y a eu un lobbying effréné de plusieurs sociétés sur des membres de la commission », assure la rapporteure (groupe communiste, républicain et citoyen) Brigitte Gonthier-Maurin. « C’est le groupe communiste qui tenait à lancer cette commission, il était d’emblée critique contre le CIR », rétorque un sénateur, membre de la commission. Plusieurs jugent qu’il ne faut pas toucher au CIR, attractif bien qu’imparfait. Aussi pour des logiques politiques: « Chaque sénateur a une boîte exemplaire dans sa circonscription, qui touche le CIR », souligne la sénatrice Corinne Bouchoux (groupe écologiste). Brigitte Gonthier-Maurin, elle, tire à boulets rouges. « Le CIR est versé sur projet et n’est pas contrôlé. De grands groupes montent des clusters ou des start-up pour toucher le CIR », accuse-t-elle. Autre manque de transparence patent : impossible de savoir combien les sociétés ont perçu, puisque le CIR est couvert par le secret fiscal. Menace européenne « C’est un simple chèque en blanc censé éviter les délocalisations », s’étrangle l’association de chercheurs Sciences en marche. Parmi les bénéficiaires, on retrouve Intel, qui a perçu « 8 millions d’euros de CIR en 2015, et 28,5 millions entre 2010 et 2015 », selon Alain Séguier, élu du comité d’entreprise. Dans ce dossier, beaucoup pointent la faiblesse du suivi par les autorités françaises. « L’Allemagne a été gagnante : son cluster de recherche à Munich est resté. Peut-être que nos pouvoirs publics n’ont pas été assez bons en lobbying », poursuit Alain Séguier. « Il y a un manque de lobbying du gouvernement français dans les instances européennes. Contrairement à l’Allemagne », abonde le sénateur (LR) Michel Vaspart. Signe du manque d’influence de la France à Bruxelles : la Commission européenne a ressorti un projet, l’assiette commune consolidée de l’impôt sur les sociétés, visant à uniformiser la taxation des entreprises dans l’Union. Le CIR, vu comme un outil de dumping fiscal, est visé. « Il n’y aura pas de régimes dérogatoires nationaux, il faut nettoyer les niches », explique les services du commissaire Pierre Moscovici. L’ancien ministre français de l’Economie et des Finances sait de quoi il parle : il a, lui aussi, pratiqué les inaugurations de centres de R&D et les distributions de CIR.

The fully configured ROG GT51 system costs $4999 and marks ASUS’ entry on the market of high-performance desktop PCs. ASUSTeK Computer was established in 1989 with the purpose to develop and build computer motherboards. The company quickly became famous for its mainboards and by the early 2000s it was the world’s No. 1 producer of mainboards and a leading maker of PC components in general. Starting from 2002~2003, ASUS began to diversify its business and started to make products like notebooks and various peripherals, and in 2006 the company established its Republic of Gamers (ROG) sub-brand for computer components designed specifically for gamers. Eventually, ASUS came up with high-end ROG laptops as well as gaming displays and even became the largest supplier of the aforementioned product categories (at least, according to its own statements). However, despite the fact that ROG-branded motherboards have been used by performance enthusiasts and a variety of boutique PC makers for their builds for a while, ASUS itself did not actively engage into desktop PC market until circa 2014, when it introduced its ROG G20 SFF PC and ROG GR8 console based on custom form factor designs. Over the last couple of years, ASUS has showcased various region specific builds, but the GT51 is the company’s first gaming desktop build to challenge high-end machines from well-known brands. It took the company quite a while to finalize the design and it is finally available for purchase. The ASUS ROG GT51CA is based on Intel’s Core i7-6700K CPU that can be overclocked in one click to 4.60 GHz as well as a proprietary Intel Z170-based motherboard. The processor is cooled using an ROG-branded closed-loop liquid-cooling system, which fan also acts like an exhaust fan for the whole PC. The system comes equipped with two ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards running in SLI mode, 64 GB of DDR4-2800 memory (4×16 GB), two Samsung SM951 512 GB M.2 SSDs operating in RAID 0 mode and with a 1 TB HDD (which has 7200 RPM spindle speed). Since we are talking about a serious gaming PC that has to compete against products from companies like Alienware and Origin PC, the ROG GT51CA can be further customized by their owners, but not built-to-order by retailers. For example, the end users may install faster memory, up to five 3.5”/2.5” HDDs or SSDs, different M.2 drives and so on.

Exact specifications may vary as ASUS and partners may offer different configurations. As for connectivity, the ASUS ROG GT51CA has gigabit ethernet, 802.11ac 8x2 Wi-Fi, multiple USB 3.0 Type-A ports (including two on the front), one USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) and one USB 3.1 Type-C (10 Gbps) port (both on the front). The audio of the PC clearly deserves a mention because ASUS has installed an audiophile-grade ESS Sabre headphone DAC and amplifier to improve audio quality to the front audio outputs. Meanwhile, for some reason the company decided not to equip its top-of-the-range system with one of its Xonar discrete audio cards and the ROG GT51CA still relies on a 7.1-channel integrated audio solution (which is typically an improved ALC1150 audio solution from ASUS). Yet another exclusive capability of the ROG GT51CA is the ROG Band, which can be used to access a hidden hard drive space as well as the overclocking mode. Like systems from boutique PC makers, the ASUS ROG GT51CA has custom dynamic LED lighting effects (eight million colors, four zones) and comes with a mechanical keyboard and a gaming grade mouse with matching design. Unfortunately, at this time ASUS does not offer aerography for its machine. The ASUS ROG GT51CA premium desktop is available from Amazon, B&H Photo and some other retailers.

LOL Reply close - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link If only for the shi*ty design that every "gaming" device out there must follow it seems. Or maybe the 50% markup on the price (you could probably build your own for $3500 or less. Or even the questionable technical solution chosen for cooling in combination with the slanted case (hey, it's a "gaming" device", it must look alienish) which all but guarantees hot air will have a harder time exiting the case. Looks to me like so many companies build stuff for people with more money than sense these days. And Asus is really one of the frontrunners in this trend. Reply just4U - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link If they came in with some nice small sturdy aluminum design... "MAYBE" i'd consider it. Personally i'd rather see something along the MSI nightblade barebones.. and even MSI went all funky with something meant more fore a teen than a adult.

Reply Kepe - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link Erm... You save ~1000 - 1500 USD by building this thing yourself. That's quite a hefty price to pay just for someone to build the system for you. Reply Kepe - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link Also, cooling seems really iffy. CPU cooler as the sole exhaust fan? Does it have any intake fans? Those 1080's are going to run super hot, especially as they seem to be the same width as the inside of the chassis. How are they going to breathe in there? Actually, cooling isn't iffy; it seems absolutely horrible. Reply bigboxes - Friday, November 11, 2016 - link No, you got it all wrong. The case is tilted and all the heat runs out the back!

It's too near launch for this initiative to be applicable to the Intel 200-series motherboards, but the feature integration will be present in Intel 300-series motherboards "scheduled to be released at the end of 2017," reports DigiTimes. Motherboard makers speaking to DigiTimes said that Wi-Fi and USB interface chipmakers such as Broadcom, Realtek, and ASMedia could be adversely impacted by Intel's decision. Hopefully such companies have a broad enough portfolio and were working on new developments, so the loss of Intel motherboard related business won't be too painful. Even after the Intel move, some motherboards will still require more USB3.1 chips, for example, to equip more ports than the Intel 'standard'. AMD could take up some slack if its Zen processors and motherboards become popular and it might also benefit from cheaper Wi-Fi and USB 3.1 components. DigiTimes cites ASMedia's predicament as being not-too-sticky. This particular firm will reportedly cater to increased demand for USB 3.1 device-side, and for related chips, and "10G signal redrivers and retimers". Furthermore, ASMedia is known to be producing a high-speed transmission interface chipset for AMD motherboards.

Intel Is Looking for You Know How to Weld? Intel Is Looking for You By Dror Halavy Friday, November 11, 2016 at 3:07 am | י' חשון תשע"ז Intel in Israel employs around 10,000 workers in its Kiryat Gat production center and in four development centers, in Haifa, Yakum, Yerushalayim and Petach Tikvah. (Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - Intel’s Kiryat Gat chip fabrication plant is undergoing an overhaul, and the company is looking for over 1,000 workers to outfit the site, the company said. Time is of the essence; the company needs to upgrade its facilities in order to refit the site for production of Intel’s new generation of processors, but due to a shortage of skilled workers, the company is spreading the word about open positions, and is willing to train new workers. “We want to employ Israelis on all aspects of our upgraded plant, and especially residents of the south,” said an Intel spokesperson. “We are going all out to recruit welders, pipelayers, and other workers, as well as individuals who see themselves as building a career in these areas. Career paths are available for senior, experienced workers, as well as new, inexperienced workers.” Intel and the companies it contracts with, the spokesperson said, will pick up the costs of training. The Intel upgrade project, which will enable the site to manufacture the next generation of computer chips, is set to cost $6 billion. Some 3,600 construction workers are currently involved in the project, and there is an immediate need for more skilled workers, especially welders. A poll by the Career and Training Authority, a group sponsored by the Manufacturers Association, said that in 2011, 80 percent of manufacturers reported that they were having a hard time finding workers, and a third of those said that finding workers was “very difficult.” Only about a third of students study subjects such as electronics, HVAC, or nontechnology-related subjects that will get them a job in manufacturing; many more are needed, the Authority said. Speaking to Yediot Achronot, manufacturers bemoaned a lack of workers, saying that many of those who did apply for jobs were not committed to their occupations as careers, and were only doing it as a temporary activity, often while they studied academic subjects in preparation for their “real” career. “It’s very hard to find workers,” said the owner of one kitchen design firm. “As the years go by the experienced workers are retiring, and replacing them has been very difficult. We have no choice but to convince older workers to stay on the job.” Filed under: Labor Print Email Gmail Related Intel to Shutter Yerushalayim Production Facility Manufacturers: Skilled Worker Shortage Affecting Production Intel to Invest $6 Billion in Kiryat Gat Finance Ministry Mulls Intel Grant Intel Layoffs Go Into Effect Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Israel Israel to Look for More Dead Sea Scrolls Rabbi Litzman Raises Objection to Muezzin Bill Histadrut on Strike Path Over Long-Term Care Insurance Liberman Warns Against Clash With Army at Amona El Al Publicly Rebukes Pilots in Sick-Call Squabble OP-ED Where Do We Go From Here?

(Photo: Achen-Gardner Construction) Ranked as the fourth largest city in Arizona by the U.S. Census Bureau, the community once known as a small farming town has significantly grown to be a highly desirable destination for residents, visitors and businesses alike. Chandler has built a strong reputation as a leader in the technology and innovation hub of the Southwest. With a wide range of affordable and quality housing, top-rated school districts, and plenty of nearby dining, shopping and entertainment venues, it’s clear that Chandler is a great place to live, work and play. Business-friendly appeal Chandler has attracted some of the largest technology companies in the world including Intel, Orbital and Microchip. This effort is a result of more than 20 years of visionary work. “We had a solid infrastructure in place to accommodate the needs of these businesses that included low cost living and nearby services and amenities,” said Jay Tibshraeny, Chandler City Mayor. “We were able to compete on a global stage.” Intel Chandler, which has approximately 11,000 employees, chose to expand into Chandler in 1980, because the city provided the business environment Intel needed: access to a talented workforce environment, favorable tax and infrastructure policies, low likelihood of natural disasters and plentiful land, according to Carlos Contreras, Intel’s director of public affairs. The Intel Arizona site includes the latest manufacturing technology, research and development and several business groups. Since 1996, Intel has invested more than $20 billion to build high-tech manufacturing capacity in Chandler. Each year, Intel spends more than $500 million to support research and development in Chandler. In addition to high-tech industries like Intel, Mayor Tibshraeny credits the city for being fiscally sound and stable, which ultimately attracted other large employers such as Toyota Financial Services and Wells Fargo. “Building the Wells Fargo Center in Chandler allowed us to accommodate additional growth and move many of our team members out of leased space and bring them together in the most efficient manner at one location, while providing flexibility if we have a business need to grow in the future,” said Leo Bauman, vice president and manager for Wells Fargo Corporate Properties Group. “Additionally, our Chandler campus is located in a vibrant, growing community and many of the team members live in the East Valley so this location provides convenience and a reduction in their commute times.” Located on the Price Corridor, Wells Fargo houses approximately 5,000 team members from the technology and operations group, consumer lending, community banking, corporate finance, corporate risk and wholesale banking areas. Family-friendly feel The excelling school districts and higher educational opportunities have been a draw for many Chandler residents. “We worked hard to develop relationships with Arizona State University and The University of Arizona, which both have a physical presence in Chandler,” Mayor Tibshraeny said. The City of Chandler also operates 1,214 acres of park land, including 60 regional, community, and neighborhood parks, along with special use facilities and aquatic centers. A wide range of affordable and quality housing is available in all parts of the city, including the city’s historic downtown, which also offers a vibrant arts, entertainment and cultural scene. “Our unique, historical downtown has attracted millennials who wish to have easy access to restaurants and entertainment,” Mayor Tibshraeny said. “While this area is in such high demand, it still gives the feel of a small community.” Members of the editorial and news staff of The Arizona Republic were not involved in the creation of this content. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2eBw1ON Chandler Chamber of Commerce Chandler Chamber: Vision for business, growth and prosperity Oct 28, 2016 More Stories from Chandler Chamber of Commerce Banking on community connections Sponsor story Bursting with creativity Sponsor story One of a kind Sponsor story Top grade Sponsor story

That the Surface Book i7 can actually give you better graphics performance than a larger 15-inch laptop with discrete graphics is amazing. Combined with its tablet mode, swanky hinge, pen support, beautiful screen, and stellar battery life, it’s easy to remember what made us fall in love with the Surface Book in the first place. Would you buy this? Yes 3 No 0 Price $ 4,454.00 (AUD) Special Offers Coupon: Dell Branded Accessories Coupon Is it a laptop or is it a tablet? It's neither yet both and yet different to other convertibles in the market too. And just look at that price! It’s always been difficult trying to find the right category for Microsoft’s hybrid tablet/laptop Surface Book. And now with the new Surface Book i7 in hand, it’s even harder to figure out just what square hole to put this round peg into. Before we get too far into the review, let me say that the Surface Book i7 is incredibly fast for a laptop in its class, offering no less than twice the performance of the original Surface Book, which itself outstripped all others in its day. Even better, it has stupidly long battery life that bests all the laptops we’ve tested. Done. Fini. Move along, right? Well, not quite. The world isn’t the same as it was a year ago and the Surface Book i7’s competitors have been hard at work too, and there are aspects of Microsoft’s hybrid device that aren’t perfect. Microsoft The Surface Book i7 is hard to define but still pretty damned fast. What it is If you’re not up on current events, the Surface Book i7 is the second iteration of Microsoft’s “convertible” laptop. The top half is a beautifully proportioned 13.5-inch tablet with a “PixelSense” screen that has touch and pen support. The keyboard base (aka the Performance Base) is home to a discrete graphics chip, which takes the Surface Book’s performance beyond that of any other laptop in its class. The two sides are held together with that same crazy hinge found on the first Surface Book. There were rumors Microsoft would give up on its “dynamic fulcrum hinge” and eliminate the gap it creates, but nah, it’s still there and remains one of the most prominent features of the Surface Book i7. Gordon Mah Ung Bam. Dat hinge. Love it or hate it, it’s still there in the latest Surface Book i7. In fact, it looks unchanged from last year’s (above). The old and the new of it The Surface Book’s tablet looks identical to the previous version. In fact, from what I can tell, nothing has changed externally. The PixelSense screen is the same IPS panel with 3200x2400 resolution. Behind the screen there’s an Intel dual-core 6th-gen Skylake Core i7-6600U. It’s pared with 8GB and 16GB LPDDR3 options, as well as an SSD from 256GB to 1TB. (We received a model with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which can be bought from Microsoft's own store for a whopping $4,454). For hardware addicts, that CPU is a disappointment. With truckloads of laptops now using Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPUs, you’re probably wondering why Microsoft “pulled an Apple” and went with an older processor. Gordon Mah Ung The Performance Base on the newest Surface Book i7 (left) is about two millimeters thicker than the original Surface Book’s base (right). It appears that Microsoft was more concerned with upgrading the graphics in Performance Base. The original Surface Book featured a discrete Nvidia “GeForce” chip, which was custom but widely believed to be a GeForce GT 940M. The more powerful GPU in the Surface Book i7 requires a larger 95-watt power brick (bottom) vs. the 60-watt brick of the original Surface Book’s (top). The new Surface Book i7 packs an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M chip with 2GB of GDDR5 RAM. The newer GPU is far faster, but also far hotter. Microsoft said it added a second fan to keep it cool, but the Performance Base is also a little thicker than the original model, with larger air vents. From this angle you can see just how much thicker the new Performance Base (left) is with its GeForce GTX 965M inside of it. Under heavy load, the fans get louder, but the acoustics aren’t bad. A bit shrill, maybe, but totally acceptable. The fans also seem to work pretty well at keeping the GPU cool. I ran a GPU torture test on the Surface Book i7 for more than an hour and although it got warmer, it didn’t get uncomfortable to touch or use. So good job on the implementation, Microsoft. After running the torture test FurMark for more than an hour, the Surface Book i7’s keyboard deck was reasonably cool. Surface Book i7 performance The Surface Book i7’s CPU performance can be summed up pretty much in one sentence: It’s a dual-core Intel chip. Being a 6th-generation Skylake CPU, it’s around 10 percent slower than a comparable 7th-generation Kaby Lake. Of course, a lot of people won’t feel that deficit very often. Handbrake performance To illustrate that point, the chart below shows how the Surface Book i7 compares to a stack of the best laptops around. For additional context, I also threw in a larger quad-core Dell XPS 15 and the Microsoft Surface 3, which runs on the anemic Atom X7 CPU. Our test takes a 30GB MKV file and converts it with Handbrake 0.9.9. On most dual-core laptops (including the Kaby Lake-based Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre x360), it takes almost two hours to run this test, and as you can see in the chart, as the chips heat up and slow down during the course of the test, there are minimal differences in performance. That doesn’t mean there aren’t any differences, but the 6th-gen Skylake chip keeps up. A dual-core CPU is pretty much a dual-core CPU in our lengthy Handbrake encode test. The chart also illustrates just how little has changed from the first Surface Book. In another performance test—the CPU-heavy Cinebench R15—the score for this year’s Surface Book was actually identical to one I recorded last year. It’s all about the GPU The performance you really care about is the GPU that Microsoft tucked under the keyboard. Even though we all hoped for some secret new AMD or Nvidia GPU, the GeForce GTX 965M doesn’t disappoint. 3DMark Sky Diver performance Futuremark’s 3DMark Sky Diver is a synthetic test that measures the graphics performance of a PC. Although it doesn’t use an actual video game engine, it’s still well respected. For comparison I also threw in the Dell XPS 15. It’s a much thicker and larger 15-inch laptop with a quad-core CPU and GeForce GTX 960M. Since the overall score factors in the CPU cores, the XPS 15 takes the win. Elsewhere in the the pack though, you can see how last year’s Surface Book is head and shoulders above everyone else. But then you get to the Surface Book i7’s GeForce GTX 965M, which is basically three times the performance of most laptops with integrated graphics. Watch out. No other 13-inch Ultrabook can touch the Surface Book i7. But is it still an Ultrabook? 3DMark also gives you a sub score which focuses solely on the graphics performance and cuts out the CPU performance. Once we take the quad-core out of the equation, the Surface Book i7 moves into first place. Not by as much as I expected, but it’s not bad. The Surface Book i7 is basically plenty fast. Look at that GPU go. Tomb Raider performance Not everyone trusts synthetic tests though, so I also ran the 3-year-old, but still quite lovely, Tomb Raider game. I don’t have quite as many comparable laptops, but you can see how two of the XPS 13’s perform when running the game at 1920x1080 on the High setting. The slowest of the bunch is the 7th-gen Kaby Lake laptop with HD 620 graphics. Moving up to the Dell XPS 13, with an Intel Core i7-6560U and Iris 540, nets a decent boost. The original Surface Book with its GeForce GT 940M is faster still, but at 35.4fps, I wouldn’t play the game. That changes with the Surface Book i7, which achieves a totally satisfying 80.8fps, and even exceeds the Dell XPS 15’s GeForce GTX 960M. The Surface Book i7’s GeForce GTX 965M mashes the competing 13-inch laptops in gaming performance. Stupid-good battery performance too With the Surface Book i7’s upgrade you already know Microsoft didn’t touch the tablet portion, which has the same DYN-made 18 watt-hour batteries. Where Microsoft did change things was, again, in the Performance Base, whose now-thicker profile accommodates more battery capacity. The original Surface Book with GeForce card packs a 53 watt-hour cell while the new one has nearly a 63 watt-hour battery. All told, that’s a massive 81 watt-hour battery pushing the Surface Book i7 along. To see how well it does, I ran our standard video rundown test on both it and the last-gen Surface Book. Our test loops a 4K resolution movie using Windows 10 Movies & TV app. That particular app is selected because it’s a super-efficient video player. We set the laptops to airplane mode and the brightness to a relatively bright 250 to 260 nits to approximate what you’d use in a typical house or office in the daytime. Audio is enabled but we use a pair of small earbuds. The result? Stupendous battery life. In fact, it set a new record for battery life in a laptop at just over 13 hours of playback. The original Surface Book gave us a respectable 10 hours and the next closest competitor was Dell’s current XPS 13 at about 11 hours. With its giant battery, you also get pretty stupendous battery life out of the newest Surface Book i7. Think of it as Project Ara, but that you can buy Since the tablet of the new Surface Book i7 appears to be exactly the same as the original, I naturally wondered if I could simply attach the original to the upgraded Performance Base, since that’s where most of the upgrade happened. Sure enough, the two sides fit, and after a few driver downloads it was a go. Don’t believe me? Here’s a screenshot of last year’s Surface Book tablet with the new Performance Base and its GeForce GTX 965M. That score is the same as we got with the “new” Surface Book i7 and the Performance Base. In some ways, the Surface Book i7 is the first modular laptop. With the GPU and extra batteries stored in the base, you could, in theory, upgrade by just buying a new base. It’s almost like Google’s cancelled Project Ara, except it’s an actual product. The problem, of course, is that Microsoft doesn’t sell just the base. That’s too bad because I think Microsoft is missing an opportunity. Plenty of people who bought a Surface Book last year are probably still pretty happy with the Skyale CPU and tablet portion, but that GeForce GT 940M is getting long in the tooth. If I cared about graphics performance and I had the original, I’d jump at the chance to buy the Performance Base with the GeForce GTX 965M upgrade. Gordon Mah Ung Microsoft’s Surface Book i7 (bottom) certainly isn’t the tiniest laptop around compared to the last-generation MacBook Pro 13 (second from bottom), the latest-generation HP Spectre x360 13 (third from bottom), and Dell’s bantam XPS 13 (top.) What’s wrong with it The most obvious problems are the prior sins. The original Surface Book amazed everyone at launch but went through many months of teething pains with docking and undocking issues, and multiple firmware fixes issued over the last year, which both corrected and then reintroduced new docking or sleep issues. In the interest of full disclosure, I used an original Surface Book (although not the original review sample) off and on for the better part of the the last 10 months. For the most part, problems were few and far between but they were there and occassionaly maddening. But whether those were problems with the Surface Book, per se, or issues induced by Windows 10 Insider Preview program, I don’t know. Despite all that, I still have no problems recommending it. Still, I have complaints. The most prominent is the lack of Thunderbolt 3, or at least a faster 10Gbps port. With this class of performance, “pro” ports should be part of the package. One of the stickiest points with the Surface Book i7 is its price. The unit you see here with Core i7, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and GeForce GTX 965M is $4,454 and that's supposedly a sale price - down from $4,949! Ouch. A high spec MacBook Pro 13 will set you back $2,999 — so yeah, this is a premium product at a premium price. You can knock $675 off the Surface Book i7’s price by cutting the SSD capacity in half. Or you can step down to 8GB of RAM and a 128GB drive for $2,069. The problem is those prices aren’t competitive with competing laptops from PC makers. Of course, no other PC vendors offers anything quite like the Surface Book i7 either. It’s either too light or too heavy The other issue I have is the size and weight of the Surface Book i7. I weighed our review unit at 1.52KG. That’s only slightly heavier than the original Surface Book, but it’s hefty. The current Dell XPS 13 with a 7th-gen CPU and no touchscreen is significantly. Going the other direction, the MSI GS63VR Stealth with a quad-core Skylake chip, 15-inch screen, and a much more powerful GeForce GTX 1060 weighs just 300g more than the Surface Book i7. And that MSI will plain blow the doors off the Surface Book i7 in everything, save battery life and build quality. Well, and screen quality. The perennial target of the Surface Book i7, Apple’s MacBook Pro 13, has also recently gone on a diet and weighs just 1.KG. That kind of puts the updated Surface Book i7 in a strange, middle place: It’s heavy enough that you might consider getting a larger quad-core alternative, but yet light enough that you might be tempted to opt for the even-lighter competition. Conclusion When Microsoft announced details of the Surface Book i7, I was pretty disappointed in its middle-aged hardware. In use, however, it appears there’s plenty of life left in these parts. That the Surface Book i7 can actually give you better graphics performance than a larger 15-inch laptop with discrete graphics is amazing. Combined with its tablet mode, swanky hinge, pen support, beautiful screen, and stellar battery life, it’s easy to remember what made us fall in love with the Surface Book in the first place.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Hardware Wi-Fi on Intel USB 3.1 Saimin (Blog) - November 11, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail As we all know for a long time there have been no changes on motherboard chipsets. But there had been talk and support for new storage options and standards, such as M.2 for SSD and some limited support for features for adding Thunderbolt, and changing memory speed for good that gradually trickled out. Now Intel may change the course somewhat for 300-series chipsets in 2017. There are rumors that Intel will add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to the next generation chipsets.     A new report from Digitimes suggest that Intel is considering the USB 3.1 Gen 2 offers up to 10Gbps of transfer speed, where USB 3.0(aka USB 3.1 Gen 1) has only 5Gbps. At the present time, not many consumers are interested in or need a USB 3.1 Gen 2. However, this technology may come in handy for high performance external storage displays. It is known that Intel never had hardware with either feature directly integrated on the board.     If Intel decides to combine Wi-Fi then it may likely use its own radios, where there are two ways to make it to work, either make size smaller to a similar process technology or placed on package rather that integrating directly into the CPU. Of course, there will always be some negative effect on third-party providers, like Realtek, Broadcom and Asmedia. They often sell chips to both Intel as well as AMD. This has no negative affect and will not pass to consumers.                              Today Intel products last longer, which is not profitable but improving or changing a bit even adding Wi-Fi to the product will open a bigger market for Intel .       "It seems as though my state-funded math degree has failed me.

Skip to main content Toggle navigation Dowser Windows Errors Fixes and Guides DLLs Igdkmd64.sys Windows 10 Fix November 10, 2016 Mareto.ks Windows Errors This guide will help you fix the Igdkmd64.sys BSOD, which continues to plague Windows 10 users. The instructions provided mostly work with older versions of Windows as well. The article you will read below deals with the error message connected with Igdkmd64.sys BSOD – the driver for the Intel Graphics Kernel Mode, also known as igfx. It contains some solutions in the form of guides that are supposed to get that unpleasant issue solved for you. Where, when and why could Igdkmd64.sys error appear? Igdkmd64.sys is by no means a new error in the Windows scene and it appears to occur just as frequently on Windows 10. This specific driver has been developed by Intel and only systems with a processor made by Intel could experience such an issue. The problem itself represents a Blue Screen of Death together with an error notification stating this driver is not working properly. In fact, such an issue might result from nothing – there could be no reason for it. Some Mac users might also become victims of such a problem. Fortunately, we have provided a few useful guides below that could be just the right thing for your case. Hopefully, by following the steps inside them, you will be able to get rid of this problem. Igdkmd64.sys – a Windows 10 Fix The Guide Guide #1: Steps to disable Intel’s integrated GPU  The instructions in the following guide will only work for users, who have discrete graphic cards. Examples of discrete cards are AMD or nVidia. Actually, the instructions below represent something more of a workaround than of a fix. However, in case you don’t really use Intel’s GPU, you are not going to spot any differences. Turn off your PC. Unplug the graphics card. Boot your device again. Load the Device Manager. Just push the Windows Key on your keyboard, and then enter Device Manager. Open the generated result. As soon as you open the generated result, enlarge the Display Adapters. Find Intel’s integrated GPU there. Click with the right button of the mouse on it. Once you see the dropdown menu, choose Disable. The last step from this guide is to shut down your machine once more. Then simply plug your graphics card back in.  When you start your computer again, you should not be experiencing the igdkmd64.sys issue anymore. Guide #2: How to solve the issue by updating the drivers via Windows’ Force Update In some cases, using the Force Update could fix the error by getting you the newest drivers. However, what you are supposed to do first is to download everything Windows Update has available for you. Hit the Windows key. Enter Check for Updates. When there is a result of this search request, load it. Push the Check for Updates from there. This should be done as many times as it is necessary. The final message you should see in order to stop doing that is “Your device is up to date“. When you have finished with the steps above, load This PC. From there go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download. Once there, remove everything from the inside. Next you have to enter an Elevated Command Prompt. For that purpose, press both Windows and X at the same time. From the menu that comes up, choose Command Prompt. Wuauclt.exe /updatenow should be entered in the Command Prompt, followed by pushing Enter. In the end, only a reboot of the system is recommended. A special tip: In case you are overclocking, stop that! This solution doesn’t work for everyone. In case you are not aware of the fact that you are overclocking, this will not be the tip for you. Still, if you know that you ARE, proceed with the next paragraph. Overclocking could result in a serious strain on your CPU, as well as your GPU. This depends on which one exactly you are overclocking. Such issues might result in BSOD with the aforementioned error alert. Our advice is that you attempt to bring everything back to the stock frequencies and voltages. In some particular cases, this might fix the problem. Guide #3: Maybe setting a new name to “igdkmd64.sys” will help The instructions below are only compatible with issues of Mac users who use Windows via Bootcamp. First of all, look for the .sys file {It is normally found in the Windows folder of the partition where your OS has been installed – within System32 and inside the drivers folder}. Choose that file. Right-click on it then. Select the Rename option, after which alter its name to another one like igdkmd64Backup.sys. Save the new name. The problem should not be present anymore.      Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Here's Who Rose to the Top. CoffeeAndMilk | Getty Images Rose Leadem Online Editorial Assistant When it comes to the fashion world, technology seems to fit right in. Intel partnered with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and the Vogue Fashion Fund for their annual CVFF Design Challenge, empowering 10 up-and-coming designers to create unique wearables that incorporate Intel's Curie technology, which provides computing power for wearable devices in a chip the size of a shirt button. In addition to incorporating the chip, designers were challenged to have their creation showcase a personal memory, enhance an emotional connection to an event or elevate an experience. Among 10 final contestants, Laura Vassar and Kristopher Brock of Brock Collection took home the $400,000 prize and a year of mentorship with their custom design. The runners up were designers Stirling Barrett of Krewe du Optic and Adam Selman. Read on to see what the winners came up with and to check out the other futuristic design concepts. Related: These 15 Companies Are Bringing Tech to Fashion 1 / 10 BFA A hand-carved horn label that provides personalized styling tips. Winners Laura Vassar and Kristopher Brock are the brains behind luxury womenswear label, Brock. The nostalgic duo was inspired by their childhoods growing up in the country. To incorporate this memory, they embedded the Intel Curie chip into a hand-carved horn label that lives on the back of a coat. The chip connects to an app that gives personalized styling tips to its wearer. Image Credit: BFA 2 / 10 BFA Sunglasses that double as a camera. Sunglass company Krewe Du Optic and its designer and challenge runner-up Stirling Barrett strive to preserve the culture of New Orleans through its frames.  Using the Intel Curie chip to support his vision of preservation, he envisions sunglasses that capture memories in a more “natural-feeling way” than using a smartphone. Essentially, the sunglasses have a small camera and are able to take photos throughout the wearer’s day.   3 / 10 BFA A brooch that notifies the wearer of appointments, emails, Uber rides and more. Runner-up Adam Selman is a costume designer, most recognized for creating Rihanna’s red carpet looks and on-stage getups. Combining the efficiency and helpfulness that technology has to offer with his sense of fashion, Selman has designed a rose-shaped brooch with the Intel Curie chip that helps notify a wearer when it’s time for an appointment, an email is received, an Uber has arrived and more. The brooch will sync to a smartphone to light up or vibrate whenever it gets one of these notifications. Image Credit: BFA 4 / 10 BFA A silk mask that helps wearers sleep better. Inspired by her favorite childhood film The Wizard of Oz, up-and-coming fashion designer and artist Morgan Lane designed a silk mask to help the wearer sleep better. The mask is adorned in illustrious patterns, with the Intel Curie chip situated inside the accessory's strap to measure brain waves and temperature. With these measurements, the mask has the ability to identify the user’s sleep stage and even steer them away from bad dreams by controlling temperature. 5 / 10 BFA Clothing that disables nearby smartphones. Laurence Chandler and Joshua Cooper are the designers behind men’s fashion label Rochambeau. By incorporating the Intel Curie chip into their chic streetwear designs, they are encouraging wearers to get off the phone and enjoy spending time together. When two wearers are within five feet of each other, the technology disables both of their smartphones for a certain amount of time, “encouraging social intimacy.” 6 / 10 BFA A self-cooling blazer that regulates body temperature and heart rate. Ji Oh, an international fashion designer from South Korea, creates delicate and balanced designs for women. With the Intel Curie technology sewn in, she has designed a self-cooling blazer that tracks heart rate and body temperature. When heart rate or blood pressure goes up, the blazer detects this and helps to neutralize it and keep the wearer cool and comfortable. 7 / 10 BFA Boots that track a performer’s movements and enhance onstage visuals. Sisters Maryam and Marjan Malakpour are the masterminds behind L.A.-based shoe and handbag brand, NewbarK. The sisters will add the Intel Curie chip as an extension to their current mid-ankle heeled boot. The boot will then track a stage performer’s movements onstage and send the data to a connected lighting system. The lighting system will be able to adjust the lightings and visuals happening onstage in real-time. 8 / 10 BFA Lace-up booties that make recommendations about places nearby to go. Influenced by music, contemporary art, photography and vintage aesthetics, Chloe Gosselin is a French-born shoe designer. For the competition, Gosselin was inspired by a childhood visit to Claude Monet’s Giverny gardens, designing a pair of lace-up booties embedded with the Curie chip. The booties are designed to tell the wearer about her environment. The boots will make recommendations about nearby places to go and things to see, and share information about objects nearby. 9 / 10 BFA Garments that tell their story. Chris Stamp is creator of Stampd, a West Coast contemporary lifestyle brand. By installing Intel Curie chips into various garments, the technology provides the user information specific to the piece they are wearing -- including its inspiration, where the materials are from and a fully interactive map showing how exactly the piece got from the factory to the hands of the customer. 10 / 10 BFA A dress that visually changes according to the wearer’s movements. Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk are the creators of Area, a design studio that specializes in “textile manipulation.” The designers envision a dress that uses the Intel Curie chip to learn the gestures of a wearer’s movements. By learning these movements, the technology will change the visual aspects of the dress such as illuminating embroidery and LEDs throughout the dress.

Technology 2 0 0 November 10, 2016 iMac 2017 Release Date And Rumors: Apple’s Kaby Lake Machines To Be Introduced With iPad Pro 2? Simon Alvarez It is no secret that Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac, is long overdue for an innovation. The latest iteration of the iMac that Apple currently sells was unveiled two years ago and simply refreshed last year, which corresponds to a very long time in the tech industry. Prior to the unveiling of the MacBook Pro 2016, numerous rumors emerged stating that Apple would be releasing the next-generation iMac in the event as well. Unfortunately, the iMac was not mentioned at all during the tech giant’s October 27 “Hello Again” event, fueling speculations that the device would be unveiled in early 2017 instead. Considering the delay in the iMac’s release, rumors are high that the next-generation, all-in-one desktop computer from Apple would feature the most advanced technologies currently available in the market today. Most of the rumors about the iMac 2017 are very encouraging, with speculations painting a picture of a powerhouse device that would be quite a match with its biggest and most formidable rival, Microsoft’s Surface Studio. One of the biggest possible reasons behind the considerable delay of the iMac 2017’s release would be Intel’s Kaby Lake processors. While Apple settled on sixth-generation Skylake processors for the MacBook Pro 2016, there is a very slim chance that Apple would do the same strategy for the 2017 iMac. After all, between the two devices, the iMac has traditionally been more powerful than the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 2016’s aging Skylake chips are already pretty much maximized by Apple’s latest power laptops. Thus, using Intel’s Skylake chips for the iMac 2017 would simply not work. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] A recent Intel report unearthed by AnandTech found that the premier chip-maker is preparing for the release of 11 quad-core Kaby Lake processors within the first three months of 2017. According to the report, included in Intel’s release would be seven Core i5, three Core i7, and one Xeon E3 v6 processor. These, of course, are the chips that have been rumored for the iMac 2017 for some time now. If the unearthed report proves true, each of the chips in the Kaby Lake family is significantly faster than their counterparts in the Skylake generation. Thus, these upcoming chips would be perfect for Apple’s upcoming flagship all-in-one. As for the release date of the iMac 2017, Apple would definitely need to step up its game, as the all-in-one market just got a lot more competitive with the arrival of the Microsoft Surface Studio. The Surface Studio is leagues above the current iMac right now and features support for the Surface Pen and a new innovative tool called the Surface Dial. The iMac has always prided itself as one of the best productivity and creativity devices in the market, but with the Surface Studio around, Apple’s all-in-one has been thrown far back in the race. With this in mind, speculations are high that Apple would be releasing the iMac 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2. In a lot of ways, this does make sense, since the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the 4-inch iPhone SE were unveiled last March. Considering the cycle of Apple products, a March, 2017, reveal seems very likely. [Image by Brian Kersey/Getty Images] Revealing the iMac 2017 together with the iPad Pro 2 within the first three months of next year would be beneficial for Apple since both devices are in need of an upgrade. Apple’s iPads have seen a notable decline in sales recently, and the iPad Pro line has not been as successful as the tech giant might have wanted. Thus, March, 2017, would be the perfect time to unveil both the iMac 2017 and the iPad Pro 2. The iMac 2017 would be arriving at the all-in-one market in a position that is far different than before. While all-in-one machines have been around for some time, the iMac has always taken a very notable spot as one of the best productivity machines in the industry. This has caused the device to be embraced by many, despite its relatively high price. With the market more competitive than ever, and with a very formidable rival already being released, Apple’s iMac 2017 would need to surmount a mountain of challenges. Then again, Apple has always had a magic touch with its products. The entry-level iPhone 6S only had 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, but the tech giant’s loyal fans still supported it, allowing the rather underpowered device to outsell its more robust competitors. With the iMac 2017, however, the tech giant would not have the luxury to pull its punches. Apple would need to do everything it can to make sure that true to rumors about the device, the iMac 2017 would be its best all-in-one desktop computer yet. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcoG8hZjNtw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Paralyzed Monkey Walks Again After Implant Now Read This: 2016 MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Gets Mixed Reviews: Is The New Microsoft Surface Book Better?

Microsoft's Surface Book is the MacBook Pro we didn't get USA TODAY 5 days ago Brendan G Nystedt © Reviewed.com The new Surface Book's Performance Base fixes all the flaws of the original. We’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales.

I really enjoyed using it, but lamented its high price tag and it was held back by buggy hardware. It was a beautiful, expensive laptop...one whose screen tears off to become a clipboard-style tablet. Just in time for the holidays (and for new MacBook Pros to finally arrive), Microsoft's reinvested in its laptop line by adding the new Surface Book with Performance Base (MSRP $2,399, $3,299 as tested). This Surface Book gets an extra kick in the pants from a faster Nvidia graphics chip in a redesigned keyboard base. The tablet portion hasn't been redesigned, but you'll not only get improved graphics but also longer battery life. If you were iffy about the original Surface Book, then those concerns generally apply here. But, if you thought the first Book wasn't quite powerful enough, the Performance Base version helps shore up those weaknesses, and makes the product even more lustworthy. Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base - Buy now for $2,799.99 About the Surface Book with Performance Base This new version of Surface Book keeps the beating Intel heart of the current Book, and mates it to a keyboard that has a more powerful Nvidia graphics processor and more battery inside. There are three versions of this laptop, and the one we were able to try is the top-of-the-line model that sells for the eye-watering price of $3,299: Intel Core i7-6600U dual-core processor 16 GB RAM 1 TB PCIe solid state drive 13.3-inch 3000 x 2000 IPS touchscreen Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics with 2 GB GDDR5 VRAM (in keyboard dock) WiFi AC/ Bluetooth 4.1 What We Like The kinks are ironed out. The last time I used a Surface Book, the end result was a mixed bag. The model I sampled was prone to glitches—not what you want from a super expensive, premium-grade 2-in-1. And I wasn't the only one complaining, either. Thankfully, most of these issues have been resolved at this point, and a lot of them were due to Intel's 6th generation chips, which had problems in many competing systems, too. I found the Surface Book with Performance Base perfectly usable, with little issue whether in full laptop mode, or even with the screen torn off and used as a tablet. A spec bump in some key areas. Some might kvetch that the new, super-expensive Surface Book with Performance Base isn't that different. It still uses a 6th generation Intel Core i7 chip in the display, meaning the detachable tablet portion is unchanged from its introduction late last year. Is that the end of the world? Well, no. Even though Intel's just debuted its latest 7th gen processors, I've found that they don't add a whole lot into the mix. These dual-core i7 processors are solid at this point. Where the Performance Base changes the narrative is in graphics performance and battery life. The original discrete GPU models of Surface Book have a custom Nvidia graphics chip that helped it get a leg-up on its competition but wasn't anything to write home about. The Performance Base swaps that for a spicier Nvidia GTX 965M with 2 GB GDDR5 memory onboard. It won't game or crunch data like a Razer Blade, but it'll give a much-appreciated boost when running through demanding tasks. Battery capacity is up around 30%, all stuffed inside the redesigned Performance Base keyboard. In our intensive PCMark 8 Home battery life test, we saw a decent increase of runtime. Up from around four and a half hours, we saw nearly five hours in the test with the Performance Base version. If you're a road warrior who demands a power and battery life that can work as long as you, this new version of Surface Book should be on your list. Sleek, and still unorthodox as all getout Bitter about the 2016 MacBook Pros? If you gravitated towards Apple's notebooks because they're beautiful and go against the grain, then meet the hipster laptop of your dreams. Surface Book with Performance Base delivers fast internals in an unforgettable, unique enclosure. If you're looking at paying Apple prices for a notebook, Surface Book might not make you shy like a startled mustang. But the inclusion of a lovely pen (recommended by our comic artist pal Braden Lamb), the versatility of using the screen as a standalone device for watching a video or reading, is something that the MacBook Pro can't do. Sure, the Mac has a skinny Touch Bar above the keyboard, but it still doesn't have a full touchscreen like Surface Book. Additionally, the Surface Book lets you log in with your grinning face instead of using a fingerprint, a technology that, when it works, makes the Mac's TouchID sensor seem like it's old hat. Even though I'd recommend the HP Spectre X360 and even the cheaper Surface Pro 4 to people on a tighter budget, Microsoft's 2-in-1 solution with this new Performance Base is tailor-made for more demanding professional users. No-compromises on ports and a high-quality keyboard Perhaps the most annoying "updates" to the 2016 MacBook Pros came in the form of transformed ports and a keyboard that's been reduced to barely moving. Surface Book with Performance Base has none of these drawbacks. It might not have the awesome potential of a Thunderbolt 3 port like competitors from Razer and Dell, but everything else makes it feel ready to get real work done now, today, in the present. Surface Book with Performance Base retains the handy SD card reader and twin USB 3.0 ports that professional users expect. The keyboard dock, redesigned to fit a hotter, faster graphics processor, has a new keyboard to match. Redesigned though it may be, it's another A+ Microsoft keyboard—super comfortable and responsive to type on for long sprints. What We Don't Like Battery life in tablet mode isn't great While I truly admire the ability to undock the display from the Surface Book, the un-updated bits of Surface Book still smart just a tiny bit. The so-called "clipboard" is a cool party trick, but its short 2-hour battery life means you won't be binge watching Netflix on its gorgeous 13.3-inch display. Instead, you'll be limited to short bursts of content, quick batch edits in Lightroom, or a few chapters in a Kindle book. I've used the Surface Book clipboard to edit stories with the Surface Pen, and for that usage, Surface Book with Performance Base is as extraordinary to use as before. Journalists who like to red-pen material just like in the good ol' paper days would do well to look into a Surface for editing and notetaking. No Thunderbolt 3 in a year when everyone's added it. So, Apple took away the MacBook Pro's normal USB ports and replaced them with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Mac fans are already bellyaching about needing adapters in order to use their current accouterments. That gives the Surface Book immediate compatibility with today's devices, but there's a catch. I'd imagine, without an extensive redesign, Microsoft was unable to sneak in a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. One of these future-proofed ports would have gone a long way to bridge the gap between today's needs and tomorrow's devices, but I'd imagine that we'll have to wait for the inevitable Surface Book sequel to roll around. As it stands, competing devices from HP, Dell, and Razer all give you the power of Thunderbolt and the flexibility of USB-C, giving them a slight port advantage over the updated Surface Book with Performance Base. Should You Buy It? It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. Thanks to its boost in battery and graphics potential, Microsoft has given Surface Book a great shot in the arm. It's the highest-performing 2-in-1 we've tested thus far, and it underscores that Surface wants to win over pro and creative users. It's far from the reinvention that some people were hoping for, and if you were annoyed with the old one, this one has the exact same foibles. The concept didn't need a whole lot more to push it over the edge, and the extra oomph of the Performance Base make it that much more interesting. Of course, you're still looking at a really expensive device. Given that this will trounce a similarly-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro in intensive graphical tasks, the extra price doesn't seem like a big ask. Throw in the detachable tablet and the useful Surface Pen, and the unique value proposition makes Surface Book more interesting than what Apple has to offer on its Pro offerings. Of course, quad-core models like the Razer Blade and Dell XPS 15 give you more computing power for your money. Where Surface Book shines is as a device that has few legitimate rivals. Its blend of performance, design, and flexibility are hard to find elsewhere. Even though it costs a pretty penny, Microsoft still has a special laptop in this supercharged Surface Book.

Mesa 13.0.1 to Add Up to 30% Performance Increase for Intel ANV Vulkan Driver GO Mesa 13.0.1 Release Candidate is ready for public testing Nov 11, 2016 23:13 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Today, November 11, 2016, Collabora's Emil Velikov announced the availability of the Release Candidate (RC) development snapshot of the upcoming first point release of the Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library. On the first day of November, we reported on the release of the massive Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library, which introduced a large number of new features and improvements, among which we can mention the long anticipated OpenGL 4.4 and OpenGL 4.5 capability, the new Radeon Vulkan driver (RADV) for supported AMD Radeon GPUs by the AMDGPU kernel driver, as well as OpenGL ES 3.2 support for Intel Skylake or later. There are many great features in the Mesa 13.0.0 3D Graphics Library, but there's room for improvements. For example, the OpenGL 4.4/4.5 support could not have been displayed properly on some Linux systems due to the pending Khronos CTS validation, which might be fixed in the Mesa 13.0.1 release. And it looks like the first Mesa 13.0.0 point release is about to land this weekend, possibly on November 13, 2016. As the headline implies, Mesa 13.0.1 promises a huge number of fixes in the Vulkan drivers, adding an up to 30% performance increase for the Intel Vulkan (ANV) driver, as well as support for distinctly named JSON files that include the full Vulkan driver path for the Radeon Vulkan (RADV) driver, allowing users to use the driver outside the /usr/lib directory. More RADV improvements, GLX GLVND driver fixes Apart from the goodies mentioned above, Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library adds proper advertising of the Xlib platform extension support in the Radeon Vulkan driver, which can be used alongside the Dolphin emulator, implements better handling of Xlib and XCB connections in both Intel and Radeon Vulkan drivers, along with support for advertising the correct versions of the supported extensions. Other than that, there are multiple fixes for the GLX GLVND driver, and it looks like the interoperation between the libGL and libEGL libraries of Mesa and the third-party OpenCL implementation were restored. The Release Candidate build of the Mesa 13.0.1 3D Graphics Library is available for download right now from our website if you want to take it for a test drive. The full changelog is attached below.

Turbo Boost Max 3.0 Patches Updated, Now On By Default For Multi-Socket Systems Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 11 November 2016 at 03:36 PM EST. 13 Comments Intel's Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 (ITMT) patches for the Linux kernel have been pushed to their eighth revision as it prepares for mainline integration. New patches of the Turbo Boost 3.0 support were published last month while now they've been succeeded by these "V8" patches. Previous versions of the patch only enabled ITMT 3.0 by default on single-socket systems while with the new patches multi-socket systems supporting Turbo Boost Max 3.0 also see it turned on out-of-the-box. The V8 patches also add some other code changes, the i386 build has been fixed, and other code changes. Turbo Boost Max 3.0 delivers 15% better single-threaded performance, at least according to Intel on Windows, and is about boosting the performance for single-threaded workloads by moving them to the fastest core at a higher frequency. TBM 3.0 was added to Broadwell-E CPUs and will also be found with other future Intel CPUs. With the Core i7 6800K as an example, its base frequency is 3.4GHz, the standard turbo frequency is 3.6GHz, and its Turbo Boost Max Tech 3.0 frequency is 3.8GHz. These Turbo Boost Max 3.0 V8 patches can be found on the kernel mailing list but hopefully we'll see them merged for the Linux 4.10 kernel. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Larry MacDonald Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Nov. 11, 2016 2:12PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 11, 2016 8:03PM EST Comments AA Gary Milne Occupation Retired IT professional The portfolio Includes four buckets: 1) Bank savings accounts and term deposits; 2) “Strong companies with a moderate yield” such as Exelon Corp. and Intel Corp.; 3) Stocks and ETFs with “a strong monthly dividend” such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF; 4) Stocks with growth potential such as Taser International Inc. and Sequans Communications SA. The investor As an IT professional, Gary Milne was focused on investing in technology companies during the 1990s and 2000s. “Now, I appreciate a balanced portfolio that encompasses growth and dividends,” he says. How he invests Mr. Milne keeps 75 per cent of his money in the first three buckets, which are made up of income investments with little to moderate risk. These buckets help bring his stock allocation down to a stance more fitting for a retiree. An example of an income holding is Exelon, a U.S. utility involved in electricity generation, distribution and marketing. Its dividend yields 3.9 per cent. To boost income, Mr. Milne sells call options on his dividend stocks (the buyer of a call option acquires the right to buy shares at a specified, or strike, price within a certain period of time). Selling call options on Exelon stock has been particularly rewarding: The extra income boosted the income yield to 8.7 per cent over the past year. However, if the stock price ever rises to the option’s strike price, he will have to sell his shares and forgo capital gains beyond his selling price. Mr. Milne’s background in information technology gives him a solid basis for identifying companies positioned to benefit from technological trends. So, he still invests in technology companies but only allocates 25 per cent of his capital to them, in the fourth bucket of his portfolio. In 2009, he bought long-term call options on Apple Inc. (but he no longer owns them) to tap into the growth potential of the company’s smartphone. One of his current tech stocks is Sequans Communications, the first company to bring single mode LTE chips to market. “These chips are inexpensive … and are the last obstacle in making the true Internet of Things a reality,” Mr. Milne believes. Best move It was buying shares in wireless-technology company InterDigital Inc. during the dot-com bubble, paying $18 per share in December, 1999, and selling two weeks later in the mid $60s. Worst move “Listening to analysts and selling Netflix in 2012 at $10.50 a share [split adjusted].” Advice “Sell call options on your dividend stocks to boost income.” Want to be in Me and My Money?

Suddenly — or more accurately, from an historical vantage point, once again — hardware could be programmed to assist software, making it orders of magnitude faster.  Now with the once inexorable path of Moore’s Law having collided with a solid wall erected by the laws of physics, the path forward for CPU makers such as IBM and Intel is to leverage the workload acceleration capability of FPGA chips. They can’t accelerate everything, but FPGAs can be programmed to expedite a surprisingly large number of common workloads.  Intel bet its future on the technology last year, spending $16.7 billion to acquire Altera. For IBM to compete, it has to open up its intellectual property base even further, to build software ecosystem-like activity around the very core of its hardware.  But as IBM has learned more than once, calling something “open” and sending out invitations doesn’t mean people show up to the party. Raise your hand if you remember Micro Channel Architecture. “CAPI needs to be open, because it’s a spec dealing with actual electrical signals and bus protocols that will be baked into hardware for several product generations,” explained Marko Insights principal analyst Kurt Marko, in a message to Data Center Knowledge.  “As a physical hardware spec, details can’t be abstracted away in a virtual layer or API, but must be precisely followed by products expecting to work with other CAPI-compliant devices.” If an FPGA industry is to grow and thrive, it needs a set of standards its members can apply themselves to, as opposed to having those specs dictated to them from a megaphone.  It’s the need for a level playing field that brought competitors HPE and Dell EMC, AMD and Nvidia, together with Mellanox and Xilinx to form the OpenCAPI Consortium.  The institution was announced last October 14, and Thursday, the IEEE announced it was being enrolled as its latest federation program member. That membership gives the group the clearance it needs to advance OpenCAPI as an international standard, through the Industry Standards and Technology Organization. “OpenCAPI will offer its first bus architecture specification,” read a statement Thursday from the IEEE, “that will provide an open, architecture agnostic, high performance pathway between the microprocessor and different types of technology — advanced memory, accelerators, networking and storage — to more tightly integrate their functions within servers.  This data-centric approach to server design, which puts the compute power closer to the data, removes inefficiencies in traditional system architectures to help eliminate system bottlenecks and significantly improve server performance.” Marko helped correct a common misprint about OpenCAPI’s data rate:  With 8 lanes of serial data at 25 GHz, the data rate is 25 gigabytes per second, not gigabits.  In his communication with us, he acknowledged that IBM’s original CAPI started out proprietary.  But in the modern hardware market, he stated, “most hardware specs are open to contributions from any stakeholder, since the inventor realizes that the best way to industry acceptance is through cooperation.  Few vendors outside Apple (see Lightning) can force a hardware interface through on sheer market dominance. “Historically, many proposals were submitted to the IEEE,” continued Marko.  “But lately, ad hoc industry consortia like the USB-IF and the PCI-SIG have proven to be more nimble and responsive to technological change.  I see IBM trying to do something similar with CAPI.  If other silicon vendors adopt it and you see, for example, ARM server SoCs with CAPI interfaces, then you’ll know it’s working.” Previous Article Tech Defanged as Stocks From Amazon to Netflix Left Out of Rally Next Article By 2020, 92 Percent of All Data Center Traffic Will be Cloud Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

St. Albans, United Kingdom (11th November 2016) –Boston announces its Lustre* SFF (small form factor) solution - 'the dataScaler-L SFF'- as part of its exhibit at SC 2016. Making its American debut is the Boston dataScaler-L SFF, which addresses the problem of scalability and performance that small to medium sized clusters can face. As the most widely used parallel file system in the HPC industry, Lustre*, until now, has been typically reserved for institutes with generous budgets and larger clusters. Boston Limited’s dataScaler-L SFF appliance is the latest addition to Boston’s Lustre* based parallel file system portfolio and provides a lower cost / capacity entry point for Lustre* storage systems. Traditional Lustre* solutions on the market are focused on addressing the high-end cluster users, while the Boston dataScaler-L SFF is designed for small or mid-sized clusters with capacities as low as 18TB (and scaling to 720TB). This solution provides a high performance alternative to standard NFS and provides customers with the option to scale and grow as the cluster and user demands increase over time. David Power, Head of HPC, Boston Limited says: “We have been working in this space for a number of years and noticed that there was a major gap in the market for lower end users who were looking for higher performance HPC solutions at a more attractive price-point. As an Intel® Lustre* Elite solution provider we hold the engineering expertise to provide a solution in response to this customer demand.” Intel® Enterprise Edition for Lustre* provides unmatched speed, and efficiency compared to other platforms and gives you the ability to independently Scale-Out or Scale-Up your storage in response to user demands.

Dell and Intel, however, once embarked on a mission that could have offered a big push in making computing more transferrable. A report from VentureBeat highlights an internal project from Dell known internally as Dell Stack, which centered on a 6.4-inch mini tablet that would be the base for the user’s desktop, laptop, and tablet experiences. In other words, the device would power your entire computing life. More: Dell preps its own Surface Studio-inspired creativity workstation The entire system was built around Continuum, a Microsoft-built technology that is part of Windows 10 and basically allows Windows applications to run on all different types of devices — including phones, tablets, and computers. That technology allows for systems to be built like the so-called Dell Stack. While the software enabled for a full ecosystem replacement, the hardware was a little trickier — that is because the ARM-based chips used in many tablets and phones simply would not be sufficient for computer processing. Because of that, the tablet was, according to the report, set to be outfitted with an x86-based processor from Intel’s Kaby Lake series — a high-performing processor with a low power consumption. The device was also flexible when it comes to power. When used as a mobile device, it would take in a 3.5-watt draw, but when used as a laptop, it would draw in a much heavier 12-watts. Stack would also come in multiple different options — either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. All of these specs would be fitted into a pretty slick device and one that would only measure 9mm thick. Dell even planned a second generation of the device. The current status of the project is not known and the first generation was originally slated to arrive in 2017, according to the VentureBeat report. It is possible that the device was put on hold, but based on early reactions to the VentureBeat report, it seems it could be a hit if it goes to market.

Here's Why? (Photo : David Ramos/Getty Images) Microsoft's Surface Book product line has celebrated its first anniversary last month after releasing its first-gen Surface Book. However, the 2-in-1 hybrid computer's upcoming successor, Surface Book 2, was overshadowed by the Microsoft Surface i7 launched at the October event. Now, rumors suggest that Microsoft is heading towards a late 2017 launching date of the upcoming Surface Book 2 because of the upcoming feature redesign and the Intel's Kaby Lake release. Microsoft has reportedly revamped the physical design of the laptop, most especially the dynamic fulcrum hinge which gathered negative reviews from the previous model. More so, the newly launched laptop will sport an improved battery performance and processing speed due to the changes made in its processor, which is currently running the Intel Core i7. According to CNET, the upcoming Microsoft 2017 flagship laptop is expected to feature a 16 hours battery life, 13.5 inch PixelSense display, two ports for USB 3.0, SD Card reader in full size, Mini Displayport and headphone jack. The Kaby Lake or the core i7 will double up the graphic performance as it is built on a 14-nanometer technology, which is said to boost the performance of chips by 12 percent compared to the Skylake. It will also add another fan to support GeForce GTX 965M video output. Kaby Lake's technology should enable Surface Book 2 to be equipped with USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. The former should make for faster and more efficient data transfer and battery charging. The latter is dubbed the fastest, most versatile connection to any dock, display, or peripheral device, which should offer sleek connectivity and performance on the Microsoft Surface Book 2, according to Today. The 2-in-1 hybrid computer's screen is expected to deliver a crisp 4K resolution while playback of 4K video and 3D graphics should be a much smoother experience. Before the expected release for the Surface Book 2, Microsoft fans can check out first the Surface Book i7. The laptop sports a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a resolution of 3,000 × 2,000 pixels, together with 10-point multi-touch capabilities. Furthermore, the device has a 5-megapixel front camera, an 8-megapixel rear camera, two USB 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, a Mini DisplayPort, a Surface Connect port, and a Surface Pen.

As is pretty much always the case when electronics become networked, this connectivity also offers hackers new potential exploits. According to research presented last month at the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, courtesy of computer scientists at the University of Michigan (and Adrian Colyer's excellent The Morning Paper), the controller area network (CAN) protocol implemented by in-vehicle networks has a new and potentially quite dangerous vulnerability. The attack, known as a bus-off attack, exploits the CAN's built-in error handling facilities to potentially nuke both contemporary insecure CANs and future secured versions. First off, CAN is a fairly old technology. It was first developed and published by Bosch in 1985, with CAN-ready processors released by Intel and Philips in 1987. CAN made it into an actual car (the BMW 8 Series) in 1988, and was made the international standard for in-vehicle networks in 1993. Nowadays, it's pretty common and there are several spin-off protocols, such as CANOpen and DeviceNet. Prior to CAN, auto electronics were connected device to device as needed. If, say, a dashboard indicator, water pump, fuel injection controller, and diagnostic computer all required temperature readings from the engine, then we'd expect a wire strung from the thermostat to each one. Multiply this ad hoc topography across an entire car and the result was an unwieldy nest consisting of miles of of wires. CAN fixed this by implementing a bus architecture. Every component in CAN is hooked into the same backbone across which messages are transmitted in a unified format. Crucially, this means that each device only needs to have a single network interface rather than however many are needed to connect to x number of other devices. The result looks kind of like a local internet network, where every message to and from the greater internet is actually received by every other computer on the local network. It's just that those meant for other computers are filtered out. In CAN, the collision-avoidance system might not care about engine temperature, but it will still get those messages. That system knows, however, that it doesn't care about the temperature data and so it's able to safely discard/filter out that data. This brings us back to the proposed new vulnerability. According to the UM researchers, Kyong-Tak Cho and Kang Shin, it's possible to take advantage of CAN's built-in error handling mechanism in what amounts to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Error information is passed among Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the form of error frames, which are standardized messages containing two data fields where further error details can be specified in the form of flags (where one bit in a particular position is flipped to indicate something useful). When any ECU node along the bus detects an error, it sends out a message in the form of an error frame. This nukes all traffic currently on the bus and tells every other ECU that they need to resend whatever they were in the process of sending. Simple enough. There's more to it, however. Every ECU node maintains an internal error counter. When a node realizes that it's either sent or received a bad message, it not only sends out the aforementioned error frame, it increments this counter by some amount (eight ticks for sending a bad message, one for receiving a bad message). When an ECU's error counter hits 128, it goes into passive mode. Future error messages from passive nodes will no longer nuke everything on the bus. When a counter hits 255, the corresponding ECU will lose its access to the bus completely. When this happens, things turn sour for the whole automobile system, which may shut down completely or enter a "limp-home" mode. Image: Cho et al "Since the bus-off is a serious problem, in most cases, vehicle systems are designed to first enter a 'limp home' mode (when it occurs) with all their parameters set to pre-set values, and thus run with reduced functionality (e.g., limited engine RPM)," Cho and Shin explain in a paper that accompanied their presentation. "In this mode, warning lamps are lit up on the dashboard to alert the driver, and the vehicle runs only for some time before it is properly serviced by an OEM-authorized service center. Depending on the severity of the underlying issue, a vehicle in the limp home mode will later be totally disabled." It's thus possible to disable one or more components of a car by flooding a CAN's bus with error messages. This isn't a simple undertaking, but it can certainly be accomplished with some dedication. There are three conditions an attacker would have to meet to pull this off: 1) The spoofed message must have the same ID as an existing message; 2) the spoofed message must be sent at the same time as that existing message; and 3) the spoofed message must have a particular flag set establishing it as dominant over the real message so that the real message is ignored by the various devices connected to the bus. The first condition is trivially easy and is just a matter of having an ECU connected to the bus that has no filtering in place, such that it receives every message on the network and can determine based on this what the next message's ID will be. The second is likewise easy because messages are passed around the CAN at fixed intervals—it's just a matter of clock synchronization. The final condition is not as easy (or easy to explain, anyhow), but is still totally reasonable to implement. The neat thing is that once you unleash one of these error messages, the CAN will sort of do the rest of the work for you. The ECU node whose message you faked will see the error, increment its error counter, and then attempt to resend the message. But, it will only be seeing the spoofed message, not its own original message, because we made the spoofed message dominant. So, it will just keep copying and sending our bunk message until it's forced off the data bus. Mission accomplished. "If the attacker targets a message sent with high priority (i.e., a low ID value) and small message intervals, then the attacker would most likely disconnect a safety-critical ECU that sends important messages related to, for example, vehicle acceleration or braking," Cho and Shin explained. This was, by the way, demonstrated in actual vehicles. As it turns out, this vulnerability is fairly easy to fix. For one thing, it's easy to detect because the repetition of error frames implies something nefarious is going on—normally, the source of the erroneous message would take action to correct the message before resending. The attack can be further confirmed by the presence of an error message that remains in active mode after the passive mode counter has maxed out. This would only be possible if the same message were being sent by two different ECUs. "Even though the proposed attack has not yet been seen in the wild, it is easy to mount and also directly related to drivers/passengers’ safety, and should thus be countered with high priority," Cho and Shin conclude. "Moreover, the facts that the proposed attack can nullify state-of-the-art solutions and is easy to launch, make it even more important to design and deploy its countermeasures."

Jump to Navigation Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects Core Infrastructure Initiative News Announcements In The News Blogs Grants Programs Resources FAQ Contact Twitter Facebook Google+ YouTube LinkedIn Menu The Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative Renews Funding for Reproducible Builds Project Date Published November 11, 2016 Share Grant Helps Fund New Developers Working on Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD to  Improve Software Security and Control SAN FRANCISCO, November 11, 2016 — The Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), a project managed by The Linux Foundation that enables technology companies, industry stakeholders and developers to collaboratively identify, fund and improve the security of critical open source projects, today announced continued financial support for the Reproducible Builds Project. The grant extends the contribution to include Debian developers Chris Lamb, Mattia Rizzolo, Ximin Luo and Vagrant Cascadian, as well as extending funding for Holger Levsen. Furthermore, this contribution adds support for Ed Maste, working with FreeBSD.   While anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or compiled) packages to end users. The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during the compilation process by endeavouring that identical binary packages are generated from a given source. This prevents the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers' machines as an attacker would need to simultaneously infect all developers attempting to reproduce the build.   “Ensuring that no flaws are introduced during the build process greatly improves software security and control,” said Lamb. “Our work has already made significant progress in Debian GNU/Linux, and we are making our tools available for Fedora, Guix, Ubuntu, OpenWrt and other distributions. Support from CII will allow us to expand our efforts to work on longer-term commitments such as upstream patches requiring significant technical and time investment, as well as work on the infrastructure required to make Reproducible Builds both meaningful and approachable for end-users.”   Technical advantages of a reproducible build include removing unsafe behavior, such as downloading third-party code from the internet, detecting corrupted build environments, reducing time-to-detection of a build host compromise, as well as numerous other debugging and testing advantages.   Last year CII funded Levsen and Jérémy Bobbio’s efforts to eliminate unneeded variations from the build processes of thousands of free software projects. They also delivered new tools to understand the source of these differences and an infrastructure update to allow developers to independently verify the authenticity of binary distributions. Their efforts, combined with those from the rest of the Reproducible Builds Project, have resulted in 91% of the packages within the Debian testing distribution becoming reproducible.   About The Core Infrastructure Initiative CII is a multimillion-dollar project that funds and supports critical elements of the global information infrastructure. It is organized by The Linux Foundation and supported by Amazon Web Services, Bloomberg, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, Hitachi, HP, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, NEC, Qualcomm, RackSpace, salesforce.com, and VMware. Moving beyond funding projects, CII is introducing preemptive tools and programs to help the open source ecosystem and the companies who support it deploy secure coding practices.

About The Linux Foundation The Linux Foundation is the organization of choice for the world's top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. Together with the worldwide open source community, it is solving the hardest technology problems by creating the largest shared technology investment in history. Founded in 2000, The Linux Foundation today provides tools, training and events to scale any open source project, which together deliver an economic impact not achievable by any one company.

Asynchronous spacewarp: is it reality, or something that Captain Kirk yells as the USS Enterprise is about to engage its warp drive? Actuality, it's virtual reality—a new processing technique that Oculus launched this week. First announced last month at the company's developer conference, it promises to cut the processing power needed to render VR content in half. ASW is remarkably simple at its core: if it detects that the system is about to drop a frame, it will insert a copy of the previous frame into the void, ensuring that the viewer doesn't experience any flickering or tearing. While the technology could one day be used in the sort of standalone VR headsets that Oculus, Intel, and ARM are working on, its chief benefit today is to reduce the hardware requirements for PCs that power the current generation of headsets, like the Oculus Rift. Minimum specs now include an Nvidia GeForce GTX 960, an Intel Core i3-6100, and 8GB of RAM. //Related Articles The Best Computers for the Oculus Rift The hope is that by supporting these lower-end specs, ASW will make VR headsets more appealing to non-gamers who don't own or don't want to shell out a lot of money for expensive PCs. CyberPower is even advertising a $499 AMD-powered desktop, and offering it as a bundle with the Rift headset for $999, which is $100 cheaper than buying both separately. The PC includes a Radeon RX 470 graphics card and an AMD FX 4350 processor. As for ASW's limitations, there's "no completely free lunch, however," Oculus warned in a blog post. "ASW doesn't scale well below half the display's refresh rate. Depending on what's being displayed, there may be visual artifacts present as a result of imperfect extrapolation." That could result in several annoyances, including rapid brightness changes and some objects that move too quickly for ASW to render properly.

News & Analysis Chip Veterans Scan Horizon Chang, Stata, Barrett speak at SIA event Rick Merritt 11/11/2016 01:30 PM EST 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — The chip sector has a long road ahead but faces real challenges attracting top engineers, according to veteran executives. They spoke at the annual dinner of the Semiconductor Industry Association where a lithography expert showed a system which could drive advances in Moore’s law for another decade. In a panel discussion with other industry veterans, TSMC chairman Morris Chang expressed optimism for continued advances in chip scaling. However, he noted the industry is maturing and advised young electrical engineers to seek their futures in fields related to software, computer science and the Internet. “The requirements for fab engineers will be pretty stable for a while,” said Chang who founded TSMC as the world’s first dedicated chip factory. “Our struggle for higher density will go on for at least a decade, until the mid-2020s through the 3nm node — I think we will go that far at least,” he said. Another panelist, Ray Stata, co-founder of Analog Devices Inc., suggested a crisis is looming in the electrical engineering profession, but expressed hopes for technology advances beyond chip scaling. “EE departments are shrinking, yet we need trained people,” Stata said. “One of our challenges is we are not going to get as many EEs as we used to get, so [industry] may have to take on more of the burden of education and be in the face of universities so they know our needs,” he said. Stata pointed to an incubator at MIT as one of the vehicles to help bolster flagging investments in semiconductor startups. The former chief executive turned investor said systems-level combinations of existing technologies will help advance an electronics industry previously focused on components. “Smartphones are already there…[but the] analog [sector] is still in the midst of that transition,” he said. Former Intel chief executive Craig Barrett was the most bullish of the panelists. “The marriage of electronics and photonics is just starting, and there’s a huge opportunity there,” Barrett said. “The marriage of electronics and biology hasn’t even started yet – there’s immense opportunity everywhere,” he said. “When I joined Intel people said Moore’s law was on its last legs, we’ve always had just three or four more generations to go,” Barrett added. “Someone will figure out how to make the next electronic switch, and that will change the world, so like [Intel co-founder] Robert Noyce said, forget about history, go out and do something wonderful,” he said. As if responding to that call, Martin van den Brink, the chief technologist of ASML, promised to deliver by 2024 an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system that can print 0.45 penta-pixels/second. The recently announced high numerical aperture system will be able to produce as many as 200 wafers/hour, he said in a talk after receiving the SIA’s annual Noyce award. By contrast, the first integrated circuits were made in 1958 using a process that printed just 50 pixels, van den Brink said. By the time ASML was formed and he joined as one of its first employees in 1984, systems were printing 61 MPixels/second, he noted. “Moore’s law will not stop because we have smart engineers trying to move the industry forward,” he added. “Without him, we would have not followed Moore’s law this far or have hope of going to 7nm and below,” said John Kelly III, senior vice president of cognitive systems and research at IBM in giving van den Brink the award for advancing lithography. “The most risky and important bet Martin and his company has placed is on EUV, and progress in EUV in the last several years has been stunning,” Kelly added. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: ASML Invests $1.9B in Next-Gen EUV ASML Reports Progress on EUV Moores Law Hits Middle Age Email This Print Comment More Related Links Electronica: CEO Forum Rambles on IoT Security, Safety Chip Forecast Rises Through 2017 ASML Invests $1.9B in Next-Gen EUV U.S. Needs Big Bet on Chips Anticipating a More Virtual Moores Law Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Re: Hard to recommend "EE" as a career rick merritt   11/15/2016 10:50:13 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate @MWagner_MA Your comment reminds me some time ago an HP manager told me that the few senior people who still know board-level design are coming up to retirement age, so that skill set has almost entirely gone off to ODMs in Taiwan and China now.

[Courtesy Nvidia] HPC, Technology, Uncategorized Nvidia Has Become the Data Center Accelerator Company by Scott Fulton III  on November 11, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Over a decade ago, the name Nvidia was mentioned in the context of a company called ATI, as a producer of high-powered graphics accelerators that appealed to the then-rising PC gaming market.  A “design win” for Nvidia was when its chips were selected to power Microsoft’s Xbox 360.  On the horizon was something called “high-definition television,” so when Nvidia’s design engineers spoke about the future, they referenced the dream of commanding the home theater market. On the company’s back burner, whose heat was often turned down to “Lo” and occasionally to “off,” was a project called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA).  It was a little notion that graphics processors — which run small jobs such as shading triangles in very large parallel schemes — could be leveraged for running small everyday tasks, such as running data models, using the same parallel pipelines. It was a side project that even some Nvidia officials told me at the time was like the minority third-party in a European parliament, sounding sensible enough but never garnering enough votes. In the intervening decade, someone rebuilt the back burner into a fiery kiln.  Nvidia and the rest of the pipelined processor industry (which includes AMD) began calling the technology GPGPU, where the first “GP” stands for “general purpose.”  And now the industry is experiencing such astonishing growth that no company in the semiconductor space can avoid noticing it, and any firm invested solely in FPGA accelerators must find itself this morning in the midst of a cold, re-awakening shower. Thursday night, during Nvidia’s quarterly earnings call for fiscal 2017, the company once declared dead or dying for having been left out of Sony’s PlayStation 4 informed the world that its annual revenue growth from data center projects — where GPGPU is now focused — grew almost 300 percent annually to $240 million. What counts as a “design win” for Nvidia today?  Amazon’s choice of Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU-based accelerators for powering its P2 instance type, announced last September.  And yes, Nvidia won Microsoft over yet again, this time by adopting Tesla M60 accelerators for Azure’s N-Series instances. Amazon AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr explained the phenomenon in a company blog post last September:  “Processors have reached the upper bound on clock rates, but Moore’s Law gives designers more and more transistors to work with,” Barr wrote.  “Those transistors can be used to add more cache and more memory to a traditional architecture, but the von Neumann Bottleneck limits the value of doing so.  On the other hand, we now have large markets for specialized hardware (gaming comes to mind as one of the early drivers for GPU consumption).  Putting all of this together, the GPU scales out (more processors and parallel banks of memory) instead of up (faster processors and bottlenecked memory).” It’s a verification of the observations that Intel made back in the spring: essentially, that the types of speed gains that data centers had anticipated would always come from CPUs, must from now on be found by broadening the platform beyond CPUs, and focusing one’s definition of performance from general purpose to specific tasks.  While Intel and other semiconductor firms make investments in FPGA technology to rebuild Gordon Moore’s golden track of progress, CSPs and investors are realizing Nvidia had been growing the same class of solution organically since the early 2000s. In its last fiscal quarter, Nvidia earned $2.004 billion in revenue, a gain of 54 percent year-over-year, and 40 percent over the previous quarter.  For a company whose seasonality used to be determined by the strength of gaming during the holidays, these numbers are huge for a fall quarter. “The thing that really made it possible,” said Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang during yesterday’s quarterly conference call [our thanks to Seeking Alpha for the transcript] “was the transformation of our company from a graphics processor to a general-purpose processor.  And then, probably the more important part of that is transforming from a chip company to a platform company. “With GPU acceleration, the benefit is incredible,” Huang continued.  “It’s not 20%, it’s not 50%, it’s 20 times, 50 times.  And that translates to, most importantly, for researchers, the ability to gain access to insight much, much faster.  Instead of months, it could be days.  It’s essentially like having a time machine.  And secondarily, for IT managers, it translates to lower energy consumption and, most importantly. . . a substantial reduction in data center cost.  Whereas you have a rack of servers with GPUs, it replaces an entire basketball court of cluster of off-the-shelf servers — so, a pretty big deal.” The center of server hardware is decentralizing, and the CPU is no longer the center of gravity.  That’s good news for companies like AMD, which lost its lead in that department anyway.  And that’s great news for Nvidia, which placed its GPU in just the right orbit, well in advance.

Infinity Ward hasn’t updated their patch notes thread on Reddit with the changes yet, but Charlie Intel and users on Reddit have confirmed that Infected mode is now live. Some of the other changes appear to include: a rarity for Camos, the ability to see other players’ stats in the lobby, pick 10 points are now blue in custom classes, lobby status is now above names, Prestige icons are now bigger in lobbies, a Recent Players tab, new Taunts for Combat Rigs (Surgical Strike, Drop the Hammer, Pineapple Toss), and the HUD now shows the kill feed and the other player’s emblem when you die. On Activision’s support website, they said the first post-launch update will fix these issues: Intro video after match – Players are reporting that the intro video is playing after every Multiplayer match with no way to skip or bypass. Players not receiving Season Pass bonus content – Some players who have purchased Season Pass are not receiving their 10 Rare Supply Drops and 1,000 Salvage Credits. Workaround: Some players have found that closing and rebooting the game two or three times delivers their Season Pass bonus content. Did you notice any other changes with today’s update?

Advanced Micro Devices deserves credit for shifting its business toward important areas in the semiconductor market, but its soaring stock price also makes AMD shares look overvalued today. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Nov 11, 2016 at 2:12PM Image source: Getty Images. Pop quiz: What do you get when a company's stock rises 228% in a year while it also loses $548 million over this same period? My answer: A precarious valuation. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on an incredible tear over the past 12 months: AMD data by YCharts. As you'll see below, some of the newfound optimism bolstering AMD stock is deserved. However, the extent of a yearlong rally has also driven AMD shares to heights that the company's underlying business fundamentals seem unlikely to support, and investors eyeing AMD shares today should do so with extreme caution. AMD's turnaround deserves recognition Advanced Micro Devices occupies something of a precarious place in the eyes of many longtime semiconductor sector observers. Long the distant second fiddle to Intel in the market for the x86 microprocessors that power the PC industry,  AMD has struggled to maintain consistent profitability since the turn of the millennium, which has had disastrous results for its volatile stock price over the long term. AMD Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. In recent years, though, AMD experienced something of an unexpected renaissance. The growth in graphics-intensive computing tasks related to self-driving cars, big-data imaging, virtual reality, and even high-end video games drove a surge in demand for the graphics chips made by AMD and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The two GPU specialists differ in one essential characteristic: NVIDIA has traditionally occupied the high-end, high-performance piece of the market, while AMD has offered more affordable, mass-market chipsets. And its status as the everyman's GPU maker has proven to be an especially large benefit to AMD today. For example, it recently introduced the first $200 GPU -- the Radeon RX 480 -- a feat that could help lower the cost a VR-quality computer to around $600. Since the cost of many VR-ready PCs can run well into the thousands of dollars, a compelling mix of price and performance has fueled market-share gains for AMD in the market for PC graphics chips, even as the market for PC GPUs as a whole continues to decline. To counter this success, AMD's rival NVIDIA recently introduced its own $200 graphics chip design, the GeForce GTX 1060, and it's this kind of behavior that may threaten AMD's prospects in PC graphics chips. The broader implication here is that NVIDIA is willing to devalue its traditional high-end chips to defend its market share, and that doesn't bode well for AMD's continued surge in this space. AMD has also been able to translate its abilities in both CPUs and GPUs to create single systems on a chip (SoCs) that can handle most core computing tasks for video game consoles like the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PS4. The company indeed deserves credit from investors here: It appears to have established a profitable niche in console SoCs. However, despite AMD's clear opportunities and recent successes, shares have ventured into the realm of the overvalued. Difficult-to-justify valuation AMD's business has indeed improved, but its soaring stock price seems difficult to justify, even looking to the medium term. For context, AMD's current lack of profits this year and its expectation for continued losses next year give it negative current and forward price-to-earnings ratios. Looking further to other commonly used valuation metrics, AMD's enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is also quite high at 236. The common thread should jump out here. AMD's expected lack of profitability this year and next year doesn't inspire a lot of faith that the company can sustain a $6.8 billion market capitalization. To be sure, a large portion of AMD's current-year losses stem from the $340 million charge related to its amended chip-fabrication deal with its former manufacturing arm GlobalFoundries. However, this one-time charge doesn't affect AMD's profit outlook for next year. Thus, its continued estimated losses make me question whether investors are willing to wait until 2018 for profits to appear. To be sure, AMD has done a great job tapping into the newfound demand for gaming-quality graphics chips. However, NVIDIA's ability to move down-market in that area adds a clear element of risk to AMD's ability to continue to steal market share. What's more, as console gaming platforms seem likely to vie with PCs as virtual reality gaming platforms, it seems possible that AMD's two core revenue growth catalysts could find themselves in direct competition in the years to come. The overall point is that AMD's stock rebound has certainly been justified -- to a degree. However, given the company's plausible lack of near-term profits and its positive but evolving competitive position, a continued rise in AMD stock seems unlikely in my estimation.

And it's arguably not because the CPU space is short on innovation, but rather the fact that recent chip architectures have been so good that there's no feeling of urgency when a new generation comes along. My personal laptop, for example, a ThinkPad X1 Carbon from 2012, employs a dual-core Intel Core i5-3427U that's over four years old and yet is only now starting to show signs of slow-down when multi-tasking. On the desktop, I'm using a quad-core Intel Core i7-4770K, and though said chip is over three years old, my PC still feels suitably quick, and I'm hoping it'll see me through to at least 2018. Five years between upgrades isn't what the likes of AMD and Intel want to hear, and it isn't great reading for a PC industry that has historically relied on CPU product cycles to help shift systems. Then again, maybe I'm just slow off the mark. To canvas your opinion, this week's question is: which CPU is inside your PC(s)? Let us know the model number, how long you've had the chip, and whether or not it's still sufficient for your needs.

While the new machines don't usher in Intel's latest Kaby Lake 7th Gen Core series processors (of which only dual-core variants are currently available), they are now packing NVIDIA Pascal firepower, with a GeForce GTX 1080, GeForce GTX 1070 and GeForce GTX 1060 powering the Alienware 17, 15 and 13 models respectively. It was a clean sweep for NVIDIA and the Alienware team also took the opportunity to tighten-up the build quality of their gaming notebook fleet, with new, cleaner lines and edgier angular looks now strapped with more aluminum alloy and less high density polycarbonate.  However, one of Alienware's new three amigos is a bit more stand-out than the others, perhaps. With the Alienware 13 R3 (marking the 3rd revision), Dell-Alienware has taken what was previously a dual-core only affair and made it quad-core capable. That extra CPU juice under the hood, coupled with a dramatically more powerful GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, should equate to a bodacious increase in gaming performance-per-square inch. And if that weren't enough, Alienware brought that sexy OLED back for the upper-end SKUs of the AW13 -- 13.3 inches of super-saturated, 1ms pixel response time love... Let's face it, after this years crazy US Presidential Election cycle, you need a diversion. Alienware may just have a proper diversion for you here but first, let's hit the video roll and then we'll deep-dive into the particulars.   MSI GE62VR 6RF Apache Pro Specifications & Features Processor  6th Gen Intel Core i7-6700HQ (6MB Cache, 2.6GHz - 3.5GHz) Display 13.3-inch QHD (2560x1440) OLED Display, 1ms, 60Hz Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 w/6GB GDDR5 Memory 16GB DDR4-2400 (8GB x2) Storage 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive Optical NA Wired Ethernet Killer Gaming Network E2400 Wireless Connectivity Killer Wireless AC 1535 2x2 WiFi with Bluetooth4.1 Interface (Left) USB 3.0 With PowerShare), Headphone/Mic Line-In, Audio Line Out Interface (Right) USB 3.0, USB 3.0 Type-C Interface (Back) RJ-45 Killer Networks e2400, Mini DisplayPort 1.2 Output,HDMI 2.0, USB Type-C Thunderbolt, Alienware Graphics AMP Port, Power-Adapter Port Webcam Alienware HD resolution camera with IR presence detection and Windows Hello technology Operating System Windows 10 Home 64-bit Dimensions 13.0 x 10.6 x .87 inches (W x D x H) Weight 5.8 Pounds Extras Tobii Eye Tracking Software, AlienFX™, AlienFusion™, AlienAdrenaline™ w/ Accelerator Manufacturer Warranty Alienware 1 year Limited Warranty plus At-Home Service with additional extensions up to 4 years available Pricing $2,124.99 As Configured And Tested @ Dell.com The configuration Alienware sent in for review is a top-of-the-line load-out with a Core i7-6700HQ quad-core Skylake CPU, a 512GB PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive, 16GB of RAM and a QHD (2560X1440) OLED (Organic LED) display. As tested, our machine retails for $2,124.99 as configured on Dell's site. However, you can dial in various build options starting as low as $1199, which would come with a standard FHD (1080p) IPS display and an Intel Core i5 quad-core processor. There are quite a few options on Dell's site but even the base model comes with 8GB of DDR4 2133MHz RAM and a GeForce GTX 1060, which by the way, offers virtually the same horsepower in the notebook configuration as its desktop counterpart. Power gating aside, the GPU and memory configuration are identical between NVIDIA's desktop and notebook variants, which is testament to the power efficiency of the Pascal architecture. But let's poke and prod at this new alien machine a little more, shall we?

Display shapes up un the form of a 12.3-inch IGZO LCD set to resolve at 2736×1824 resolution and 450 nits of brightness. Also, the display comes with a Gorilla Glass with Anti-reflective and Anti Fingerprint coating and is touch enabled. Eve V packs in an impressive 48Wh of battery and comes with the usual array of sensors including Fingerprint, Hall, Gravity, Light, Gyroscope, and GPS. Audio arrangements on this machine include four quad speakers rated at 1w each, headphone jack audio amplifier and noise-cancelling microphones, two in numbers. Now as you might have observed the specs bring the Eve V eerily close to the Surface Pro 4 and not only that, the specifications are something that we would expect on an iterative upgrade for Surface Pro 4. Also, the N-Trig (Ironically this is the same Israeli startup whose Technology had been acquired by Microsoft)  Stylus which has 1024 pressure levels and comes with two buttons. Well the connectivity options on the Eve V are superlative indeed and include 1 X Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C, 1X USB 3.1 Type C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-A and the MicroSDXC card reader. It is surprising to see that a new company has been able to get high-end hardware and a custom designed product on the offing but the ability of the company to fulfill the same is something that can be questioned. That said, Indiegogo and Kickstarter projects are mostly known for its innovative pedigree and the same also comes with a certain degree of risk for the buyers. Priced at $900 the Base Eve V comes with Intel Kaby Lake and it certainly seems a worthy product barring the question mark with regards to sales and support. Just to put things in perspective, Eve team has explained how it would meet the expected demand and will also be able to provide adequate support in a recent Reddit AMA. The spec sheet for the Eve V makes it evident that the company wants to overdeliver on the Hardware front I just hope that the product will be positioned effectively.

The recent appointment of Nithya Ruff as an at-large director on the Linux Foundation's board should have a positive effect, even outside open source. Finding and keeping women and other minorities has been a problem in tech. The recent appointment of Nithya Ruff as an at-large director on the Linux Foundation's board should have a positive effect, even outside open source. Advertisement It's been a couple of weeks since the nonprofit Linux Foundation announced the addition of Nithya Ruff, along with Erica Brescia and Jeff Garzik, to its board. Ruff comes to the table with a long list of accomplishments. For the past two years she's been at Western Digital, where she's currently the director of open source office and is also the founding president of the company's Women’s Innovation Network. During this same period, she's been a member of the OpenStack Diversity Working Group and Women of OpenStack. Her career in tech began with a ten year stint at Kodak, where among other things, she was an IT Analyst. Since then, she's spent time at some well known tech firms, including SGI, Avaya and Intel. With her current employer, her duties include being an evangelist, meaning she can often be found speaking at various tech conferences, including the Linux Foundation hosted LinuxCon. Her appointment to the Linux Foundation board is as an at-large director, which puts her in a rather advantageous position, since she's not directly beholden to any of the Linux Foundation's corporate sponsors. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to spend some time on the phone with Ruff, who spoke from the Western Digital offices in Milpitas, California. We talked about her appointment to the board at the Linux Foundation and her thoughts on her involvement with the foundation. IT Pro: How did you come to be considered for this appointment, and why do you think you were chosen? Ruff: I've been working in open source since 1998 at Silicon Graphics. In fact, some of the first people I was working with open source on were people like Jeremy Allison and Dave McAllister. Since then I've been in and out of open source -- primarily more in than out -- in various capacities in the community and in companies doing project management on the open source side. I've never been a coder or a code contributor to open source, but I've been in various other functions like community manager, marketer, compliance and things of that sort. Diversity is something that I've been working on for a very long time. I had been informally advising the Linux Foundation, sponsoring the Women In Open Source lunches at the foundation and working on how to structure that to be more fresh and to continue the conversation to change and reduce barriers to open source. I've talked on that subject in various places, valuing different types of contributions, such as marketing, documentation, quality, and how to reduce barriers to open source and open doors. So, with all that work, Jim invited me to join the foundation and asked, why don't you help us do this in a more structured and broad fashion? I was thrilled and excited to be invited to do that as a director at large, and that's how I became a part of it. IT Pro: I think it's important to have some board members who aren't answerable to some of the large corporations who are deciding how Linux is going to go. Ruff: Exactly. And my role at Western Digital has nothing to do with my role at the Linux Foundation. Even if I were to change companies, even if I were not part of a company that's a member of the foundation, my role would continue, because it's independent of the company that I work for. IT Pro: And you're not being pushed by any handlers to support a particular agenda either? Ruff: Not at all. In fact, it's the passion and the agenda that I already had that got me noted to be on the board. My feedback to the board was that I want to continue to do what I'm doing and I want to do it with the platform that the foundation provides, because it reaches a much broader audience in a more systematic way versus my working through just Women In Open Source, Women of OpenStack, or some of the smaller groups that I've been functioning with. IT Pro: And diversity is something that tech in general -- including open source -- has been struggling to do something about. Ruff: Absolutely. This is something that I've been doing inside Western Digital/Sandisk as well. This is not something that is new or just in open source for me. Three-and-a-half, four years ago, I and a bunch of others, from a grass roots perspective, went to the leadership team here and asked that we focus on diversity as a company, and measure and hold ourselves accountable for changing the numbers, changing the culture, changing our recruitment practices, et cetera. So this is something that I lead inside the company as well. IT Pro: Do you think that the open source development community is getting more diverse? Ruff: I'm seeing a little bit of change in the demographics. I'm seeing more women, contributing code and in other functions like community and documentation. For example, when I partnered to study what the percentage contributed to the Linux kernel was, we saw, I think, between nine and ten percent at the code level, the code review level and the mailing list level, and at OpenStack it was, I believe, between eleven and twelve percent. We looked at the trends from, I think, 2010 on, and it has been steadily climbing. This is still a very low number. Fifty percent of the population is women, and in tech we have about 17 to 20 percent, depending on the company. When you look at open source it's even lower; it's at ten percent. It is low, but it's trending in the right direction. IT Pro: It also seems to be a problem keeping women. A lot of women say they don't feel welcome and leave open source. Ruff: Yes. I think it's a problem in tech in general and open source in particular. We are working on recruitment and pipeline development, which is good, but we have a leaky bucket. We have people leaving the organizations and a lot of that has to do with culture of inclusion. It's whether you feel welcome, how the interactions are, whether your contributions are valued, and whether you find others like you in the organization, because if you are alone you tend to feel like an odd duck, you feel isolated, you feel that you can't have your voice heard. But when the numbers increase, then more and more women feel comfortable to speak up and to change the culture of a group. Some people are doing exceedingly well, like the Python organization, because right from the top, from the maintainer of the Python group to some of the women who are involved in the group, like Jessica McKellar, people are making a concerted effort to attract, keep, reward and recognize women and other contributors to Python. IT Pro: It's not only women either. It's trying to attract and keep people from different cultures and from other minority groups. Ruff: Absolutely. In fact, the model that the gender diversity effort has been using can easily be extended to other minorities in open source. Also, underprivileged people, if you will -- people who've been left out on the fringe. It's young people, it's black, hispanic, American Indian and people who've traditionally not been in tech. One of the things I said at Grace Hopper when I spoke about opening doors in open source is it's also important because as industries get disrupted by software, if you're not part of it then you get left out on the sidelines and you get economically left out of what I called the gold rush of digital disruption. We need everyone to be able to participate, or at least have the opportunity to participate, in the disruption that's happening. IT Pro: You talk about using the same model for other minority groups as with women. This makes sense. I think people from other minorities, perhaps, feel some of the same isolation. Ruff: Absolutely. Including men. There are many men, who are either introverted, or who don't particularly care for some of the practices that happen in some online communities, who prefer a kinder, gentler kind of community or an inclusive community, who are are also leaving. Inclusion for me is a broader term than just women. It means that every person at the table feels valued, listened to, understood, and is able to contribute to the best of their abilities to the project. IT Pro: It's a big wide world and everybody deserves a place at the table? Ruff: Precisely. Someone recently said that even at the individual level, each of us is so different. True diversity is when each individual feels respected and heard. It's something that can be done; it's not rocket science. By shining a light on projects like Python which are doing it well, you can learn a lot of best practices to apply to other projects.

Proper management of memory is vital for a computer system to operate properly. Modern operating systems have complex systems to properly manage memory. A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is the storage space in a computer where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. The memory is divided into a large number of small parts called cells. Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one. Memory can primarily be divided into three types; namely; primary, secondary and cache. Solid-state storage (SSS) is a type of non-volatile computer storage that stores and retrieves digital information using only electronic circuits, without any involvement of moving mechanical parts. Types of flash-based solid-state storage devices include MMC, SD, SSD and USB Flash Drives. A solid-state drive/ disk (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. The key components of an SSD are the controller and the memory to store the data. The primary memory component in an SSD was traditionally DRAM volatile memory, but since 2009, it is more commonly NAND flash non-volatile memory. Company Coverage of Solid State Drives (SSD) Market: o Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. o SanDisk o Intel Corporation The overall growth of the industry is driven by rising rate of adoption of laptops and notebooks for personal and professional use. Other factors contributing to the growth is rising storage needs of Big Data industry coupled with the supremacy of SSD over flash memory. The trends observed in the SSD market and hence the memory market is a large number of merger and acquisitions as well use of eSSD. Despite the large number of factors contributing to the industry growth, the SSD market is posed with the challenges like entry barriers for new players, data security concerns, competition from solid state arrays. Technological challenges such as transition to 3D NAND and new generation NVM memory also pose serious threat to the industry.

Reuters/Lucas Jackson The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017 is expected to be released early 2017 after the success of its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4. Various reports are hinting at an early 2017 Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date and the Internet is going crazy over its rumoured specs and features. As already pointed out by numerous unconfirmed reports, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017 is getting delayed primarily because of the 14-nanometer Intel Kaby Lake processor and the second major Windows 10 update. Experts believe that the device will be launched by Spring 2017 and could be priced at around US$899 (AU$1,349), writes CNET. Tech enthusiasts expect a major upgrade to the stylus, especially because of the patent filed by Microsoft for the stylus featuring a rechargeable battery system. The patent mentions a magnetic charging dock with connectors for a Surface Dock mounting, writes Mobile & Apps. Improvements are also expected on the screen size and resolution of the Surface Pro 5. Almost seven hours of battery life has also been hinted by reports. A bigger screen with 4K capability may also be incorporated in the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may run on the latest Windows 10 Redstone 2 update, consist of a 16GB RAM and have a longer battery life. When it comes to camera specs, the device may sport a 16MP primary and 8MP front camera. So far none of the rumours have been confirmed. Microsoft has not released any official statement regarding the Surface Pro 5. Fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C ports could be added to the device. Microsoft is offering discounts on its Surface Pro 4 device though iDigital Times believes, this may not be the right time to invest in a Surface Pro 4 as the successor is only a few months away from getting unveiled.

The remarks from Stephen Moore - a senior economic advisor to Mr Trump - suggests that in some areas, the rhetoric may yet become reality. Moore told the BBC that the new administration would follow through on the campaign pledge of slashing America's high corporate tax rate - the highest in the developed world - precipitating a "flood of companies" to leave Ireland and other countries and return to the United States. Given the significant presence US companies have in Ireland, and the level of employment they have provided, the comments are concerning. Collectively, US investment here amounts to $343bn, directly supporting 140,000 jobs, according to the American Chamber of Commerce. The multinational sector is a fundamentally important component of the Irish economy, and our low 12.5pc rate has been a key tool in ensuring its continued success. A cut to the US rate - especially a cut of the magnitude touted by Mr Trump - arguably is a risk to that policy. Whether it is of sufficient threat to, as Mr Moore suggests, precipitate a mass exodus of companies that have in some cases a sizeable base here, seems highly unlikely, experts say. Large employers like Microsoft, Apple, Pfizer and Intel have been here for decades and have very established operations. It's hard to see them suddenly shutting up shop and shipping back across the Atlantic. The Government has repeatedly pointed out that multinationals are here for more than simply the low tax rate (even if it is a considerably enticing factor). They have access to the European market, an educated workforce and are closer in terms of timezones to the Asian market. But the fight for future investment is a concern. Both parties in the US would love to stop the flight of American companies overseas, but they've never managed to agree on how to do it. Now that the Republicans control Congress, the Senate and the White House, and Trump has made returning jobs to the US a cornerstone pledge, the international investment environment looks set to be altered. While existing US companies may stay put, enticing future investment may get more difficult. Firms may feel under pressure to spend more money increasing investment in the United States, instead of expanding overseas. This could be particularly true if Mr Trump follows through on his pledge to give companies a one-time opportunity to pay just 10pc tax to bring home profits. And that could make it harder to attract future US investment, unless, as one tax expert pointed out, Ireland's non-corporate tax offering is particularly attractive. Trump's ascension to power once seemed implausible, and his rhetoric dismissed. We do that now to our peril.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Matheson Signs Agreement with Cathay Pacific Airways for Import/Export Air Cargo Services Between Portland and Asian Markets SACRAMENTO, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Matheson Flight Extenders, Inc., a subsidiary of Matheson Trucking, Inc., signed a freight consolidation agent agreement with Cathay Pacific Airways in October to provide import/export air cargo services at the Portland International Airport for goods transported to and from Oregon and Asian markets. Matheson Flight Extenders, Inc. currently provides airport terminal handling services for U.S. mail in Portland. The company added eight employees to support twice-weekly arrivals and departures of Cathay Pacific’s 747-8F jumbo jet service officially launched November 4. These flights travel between Portland and Hong Kong via Los Angeles and Anchorage. Continue Reading Josh Matheson, Vice President of Operations (left) and Charles Mellor, Chief Operating Officer for Matheson Trucking, Inc., with Oregon Governor Kate Brown at the launch of air cargo service between Portland and Asian markets on November 4, 2016. Matheson Flight Extenders is handling import/export freight consolidation services for Cathay Pacific Airways at its facility at the Portland International Airport. “This is an exciting opportunity for Matheson to once again expand into the international freight arena,” said Charles Mellor, Chief Operating Officer for Matheson. “We handled similar services for Asiana Airlines and are proud to be a key facilitator in the partnership between the Port of Portland and Cathay Pacific. Providing consolidation for import/export goods benefits the economy of Portland and businesses in the region.” Mellor said Cathay contacted Matheson about providing consolidation services. “We quickly presented a bid and began negotiations. The referral was a result of our previous partnership with Asiana. We have the ramp space to park a 747 close to our hanger, making it more convenient to load and unload the aircraft.” Several regional manufacturers, such as Nike, Columbia Sportswear and Intel, are interested in this direct air cargo service. Product categories that could be transported from Portland to Hong Kong include semi-finished footwear and apparel, electronics and perishable goods like blueberries, cherries, Dungeness crab and oysters. Cathay Pacific expects to carry 40 to 60 tons of cargo from Portland every month, even more as demand rises. This new service saves weeks of shipping time compared with marine transport. Port officials said East Asia markets account for over half of Oregon’s air exports, valued at $4.3 billion, currently being shipped through other airports. Matheson Flight Extenders, Inc. and Matheson Postal Services, Inc. are business units of Sacramento-based Matheson Trucking, Inc. In recent years, Matheson’s area of operation has expanded from the Western United States to border-to-border and coast-to-coast. The company provides dedicated local, intermediate, and long haul transportation services over the road, and also has operations at 27 airports across the country throughout the year for the United States Postal Service (USPS).         Photo – http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161110/438153   satprnews.com Author RSS ImportPosted on November 11, 2016Categories Uncategorized Post navigation Previous Previous post: UAE Gems and Jewelry Market By Type(Gold, Diamond in Gold, Gemstones, Diamond, etc.),By Point of Sale(Exclusive Showrooms, Multi Branded Jewellery, Showrooms, etc.), By Organized vs Unorganized, Competition Forecast & Opportunities, 2011 – 2021 Next Next post: Caseology Introduces Stylish Cases for Google Pixel and Pixel XL Search for: Search Recent Posts Vetical.com Introduces Affordable & Secure Cloud Based Veterinary Management Solution for Better Animal Care Healthy Eating Is Finally Practical with the OGarden Insomnia Pipeline Landscape and Therapeutics Development Market Review H2 2016 McKay Brothers Slashes Latency Between Tokyo and Singapore Diet Doc Provides Pharmacy-Grade Weight Loss Solutions and Customized Diet Plans With Ketogenic Diet Recent Comments Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 November 2013 September 2013 June 2013 March 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 July 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 April 2010 March 2010 August 2009 January 1970 Categories Satellite Space Flights Uncategorized VSAT Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Partners TS2 Space Space Flights .news Satellite Press Releases Proudly powered by WordPress

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 11, 2016 -- 00:22 GMT (16:22 PST) | Topic: Hardware Walmart's Black Friday ad includes an Apple iPad mini 2 sale and $119 Chromebook deal. The Black Friday ad wars are finally starting to heat up, with Walmart's ad surfacing shortly after Target's. Like its rival, it has more tablet deals than ads leaked earlier in the cycle -- including Apple's iPad -- along with specials on several low-cost laptops. While Target has three different iPad models on sale, Walmart just has one -- not surprisingly, the Apple's cheapest model. The iPad mini 2 is discounted to $199, 79 cents less than what Target is going to be offering it for. Walmart makes up for it with a number of Android tablet specials, including a 7-inch RCA for just $28. It also has the Samsung Galaxy Tab E Lite 7-inch slate for $69 (99 cents lower than at Staples, with a $10 Google Play thrown in) and the Lenovo Tab 10 model for $99 ($50 off the regular price).

There are a pair of Android 2-in-1 deals in the form of a 10.1-inch SmarTab with Intel Atom processor for $72, and a 11.5-inch RCA Galileo Pro for $98. Given their surging popularity, Chromebooks have been largely unseen in Black Friday ads thus far. Walmart has one, however, at a low price of $119. For that price ($60 less than Samsung is currently selling it for online), the Samsung Chromebook 3 gives you an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, and a 11.6-inch display. If you want a cheap Windows 10 laptop instead, you'll have to pay a bit more ($199) for the HP 15-ba018wm with AMD E2-7110 processor, 4 gigs of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. Walmart has three additional budget notebook listed in Black Friday ad, each with a 15.6-inch displays. These include the HP 15-f222wm with an Intel Pentium N3540 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and touchscreen for $249, and an Acer laptop with Intel Core i5 chip, 6GB of memory, and 1TB hard drive for $299. Finally, for a little more ($349), there's the HP 15-ba051wm with AMD A10-9600P processor, 8GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and choice of chassis color, along with a wireless mouse, 16GB flash drive, and a sleeve included in the price.

By Tas Bindi | November 10, 2016 -- 23:47 GMT (15:47 PST) | Topic: E-Commerce Alibaba Group founder and chairman Jack Ma performing a magic trick at this year's Global Shopping Festival Gala Celebration. Image: Alibaba Group Alibaba Group kicked off its annual shopping event at midnight on Friday and within the first five minutes processed $1 billion in transactions via Alipay. Within two hours, $7.2 billion of gross merchandise volume (GMV) was settled by Alibaba on Alibaba's China and international retail marketplaces, with mobile transactions via Alipay accounting for 84 percent of total GMV. The event, known as the 11.11 shopping festival, begins at 12.00am and lasts 24 hours. Latest news on Asia Huawei and NTT DoCoMo reach 11Gbps speeds in 5G Japanese field trial Phone firmware maker denies handing text message data to Beijing ​Samsung buys NewNet for RCS technology Optus and Huawei clock 35Gbps speeds in 5G trial Low-cost Android phones are secretly sending your messages and contacts to China "Chinese consumers purchased more in the first hour of 11.11 -- $5.2 billion -- this year than the entire 24 hours in 2013," said Daniel Zhang, chief executive officer of Alibaba Group. "This unprecedented level of engagement demonstrates both the consumption power of Chinese consumers and their embrace of online shopping as a lifestyle." China recently dethroned the US as the world's largest market in mobile payments with a transaction volume of $235 billion. At the current growth rate, China is expected to process $6.3 trillion in mobile payments by 2020. For the first time, in the hours leading up to midnight, customers watched Alibaba's Global Shopping Festival Countdown Gala live online and on mobile devices via Youku Tudou and the Tmall and Taobao apps. The gala was also televised live across China through Zhejiang Satellite TV, as well as in Hong Kong and Macau. "Viewers were able to influence the production of the show in real-time through their mobile phones," said Chris Tung, chief marketing officer of Alibaba Group. "Consumers in front of their televisions were shaking, tapping, scanning, chatting, browsing, and buying with their mobile devices, creating a seamless and truly immersive entertainment experience." Last year, Alibaba reported in excess of $1 billion in GMV transactions in the first 8 minutes of 11:11, and $5 billion in the first 90 minutes. The company reported overall revenue of $5.14 billion in the July-September quarter this year. While 83 percent of Alibaba's revenue is commerce related, its cloud computing group Alibaba Cloud has moved up to 4 percent of overall sales from 3 percent a year ago. Alibaba's cloud revenue surged 130 percent from a year ago to $224 million. Alibaba Group also announced this week that it is working with Intel in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and smart hardware, with Intel releasing the first customised CPU for Alibaba Cloud earlier this year. Alibaba and Intel also established a joint innovation centre this year, specialising in the research and development of technology in semiconductor chips, cloud computing, and IoT, and Alibaba believes that AI is key to building out sound infrastructure for commerce. In an effort to expand into Australia, Alipay entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to deliver payment solutions to Australian and Chinese consumers and retailers. Under the agreement, Alipay, which has more than 450 million daily users globally, will be able to use Commonwealth Bank's digital payments infrastructure to enable Australian consumers to make purchases across Alibaba Group's ecommerce websites including AliExpress. The deal with Alipay will also allow Commonwealth Bank to target Chinese tourists -- about 19,000 Chinese tourists visit Australia every week and spend almost AU$8,000 per person -- as well as Chinese students living in Australia.

The Surface Book 2 has yet to be made available. Changes are expected for the upcoming installment of Microsoft's Surface Book after users complained about the device's functionality.  Reports indicated that users of the Microsoft Surface Book all faced similar problems surrounding its design. With the negative feedback regarding the device, many are expecting the company to have a fix for these problems in the upcoming product.  One of these problems was the Surface Book's hinge. Many were complaining that the hinge did not allow the device to close, allowing for dirt to enter it. This brought about a lot of criticism from users and is one of the things that Microsoft will reportedly be changing.  That being said, the new Surface Book is said to address this by presenting a big change to the line. Microsoft will apparently be turning the hinge into a standard one in order to fix the problem. With that, many can look forward to a better device that will also be more aesthetically pleasing.  The upcoming Surface Book 2 is said to be similar to its predecessor in terms of some of its aesthetics too. However, a lot of other improvements are expected. It was stated that the new model will allow for better graphics, reaching up to 3840 x 2160 pixels. In addition, it will likely include Intel's new Kaby Lake processor which will boost the device's performance. The battery life of the device is also going to be improved. Since the device also features the highly acclaimed Surface Pen, innovations on the accessory are expected as well. With that, Microsoft is said to include a built-in dock that will power up and recharge the additional gadget. This change is pivotal for the franchise, as the Surface Pen is one of the device's selling points.  However, there has yet to be any news on the official specs of the upcoming device. Many are expecting it to be unveiled early 2017. Fans will have to wait for more updates on the matter.  Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it RECOMMENDED Ukrainian conflict East Europe's worst crisis since World War 2, says archbishop S.

About Us Contact HOME Financials Technology Consumer Discretionary Healthcare Energy Gaming Search Technology Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Tipped To Refresh Its Most Popular MacBook Offering: Report Published By Blake Audett at November 12, 2016 08:25 am Last month, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made big waves in the tech world with the release of its new and shiny models of the MacBook Pro. However, the Cupertino-based tech giant did not reveal a refreshed line of its MacBook Air which led users to believe that the company is on the path of discontinuing its entry-level notebook offering. Interestingly, a new publication from the International Business Times AU notes that Apple is still looking to refresh its current-generation MacBook Air. Even though the 13-inch model of the new MacBook Pro is slimmer and lighter than the current MacBook Air but MacBook users were still left devastated when they found out that the company could potentially discontinue one of its most popular and certainly cheapest notebook offering. Hence, Apple would not want to risk upsetting its users, so the arrival of the much-discussed MacBook Air 2017 is still on the cards. MacBook Air 2017: International Business Times AU states that the first thing that users can expect from the nex-generation MacBook Air is that the device should be slightly thinner and lighter, compared to the new models of the MacBook Pro. Also, it is unlikely that the next-gen MacBook Air will incorporate standard USB A ports. Instead, the upcoming notebook is tipped to harness faster connectivity of the new USB Type-C ports. Furthermore, Apple would want to incorporate new features in its next-gen MacBook Air, similar to the Touch Bar introduced on the new MacBook Pro. There are rumors that the upcoming notebook could sport an E-ink keyboard, designed by Sonder Design, which could help the device stand apart from its competition. It would be highly welcomed if the next-generation MacBook Air arrives with the latest Intel Kaby Lake processing chipset, but nothing is confirmed regarding this aspect. Unfortunately, Apple continues to remain secretive regarding its upcoming projects which make it tough to assess what its next MacBook Air notebook will feature. Hopefully, the Cupertino company has lined up a host of surprises in an updated version of its most popular notebook offering, ever.  Stay tuned for more updates regarding Apple’s upcoming projects.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Dell Stack + Dock looks gorgeous (new render) 4 by Surur  @mspoweruser Nov 12, 2016 at 14:25 GMT4 days ago Talking about devices from the graveyard, Evan Blass (aka evLeaks) has posted another render of the Dell Stack, a Windows 10 tablet with LTE capabilities that would have allowed consumers to carry their whole work environment with them, and dock to access larger screens and keyboards when in the office. Telephony would have been managed via VOIP apps like Skype making it a full featured device for most work needs. The picture shows the dock above, and demonstrates how thin the envisioned device is. The handset was supposed to run Windows 10 on a full Intel Kaby Lake mobile processor, so we assume the second slot was for an extra battery. The device  was envisioned as a 6.4 inch to 7 inch Full HD mini tablet/phablet style device which would be the brains for a desktop, laptop and tablet-like experience and would have featured between 4GB to 8GB of RAM (the first on a mobile device), with 128GB and 256GB of Storage coming along for the ride. In 2014 the device was expected to ship in 2017, though the project is currently believed to have been shelved. Read more about the device here.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases The Linux Foundation’s Core Infrastructure Initiative Renews Funding for Reproducible Builds Project Grant Helps Fund New Developers Working on Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD to Improve Software Security and Control SAN FRANCISCO, CA–(Marketwired – November 11, 2016) – The Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), a project managed by The Linux Foundation that enables technology companies, industry stakeholders and developers to collaboratively identify, fund and improve the security of critical open source projects, today announced continued financial support for the Reproducible Builds Project. The grant extends the contribution to include Debian developers Chris Lamb, Mattia Rizzolo, Ximin Lao and Vagrant Cascadian, as well as extending funding for Holger Levsen. Furthermore, this contribution adds support for Ed Maste, working with FreeBSD. While anyone can inspect the source code of free software for malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary (or compiled) packages to end users. The motivation behind “reproducible” builds is to allow verification that no flaws have been introduced during the compilation process by endeavouring that identical binary packages are generated from a given source. This prevents the installation of backdoor-introducing malware on developers’ machines as an attacker would need to simultaneously infect all developers attempting to reproduce the build. “Ensuring that no flaws are introduced during the build process greatly improves software security and control,” said Lamb. “Our work has already made significant progress in Debian GNU/Linux, and we are making our tools available for Fedora, Guix, Ubuntu, OpenWrt and other distributions. Support from CII will allow us to expand our efforts to work on longer-term commitments such as upstream patches requiring significant technical and time investment, as well as work on the infrastructure required to make Reproducible Builds both meaningful and approachable for end-users.” Technical advantages of a reproducible build include removing unsafe behavior, such as downloading third-party code from the internet, detecting corrupted build environments, reducing time-to-detection of a build host compromise, as well as numerous other debugging and testing advantages. Last year CII funded Levsen and Jérémy Bobbio’s efforts to eliminate unneeded variations from the build processes of thousands of free software projects. They also delivered new tools to understand the source of these differences and an infrastructure update to allow developers to independently verify the authenticity of binary distributions. Their efforts, combined with those from the rest of the Reproducible Builds Project, have resulted in 91% of the packages within the Debian testing distribution becoming reproducible. About The Core Infrastructure Initiative CII is a multimillion-dollar project that funds and supports critical elements of the global information infrastructure. It is organized by The Linux Foundation and supported by Amazon Web Services, Bloomberg, Cisco, Dell, Facebook, Fujitsu, Google, Hitachi, HP, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NetApp, NEC, Qualcomm, RackSpace, salesforce.com, and VMware. Moving beyond funding projects, CII is introducing preemptive tools and programs to help the open source ecosystem and the companies who support it deploy secure coding practices. For a full list of CII grantees, please visit: https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/grants. About The Linux Foundation The Linux Foundation is the organization of choice for the world’s top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. Together with the worldwide open source community, it is solving the hardest technology problems by creating the largest shared technology investment in history.

Phillip M. Rayer II, general manager, Local Motors, described how his company uses "co-creation" -- involving as many as 50,000 developers -- to design driverless electric vehicles for target communities. Local Motors uses 3D printing to manufacture the vehicles in months rather than years. "Today's transportation system is characterized largely by privately owned, individually driven, gas-powered vehicles that sit unused 95 percent of the time, cost over $1 trillion annually and emit 1 gigaton of emissions each year," Phillip M. Rayer II, general manager, Local Motors. "A more cost-effective, efficient, equitable and convenient system is possible -- one that delivers a variety of shared, electrified and autonomous mobility options when and where they are needed. We call this 'mobility as a service' -- and we have proven it through the first 3D-printed structural car and the first self-driving electric vehicle to integrate the advanced cognitive computing capabilities of IBM Watson. Through co-creation, we are now working on the first 3D-printed driverless car for highways." Cameron Coursey, vice president of product development for AT&T's Internet of Things Solutions, told MEMS and sensors suppliers that they play a critical role in the "Fourth Industrial Revolution": the Internet of Things (IoT). Dan Hyman, president, XCOM Wireless, and partner, Icarus Technologies, Inc. introduced attendees to the concept of "democratizing airspace to defend against drones." Leveraging RF MEMS from XCOM Wireless, Icarus develops portable, affordable counter-drone products to stop drones used unwittingly by dangerous hobbyists as well as by willful enemies. MEMS & Sensors Industry Group Executive Director Karen Lightman expanded upon themes from MEMS & Sensors Executive Congress," In MEMS and sensors, there is a need for co-creation, standards, connectivity and audio technologies that enhance voice user interface as well as ultrasonics that redefine gesture control," said Lightman. "There was a collective buzz around driverless mobility solutions and environmental sensing. Attendees also learned about future-term technologies such as perpetual energy sources for autonomous sensing devices and printed hybrid electronics. As we look to 2017 and beyond, MEMS and sensors suppliers will continue to advance the user experience with every imaginable electronic product and system." Tech Showcase Winner and Hall of Fame MEMS & Sensors Technology Showcase is a forum through which five finalists competed for attendees' votes and the title of "winner." The 2016 Technology Showcase winner, i-BLADES' mobile Smartcase, is a new modular accessory that dramatically accelerates time to market and reach for IoT technologies. It lets new technologies quickly reach mass-market mobile consumers through one integrated smartphone accessory -- a mobile phone case that forms a "hard-wired" smartphone connection, enabling add-on MEMS and IoT technologies. MEMS & Sensors Industry Group also inducted three new members into the MEMS & Sensors Industry Group Hall of Fame: Ken Foust, platform manager, Intel Corporation; Dave Monk, vice president and general manager of motion sensors, NXP Semiconductor; and Jason Weigold, president, MEMStaff. Upcoming Events MSIG will also host a full-day conference track at 2017 International CES, MEMS & Sensors: Personalizing Consumer Technology, January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas, NV. MEMS & Sensors Technical Congress will take place May 10-11, 2017 at Stanford University in Stanford, CA.

Offering the latest in storage and aesthetic technologies, the X99A TOMAHAWK aims to meet the market's demand for strong basic features on a refreshed X99 motherboard.   While many gamers like the idea of building PCs based on the color theme of different components, it's rare that the color of the various components match. The mismatch of color might even lead to product choices based on aesthetics rather than performance or price, but with the X99A TOMAHAWK, you won't have to make these sacrifices.     For many years, builders have asked for more color neutral products, but out of fear of being too bland, vendors have avoided putting these types of products out to market. As a refreshed X99 motherboard, the X99A TOMAHAWK offers U.2, x4 PCI-E 3.0 M.2, and of course, RGB LED support. Surprisingly, the motherboard also has dual Intel NICs. The X99A TOMAHAWK is designed and marketed as a mid-range X99 motherboard, but let's see what it has to offer.     Specifications     The X99A TOMAHAWK has three x16 PCI-E slots and supports 3-way SLI/CrossFireX. It also supports USB 3.1 Gen 2 (which I will just call USB 3.1), USB 3.1 Gen 1 (which I will call USB 3.0), x4 PCI-E 3.0 and SATA based M.2, U.2, SATA Express, and dual Intel 1Gbit LAN.     Pricing   The X99A TOMAHAWK is available from many large retailers for roughly $240.

Photo credit: (Graphic courtesy Memoori) | Share | Share | Share | Share As anyone who closely follows the security industry can attest, video surveillance manufacturers have been impacted by a variety of changing market dynamics in recent years, including increased competition from Asian-based suppliers as well as the growing commoditization of hardware and a need to develop products that will meet the needs of tomorrow’s Smart Cities.  According to our new annual report, The Physical Security Business 2016 to 2021: Access Control, Intruder Alarms & Video Surveillance, the total value of physical security products at factory gate prices is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.65 percent over the five years to over $37 billion in 2021. Over the last five years, the total market has grown at a CAGR of 8.2 percent, but there has been a significant fall in growth over the past two years as the developed markets of North America and Europe have continued to lose market share to Asia and China, in particular.  The video surveillance manufacturing business, with the exception of a minor blip in 2009, has delivered consistent profitable growth over the last decade. This is a great achievement considering the difficult trading conditions brought about by the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Fortunately, latent demand was there to be exploited by an industry that managed to improve the performance of all components – particularly video cameras and the development of IP network cameras. So, is the industry now ready for the new challenges and opportunities in the next decade? Our report identifies three major issues that will most influence the shape of the industry in the next decade and sets out the strategies to meet the needs of the new and very exacting challenges ahead. 1. The Chinese Influence The first and most immediate challenge for Western-based manufacturers is the need to scale up volume, and they must do it quickly. These companies have within five years been completely out flanked by Chinese manufacturers Hikvision and Dahua. Formed relatively recently and not even regarded as serious competitors by most suppliers only six years ago, they now dominate the mainstream market. Both companies specialize in video surveillance, and are now by far the largest two video surveillance companies in the world, with combined revenues of around $5 billion. Until more recently, they did not have products at the leading edge of technology in the high-growth IP network camera business, but that has obviously changed. The last two years has seen a slowing down in revenue growth of the world’s video surveillance business, which is not attributable to a decline in demand, but instead due to aggressive pricing by Chinese manufacturers. They have adopted this strategy in order to win market share and scale up volume to take advantage of future commoditization. The major concern of western manufacturers in the video surveillance industry today is how to counter the phenomenal growth of Chinese products rapidly winning market share in their local markets without reducing their prices to derisory margins, which would not be sufficient to properly recoup their R&D costs. There is no indication that Chinese suppliers will change their pricing strategy, as it is clearly working for them. At the same time, they have almost total control of their home market, which is the largest single country market in the world – and is protected by the fact that more than 50 percent of the business comes from the country’s public sector. Imported equipment is not going to win this business. A possible solution is for major western companies to merge or acquire video surveillance companies if they want to remain viable in the mainstream market. This would bring about major structural change in the industry. Even if that option is not taken, major structural change could be inevitable. In our new report, we have identified other solutions that could provide a profitable existence but they go down the specialization route, which ultimately could force companies into becoming system integrators. 2. 'Siliconization' of Video Cameras The second and interlinked factor in all this is the commoditization of video cameras, which has an inextricable connection for the need to go for volume. Western manufacturers have sophisticated products and know-how that they have built into their cameras and software; however, over the next five years, much of this will be built into the silicon chipsets by manufacturers like Ambarella and Movidius. "Siliconization" of video cameras has been taking place over the last few years, with the functionality of complex megapixel cameras becoming integrated onto chips. Chipset providers are already able to deliver sophisticated camera functionality in silicon today and you can expect them to move this forward. Now, major chip manufacturers like Intel and Qualcomm are seeing the potential for video cameras to be the “king of sensors” in Smart Cities – prompting them to move into producing the next generation of video chips. In the case of Intel, they have also developed a software platform on which middleware for all the services that go into delivering a Building Internet of Things (BIoT) can reside. 3. Data Processing This now brings us to the third major challenge: how to process all the data streams from millions of video cameras and make sense out of it all. This will not be achieved by humans watching screens and aided by relatively simple analytical software that can identify and pinpoint interesting and unusual activity. It will only be achieved by using computer algorithms and Big Data software to analyze and automatically take action. Nothing short of this will fulfill the promise of IoT and take video surveillance into another realm. The returns for those that succeed will far exceed what has so far been achieved by successful video surveillance companies.

News & Analysis Supercomputer Aims for Exascale U.S. effort discloses $34M in software projects Rick Merritt 11/10/2016 07:00 AM EST Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — U.S. government researchers will spend $34 million on 35 software projects as part of an effort to put in production by 2023 an exascale-class supercomputer. It’s one small step in an initiative eventually expected to cost more than $3 billion to push computing to levels 50 times ahead of their current 20 petaflop systems. The news comes at a time when China, Europe, Japan and the U.S. are all racing to the next milestone in computer performance. With three projects in China compared to one just getting started in the U.S., “it looks like China will get to an exaflop by 2020…[while the U.S.] will probably reach exascale by 2022-2023,” said Jack Dongarra, co-author of the Top 500 List and a professor at the University of Tennessee working on multiple software projects for the U.S. effort. China has held the first place on the Top 500 list for more than three years, most recently with the first supercomputer based on homegrown processors. China’s initial systems are expected to deliver a peak performance of an exaflop on the Linpack benchmark. In an interview with EE Times, U.S. researchers said that they aim to design systems with sustained exascale performance on real applications. They hope to announce early next year details of six companies selected to build the underlying hardware. The effort could help establish new memory, processor and systems technologies and give a foothold to new high-end programming techniques. “It’s a full court press on issues like energy consumption, massive parallel processing…the architectures are complex so programming is difficult and memory and storage are always issues,” said Paul Messina, director of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Exascale Computing Project, spearheading the U.S. National Strategic Computing Initiative. The group is in negotiations with six vendors whose proposals it selected in August to split $300M in the first phase of the hardware design effort. “Our solicitation stated we wanted better node and systems designs for our broad kinds of applications in areas such as chemical, material and fluid analysis, technologies likely far enough along that they could be bid in 2019 when the first request for proposals for exascale production systems go out,” Messina said. Companies including AMD, IBM, Intel and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise proposed a variety of node, system and memory designs. “A sizeable fraction proposed new interfaces to memory or new memory technologies or both, you can imagine photonic links, for example,” he said. A new class of memory architectures that use less power or provide faster response times are one of industry developments giving Messina confidence the project can achieve its ambitious goals. The proposals will compete to define two different systems researchers aim to take into production. “We want these to be part of vendors’ regular product lines, not one-of-a-kind systems, but something others can buy, too — we are trying to create an ecosystem,” Messina said.

Read the current issue and access the magazine archives at www.secdealer.com. | Share | Share | Share | Share Two years ago, I had my first opportunity to roam the gigantic show floors at International CES. On a personal level, it forever changed the way I perceive a trade show and how to attack it – especially ISC West, which is the security industry’s closest facsimile (and it doesn’t even come close). My other major take-away from the CES show floor was how it truly gives our industry a look into its future. Yes, CES is for consumers, and a great deal of the products and innovations are designed for lifestyle and entertainment; however, a good chunk of the technologies – even the ones for entertainment – are on the bleeding edge of the security space.   Smart Home Vivint, Honeywell, ADT and other major security service providers have found a new home at CES in the smart home/technology area. Soon enough, everything that can possibly be smart in our homes will be connected – last year at CES, there were smart stoves and fridges; from smart ceiling fans to frying pans and everywhere in between. Vivint, in fact, announced full integration with the Amazon Echo platform at CES 2016 – giving your customers full voice control over every smart element in their homes. Alexa, turn on my lights...Alexa, make it warmer in here...you get the idea. Alexa (and her competing cousin Siri), in fact, were all over last year’s show, as companies scrambled to make their tech products compatible with voice control. Obviously, this is a harbinger of greater adoption in the security industry – from smart home customers to small and large businesses. Smart companies in our industry are integrating with DIY and consumer tech as much as possible. ADT, for example, partnered with LG to develop the LG Smart Security Solution – a connected cam with a 152-degree field of view packaged together with a smart home hub, environmental monitor and siren. ADT also announced it would support professional central monitoring for the device via its new Canopy service, designed to offer central monitoring for a variety of DIY smart home devices and hubs.   Video Innovation & Virtual Reality It seems like a distant memory among the regular attendees of CES, but 4K video and display, and H.265 were once “the thing” on the show floor. We all know how those technologies are infiltrating the security industry at this very moment. In 2016, “the thing” in the video space actually mirrored the security industry: 360-degree video. Nikon announced a shock-resistant, waterproof personal camera (a GoPro competitor) that could shoot 4K ultra high definition (UHD) video with a 360-degree field of view and electronic image stabilization. Many DIY home security cameras were on display, and one that caught many eyes was zmodo’s pivoting security camera – which uses a 360-degree motion sensor to enable it to detect motion in an entire room and then turn the camera to record it. Even if your customers dont have it themselves, it sure sounds like technology that would and should be imitated in the commercial security space! Other interesting tidbits included: The Toucan from Kuna, which transforms an existing light fixture into one equipped with a security camera and motion sensor; and the Netatmo Presence home security camera, which features the type of video analytics in professional security – detecting the difference between cars, people and animals. VR and its cousin, augmented reality, are only for the video gamers, right? Wrong! Many pundits called CES 2016 the year of VR, and its uses extend far past your kid’s Playstation. Here’s a great example: Intel's Daqri smart helmet is intended for real-life work situations where people must keep their hands free to do installation, repair, etc. Imagine your security technician on a ladder wearing this helmet – his or her hands would be free to install the camera while an instruction manual or schematic hovers in the virtual space next to it. VR is also being used for system design and implementation; in fact, one such system was on display at ASIS this year (read more in Ray Coulombe’s Tech Trends column this month).   Make the Trip CES is in early January, so there is still time to get it on your calendar. If you own or manage a security services company, it might behoove you to take a day or two and head to Vegas – rest assured, you won’t be disappointed (consider it a perk of upper management). For those of you reading this who cannot spare the time or the expense, I would highly encourage you to follow the trends and read as much as you can from sources like CNET to get a feel for the technologies that are right around the corner in the industry you serve.    Paul Rothman is Editor in Chief of Security Dealer & Integrator (SD&I) magazine.

The Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh announced that it gave Federation money to the Bhutanese community, the Japan America Society, Junior Achievement of Western Pennsylvania and the World Refugee Day event. How could those people help us combat anti-Semitism and the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel? More important, would they even try? For 2,000 years, we have been persecuted — not because of our religion, but because we have been economically successful. In every country, we turned a bunch of dirt farmers into an agrarian economy. Some Jews became wealthy and powerful. Some locals wanted that wealth and power for themselves; so they played the religion card. The peasants were uneducated and totally ignorant about what Jews had brought to their economy. They could easily believe all the lies about Jews. Thus, the persecution repeated over and over again. If you would like to forget that history, then remember what George Santayana said: “Those who fail to understand history are doomed to repeat it.” Look around you. Since the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, the Jewish community has flourished both financially and socially, but the anti-Semites and the BDS people are getting stronger. Our persecution scenario is repeating. In order to avoid the same ending to that story, we have to fight back. We cannot fight anti-Semitism and BDS head on, because for every fire that we can put out, they can start 10 more. However, their success or failure depends on supporting approval from the general public. Take away that public support, and they cease to be a problem. We are the best educated civilization in the history of mankind, but our gentile neighbors still do not know what Jews have contributed to the civilization that they enjoy. We do not have to brag; all we have to do is tell them of all the things that Jews have contributed to civilization, and the gentiles will draw their own conclusions. Jews have touched the lives of everyone in Pittsburgh. The Pirates exist because a Jew named Barney Dreyfuss turned a losing team into a success. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra exists today because a Jew named Bertha Rauh led the fundraising campaign in 1926. Point Park University began as a business school operated by Dorothy and Harold Finkelhor. Dr. Jonas Salk led the team that created the polio vaccine. Maurice Falk donated the Falk Clinic at UPMC. Phil Hallen, as the director of the Falk Foundation, orchestrated the pilot program that became the prototype for all emergency medical services worldwide. A Jew named Thomas P. Detre was the visionary leader who transformed UPMC into the top-flight treatment facility, medical school and research powerhouse that it is today. The KDKA Turkey Drive was created by KDKA commentator Al Julius. Giant Eagle and Levin Furniture were founded by Jewish families, and they employ thousands of Pittsburghers. Look beyond Pittsburgh: The cell phone was invented by Motorola at its facility in Israel. A Jew named Phillipe Kahn invented the cell phone camera. Andrew Grove was a co-founder of INTEL, which made the microprocessor in your computer. The Windows operating system was created in Israel. Google was invented partially by Jews, and Facebook was as well. Myspace, Paypal, Instagram and TripAdvisor were also founded or co-founded by Jews. Two months ago, many learned those stories at the Pittsburgh Folk Festival at the Israel booth. The booth was not staffed on Saturday, but anyone could walk through and learn what was being presented. They were confronted by a 10-by-10 mockup of the Western Wall with a picture of the real Kotel and an explanation of why that is a holy Jewish site. There were also pictures of Pope Francis and President Obama placing their prayers between the stones of the wall. Visitors were invited to do the same, and 73 people did! On the Sunday of the festival, we had a Torah for our guests to see. There are many ethnic festivals throughout America, but the local Jewish community usually does not participate because the festival usually occurs during Shabbat. That is unnecessary. I design the Israel booth so that a stranger can walk through the booth and glean most of the information I want them to learn without any staff. The booth is erected on Friday before Shabbat, and the booth is taken apart after Shabbat. Ethnic festivals are an opportunity to communicate with our gentile neighbors. Not participating in the festival makes us look like snobs! I pay the costs of participation in the Folk Festival out of my own pocket, not from community grants. Lee Feldman lives in Dormont.

(Thinkstock photo) A majority of companies in India have introduced a clutch of initiatives like adoption leave and second-career programmes to attract and retain young mothers at workplace, says a study that is conducted by diversity advocate and workplace inclusion expert AVTAR Group and Working Mother Media, a gender-parity champion in the United States, said the women-oriented initiatives are helping young mothers rejoin the workforce. The study said 18 companies introduced 6 months of fully paid maternity leave in 2015 and a significant 86 per cent of companies have rolled out paternity policies at workplace. Second-career programmes stand out to be the most effective of all for helping young mothers in rejoining the workforce. Around 52 per cent companies allow an average of 6.3 months of phase-back, in addition to paid maternity leave, for young mothers rejoining after their maternity breaks. Accenture, Cummins India and Deloitte India have been named among the top 10 best companies for women in India (in alphabetical order). Others in the top 10 list include EY India, Hindustan Unilever, IBM India, ICICI Bank, Intel Technology India, Mindtree Technologies, Morgan Stanley and People Combine Educational Initiatives. “Creating an inclusive environment that enables women to achieve both their personal and professional ambitions, reflects Accenture’s core values and culture,” said Rekha M Menon, Chairman and Managing Director, Accenture in India.

The development was announced in an internal email sent by Snapdeal’s co-founder and chief operating officer Rohit Bansal to employees on Wednesday. A copy of the email has been reviewed by Techcircle. “Market development, Category Management and part of Brand alliances teams are being consolidated into one team, which will be led by Vishal Chadha. Within Vishal’s team, we will move to a business unit structure where all category managers, key account managers, brand partnership managers, and most other functions pertaining to a category will become a part of the same business unit,” said Bansal in the email. Vishal Chadha is senior vice president at Snapdeal, while vice president Saurabh Bansal who was vice president and head of category management is moving to head Snapdeal Instant. Snapdeal Instant was launched last year in July to allow delivery of goods within an hour of placing the order. The reason for these changes is not known. “Seller partner facing functions have been clubbed to align workflows and enhance synergies. It does not in any way adversely impact teams or individuals,” a company spokesperson told Techcircle on the realignment but did not disclose further details. The Times of India was the first to report the development on Friday. Over the last few days, the social media has been abuzz with rumours of top level exits from Snapdeal. The company has strongly refuted these reports. Each of the category business units will now have four broad work streams—portfolio management, key accounts management, brand alliances management, and products life-cycle management. “The pricing analytics team will now roll up to Anubhav Goyal and Tony Navin will be heading strategic partnerships and new initiatives for Snapdeal,” the email added. Goyal is now the head of analytics, product and user growth and Navin is now senior vice president of partnerships and strategic initiatives. Techcircle could not immediately ascertain what exactly the earlier structure was at the firm. Bansal added that “this new structure will be completed within the next one week.” Snapdeal is in the midst of several developments. VCCircle had reported in August that Snapdeal has initiated preliminary talks with staunch rivals Flipkart and Amazon to explore a possible merger. Snapdeal’s biggest investor SoftBank marked down its investment in the company recently. SoftBank holds a significant minority stake in Snapdeal. It had led a $627 million round of investment in the company in late 2014 followed by another round of $500 million last year. In total, Snapdeal has raised nearly $1.65 billion from about two dozen investors. These include SoftBank and SoftBank-backed Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, global online marketplace eBay Inc., Indian media company Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd, and venture capital investors such as Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Iron Pillar, Kalaari Capital and Ratan Tata. Snapdeal, Flipkart and other Indian e-commerce firms have spent heavily on discounts and marketing over the past few years, as they focused on building a strong customer base, before working toward profitability. This widened losses at the top e-commerce companies. Snapdeal, founded by Kunal Bahl and Bansal in 2010, has also been trying to cut costs and focus more on profitability. The pressure on Snapdeal is also evident from two recent developments. The company has shut down Exclusively.com, a marketplace for premium branded fashion and lifestyle products, about 18 months after acquiring the startup. It has also been in talks with several investors, including Foxconn, to sell a stake in its payments unit FreeCharge. Snapdeal had acquired FreeCharge in early 2015. Last month, Snapdeal’s rival Flipkart, which is India’s biggest online marketplace, had also made some changes in its top management, as it chief financial officer Sanjay Baweja quit, during the October festive season.

The folks behind the Eve V 2-in-1 tablet, however, have taken a rather revolutionary, and most likely risky, approach. Right from the very beginning, they’ve asked would-be backers what they want. Of course, the startup eventually needed to put its foot down somewhere, and the foot has indeed come down. The specs for the Eve V have just been finalized, and the tablet is finally ready to head to Indiegogo for the real litmus test. If you ask people what they want in a computer, you will most likely run into some unreasonable expectations or unfeasible requests. And yet, the final list of specs for the Eve V still looks like a Christmas wish list. Or at least what Surface Pro 4 owners would have put in if they had been involved in the design of Microsoft’s tablet. Comparisons between the two will be unavoidable, as the Eve V’s hardware pretty much outclasses or is on par with the Surface Pro 4. For example, the tablet would run on Intel’s 7th gen “Kaby Lake” processors, from m3 to i5 to i7. RAM will come in 8 or 16 GB options, and storage ranges from 128 to 512 GB SSDs. The screen is particularly curious, a 12.3-inch 2736×1824 Sharp IGZO IPS LCD panel. And the battery is a good 10 watts more than the Surface at 48 Wh. The parallels don’t stop there, of course., The tablet will also support N-Trig, the very same digitizer technology used by the Surface Pro 3 and later models. The very design of the tablet, including the kickstand, is near identical to the Surface Pro. And yet, for all of these, the Eve V’s starting price on Indiegogo will be less than $1,000. The Eve V computer is finally launching on Indiegogo this November 21, where it will be facing the really tough questions. Will there be enough interest to fund the actual product, at that high a price. And more importantly, will a small startup be able to deliver a product that a giant like Microsoft wasn’t able to.

Andrew Cuomo, Onondaga County Executive Joanie Mahoney and President and CEO of Empire State Development Howard Zemsky in Syracuse on Thursday. Tom Magnarelli / WRVO News Listen Listening... / 1:25 Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a $30 million dollar airstrip that will test unmanned aircraft or drones will be built in central New York. The flight traffic management system is part of an overall push to drive the drone industry into the region. Speaking at the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management Convention in Syracuse, Cuomo said the airstrip is an investment in an industry that is going to be developed somewhere, so why not here. “We believe that’s going to be very effective in luring these companies, because they need that facility,” Cuomo said. “There’s not a lot of places you can find a 50-mile airstrip to test drones. You don’t run across them everyday.” Onondaga County is home to radar and sensor companies used by drones. County Executive Joanie Mahoney said industry leaders say they need the infrastructure to test and create the traffic rules for commercial drones. “Amazon, your local pizza place, there are no rules in place for how that traffic is managed," Mahoney said. "We know that traffic is managed at higher altitudes with the military, but this whole new industry is being created.” It’s an industry that could be worth a trillion dollars. President and CEO of Empire State Development Howard Zemsky said they are committed to building on the area's strategic assets. "You already have a lot of sensor and related technology companies here in the region," Zemsky said. "You really have a growing, dynamic industry that needs this type of traffic management testing system. By putting in the public infrastructure, you can be assured that the governor is intent on attracting private investment. At a conference like this, you have companies like Amazon, Google, Intel and others. It's not everyday that you've got representatives of the fastest growing, largest tech companies in the world right here in Syracuse. This is a very important conference. It says a lot about the credibility this industry puts in central New York that they host their conference here, the first one at NASA, the second one in Syracuse." Money awarded through the Upstate Revitalization Initiative will be used to build the airstrip by 2018.

Zuckerberg: Facebook didn't influence US election result Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has spoken out against claims that the social network influenced the outcome of the US presidential election due to the effect of fake news stories and 'filter bubbles' on users' news feeds (TechCrunch). Speaking at Techonomy16, Zuckerberg said: “Personally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it’s a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.” He also noted that "the biggest filter in the system is not that the content isn’t there, or that you don’t have friends who support the other candidate, or who are from another religion, but that you just tune it out when you see it."

Mars image analysis reveals that Beagle 2 landed safely in 2003 Scientists working with images showing the 2003's failed Beagle 2 Mars lander on the red planet's surface have concluded that it successfully landed on the Martian surface and deployed three of its four solar panels (Space.com). However, the European lander's failure to deploy its fourth panel is likely to have hindered its ability to communicate with Earth, explaining its radio silence. Former Beagle 2 mission manager Mark Sims said that "we have gathered more information on the failure of Beagle 2 to communicate, and we are one step closer to knowing what happened'. 3. EU antitrust case: Google maintains that Android hasn't blocked competition Google has responded to the European Commission's claims that it has abused Android's market position with a flat denial (Ars Technica). Smartphone makers who wish to include the Google Play store on their Android devices are contractually obliged to include a number of other Google apps, most notably Google Search. Google says that such business practices are neither anti-competitive nor unusual in the mobile phone market. Google general counsel Kent Walker said that "the commission argues that we shouldn’t offer some Google apps as part of a suite. No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone, you can access a familiar set of basic services. Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice." 4. Scottish island to use spare TV spectrum to speed up broadband Spare radio frequency spectrum left over from the digital TV switchover will be used improve broadband access on the Scottish island of Arran (WIRED). The rollout, the first of its kind in Europe, will be used to improve broadband speeds for the island’s 5,000 residents. It’s hoped the use of TV white space can help bridge the urban-rural broadband divide and better connect the UK’s more remote communities. The technology is being rolled-out through a partnership between internet firm Nominet and broadband campaign group Broadway Partners. TV white space has been trialled and teased as a potentially useful technology ever since vast swathes became available when the UK completed its move to digital TV in October 2012.

Video: Researchers tickle delighted rats – for science German researchers have identified the part of the brain that causes ticklishness, with the help of some delighted rats (Science). The scientists recorded brain activity in the rodents' somatosensory cortex while they were being tickled. During tickling play, the team noted an increase in the rate at which cells fired, which they were able to replicate by applying light electrical stimulation to the same part of the brain. The study provides new insight not only into how to make a happy rat laugh, but also into the nature of the human tickle response. 8.

Published on November 11, 2016 at 12:38 am Last update on November 11, 2016 at 12:44 am By Wesley Story A UT professor will receive $825,000 over the next three years to help reach his goal of creating the world’s thinnest silicon transistor. Associate professor Deji Akinwande from the Cockrell School of Engineering was among five inventors selected by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for a fellowship program on Nov. 2. The program, new to the foundation this year, aims to recognize innovators early in their careers. Akinwande was chosen for his cutting-edge work with silicene, a 2-D silicon structure as thin as an atom. He hopes to use the silicon structure to make transistors. Transistors are used in virtually all electronic devices, including cell phones and computers. A hyper-thin silicon structure could provide a tenfold increase in energy efficiency for integrated circuits within those devices, according to the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation website. Akinwande said in the three-year time frame of the fellowship, his goal is to reach the next level of prototype development and generate interest among industry partners. “We’re going to focus on what we’ve been doing, but now we’re going to take it to the applied level of development,” Akinwande said. “Commercialization could take another decade or so, but it’s too early to say.”   Gordon Moore, one of the foundation’s founders and a co-founder of Intel, noticed in 1965 that the number of transistors per square inch on the integrated circuit doubles every year. This observation became known as “Moore’s Law” and helped set the pace for modern digital technology. Bob Kirshner, chief program officer for science at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, said the foundation wanted to mark the 50th anniversary of Moore’s Law with the new fellowship program. “We thought as a tribute to Gordon Moore, it would be appropriate to do something that emphasized the role of scientific inventors, of whom Gordon Moore is a very good example,” Kirshner said. The foundation plans to invest nearly $34 million in the next ten years to support 50 Moore Inventor Fellows, and accelerate progress in scientific research Ahmed Tewfik, chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said students could have the opportunity to get involved with Akinwande’s research at the college. “That’s one of the advantages to being in a research university as opposed to a teaching-only university,” Tewfik said.  View the discussion thread.

The SDP market is expected to grow significantly due to the rising need for security mechanisms that can protect dispersed enterprise applications. SDP solutions make security infrastructure easy to configure, manage, and control through policy-driven, scalable, and programmable security architecture without requiring high level of expertise, which also drives the demand of the SDP solutions.

At first sight, the EliteBook Folio G1 may appear to be the ultraportable you’ve been dreaming of. Ever since the sub-1kg MacBook arrived on the scene, Apple’s featherweight has been emptying bank accounts and – HP’s stratospherically expensive Folio 1020 aside – competitors have been in irksomely short supply. Now, finally, HP has provided a MacBook alternative that doesn’t require you to recant your allegiance to Microsoft. Unashamed luxury Spending north of $2,600 sets a certain level of expectation, but the Folio G1 delivers. The look and feel is unashamedly luxurious, and HP has squared off the soft, rounded curves of the Folio 1020 to give the Folio G1 a sharply angled makeover. If polished diamond-cut CNC aluminium appeals, you’ll love it. Build quality is impeccable. HP has subjected the Folio G1 to a barrage of military tests – the MIL-810-STD certification, to be precise – which consist of dropping the device 26 times from 76cm onto a hard floor, caking it with dust and subjecting it to extremes of altitude and temperature. Pretty much your average day in the PC & Tech Authority office. In short, this is a featherweight laptop that’s certified to survive a battering. Rigid plates of metal are clasped together with a chromed cylindrical hinge, and the Folio G1 has a reassuringly solid heft to it.  It’s not heavy, though: the 4K touchscreen model on test here weighs only 1.07kg, and the cheaper Full HD model knocks that down to 970g by dumping the touchscreen and the protective layer of Gorilla Glass. The Apple MacBook is lighter still, but only by 150g and 50g respectively. 4K glory Sitting down with the Folio G1 for the first time feels revelatory. The 12.5in 4K touchscreen is pin-sharp, capable of reaching squint-inducing brightness levels of 462cd/m2. It’s also gloriously colourful thanks to the high-quality panel (its average Delta E was 1.93) that covered 98% of the sRGB colour gamut in our tests. The ability to reach out grab, prod and interact with onscreen elements is a welcome bonus, and one the MacBook can’t match. The keyboard is another highlight. Where the MacBook’s wide, short-travel keys aren’t to everyone’s liking, the Folio G1 feels just like a good keyboard should. Each key gives roughly twice as much travel as the MacBook, and typing feels markedly more positive as a result. The touchpad doesn’t quite scale the same heights, but this is mainly because it lacks OS X’s intuitive array of gesture controls. The hardware itself works flawlessly, and the ability to disable it with a quick double-tap in the top-left corner is handy, too. The ability to reach out grab, prod and interact with onscreen elements is a welcome bonus, and one the MacBook can’t match. If you’re scouring the photographs for a traditional USB port, though, stop now. HP has equipped the Folio G1 with two Thunderbolt 3-enabled USB Type-C ports and a headphone jack. That’s your lot. To be fair, that’s 100% more connectivity than you get on the MacBook, and the MacBook’s port is slower, supporting “only” USB 3.1. If none of this sounds remotely exciting, then the Folio G1’s infrared 720p webcam might just do the trick. This isn’t designed to improve your night-time selfies but instead to take advantage of Windows 10 Pro’s facial-recognition login feature, Hello. Combine the webcam, TPM 2 authentication and your face, and you have a super-secure login mechanism that doesn’t require you to type a single thing. Another feature that may appeal to executives is its array of microphones, designed  to make video conferencing a clearer, more audible affair (the loud speakers help too).  Super models Fall for the charms of the Folio G1 and the Australian model partners a 1.1GHz Core m5-6Y54 with 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and a matte Full HD display.  I tested it in everyday use, and found it to be flawless. Not everyone will find Intel’s Core M processors fast enough, but so long as you don’t task them with heavy, extended workloads, they feel as quick as devices with similar-generation Core i processors.  The Core M chip did mean that the Folio G1 took its time with our video-encoding and multitasking tests, but its performance is a match for similarly equipped rivals. For less business-like entertainment, note that it’s capable of a 29.3fps average at Full HD in Dirt Showdown at Ultra settings, so there’s potential for gaming if you’re willing to sacrifice some detail and effects. HP has dropped the ball in some ways, though. One disappointment is that high-speed NVMe SSDs aren’t an option in Australia. Instead, you’ll have to make do with standard mSATA solid-state drives, which is a shame. The SSD in my review unit didn’t come close to the speeds of the drives in the Apple MacBook. Admittedly, the difference in real-world use may be slight, but the ability to whisk around gigabytes of data in mere seconds can make a tangible difference when you’re pushing a laptop to the limit. Battery life presents me with a different dilemma. Buy the cheaper Full HD version and you can expect close to seven hours of battery life. On the pricier model I have here, however, the 4K touchscreen takes its toll. With four times the pixels of the Full HD variant, power consumption soars, and in our video-rundown tests, with the screen calibrated to 170cd/m2, the HP lasted a paltry 4hrs 41mins. That’s not even half as long as the Apple MacBook’s 10hrs 12mins. Perfect portable? In the midst of the 1990s, back when some marketing genius first coined the term “ultraportable”, the technology simply wasn’t up to the job. Achieving an acceptable balance between performance, usability, build quality and battery life was impossible; sacrifices had to be made. Slow processors, low-resolution screens and dreadful battery life were the norm. Two decades later, HP is attempting to show just how far we’ve come with the EliteBook Folio G1. It’s beautifully constructed, incredibly light, yet powerful enough to do almost everything you could ask of it. But with barely enough battery life to scrape halfway through the working day, you have to wonder what HP was thinking when it decided to include such a power-hungry 4K touchscreen. With a tweaked specification – an NVMe SSD for speed and Full HD screen for better battery life – the EliteBook Folio G1 could have been a clear winner. As it stands, it not only falls shy of the Apple MacBook, it doesn’t come close to the fabulous Dell XPS 13.  Related Reviews Review: Dell Latitude 13 7370 Review: Asus VivoBook Pro N552VW Review: Asus Transformer Book Flip TP200SA Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dishonored 2 blinks back into our hearts Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  hp elitebook folio g1  |  laptop  |  pc  |  review   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

The Linux Rain Linux General/Gaming News, Reviews and Tutorials Toggle navigation Home About Contact Submit Tip/Article Categories Reviews News Tutorials Editorials Announcements Previews Upcoming Advocacy Overviews OpenMW 0.40 - Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind on Linux By Andrew Powell, published 10/11/2016 The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is one of my personal favourite games of all time. Years ago I would have happily run the game in Linux, but the only real way to do so was through WINE. Thanks to OpenMW, a totally rewritten and open source engine for Morrowind, it is now very much possible to have a near complete Morrowind experience, completely natively. OpenMW has been in development for some years now and if you've been following its development, you would know Morrowind has been playable to varying degrees with each new release. When I last tried out OpenMW (again, on Linux) a couple of years ago, it was amazing how much did work, but there were certainly missing features like opening doors in-game. You could get around these issues by using the in-game console to activate objects like doors, but it was obviously not a complete experience that you would get with vanilla Morrowind. OpenMW version 0.40 dropped a couple months back, however, and besides some still missing features like shadows, the engine is in remarkable shape and allows you to play Morrowind as a pretty much completely vanilla experience. Better yet, there's even a decently sizable list of mods for Morrowind that will work with OpenMW. We're talking mods that were written for vanilla/standard Morrowind, by the way. OpenMW has come such a long way that many old mods Just Work™ as intended even though it's a completely different engine. Even some Microsoft Windows users use OpenMW to play Morrowind, as the OpenMW engine even offers generally better stability and features like 1080p resolutions which were not seen in the original Morrowind game. As a Linux user, the benefit is obvious - you can play Morrowind on your favourite distro natively instead of messing with WINE and dealing with the old Morrowind engine which was prone to all sorts of crashes and weirdness even on Windows. Of course, OpenMW is just an engine replacement/reimplementation, you still need the original TES III: Morrowind game itself in some manner, whether it be on CDROM or Steam, which will give OpenMW all the assets (textures, sounds, game data etc) to run. Installing OpenMW Head on over to the OpenMW site and hit the downloads section. In the Downloads section there's simple guides on how to install OpenMW on your distro of choice. For Ubuntu there is a PPA which you can install like so: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openmw/openmw
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openmw openmw-launcher Hey presto, OpenMW is now installed. This is just the engine itself installed of course, not the game in its entirety. Once upon a time you needed an already installed version of Morrowind, say for example Morrowind installed with WINE, which you would then copy over the necessary game data files to OpenMW. These days though, OpenMW has its own install wizard and will guide you along even if you have no existing install of the game. Installing Morrowind is pretty much as easy as installing regular Morrowind in Windows. The first time you run OpenMW, it should bring up the wizard and you just follow the prompts. If you have the original Morrowind CDROM (or the Morrowind Game of the Year Edition CDROMs which includes the expansions Bloodmoon and Tribunal), just put in each disc as the wizard tells you to and it will automatically install all the necessary files from disc. If you have an existing installation through WINE or Steam, simply tell OpenMW where the installation is located by clicking on the 'Browse...' button when prompted. To get started, simply run: openmw-launcher Or run OpenMW from your applications menu, which will run the launcher also. Before you play, there is one more step, otherwise you'll get a fatal error - go to the Settings tab of the OpenMW Launcher and hit the 'Run Settings Importer' button, which will get you setup with a default Morrowind.ini file. The reason it's not done automatically is in case you have an existing Morrowind.ini file from an old installation you may wish to use instead. You should also go to the Data Files tab and make sure the relevant .esm files are selected. If you're using just Morrowind without expansions, at least Morrowind.esm should be selected. If using the expansions, be sure the files Bloodmoon.esm and Tribunal.esm are selected and in the correct order (the launcher should tell you if the ordering is correct). Launching Morrowind Want to go bash Mudcrabs and get called 'outlander' every 5 seconds? Just hit the 'Play' button in the launcher! If all has gone well, you should see that classic Bethesda splash screen, followed by the good old Morrowind main menu screen, complete with the epic intro music score. Everything else at this point should be more or less as you remember from the old game, just with higher video resolutions available and maybe a lack of graphical shadows (I didn't notice until I read they weren't implemented, to be frank). Enjoy! Playing with Bumblebee/Primus If you're like me and have a laptop with dual graphics, the good news is OpenMW/Morrowind will run decently well even on integrated Intel graphics, but if you want to take full advantage of the dedicated NVIDIA GPU, OpenMW seems to work fine with Bumblebee/primus. You could probably simply run openmw-launcher through primusrun, though personally, to be more direct and skip the launcher I just run this command in a terminal: primusrun openmw Done. Works fine for me and the performance certainly was a step up on my NVIDIA GPU, especially in towns. The only downside is occasionally the game doesn't seem to shutdown correctly, thereby keeping the NVIDIA GPU active even when you think you've exited the game. This will be evident if you've ran the command in a terminal window, because you won't be returned to the command prompt like you normally would. Plus there's the whole fans making noise thing from the NVIDIA card, probably, which is a bit of a give away. As a Bumblebee user you'll probably know what to do here (hint: get murderous in the terminal), which is something like this (open up a new terminal window): ps aux | grep -i openmw
kill -9 <whatever openmw's PID number was> Mods (the fun stuff) You would be forgiven for thinking that a game engine replacement that is not yet even at version 1.0 would probably not do well with mods. But actually, mods are one of the things OpenMW set out to handle even more gracefully than the original engine. There is a little bit of modifying a config file everytime you want to add a new downloaded mod, but once you understand why, it's not only quite powerful, it can save you a lot of headaches compared to the old way of doing things. We'll get to that in a moment. First of all, you'll want to head over to the OpenMW Mod Status page and see which mods are working and which ones may have issues. This isn't a totally exhaustive list and some of the testing results may be out of date (some of the results may be for OpenMW 0.3x for example, while you may find that on the latest 0.40, that the mods seem to work just fine). The great thing about OpenMW is it's very easy to test mods and not risk your existing installation. Here's why... First, get a mod you want to try. For example, say the very cool Morrowind mod called SkyrimUI, which gives a bit of modern spice to Morrowind's UI. Next, make a folder, say in ~/Downloads, where your Morrowind mods will live. I called mine 'MWMods'. Make a new folder within the new folder you just created and extract the downloaded SkyrimUI archive to this folder. Give it the same name as the mod you downloaded, eg. SkyrimUI. In the end your file structure will probably look like this: /home/user/Downloads/MWMods/SkyrimUI Next, we have to tell OpenMW how to find our new mod. Now, this is also where things get really cool. In the old days with vanilla Morrowind, a mod like SkyrimUI would have to be installed manually (extracted into the game's core data files), as it has no .esm files of its own, it's simply a mod that overrides the default textures and meshes of the game, which in this case is the graphic files for the game's UI. Of course, once you did this, unless you backed up the original data files for the game, there would be no easy way to reverse this and you would be stuck with your 'modded' game unless you completely reinstalled. This isn't a problem with OpenMW. Although you could still install a mod this way, there's another much better way. First, open up the openmw.cfg file located in ~/.config/openmw. For example: gedit ~/.config/openmw/openmw.cfg Find the first line that starts with data=. After this line, type a new line also beginning with data= and now we're going to add the path to our new mod, like so: data=/home/<user>/Downloads/MWMods/SkyrimUI Save and exit the file. Now run the OpenMW Launcher again. If your mod has a .esm file, it would now show up in the Data Files tab so you can select it (as long as you put in the correct path). In our example, we're using a simple UI mod (SkyrimUI) which has no .esm file, so nothing will noticeably change in the OpenMW Launcher. Run the game, however, and you'll see the game UI has changed! This is because OpenMW picks up the folder of your mod and recognises the data files within, such as the Textures and Meshes folders, and merges them on the fly when you run the game. But the game's original textures and meshes are still intact, so if you wish to remove the mod, all you have to do is remove the above data= line from ~/.config/openmw/openmw.cfg. Or in the case of mods that have .esm files, simply uncheck them in the OpenMW Launcher. Anyway, hopefully you can see how simple and robust the mod management is. I imagine in future the developers may even add a graphical interface for adding mods by folder instead of explicitly adding the paths to the openmw.cfg file, but as it is, it works pretty well. For anyone wondering, these are the mods I'm currently running without issues: Better Heads Dirnaes Beast Animations Graphic Herbalism LGNPC (Less Generic NPCs) SkyrimUI Morrowind Visual Pack Tamriel Rebuilt Have Fun! I hope this article helps and you have many happy hours in the land of Morrowind. Moreover, keep an eye on OpenMW's development, as interesting things are always happening. The progress has been quite amazing for a project that is made up of volunteers!

Join For Free Access the survey results 'State of Industrial Internet Application Development' to learn about latest challenges, trends and opportunities with Industrial IoT, brought to you in partnership with GE Digital. Two weeks ago, I attended ARM TechCon, the annual developer conference showcasing the latest offerings from ARM and its partners (see my colleague Yan’s blog on Red Hat’s partnership with ARM). There were a lot of new products (new and improved processor cores, radios and other IP), announcements with key themes around IoT (Internet of Things), mobile, security, automotive functional safety, and embedded software development. This was the first TechCon after ARM was acquired by Softbank for $32B this summer, so there was great interest in hearing what Masayoshi Son (Chairman & CEO of Softbank) would say in his first public appearance with ARM. Masayoshi Son talked about connected and intelligent IoT devices enabling an explosion of new technologies, just like the Cambrian Explosion enabled thousands of new species on Earth, and suggesting that this will lead to 1 trillion IoT devices in 20 years. This will lead also to the Singularity — when machine intelligence exceeds the collective intelligence of humans. To the conference audience, this raised concerns about the possibility of conflict between humans and machines in the near future. He also emphasized the importance of security and why it will be critical in this highly-connected IoT environment. ARM CTO/CEO Keynotes Mike Muller (ARM CTO) in his keynote talked about innovations in healthcare driven by ARM technologies, including polio vaccination tracking through wearables and cancer screening through smell sensors (and even a deodorant from Unilever that activates only when needed). Simon Segars (ARM CEO) shared a perspective of IoT gleaned from data collected from over 700 businesses that provided some interesting comparisons. In 2013, 96% of the companies surveyed believed that in three years, they would be using IoT in some way. In 2016, in a survey of the same companies, 75% believed that IoT has had some impact on their business. This shows that the adoption of IoT is happening widely, though not at a scale that people expected. Security Everywhere Security was a big theme at the conference. ARM is making a big push for making ARM-based solutions more secure end-to-end–from the microcontroller to the cloud. TrustZone security mechanisms have been part of the last several generations of ARM processors. TrustZone is hardware-based security that prevents non-secure software from accessing secure resources directly. CoreLink SIE-200 now extends TrustZone to cover the entire the SoC. ARM is also bringing TrustZone to microcontrollers based on the ARMv8-M architecture to secure them from attacks. Combined with CryptoCell (which provides cryptographic services), ARM now has a very compelling hardware-based security solution.  Device Management With mbed Cloud ARM also announced a SaaS offering to manage mbed-powered devices. This is additional to the mbed operating system that ARM offers for Cortex-M based devices. With mbed Cloud, you can now connect, provision and update mbed devices. The mbed Cloud offering is scheduled for availability in Q1 2017. Blockchain Meets IoT In the expo, there were quite a few demos showing blockchain with IoT use cases. IBM showed a “smart parking” use case where blockchain was used to share parking meter data across various stakeholders (city, meter operator, customers). Trustonic, an emerging security technology vendor, showed how blockchain can be used for Root of Trust on TrustZone-M to secure systems that have modules from third parties. Both of these blockchain demos won the best of show awards as well. Intel @ ARM When you see Intel presenting at the ARM conference, you know that the power center has realigned in the semiconductor universe. Granted, it was Intel’s custom foundry group making a pitch to fabricate ARM chips, but there were quite a few Intel staff at ARM TechCon. It helps since the conference was a stone’s throw from Intel’s headquarters in Santa Clara. However, having ARM chips fabricated with Intel’s state-of-the-art processes will be a big benefit for end customers.

Finally, the release cycle of Linux kernel 4.8 has settled in and it looks like more and more GNU/Linux distributions are adopting it, including the upcoming openSUSE Leap 42.2 and Fedora 25, due for release next week. Rolling release users of Solus, Arch Linux, and openSUSE Tumbleweed are already enjoying the latest Linux kernel 4.8 updates, and soon they’ll receive a new one, Linux kernel 4.8.7, which comes ten days after Linux kernel 4.8.6. Looking at the appended shortlog and the diff from the previous point release, it looks like Linux kernel 4.8.7 is quite a big update that changes a total of 122 files, with 1096 insertions and 541 deletions.

10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets - 2016-2022 2010, 2015 & 2020 With 1.8 million asylum seekers (UN reports) crossing Western Europe's external borders in 2015, the European border agencies are facing challenges with a far greater reach than ever before. More than 1000 ISIS-trained jihadists returning to Europe every year, coupled with the surge of migrants to Europe are alarming concerns; as present capabilities of the European border, coast guard, intelligence services and immigration agencies simply cannot meet these challenges. The EU-Turkey deal (if implemented) might lead to a significant decrease in the flow of refugees (by March-April 2016 the rate of migrants entering Greece declined by 90%). However, the agreement faces formidable practical, political and legal challenges (e.g., each and every one of the 22 EU parliaments has to endorse the treaty). In the aftermath of the migration crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, a major overhaul of the Western European border security and immigration infrastructure, strategy and funding is already underway. Following a 2010 to 2015 annual market growth of 10-13% the 2015 to 2020 annual market will surge by 104%. The "European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022" report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today. It provides a detailed and reasoned roadmap of this growing market. The European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Market is boosted by the following drivers: The Western European border security, coast guards, immigration agencies and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to counter the surge of refugees and 21st century jihadists who use sophisticated means to return to the continent. The Schengen Area is comprised of 26 European countries that have abolished border control at their common borders. Several Schengen Area governments reinstated border checkpoints by 2015. Europe cannot build a wall to keep out refugees and terrorists or enlist millions of border guards who would need to watch every inch of its over 10,000 land borders and 80,000 coastlines. Europol estimates that up to 5,000 European jihadists have already returned to Western Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a proposal for a new agency that would replace and succeed Frontex, having a stronger role and mandate, and forming a "European Border and Coast Guard" along with national authorities for border management. Of Europe's approximately 50 countries, Russia has by far the longest coastline as well as the longest land border. Western Europe, the largest economy in the world with a 2015 GDP of approximately $22 trillion (vs. the U.S. $17.5 trillion), can invest "whatever it takes" to protect its citizens from the looming jeopardies of mass migration and terrorism. The border security and immigration enforcement industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents multi-billion USD opportunities to the defense, ICT and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems, and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. According to European intelligence services, ISIS has approximately 5000 original European blank passports which can be used by jihadists returning to the EU. The EU and the rest of the European border security and immigration infrastructure enforcement market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans. * Customers who purchase a multi-readers license of the report will get the "Global Homeland Security & Public Safety Industry – 2016 Edition" report free of charge. Single-reader license customers will get a 50% discount for the Industry report. Questions answered in this 289-page report + one* reports include: What will the market size and trends be during 2016-2022? Which are the submarkets that provide attractive business opportunities?

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022 With 1.8 million asylum seekers (UN reports) crossing Western Europe’s external borders in 2015, the European border agencies are facing challenges with a far greater reach than ever before. More than 1000 ISIS-trained jihadists returning to Europe every year, coupled with the surge of migrants to Europe are alarming concerns; as present capabilities of the European border, coast guard, intelligence services and immigration agencies simply cannot meet these challenges. The EU-Turkey deal (if implemented) might lead to a significant decrease in the flow of refugees (by March-April 2016 the rate of migrants entering Greece declined by 90%). However, the agreement faces formidable practical, political and legal challenges (e.g., each and every one of the 22 EU parliaments has to endorse the treaty). In the aftermath of the migration crisis and the Paris and Brussels terror attacks, a major overhaul of the Western European border security and immigration infrastructure, strategy and funding is already underway. Following a 2010 to 2015 annual market growth of 10-13% the 2015 to 2020 annual market will surge by 104%. The “European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Markets – 2016-2022” report is the most comprehensive review of the market available today. It provides a detailed and reasoned roadmap of this growing market. The European Smart Borders, Immigration Enforcement & Border Security Market is boosted by the following drivers: The Western European border security, coast guards, immigration agencies and intelligence agencies are ill-equipped to counter the surge of refugees and 21st century jihadists who use sophisticated means to return to the continent. The Schengen Area is comprised of 26 European countries that have abolished border control at their common borders. Several Schengen Area governments reinstated border checkpoints by 2015. Europe cannot build a wall to keep out refugees and terrorists or enlist millions of border guards who would need to watch every inch of its over 10,000 land borders and 80,000 coastlines. Europol estimates that up to 5,000 European jihadists have already returned to Western Europe after obtaining combat experience on the battlefields of the Middle East. On 15 December 2015, the European Commission presented a proposal for a new agency that would replace and succeed Frontex, having a stronger role and mandate, and forming a “European Border and Coast Guard” along with national authorities for border management. Of Europe’s approximately 50 countries, Russia has by far the longest coastline as well as the longest land border. Western Europe, the largest economy in the world with a 2015 GDP of approximately $22 trillion (vs. the U.S. $17.5 trillion), can invest “whatever it takes” to protect its citizens from the looming jeopardies of mass migration and terrorism. The border security and immigration enforcement industry faces a considerable challenge in seeking to provide the necessary solutions to current and future threats. At the same time, this challenge presents multi-billion USD opportunities to the defense, ICT and security industries able to deliver effective functions, integrate systems, and maximize security and productivity per $ invested. According to European intelligence services, ISIS has approximately 5000 original European blank passports which can be used by jihadists returning to the EU. The EU and the rest of the European border security and immigration infrastructure enforcement market for products and services are served by local defense and security companies. Even with a preference for locally manufactured products, foreign products can usually strongly compete on the basis of cost-performance. They do not encounter any EU direct trade barriers or quotas. Non-tariff, indirect trade barriers may be the approval process of dual use goods, which include many security market products. This report is a resource for executives with interests in the market. It has been explicitly customized for the security industry and other decision-makers in order to identify business opportunities, developing technologies, market trends and risks, as well as to benchmark business plans. * Customers who purchase a multi-readers license of the report will get the “Global Homeland Security & Public Safety Industry – 2016 Edition” report free of charge.
