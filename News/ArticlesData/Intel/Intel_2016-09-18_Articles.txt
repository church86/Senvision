Diane Bryant, SVP at Intel and a big Oracle partner, spent an hour covering a very broad landscape and she did it with verve. There are so many intersection points between the companies that it's hard to present a coherent story. There is the Xeon E5 v4 processor that outperforms previous versions -- something you can expect from any Silicon Valley announcement -- and there are memory chips that power things like the Oracle Sun Xadata machine, which can encrypt data to make it more resilient to hacking. There was a lot more in the keynotes -- and all of it important, but perhaps only for segments of the audience. For the rest of us, there was a gee-whiz quality to those announcements, but at least being wowed is entertaining. Chips of the Future Now Perhaps the most interesting information in Bryant's presentation was that Intel was shipping a new line of chips that communicate not by moving electrons along predetermined paths but by using light emanating from incredibly small lasers that are manufactured on the same silicon substrate as conventional chips. Light enables greater speeds, and these chips -- classed as "photonics" -- have a big job to play in the future for things like networking and communicating with peripherals. I know I am not doing justice to photonics, but the most amazing thing to come out of the discussion was that Intel already has begun shipping those products. With this down payment, we can see the outlines of a future when computing is hundreds, if not thousands, of times faster than today's state of the art -- and who knows what that will mean in IT or the IoT? I am curious, for instance, if using light will generate less heat on chips and enable further component density. Writing the Cloud Chapter After that brain dump, Larry Ellison spoke in what can be termed only as brain dump No. 2. Larry also had a lot to talk about. After a really good earnings call last week -- in which it was evident the company has turned a significant corner to become a bona fide cloud company -- Ellison was in his element. He sold the benefits of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS to the point of repeating last decade's analogy about IT becoming a kind of utility, like water, gas and electricity. At least he was talking about the future and not denigrating cloud technology as he did before his conversion some years ago. In truth, Ellison always has been a cloud guy. He owned a big chunk of NetSuite and was a member of the Salesforce board at the very beginning. When he was denigrating the cloud, he simply was selling what he had at a time when his customer base wasn't ready to begin the herculean task of converting, whatever the benefits. That's different today with greater demands on IT and a new crop of younger leaders joining the ranks. Cloud is now cool. The Right Direction Still, cloud is not tomorrow for many businesses. Ellison's presentation was loaded with statements that suggested the conversion could take a decade. That explains why, even as it pivots, the company is very careful to bring along legacy customers by offering Infrastructure as a Service that provides half-step measures to get customers acclimated to the cloud. Another smart measure is the pending deal to acquire NetSuite -- a cloud ERP vendor with a track record of working with legacy systems to deliver most of the benefits of cloud computing without clobbering the status quo. Such dancing will be essential to Oracle's continuing success, because as we saw at the earnings call, Oracle's cloud business so far is coming much more from net new business and not from the installed base. Those customers still need convincing, and until then they need to make their current systems run well. If the keynotes did a job, it was to set up the cloud-legacy dichotomy in a positive light, forecasting a bright future with a company and partners that are prepared to nudge customers in the right direction.

We'll see grave environmental damage instead of progress. Fear of negative consequences will spur more positive actions. Trump probably will come around to a more moderate position. We won't see much change either way in just four years. Trump will expose the climate change hoax -- and it's about time.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | September 19, 2016 -- 20:44 GMT (13:44 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry Intel said Monday that Bob Swan has been named the company's next chief financial officer. Swan will take over for Stacy Smith, who's switching to another role leading Intel's manufacturing, sales, and operations teams, on Oct. 10. Smith was Intel's CFO for nine years.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said Swan brings "financial acumen and strategic insight" to the executive leadership team as the company continues its transformation efforts. Earlier this year, the tech giant announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs -- or nearly 11 percent of its workforce -- as part of a major restructure prompted by the decline in PC sales and other hardware. At the time, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he believed Intel could transform from a PC company to "a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices" by focusing on technology for connected things, memory, Moore's Law, and cloud. Last week, Intel increased its third quarter revenue forecast, citing an expected turnaround in the PC market prompted by the replenishment of PC supply chain inventory.

The world's largest chipmaker said earlier this year that Smith, who has been Intel's chief financial officer for nearly a decade, would shift to a new role. Swan, 56, joins from private equity firm General Atlantic and will oversee global finance and IT organizations, as well as corporate strategy office, Intel said on Monday. He will take up his new role, effective Oct. 10. Swan, who also served as eBay Inc's chief financial officer, left after the company spun off PayPal Holdings Inc last year. Intel raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years on Friday as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. The company's shares were unchanged in aftermarket trading on Monday. They closed down 1.3 percent at $37.16.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 19, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: Intel.  On Sept. 16, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced an upward revision to the financial guidance that it provided back in July. The company says that it now expects revenue of $15.6 billion for its third quarter (give or take $300 million), up from a prior forecast of $14.9 billion (plus or minus $500 million), as a result of "replenishment of PC supply chain inventory". Intel said that in addition to the inventory dynamics, it is "also seeing some signs of improving [personal computer] demand".  The good news expands beyond revenue as well. The company is raising its gross profit margin guidance from 60% to 62%. Intel attributes this improvement mainly to "higher PC unit volume". And finally, the company says that its operating expenses will now come in at "approximately $5.2 billion", a slight increase from previous guidance of $5.1 billion. Let's take a closer look at what's going on here. PC inventories apparently lighter than expected Intel doesn't sell personal computers directly to consumers. Instead, it sells key components (mainly processors) to personal computer vendors. Those vendors then take these components and integrate them into complete systems that are sold to end users. Those vendors need to keep inventories of both components as well as completed systems in order to be able to satisfy customer orders in a timely fashion. For example, if Joe Public goes to the Dell website and places an order for a new system, Dell needs to already have the components around to build the system that Joe ordered. Those system vendors need to make their "best guesses" as to the kind of demand that they will see for personal computers -- those demand forecasts almost certainly inform Intel's production and sales plans, which is how the chip giant is able to provide reasonably solid quarterly sales guidance to investors. What appears to be going on here is that the personal computer vendors found themselves with lower inventory levels of components/personal computers than they would like. As a result, they have seemingly ordered more processors from the chipmaker in a bid to bring their own inventory levels up to better support the demand that they expect for their products.  Why is margin guidance up? In addition to the better-than-expected PC processor sales, Intel also guided gross profit margins up, which obviously helps to amplify the profit growth that higher revenues at flat margins would have brought. Intel attributes the margin increase to higher personal computer chip sales volumes. One point that might be a little confusing to some is why margins would actually go up with revenue, but it's not too hard to understand. Remember that Intel owns and operates its own chip manufacturing factories and that the vast majority of the chips that the company produces are targeted at personal computers. To build and equip these factories, Intel needs to make significant capital investments. The cost of these factories flows through to Intel's financial results in the form of depreciation. The depreciation essentially shows up as part cost of goods sold, or COGS. Recall that gross profit margin percentage is calculated by dividing gross profit (which itself is calculated by subtracting COGS from net revenue) by total revenue. The depreciation costs that Intel incurs in a given quarter are essentially fixed, and that cost is spread out across the number of chips that the company ships in a given quarter. They're also a significant portion of Intel's total cost of sales, as the slide below illustrates: Image source: Intel.  If Intel is able to ship more chips than it had previously expected, then that depreciation cost is spread out over a greater number of units. This means that the effective cost to manufacture each chip is lower, leading to better gross profit margins. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

GoLINC will connect all devices on the network Simple web interface. GoLINC's user interface provides the user with the ability to navigate and manage any configuration Durability. GoLINC is able to survive even when the trains are passing through harshest environments. Ability to interface with Locomotive Data Acquisition Recording System (LDARS). LDARS features a crash-hardened memory system, to protect data in the event of an accident. GE Transportation began working on smart trains in 2014, with a set of software solutions. The company plans to continue developing new smart train capabilities in order to "extend locomotive life, lower fuel consumption, decrease emissions, increase velocity and improve operating ratios," according to the press release. GE's 21,000 locomotives, located in more than 50 countries worldwide, will all eventually connect using Predix. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers On Monday, GE Transportation and Intel Corp. unveiled a "superbrain" platform solution that turns freight trains into mobile data centers. These smart trains will operate with the GoLINC platform, which provides processing, wireless communication, data storage, and video capacity.

(LXRX) INTC, WD and LXRX stock are signalling breakout potential Sep 19, 2016, 9:56 am EST  |  By Johnson Research Group     Investors are going to spend much of the week waiting on the Federal Reserve for the decision on interest rates before committing new monies to the market. The question of whether rates will go higher is all consuming for many, but those of us watching the technicals and trends already have an idea of the stocks we want to hold regardless of what Janet Yellen says later this week. Large cap technology and pharmaceutical companies continue to have favorable cash flow as traders are migrating monies away from the dividend paying sectors. Today, we look at three companies benefiting from that cash flow: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX). Intel Corporation (INTC) Along with other large cap technology stocks, Intel has undergone a fundamental turnaround increasing the demand for their chips and technology. INTC took a jump higher Friday as the company raised earnings guidance and now we’re looking at a situation where the analyst community is going to start fueling prices even higher. This morning, Intel shares have already received one upgrade in price. With only 57% of the analysts on Wall Street recommending INTC stock as a buy, we also expect to see a number of upgrades. 8 International Stocks Priced to Beat the U.S. Intel shares jumped above their top Bollinger Band on Friday on heavy volume. The move strengthens an already strong momentum trend for the stock, as INTC shares have support from short- and intermediate-term trendlines, as well as a strong moving average convergence divergence. The move shifts Intel into a new bullish trend that is likely to move faster than the market, as the analyst community raises its outlook. This is even more likely to happen as INTC breaks above the $38 level, which would mark new highs for the stock since the 2000. Western Digital Corp (WDC) Western Digital stock moved lower from the $55 level after its last earnings report. Now, WDC stock is poised to cross back above this mark, which will grab the attention of technical traders. In addition, we’ve just seen a very bullish crossover of trendlines that should paint a bullish intermediate-term outlook. First, the $55 level has been resistance for Western Digital shares. The last time we saw WDC stock try to break above this point, it stumbled at resistance from its 200-day moving average. This time around, the 200-day is below the stock and actually poised for potential support. In addition, the 20- and 50-day moving averages for WDC just completed bullish crossovers, indicating that the bullish trend for the shares is growing stronger. Historically, this intermediate-term bullish signal precedes outperformance of the shares against the market. The current technical picture looks to be lifting resistance for Western Digital shares and opening-up a target price of $60. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LXRX) Another sector of the dividend cash migration is big Pharma. Pharmaceuticals took a beating earlier in the year, as the presidential candidates signaled that they may take on the Phama industry over pricing issues. The political rhetoric has died down, leaving a number of undervalued stocks that are making technical improvements. Apple Inc. (AAPL): How the iPhone Changed the World, 10 Years Later Lexicon shares jumped off the charts earlier in the month on positive news regarding one of its drug trials. LXRX stock has consolidated since then in preparation for what appears to be another rally higher. The 20- and 50-day trendlines of Lexicon Pharmaceuticals just shifted into a bullish trend, as both are ascending and the 20-day has crossed above the 50-day. Historically, these patterns result in better-than-average performance for the drug maker that should attract more technical buyers. LXRX stock will face a critical test soon as it approaches the $20 level. This mark has provided chart resistance for the shares before and may trigger some profit taking. A move above $20 will convince the technicians that the longer-term trend favors even more upside for Lexicon, drawing even more buyers into the mix. As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

If all the focus goes into the high-end, it is easy to get complacent, or living in a technology hub can feel like a bubble. This is why several times a year I wander through the local Brick and Mortar retailer to see what is on offer to users that simply walk in off the street to buy a tablet, notebook, or a casual £99 Bluetooth speaker purchase, as what happened this week. I'm in the UK, so our sole brick and mortar option is typically PCWorld, however it emulates Best Buy in a number of ways. What I Had Noticed Before Looking through the arrays of notebooks and laptops on offer, prior to my recent visit this week, it was very clear that pickings for AMD processors were very thin. Since the demise of netbooks, and Intel's Ultrabook strategy, almost all AMD offerings on shelves were restricted to a single unit, or under 1 in 20 on the show floor, and typically a budget device with low-quality displays, track pads, and build quality. Part of this, as I learned when a sales executive took me through a Best Buy in the US, is due to marketing in the store itself. Companies can invest in aisles all to themselves at a retailer at select stores or nationwide, or if there is an overriding feature that several companies share, they can invest in an aisle together under the feature heading. Aside from the aisles, there are end caps, pre-fabricated displays, video walls, and all manner of possibilities. Some users will be familiar with store-in-store elements from Samsung or Apple, where they pay for dedicated floorspace and dedicated salesmen to be trained in solely their product. Closer to the front door of the store costs more, too. Due to the way that these brick and mortar locations sell their internal space, those with big marketing budgets have an advantage, as well as investment from OEMs (like Intel, HP) as a bonus for large volume component purchases. It ends up being a sizeable investment to in-store sales, and more eyeballs end up on potential halo products like an Omen, an Alienware or a Zenbook. There's also an added factor, albeit anecdotal, that it might be common for sales staff to not suggest brands that have been commonly associated with low-performance in the past. Understandably, AMD has a roughshod time at this. Due to their well-documented size and budgets, being able to assist their major partners in store-focused placement is fairly difficult. Their major partners are HP and Lenovo, so with that in mind those budgets may be very region focused for some hardware configurations for sure. It's also difficult to train store staff in the hardware without investing in the shop floor as well, unless they already have a sizeable interest in the specific market. Despite that 1 in 20 figure, which has been generous in most cases (including the Best Buy right near AMD's Austin office, or the Fry's in Sunnyvale), smaller retailers that go after the second-hand market seem to have had a better ratio than that. Speaking to a few of these retailers on Tottenham Road in London, the £200 second hand AMD APU-based notebooks get a sizeable interest from students on a shoestring budget, if only for mild gaming and LAN gaming (using pen and paper is still fairly common in UK universities in lectures, apparently). These retailers tend to sell a number of low-end devices, such as Pentium, i3, A6 and A8-based with HD/900p TN panels, which might not be a sizeable representation when we normally discuss new sales, but indicates that a number of users are still cost-driven in that price range. So Why This News Post, What's Changed? Earlier this year we posted a lengthy discussion about AMD Carrizo based notebooks, and how there was a disconnect between AMD, OEMs, and repeat business through positive user experience enabled via smarter hardware decisions. We received a lot of feedback from that, especially identifying that Carrizo as a base processor offered reasonable performance when applied with the right companion hardware. As part of the launch with the 7th Generation platform after our discussions, they had said that they had worked closer with their key partners to enable better configurations to drive experiences, along with better strategies for getting eyes on the hardware. With that in mind...  Typically a tech journalist's week has a few meetings, perhaps a prebrief or two, and it just so happened that a VP for an unrelated company was in London, we met nearby and we talked shop. On the way out, I ran some errands and spent some time in PCWorld. I wasn't expecting to see much - it's a small store with Apple in the front and TVs in the rear, and the selection they tend to have across their 20-30 notebooks is barely mid-range, with one or two exceptions. So expect my surprise when I found five AMD notebooks in that set, with one out of the three desktops on show being the OEM version of the A10-7860K. These weren't old systems either - four of the notebooks where the new AMD 7th Generation APU (two Bristol Ridge, two Stoney Ridge), with one being 6th Gen (Carrizo-L). #1: Lenovo Yoga 510, £430 The first one that popped out near the front of the shop was the Stoney Ridge device, spotting a large 'AMD 7th Gen' sticker. This was a Lenovo Yoga 510, with a touchscreen and 360-degree hinge, being marketed as a 2-in-1. Under the hood was an A9-9410, which is a single module 25W AMD APU using 2nd Generation Excavator modules, with a 2.9 GHz base and 3.5 GHz turbo. It has 192 streaming processors at a base 800 Mhz (more when there's headroom), but because it is Stoney Ridge there's only access to single channel memory. At least Lenovo paired it with 8GB of DDR4-2133, which is eminently better than a 4GB option. The 14-inch 1366x768 TN panel from AUO was dire, even from a minute or two with bad viewing angles, and storage came via a 1TB Western Digital mechanical drive. WiFi was at least 802.11ac, albeit 1x1 from the QCA9377 controller.  CPU-Z showed that the silicon was the ST-A0 stepping, which suggests that AMD did a relatively good job during tapeout. Unfortunately CPU-Z 1.77 doesn't seem fully geared for * Ridge laptops (a point worth noting later), but the benchmark gave 987 for single thread and 1741 in multithread. Not having used the CPU-Z benchmark seriously before (and there not being that much a store will let you run with free will), but a cursory glance online puts the FX-6300 at 1152, and a stock i7 920 gets a score of 998 for single threaded performance.  #2: HP Envy 15 x360, £630 Interestingly I had originally walked past this. All the AMD official logos had been removed from the keyboard and specification list beside the notebook, which struck me as a little odd. HP is arguably AMD's biggest partner for notebooks, with the Envy and Omen being two of the most premium devices for Bristol Ridge that have been announced. Part of me might suspect this is for a reason, or it could just be a case of Hanlon's Razor and someone forgot/they weren't ready.  The Envy was the most expensive AMD notebook on display, offering a typical HP premium design ID with a near-top line A12-9700P under the hood. This uses two 2nd Gen Excavator modules for four threads, a configuration called Bristol Ridge, and runs at 2.5 GHz base with 3.4 GHz turbo on the cores. The A12 ensures the 'R7' name on the integrated GPU, but this has 384 SPs (6 CUs) rather than the full compliment, and it runs at 758 MHz for a total of 15W TDP on the processor. HP paired the SoC with 8GB of DDR4 memory, although we were unable to determine if this was single channel (1x8GB) or dual channel (2x4GB) as CPU-Z is not currently configured for 7th Gen detection. The system has two drives - a 128GB SSD from an unknown vendor as a boot drive and a 1TB mechanical storage drive from HGST. The panel was a clear 1080p IPS, and the track pad was certainly larger than I had expected. Internal Wi-Fi is a 2x2 solution using Intel's 802.11ac 7265 controller.     One thing worth noting is that this was the only system with a Type-C connector. This is USB, and based on the logo seems to be a USB 2.0 implementation. #3: HP Pavilion, £400 In the more budget section of the store were two systems, but I essentially passed over this design from HP. It uses an A9, implying Stoney Ridge and 1x8 GB of single channel DDR4-2133. This came with a 2TB mechanical drive, and looks very similar to previous HP Pavilion systems.  Further to the other HP system, this was also devoid of any AMD logos.  #4: Lenovo Ideapad 310, £350 However the Ideapad 310 intrigued me. It was the cheapest model on display, cheaper than both the Stoney Bridge models, but came with a 15W Bristol Ridge A10-9600P, a dual module/quad thread design running at 2.4 GHz/3.3 GHz. The APU has support for dual channel DDR4-1866, and I'd half expect this 8GB model only had one memory module, but the rear of the device had a large enough section for users to add in their own memory. The APU also has a 384 SPs (6 CU) design for graphics, running at 720 MHz. Other specifications include an Intel 802.11ac module, an integrated DVD drive, a 1080p screen (unfortunately TN) and a 1TB mechanical SATA storage drive for £350. There have been instances in the past where an OEM uses a bargain basement design, but sticks in the high-end processor (Like the 9800) as a big 'wow' factor, but the cooling and the build quality gives the game away after a few days of use. Nonetheless, part of me feels that another $20 on an IPS panel would actually provide a good experience, as long as the design supports dual channel memory. If that's the case, I'd stick in 32gb of what I have lying around, a spare 1TB SSD, and it would be a nicely workable system for Anandtech on the road. Maybe that's just me.  #5: A HP 550-103NA Desktop, £500 When AMD launched the Kaveri Refresh line of processors, sometimes known as Godavari, alongside the number of consumer-focused processors was a line of OEM-only parts. The consumer line was the 7000 series, whereas the OEM line was the 8000 series, but fundamentally it was the same silicon and same set of specifications, except the OEM-only parts were designed for the HPs, Dells, Lenovos and other system integrators with different support packages therein. For the UK at least, these tend to be online only purchases, at least anecdotally from my experience any AMD desktop in a brick and mortar store tends to be AMD FX based on the AM3+ platform. So I was quite surprised to see an AMD Kaveri Refresh system in a HP desktop with a reasonable design ID. The system on display used the 65W A10-8750, the OEM equivalent of the A10-7860K, combined with an R5 330 discrete graphics card as a dual graphics solution (512 SPs at from the APU, 320 SPs from the discrete card). It's a slightly lopsided configuration, aimed mainly at supporting multiple screens or different connection types.   The system had 8 GB of DRAM, and I was able to barely see into the case to confirm it was in two memory modules for dual channel operation. Storage on the system was marketed as a 2TB drive, however the system did have a 128GB SSD as a boot drive as well. Interestingly while looking through the side vents in the system, I noticed that the motherboard had been put in upside down but also reversed, similar to the Corsair 600Q that we recently reviewed. There are many reasons for this, and I asked if we could open the case up so I could see inside. Unfortunately after asking the floor manager, I was told that opening the case would break the warranty, so I wasn't able to get a better look in the internals, but it was certainly interesting to see these OEM systems on the shop floor. So You Saw Some AMD Systems, So What? As a pure observation, the fact that my singular trip showed a greater proportion of AMD designs available for eyeballs on a shop floor is an anecdotal indicator that AMD's OEMs are being bolder and/or more confident with their AMD designs. Sure, none of the ones I saw were absolute stunner systems, with a peak value of 650GBP ($717 pre-tax) and none in a real ultrabook/XPS13 style, but the numbers and variety shows a marked change in what a consumer can see when they visit a store. I spoke with the store rep who shadowed me during my visit, and I asked whether people were actively interested in any AMD systems. He replied that there was no specific interest, unless gaming was an aspect. It's worth noting that the PCWorld didn't have any of the usual MSI/Acer gaming notebooks on display, so the best gaming laptops on show would have been the products using AMD APUs. It sounded as if the only reason a laptop with an AMD APU would be actively promoted if the customer specifically said gaming was a priority. It's an interesting take, and one that AMD would gladly take. The store rep picked my brain a bit about the state of the industry, and what we might expect in the future. I recanted what we've learned over the last few weeks about Kaby Lake and Zen, as well as a little bit of VR discussion. Compared to some previous store reps I've spoken with, even though he wasn't up to speed with the absolute latest, he certainly knew about specific processors, graphics cards and general perceptions of the big OEM players in that space. Kudos to Raj, it was a fun half hour!  With regards Zen notebooks in the future, Lisa Su mentioned during an August presentation that after the launch of the high-end desktop parts and AMD in servers, notebooks are expected in the second half of 2017, or essentially 12 months away. I suspect during Computex and/or IFA next year, we might start to see some interesting Zen designs for notebooks. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

In high end gaming laptops , if they use an interposer for GPU+HBM, they might as well add a CPU die too. A huge APU doesn't seem doable with dual channel DDR4.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 18, 2016 New Part Day: A Truly Secure Workstation 86 Comments by: Brian Benchoff September 19, 2016 There is a chain of trust in every modern computing device that starts with the code you write yourself, and extends backwards through whatever frameworks you’re using, whatever OS you’re using, whatever drivers you’re using, and ultimately whatever BIOS, UEFI, Secure Boot, or firmware you’re running. With an Intel processor, this chain of trust extends to the Intel Management Engine, a system running independent of the CPU that has access to the network, USB ports, and everything else in the computer. Needless to say, this chain of trust is untenable. Any attempt to audit every line of code running in a computer will only be met with frustration. There is no modern Intel-based computer that is completely open source, and no computer that can be verified as secure. AMD is just as bad, and recent attempts to create an open computing platform have met with frustration. [Bunnie]’s Novena laptop gets close, but like any engineering task, designing the Novena was an exercise in compromise. You can get around modern BIOSes, coreboot still uses binary blobs, and Libreboot will not be discussed on Hackaday for the time being. There is no modern, completely open, completely secure computing platform. They’re all untrustworthy. The Talos Secure Workstation, from Raptor Engineering, an an upcoming  Crowd Supply campaign is the answer to the untrustworthiness of modern computing. The Talos is an effort to create the world’s first libre workstation. It’s an ATX-compatible motherboard that is fully auditable, from schematics to firmware, without any binary blobs. RISC architecture is going to change everything. ‘Secure’ isn’t a word you would use in conjunction with a modern Intel processor, and AMD is just as bad. Most ARM processors are out, because there are binary blobs floating around even when the processor isn’t tied up in NDAs. Even graphics are hard to make secure, and while open source GPUs exist, they’re not exactly powerhouses. To make a computer fully secure, you’ll have to go outside the usual architectures, and the market for a secure computer simply isn’t there to warrant a completely new architecture, anyway. For the Talos, Raptor Engineering chose IBM’s POWER8 processor. This architecture is now most common in computing that has a few more zeros on the price tag than what Microcenter offers, but historically the POWER line can be traced back through the CELL processor, the GameCube, and [Zero Cool]’s sweet clear laptop. The rest of the hardware includes 8 DDR3 slots supporting 256GB of RAM, 2 x16 PCIe slots, 4 x8 PCIe slots, one legacy PCI slot, an internal mPCIe slot, 8 internal SATA 6Gb ports, 2 external eSATA 6Gb ports, 1 HDMI port, 8 USB 3.0 ports, 2 external and 2 internal RS232 ports, and an internal GPIO header. The full list of specifications and supported operating systems is available on the Raptor Engineering website. It should be noted this is not the only POWER8 motherboard available. Tyan produces a POWER8 server motherboard, although it is not as open as the Talos. Even with the Talos, there are some restrictions on how open and secure it actually is; thanks to NDAs, some of the PCIe subsystem is not auditable. Although the Crowd Supply campaign is not live yet, we know the cost of an entry-level Talos system with an 8-core 130W TDP POWER8 CPU will come in at about $5,300. A standalone board less CPU will be available for about $4,000, according to Raptor Engineering. That’s pricey, but not terrible when it comes to high performance enterprise workstations. You’re paying for security and auditability here, and we hope Talos is a success, if only to prove there is a market for truly secure computing.

Of course we don’t actually know they ARE, but we don’t know they AREN’T. And that’s about as close as you’ll get, I think. What does the NSA buy for their servers? Don’t tell me, it’s a secret. Report comment Reply Jaakko Salo says: September 19, 2016 at 6:33 am Auditability of all schematics and code are stated here as what would give Talos “better security”. Oh wait, but not really because the PCIe subsystem is *still* not auditable. In any case, one could say all of this is BS because someone, somewhere, will eventually have to *produce* the hardware, and that actor is very unlikely to be the end user who actually uses the hardware. The manufacturer themselves are still to be trusted no matter how open the code and schematics are.

You know autistics are over-represented among people who claim to be the other gender. And the entirety of people who claim to be the 58 fictional genders. It’s part of their basic lack of understanding of social stuff, they get the wrong end of the stick about men and women, and think that some thing or other makes them “really” a woman (or less often, a man). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuZFThlOiJI has some good stuff about this toward the end. I have more respect for people who just want to be, say, a woman, and get on with it, and then try their best to live as women. But some people just want to be transgender, as if it’s an end, not a means. There’s always been attention-seeking fuckwits. And it’s a shame because they generally make the cause they’re appropriating look like a bunch of idiots. Any old bigot can point to half a dozen loonies, and they’re the easiest ones to find, the loudest, and claim that they represent the group as a whole. Same thing applies to Muslims, actually. But these idiots don’t actually care about the cause or group they’re supposed to be defending. Because it’s all just part of some malfunctioning psychology. Still the way certain persons like to rig the argument so that dissent is impossible, and disagreeing with someone is denying them their right to *exist* (?!?!?), as well as bullying, terrorism, and arson in a naval dockyard, makes them impossible to get sense out of. Which is fine by them. You also see the same thing in religious fundamentalists. Quick to resort to shit-throwing and claiming they’re being oppressed and mistreated, just because everyone doesn’t agree with their arbitrary notions on how the world is. The discussion on the Internet, which we’re not having here, seems to be that this person is, basically, mad and an attention whore. Does their cause no good. Sensible people know not to take the loonies as representative of the whole, but there’s always been a shortage of sensible people. And politics in a wider sense has gone right down the toilet, so calm reason and rationality is not something you’ll ever hear in the media or politics. Report comment Reply RÖB says: September 19, 2016 at 6:01 pm I am very surprised about what you say regarding autism and gender identity. All those who I have cared for, and who may be described as autistic, have been pre-teen or adolescent so I have no grounds to argue the matter. So I will stick to what I do know. Autism is a spectrum which we all exist on. It’s a quality that all humans have to some degree. Did you know that in the early days NASA employed autistic mathematicians because their attention to detail meant that would not make the mistakes more average people do. Autism is a difference to average and it has attributes that are an advantage over an average person and some attributes that make life a harder – mostly through non-acceptance. Report comment Dax says: September 20, 2016 at 1:09 am “Autism is a spectrum which we all exist on.” No it’s not. It’s not like some sort of Kinsey scale of social awkwardness. It’s an actual developmental issue that results in typical symptoms and traits. Just because “neurotypicals” sometimes exhibit some of those same traits to varying degrees doesn’t mean they’re a little bit autistic – any more than having a bit of a cough means you’re slightly turberculotic. Those on the spectrum have actual neurological and developmental issues, those “on the spectrum” (often self-diagnosed) are simply put there by correlating a checklist from the DSM without proper diagnosis. Report comment Dax says: September 20, 2016 at 1:28 am “You know autistics are over-represented among people who claim to be the other gender.” You’re mistaking cause and effect: self/mis-diagnosed autists are prevalent in any group of people who are narcissistic/egomanic because it is a convenient excuse for acting poorly in relation to other people. Autism does involve difficulties in developing what’s called a “theory of other minds”, where a child at some point of growing up realizes that other people have minds of their own, which leads to a kind of self-centered intuition about the world, but this is not the same thing. Gender dysphoria is all about the person’s self-image much like with anorexia or compulsive body modification through cosmetic surgery, or the desire to be amputated, and so transgenders tend to be or become highly self-centered, sometimes to the point of solipsism, as they battle with their mental illness – and it is a mental illness. Aside from people born with ambiguous genitalia and other actual cogenital issues, people who simply suffer from the desire to change gender can be effectively treated with antipsychotics. The only problem is that transgenderism isn’t politically considered to be a mental illness, so the people with gender dysphoria can’t get proper treatment. Instead of giving them antipsychotics, people try to accomodate their illness and even let them get cut up and put them on hormone replacement treatments, which doesn’t end up nice because the underlying mental illness doesn’t go away and the people often end up killing themselves. Report comment Dax says: September 20, 2016 at 2:11 am Twin-studies have shown gender dysphoria to be heritable – that is to say of biological cause – about 60% of the time. That means a bit less than half of the transgenders out there are not genuinely so, but suffering from some kind of psychosis or other issue that is not helped by everyone pretending that Tom is Jane or vice versa. The crazy transgenders are often actually schitsophrenic – the reason they think they’re the other gender, or what they think is “other gender” and what that means to them, is a cognitive distortion, and those can be any odd association or behaviour, such as a person who thinks “the number three is listening because it has a nose”. It’s a sort of cognitive synesthesia – mixing of thought and meaning – or commonly known as having your wires crossed. It doesn’t necessarily need to make any sense, and usually there’s more than one such distortion which makes these people generally difficult and unpleasant to interact with. And then there are the transtrenders, who claim to be transgenders without any offical diagnosis simply to gain attention. Being attention seekers, they’re again narcissistic/egomanical and ultimately unpleasant to interact with.

Why would be such skill suddenly lost when, %deity forbid, the topic changes from tech to whatever else?

Stuff like encryption can help, where it’s done as close to the user as possible so only encrypted data, worthless to spies, gets passed through most of the levels of the system. Open source BIOSes are a good start. The other stuff can come in time. FPGAs might offer a nice option, bringing custom hardware into ordinary people’s reach, so stuff like NICs and maybe even SSD controllers can be brought back into the ownership of the guy who actually paid for the machine. SSDs in particular are nice, since writing custom code to run a mechanical hard drive is gonna be a bit of an effort. SSDs in comparison are just memory chips, well understood, so with copies of the right specs a bespoke full-custom SSD isn’t beyond the abilities of alpha-level hackers like Bunnie or Jeri. And then once it’s written, it can make it’s way around the world, people can check the code and compile their own hardware. Of course you have to trust the FPGA, but since they have so many uses, trying to put spy-hardware in there, for very specific and particular uses, is beyond practical I think. Since Xilinx have no idea which one of their chips is going to end up as a NIC, SSD controller, or graphics chip.

After that the first BIOS instruction executes. After BIOS comes up, microcode patches can be loaded to amend microcode to modify other housekeeping tasks.

Paying ex-Intelligence Services security consultants to hack them in to oblivion, we’re not talking about your average pen testers here, these guys are chip shavers and bus tappers. $5k for a POWER8, okay given the chip costs quite a bit anyway, but as secure workstations go I’d rather just use an ARM CPU with trust zones and know that it has been validated by security researchers.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Venkata Renduchintala is president of Intel's Client and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Credit: Qualcomm More like this Intel's siloed business units unify around IoT and connectivity Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets IBM cloud chief: The next phase of cloud is a race to add value Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel is now more than just a PC company. At industry events, the company's keynotes feature drones flying around, robots walking on stage and musicians creating tunes from wearables. The chip maker is helping BMW build an autonomous car, will sell modems to Apple and is leading the development of next-generation 5G cellular networks. For all these new markets, it will provide chip and data-center technologies. The transformation is happening partly under the leadership of Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Client and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses and Systems Architecture Group at Intel. As Intel's second-in-command, he helped cut struggling products like mobile CPUs and sharpened the company's focus on IoT, servers and connectivity. Hired from rival Qualcomm late last year, he's an outsider trying to rid Intel of its historical resistance to change. He's also bringing fresh ideas and wholesale changes to Intel, which promises to bring a new dynamic to the Silicon Valley institution. IDG News Service spoke with him on a range of topics including VR headsets, IoT, autonomous cars, competitors and the decision to cut products. This is an edited version of the discussion. IDGNS: How have you settled into your new job? What drew you to Intel? It's been a really interesting process of acclimation. It's a great mixture of feeling, like an organization where I think my experience and my interests can really help the journey [CEO] Brian [Krzanich] wants to undertake with the company. The scale at which Intel can play is probably going to be very difficult for others to match if you look across client, networking and the data center groups. The goal is to be able to think as one Intel. IDGNS: There have been questions on how you would fit into Intel, which has a closed culture and history of promoting executives internally. Many people hired from external companies haven't worked out. One thing that's really important to understand is that Intel is a company of tremendous heritage. I'm not coming in to fix anything. I'm coming in hopefully to add another dimension and an important ingredient to the management team that Brian has at his disposal. It requires me to respect what Intel has been able to achieve and the caliber of the management team and the brands assimilated. I don't think Brian hired me to maintain the status quo. I think what he wanted was a strong ingredient of outside-in thinking complementing the original thoughts. I'm feeling very comfortable now in being able to feel like I've got a good bunch of colleagues who know where I'm coming from; we can speak straight to each other and we can actually have really good discussions.  IDGNS: You had to make some decisions on cutting products Intel has worked on for years as the company's priorities were reset. How tough was it? When you come into a company you have a degree of objectivity that isn't tainted by your attachments to the genesis of certain projects. For me it was a fairly structured, objective discussion where you make decisions in a transparent and open manner. As long as you can walk people through your thinking, you can take what was very controversial and make it very logical. I'm passionate about technology but I'm also passionate about profitability and how the two are married in a seamlessly reinforcing way. IDGNS: What's the reasoning behind cutting mobile processors to focus on modems? First of all, we rationalized what we were spending our R&D on. We had a couple of mobile SoC products that I don't think were worthy to continue to conclusion. That doesn't mean to say we're no longer doing mobile platforms. On the mobile platform side, my commitment is to talk less and do more. When we have something to say we'll talk about it. On the modem side, it's a fundamental technology and this is where I think it comes down to being as indelible for us as our competence in CPU or GPU. We've set ourselves up with a very interesting road-map, but more importantly, we've established a degree of credibility, relevance and importance as a key technology partner with a number of key players in the industry that I think is really important. IDGNS: What are your top priorities and goals? I have three uber-level goals. One is to continue to drive our client computing business to a position of stable profitability in the face of a slowly declining [market]. I think we're doing well in that area. The second is to grow and scale our IoT business from something that's very interesting to something that's really substantial in the longer term. The IoT business for us is a microcosm of the entire company coming together -- we're creating a type of all-for-one, one-for-all mentality. The third is to maintain a degree of vibrancy in the technology leadership of our entire systems architecture organization. It's developing all the core technologies that really moves the competitive needle forward. IDGNS: Intel's untethered mixed-reality headset called Project Alloy was big news at IDF. What are the expectations from Alloy and how are things going? The whole point of having tetherless VR is a big deal. Everything we're doing in Alloy we're going to open-source. We can take VR and evolve it from the very rudimentary definitions today of [VR] in a smart phone that you clip into some kind of visor. You can move it to a capable, embedded PC that's driving two to three teraflops of computing and generate a really immersive experience. That was really it -- taking ideas out from the lab, productizing them, solving all those problems of integration, figuring out how RealSense and depth camera fits into all of that, figuring out how to do merged reality, and saying "now go scale the ecosystem." IDGNS: Is the VR headset the new PC? I think it's another very interesting growth opportunity for the PC. I think it can generate a specific class of products in its own right. It will generate different segmentation points and probably a custom piece of silicon built on the PC platform that amplify the use case. So we're very excited about the whole VR space. IDGNS: Intel hasn't given up on Moore's Law, though many believe it is reaching its end. How is Intel preparing for a future when manufacturing reaches atomic scale, and how will chips look beyond Kaby Lake? Nobody inside Intel is coming anywhere near the kind-of-like fatalistic conclusions about where Moore's Law is. Intel has had a stellar track record in delivering node generation like clockwork. Maybe we've moved from a two-year to a two-and-a-half-year cadence, but we already see light at the end of the tunnel. We will continue to drive process technology and nobody is calling timeout on anything. We're working hard on 7-nanometer, we're talking about pathfinding for 5-nanometer. All of that is in the throes. We made a great announcement on Kaby Lake -- that's using an evolution of 14-nanometer transistor geometry that gave a substantially improved user experience compared to Skylake. We're going to continue to do more of that as we continue to drive process leadership.  IDGNS: Are you happy with your current chip line-up -- Kaby Lake for PCs, and Atom for IoT? We have a competent portfolio of products. I'm in no way shape or form concluding they are complete and aren't going to benefit from augmentation. For me I think it's really wanting to understand the use cases a lot more. I don't see an IoT strategy for Intel being one where everything is delivered by Intel. It's integrating a number of different technologies that could be indigenous to Intel, or could be created by other companies, but managed in a way where people could look at Intel as somebody providing the overarching framework of integration. IDGNS: IoT is a big part of Intel's future. What's the strategy for that market? That's a significant business. I think we're just starting. As you see the advent of autonomous driving vehicles, you see robots and drones start to ship in scale: those are very high value opportunities for us. We characterize our IoT interests into three verticals: industrial, transportation and retail -- all of them have an end-to-end dimension where we're providing a client environment, the networking infrastructure and the data analytics platform that drives all of that through industry partnerships. IDGNS: Would in any way the ARM foundry deal help Intel achieve its goals in IoT and other areas? Would you be open to the idea of taking an ARM CPU license, as an example? Open to? Yes. My view is fairly straightforward -- that Intel's IoT plan has to not only be able to harmoniously integrate Intel-based microprocessors and MCUs, it has to be able to aggregate and harmoniously integrate a plethora of different types of MCUs, whether it be ARM-based, MIPS-based, or proprietary MCUs. All of them have the ability to monitor, sense data that they want to get on to an information highway of some kind. Our ability to [support] many different client environments is going to be a necessity in any vertical IoT strategy we have. There are many areas in the ARM ecosystem where Intel can pragmatically play in for its own benefit. I'm a big believer in paying respect to established ecosystems. IDGNS: Self-driving cars are a big deal for Intel. Could you talk about projects in the pipeline? Our goal is to provide the type of computing power that dwarfs anything that exists in a car today, but basically make it mainstream. What we're doing on our Xeon Phi processor for machine learning and deep learning, what we're doing in computer vision and also supplemented by radar and lidar. Being able to aggregate that data, generate intelligence, make decisions on it with assistance from machine and deep learning algorithms -- that's all happening as we speak. IDGNS: How do you see the autonomous car market evolving? I see the first explosive area to be in the urban transportation environment where  services like Uber and Lyft will evolve and develop. There's going to be a lot of experimentation and path-finding to do in addition to technology creation. We're probably talking about a decade away. Stamina to invest is going to be really important;  those that have the stamina to stay the course are going to win big. IDGNS: Nvidia is approaching the automotive markets aggressively with its GPUs; how will you compete? I have a great deal of respect for Nvidia. But every time I think of Nvidia, I think about Californian wine where they can make great wine but it contains only one grape -- great Cabernet Sauvignon or a great Chardonnay. I love French wines and French wines are blends where you need to be great at growing Cabernet, great at growing Merlot, great at growing Cabernet Franc. The art is in the mixture. That's the benefit Intel has. We have GPU, we have CPU, we have custom silicon, we have embedded storage, we have FPGA. Nvidia's going to basically say "I've got GPUs and I've got GPUs and I've got GPUs." Great strategy, but it doesn't give anywhere near the extensibility, flexibility and scalability that Intel is able to offer. IDGNS: How will 5G influence changes in the way devices are made and work? 5G is as much about the transformation of the network and the infrastructure as it is the client environment. [There is] going to be an even greater demand from mobile broadband bandwidth, people are going to want tens of gigabytes per second, if not hundreds of gigabytes per second. We're going to see much greater pervasiveness of client devices. If you talk about autonomous vehicles or delivering health services over a mobile network, you need to be able to make life or death decisions based on that. The network has to transform and the data center becomes a much higher order entity that's focused on massive data analytics that orchestrates that entire network.

According to investment bank Benchmark Company, Israeli signal processor designer Ceva Inc. (Nasdaq:CEVA); LSE:CVA) is "one of the main beneficiaries from the launch of the iPhone 7/7+." Benchmark bases its assessment on teardowns of the new Apple smartphones. Benchmark analysts Gary Mobley and Plamen Sirakov note that Apple's smartphone market share and unit sales are declining, but add that "Despite Apple's woes in the past year, many pay close attention to components used in Apple's iPhone flagship." As for Ceva, the analysts write: "It’s official! Intel is inside, and with it, so too is CEVA. For the first time, Intel’s thin modem is used in the iPhone, at least for some versions of the iPhone 7/7+. Qualcomm’s thin modem continues to be used in CDMA versions of the phone including those used on networks owned by Verizon, Sprint, most Chinese operators as well as those operated in Hong Kong and Puerto Rico, according to ChipWorks. Just as Qualcomm and Intel are splitting the thin cellular modem business with Apple, they too are splitting the associated RF and PMU content. "According to our sources and calculation, Intel and Qualcomm may split the thing modem supply 50/50-, and if true, our FY17 non-GAAP EPS estimate for CEVA would jump by as much as $0.25. To be more specific, we are modeling 50% 4G LTE royalty units growth for CEVA in FY17, and Apple alone could account for the entire delta. One must also consider tremendous growth and market share gains for CEVA-based Leadcore, Spreadtrum and Samsung LTE modems. "CEVA’s DSP IP is NOT used as part of the dual-camera image processing in the iPhone 7. However, the trend, in general, toward dual cameras should drive future licensing opportunities for CEVA and should drive design wins for CEVA’s existing 30+ vision and imaging licensees. "While teardowns available today cannot confirm this, we also believe CEVA's BT IP is being used in the AirPods. While the high price ($159), short battery life (five hours) and fear of losing the Pods may limit the unit sales potential of the AirPod, CEVA generates $0.005 in royalty per AirPod unit sold."

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint Are things finally looking up for Intel Corp.? After all, the microprocessor giant’s technology has even made its way into Apple’s latest iPhones. According to reports, the chip maker is supplying a portion of the modems for Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Last week, Intel raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years, citing improving demand for PCs. The firm said in a statement that PC makers were replenishing laptop and desktop inventory, which means Intel is likely to ship out more chips. This is consistent with reports that PC shipments beat expectations in the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide PC shipments totalled 62.4 million units, a year-on-year decline of 4.5%, beating the forecast of a 7.4% fall, according to research firm International Data Corp. (IDC). Historically, most of Intel’s sales have come from the PC business. But the world’s largest chip maker has been struggling for the last few years as users shift away from PCs to mobile devices for their computing needs. Sales for the firm’s PC business, which includes chips for phones and tablets, declined 3% to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. This means Intel is looking for revenue streams outside of the core PC-based business, both globally and in India. In the PC business in India, Intel is targeting newer markets that extend beyond the large cities, to new users of technology who have not yet had access to computing so as to establish relevance of technology for these citizens. The company has collaborated with the government to make this possible – their work with CSCs has resulted in Ek Kadam Unnati Ki Aur, wherein Intel provides access to computing devices and relevant local content and training to non-urban citizens. But it is Intel’s Data Centre segment that is the crucial part of its India operations. Globally, it is the data centre business that delivers almost half of Intel’s operating margins and is expected to grow revenue at ~15% through 2018. “Our strategy is data centre architectural transformation, wherein computer, storage and network resources transform to become software defined infrastructure (SDI) that enable flexible, agile and on-demand services. We have an outstanding portfolio of products available and a very strong road map of data centre portfolio to accelerate this transformation,” said Debjani Ghosh, vice-president of the sales and marketing group and managing director of South Asia at Intel. In driving the cloud vision, Intel is collaborating with software and hardware partners including Dell, HP, Cisco, Red Hat, VMware and other local equipment manufacturers. Ghosh is optimistic about the future of Intel. She believes there are two key factors that will continue to give Intel growth opportunities in the Indian market. “First, our agility to develop products and solutions across a breadth of industry requirements. We are creating a common, flexible, industry standard architectural foundation across server, storage, and network,” says Ghosh. The second factor is local and global collaborations. Last year, Intel collaborated with C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) to train 20,000 developers over the next seven years to build applications for high performance computing, to enable India to be a part of the select league of advanced countries with the top supercomputing machines in the world.

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion (roughly Rs. 48,811 crores) in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. (Also see: Global Tablet Market Continues to Shrink: IDC) However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering.HP, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion (roughly Rs. 1,04,325 crores), plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion (roughly Rs. 99,644 crores), plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. (Also see: PC Shipments in India Declined 2.2 Percent in Q2 2016: IDC) RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Tags: Intel, IDC, HP, PC, Laptops, Tablets, Mobiles, Internet iOS 10: Ten Cool Things to Try in Apple's Latest Mobile OS Intel Raises Revenue Forecast as PC Market Improves     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Motorola Moto M Lyf F8 Asus ZenFone 3 Max (ZC553KL) General Mobile GM5 Xiaomi Redmi 4A Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Xiaomi Redmi 4 Micromax Canvas Spark 4G Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » RDP ThinBook 1430B 14.1 I...

Recently it has been hinted that could be the case, but in case allusions and hints weren’t enough, a teardown conducted by the folks at Chipworks has pretty much confirmed that Intel’s modems are present on the iPhone 7. In Chipworks’ teardown, they confirm that the Intel XMM7360 modem is being used in the iPhone 7. However they note that the iPhone model that the did the teardown with was the Model A1778 version, which basically points to the GSM model, so it is unclear if the CDMA version for Sprint and Verizon will yield a similar modem. However as per our previous post, we did point out that Intel’s modem is not compatible with the CDMA standard that Sprint and Verizon are currently using, meaning that more likely than not we will still find Qualcomm’s modems in those models. It is also why Apple has yet to make the transition to Intel completely, although we guess keeping multiple suppliers so as not to be too dependent on one company is also pretty normal practice for a lot of businesses. In any case at the end of the day, this shouldn’t really affect your phone’s performance, but as WIRED points out, this is the first time an Intel mobile chip has found its way into a high-end flagship device, and given Intel’s struggle to break into the mobile scene via SoCs, perhaps modems could be its way in.

English Cafe > Tech > Samsung Samsung inches closer to top in global chip market   Published : 2016-09-19 11:21 Updated : 2016-09-19 23:55 [THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics' semiconductor business has gained growth momentum in the April-June period on the back of its robust NAND flash memory business, latest data shows. According to a report by market research firm IHS, Samsung gained a 11.3-percent market share in the global market for integrated device manufacturers, including memory and non-memory chip companies, chip design houses, and foundries, in the three-month period. The figure is the second highest, behind US chip powerhouse Intel which attained 14.7 percent market share. Samsung Electronics’ vertical NAND flash memory chip. Samsung Electronics As a result, the gap between Samsung and Intel decreased from 4 percent in the first quarter to 3.4 percent in the second quarter. The gap has been constantly dropping every year: 5.3 percent in 2012, 4.2 percent in 2013, 3.4 percent in 2014 and 3.2 percent in 2015. Samsung has been able to narrow the gap below 4 percent again in the second quarter thanks to the robust sales of its NAND flash memory chips. The Korean tech firm's NAND flash business unit saw its second-quarter sales increase 5.4 percent on-year while the NAND flash memory sales of Intel whose flagship business is still that for non-memory chips for PCs and laptops dropped 1.2 percent during the same period. Samsung’s supply of NAND memory chips for Apple’s new handsets iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and its own Galaxy Note 7 reportedly boosted its revenue in the memory chip segment. The two companies were followed by Qualcomm, Broadcom and SK hynix, which secured 4.6 percent, 4.3 percent, and 4.0 percent, respectively, in the second quarter. Although the US chip company has been ramping up its efforts to increase its presence in the global memory market, transforming its chip manufacturing factory in Dalian, China to one tailored for NAND flash chips, for example, it has not produced outstanding results in terms of sales yet. “In a bid to take the lead in the NAND flash memory market, Samsung could increase the production capacity by building more manufacturing facilities,” Hwang Min-seong, an analyst from Samsung Securities, anticipated in his recent financial report.

Before becoming AMD's CTO and SVP, he spent 26 years at IBM, working his way into its Integration & Values Team and Technical Leadership Team – two exclusive and highly confidential workforces. Following his tenure at IBM, he went on to join Apple, Cisco Systems, before taking up position at AMD. Papermaster is a man armed with a wealth of knowledge and so, when he says that AMD is on its way back into the big leagues, ready to go toe-to-toe with Intel and Nvidia once again, you sit up and listen. Papermaster is also the first to admit that AMD fell behind. In server-grade architecture Intel owns practically 99% of the market; Intel dominates in the high-performance CPU space; and Nvidia is absolutely killing it in the high-end graphics department. But AMD hasn't been sitting on its laurels for the past few years, it's been actively working towards coming back bigger than ever, and it's within the next year that AMD will see the investment really begin to pay off. “As you know, semiconductors aren't like software, where you can say you're shifting focus and within the year have a new software product out,” Papermaster explains to me as we meet to discuss the future of AMD. “We shifted our focus years ago, and it takes that long [to make a change]. The products we're rolling out now are high-performance products – it's a return to our roots and we're very focused.” "It's a return to our roots and we're very focused." But what, exactly, is the company focused upon? Well, according to Papermaster, AMD used to be 90% dependent on the PC business – today, more than half of its revenue comes from the semi-custom business. Games consoles form a large part of this, and that's why the three key areas of AMD's comeback strategy focus around games, “immersive platforms” and, erm, data centres. Clearly, of the three areas that form AMD's focus, the data centre is the least sexy area, but it's the one with the largest potential for change. Intel – AMD's biggest rival – holds 99% of this market, having stolen back most of the 30% share AMD once enjoyed back in its heyday. Seeing as AMD predicts that the data centre space will be worth $18bn by 2019, grabbing back that 30% or more is sure to be lucrative for AMD's growth. In the games space, however, AMD is already absolutely crushing it. As an industry, games is worth more than $15 billion a year – and will only continue to grow. For now, AMD dominates the home-console market, supplying chips for the Xbox One, PS4 and Wii U – with the Xbox Project Scorpio and PS4 Pro also set to use AMD chips. In the PC space, however, it needs to fight back against the ever-growing force that is Nvidia and it's high-end graphics cards. It is in “immersive platforms” that AMD is ready to take its biggest leap, though. Papermaster sees the growth of VR, AR and Mixed Reality as a key space for AMD and its future. “We've gone from radio to TV; sound to audio-visual to interactive. But each one of these progressions engages you further… immersive computing is clearly the next way we'll interface with computing. It isn't just about seeing and hearing; it will involve all of your senses because you're truly surrounded by audio, visual and – eventually – haptics. “We've had the technology to create VR for years, but now it's affordable. The breakthrough this year is not only the development of head-mounted displays, but the development of CPUs and graphics that can drive them. Several years ago, we made a decision to invest in high-end graphics and high-end computing, and we've come out with a set of products ready to create a great VR experience.” It's these products that form the lynchpin of AMD's revival plan. Its upcoming Zen CPU is slated to be the first high-performance chip from AMD that can compete on a par with Intel's own architecture – benching the same, if not better than Intel's Broadwell E Core i7. Zen also offers 40% better performance than it's Excavator chipset using the same amount of energy. AMD's Radeon range also brings VR-ready graphics cards to the market, with the RX 480 – which sits between Nvidia's 1060 and 1070 cards – capable of pushing out power at a much more affordable price point. Suddenly, with these products, AMD is back in the running. Video of Breakthrough Performance of Next-Generation &ldquo;Zen&rdquo; “There's pent-up demand for competition.” Being a competitor is exactly what AMD wants to be within these spaces. “There's pent-up demand for competition,” explains Papermaster. “High-performance desktop and server [are areas that both] have a clear lack of competition. Both are dominated by our competitor and hungry for a competitive product – which is exactly what Zen will bring. “We've committed to a very strong roadmap, and my commitment is absolutely competitive, generational improvements. When our customers come back to us once we've released Zen and see we're back in the thick of the competition, making use of leapfrogging design teams, we'll absolutely maintain a competitive pace in the industry.”   Now, after years of slumber, it looks as if AMD is finally back in with the big industry players. Papermaster sums up how AMD made such huge progressions by stating that because “AMD is a fraction of the size of Intel, it causes us to be extremely innovative in how we create products.” But AMD isn't done here. We already know that it plans to maintain pace with the rest of the industry, but if it wants to hit the lofty heights of high-end immersive computing, it needs to do more. Thankfully, it sounds as if the company is up to the challenge: “if you want to go from what we have today to true presence, [there are] orders of magnitude more progression that we need to do. “That is, however, our passion; it's what AMD engineers live to do.” This article originally appeared at alphr.com Related Articles Both Nvidia and AMD release hot fix drivers New AMD Radeon Software Crimson drivers out now AMD unveils Radeon Solid State Graphics tech for workstation GPUs Gigabyte releases G1 Gaming RX 480 video card AMD's RX 480 claims the DirectX 12 crown in new Futuremark benchmark Source: Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  amd   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   What does a Trump win mean for tech and science?     Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     Samsung: When the giant trips     How WD is making storage sexy again     With Pixel, Google is barrelling headfirst into Apple’s backyard   More in Atomic (1 of 10 articles) NEWS Roccat releases Cross cross-platform gaming headphones << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Both Nvidia and AMD release hot fix drivers << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (3 of 10 articles) NEWS Group on trial for cyber-theft of $15M in FIFA Coins << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (4 of 10 articles) NEWS Might want to hold off on those 375.86 Nvidia drivers << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (5 of 10 articles) NEWS New GeForce 375.86 WHQL drivers out now << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (6 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: G.Skill Ripjaws MX780 impresses first time << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (7 of 10 articles) FEATURE The SLI question: Is multi-GPU worth it? << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (8 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: Fractal Design Define C is a great mix of silence and features << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (9 of 10 articles) GALLERY Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016 << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (10 of 10 articles) NEWS The beautiful PC mods of PAX Australia 2016! << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Atomic News Roccat releases Cross cross-platform gaming headphones Review Review: G.Skill Ripjaws MX780 impresses first time Feature The SLI question: Is multi-GPU worth it?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 18, 2016 at 2:00PM Image source: Intel.  Earlier this year, chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) disclosed to investors that it had axed its "tick-tock" product development methodology in favor of a new one known as "process-architecture-optimization". Until Intel formally unveiled its seventh-generation Core processor family -- the first "optimization" that Intel is bringing to market -- it wasn't clear what this development methodology really entailed. However, the details behind this strategy are now much more apparent. Although it's a reasonable change, I believe that Intel would be best-served with additional investments to make it even better. Allow me to explain. Understanding the current strategy Under Intel's process-architecture-optimization development methodology, here's what the company is expected to deliver with each step: Process: This is a direct replacement for the "tick" under Intel's previous methodology. What Intel delivers here is a slightly enhanced processor core, as well as a new graphics processor manufactured on a significantly denser manufacturing technology than the product that came before it. Architecture: And this is a replacement for the "tock". In this step, Intel launches a "new" processor core with substantial performance and feature enhancements over the prior-generation. Intel is also expected to deliver a new graphics processor architecture in this step, along with other significant platform feature enhancements. It is likely that, going forward, Intel will build this chip on a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology that made its debut in the "process" step. Optimization: Based on what Intel delivered with its seventh-generation Core processor family, it would appear that here, Intel takes essentially the same architecture that came in the previous step and implements it on a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology that was used in the "architecture" stage. With this methodology, Intel can deliver new and better products each year, so in that respect, it is a clear win. However, there is room for Intel to enjoy further improvements -- if it's willing to make the required investments. Optimization could enjoy architectural benefits During the optimization stage, Intel's products see performance benefits associated with the new manufacturing technologies. In effect, the company can run these chips at higher speeds while keeping power consumption the same. But it might make sense for Intel to try to be more aggressive on the architectural side of things here, too. Remember that under "tick-tock", Intel's architecture teams planned for all-new CPU architectures every two years and new graphics architectures every three years. Indeed, it's not as though the "tick-tock" methodology was derailed by execution problems on the part of the architecture teams. Indeed, the problems are clearly related to the inability of Intel's manufacturing group to make generational manufacturing technology leaps at the same speed they used to be able to. So, going forward, Intel would probably be better served by adopting the following methodology: Step 1: Move to an all-new manufacturing technology, tweak the CPU cores a bit, and introduce a new graphics processor. This would be analogous to a traditional "tick" under the prior methodology (in other words, think Intel's third generation Core processors and its fifth generation Core processors).  Step 2: Move to a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology in step 1 but also deliver significant generational leaps in both CPU, graphics, and platform architecture more than is typically expected. This would basically be the same as a "tock" under Intel's previous methodology (think fourth generation Core and sixth generation Core processors) but with the added boost from a performance-enhanced version of the manufacturing technology. Step 3: Move to an even higher-performance variant of the manufacturing technologies in step 1 and step 2, tweak the processor cores a bit, and introduce a new graphics architecture. This would also be like a "tick" under Intel's previous development methodology, but the main difference would be that the manufacturing technology delivers better performance (which is all the end customer really cares about) but doesn't deliver the cost reduction that comes with a smaller manufacturing technology.  Under such a methodology, Intel's core intellectual property teams don't have to change the pace at which they introduce new technologies, but the performance enhancements that the chipmaker will be able to deliver with each generation, and cumulatively over a three-year/generation period, would be much better. This would ultimately mean better products and stronger competitive positioning for the chip giant in the years ahead. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Apple’s iPhone 7 does not bring any significant improvement in terms of design but it packs the best possible hardware specifications. It is needless to say that both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the most powerful smartphones in their categories. At its special event in San Francisco, Apple executive Phil Schiller dived deep into the hardware prowess of latest iPhones but left specifics for iFixit and Chipworks to reveal. Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack but also made way for Intel chips. No, Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus don’t have Intel processors, rather the chipmaker is helping with the phone part of the device. Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus compromises of four Intel components — two RF transceivers, the baseband modem and power management IC. Apple iPhone 7 model used by Chipworks for teardown reveals Intel’s XMM7360 modem as the baseband processor. The baseband processor is responsible for LTE advanced smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. Apple is also using two Intel PMB5750 as the default multimode RF transceiver. According to Techinsights, the RF transceivers are designed on TSMC’s 28nm process. This is Intel’s big big win with the iPhone 7. The company has also supplied its power management IC codenamed PMB6826. Earlier, iPhone 7 Plus teardown by iFixit revealed what has actually replaced the headphone jack. According to iFixit, a large portion of the area utilised by headphone is now being used to incorporate a bigger battery and the new taptic engine. Apple’s new taptic engine inside iPhone 7 Plus is considerably bigger and paves way for iPhone without home button.

Over a cheap bottle of chardonnay one dark night in Cupertino, Intel wooed Apple with flimsy promises. The pair felt a connection (around the 1.9GHz mark) after the iPhone maker opened up about its long-distance relationship with San Diego's Qualcomm. "I don't want to get too tied down," Apple sighed. "I'm not ready for the commitment." "Baby, I'm here for you," said Intel. "But you don't know anything about mobile." "I've changed, baby, I've changed." Apple's heart melted like a Galaxy Note 7 in a child's hand. Now, thought Intel, if only it could scheme its way further into the MacBook maker's life to wreck any plans to move from x86 to ARM. I just can't understand why my screenwriting career hasn't taken off. A peek inside the iPhone 7 has confirmed that Apple is using a mix of Intel and Qualcomm radio modems in the new handsets. Typically, Qualcomm provides these communications chips, which are used to connect the device wirelessly to the cellular network for calls, texts and mobile internet. Apple hates being tied down to a single component source, so it decided to give Intel a shot. There's also the interesting dynamic of Qualcomm providing Snapdragon system-on-chips and modems to Apple's arch-rival Samsung. Couple that with Intel's desire to get its radio modem business a slice of the massive mobile world – while Intel's traditional PC world diminishes – and that Apple relies on Intel x86 processors for its desktop and laptop products, you can see why Apple let Intel in through the backdoor to its iPhone production. We all knew it was coming. In a conference call with investment analysts in April, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf said he was "assuming" that a major customer – cough, cough, Apple – would use a second supplier. And in July, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he was "concerned about getting the leading-edge momentum going for us with the 7360" – that's the XMM 7360 modem that launched in 2015. And true enough, the XMM 7360 has turned up in some iPhone 7 and 7 Plus handsets. There's a catch: this chip doesn't support CDMA networks. So if you buy an Intel-modem phone, and you want to switch to a CDMA network, such as Sprint or Verizon in the US, you'll be out of luck. Qualcomm's X12 radio modems support CDMA so iPhones using those chips will work universally. Luckily, there's a handy guide on Apple's website listing the two variants of the iPhone 7/7 Plus. The A1660/A1661 works with GSM and CDMA networks, sports a Qualcomm MDM9645M X12 modem chipset, and works with Verizon and Sprint in the US. The A1778/A1784 supports GSM, sports an Intel modem chipset, and works with AT&T and T-Mobile US in America. What the Apple website doesn't mention is that if you carrier unlock an A1660/A1661, you'll be able to use it on AT&T and T-Mobile US because the Qualcomm modem inside will support those networks. But if you carrier unlock an A1778/A1784, you won't be able to use it on CDMA networks. Basically, if you want a phone that works everywhere, get the A1660/A1661. If in doubt, check the model number against the aforementioned webpage for carrier compatibility. For what it's worth, in the UK, Apple will sell you an A1778/A1784 that supports 3, EE, O2 and Vodafone. Intel isn't insane for leaving out CDMA support, by the way: the standard is dying, and Qualcomm owns a load of CDMA patents, so Chipzilla decided to skip it. To further complicate things, potentially, Apple can switch out Intel's XMM 7360 in its GSM-only A1778/A1784 for the tried-and-tested Qualcomm X12 but use firmware to limit the phone to non-CDMA networks. This could happen if something goes wrong with the Intel supply – such as if the XMM 7360 isn't up to the X12's performance. One final thought: the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus won't support the expensive AWS-3 radio bands, aka LTE band 66, which were cleared to make way for greater mobile broadband coverage in the US.

Housing was raised and on this issue they spoke of "competitiveness and potential impact to employees". They also touched on issues such as Brexit, employment and tax. A spokeswoman for Intel said the company continually "engages on topics of competitive significance, including housing for employees". Intel employs around 4,500 people in Leixlip, Co Kildare. Sinnott also attended a meeting in the Department of Jobs where the deployment of broadband was raised. Last week, Susan Dargan of State Street, the international financial services company which employs 2,500 people here, said that accommodation could become an issue if firms in the sector decided to locate to Ireland following the Brexit vote. She suggested that Dublin city planners would have to consider raising height restrictions on buildings. Earlier this year Cathy Kearney, head of Apple's European operations, met with Cork city council and said that plans to expand its European headquarters could be hindered by the lack of housing available for staff. Apple is set to create 1,000 new jobs in Cork, bringing the workforce there to 6,000.

Airplanes. Cloud Computing. And Alien Abductions. Blog Twitter Aviation Museums Archives IoT is Software trying to grok Hardware Thoughts on platforms, standardization, scale, and economics in information software, digitally enhanced products, and their convergence in the Internet of Things. If I had a hammer Clemens Vasters Follow Mönchengladbach Email Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn XING Instagram Github Stackoverflow Pinterest Foursquare YouTube Flickr Vine The (mainstream, information) software industry thrives on standardization and scale. For servers and desktops, Intel’s x86 architecture has become the universal foundation, the UNIX userland model (and Windows) reign on the server, the PC desktop/notebook space is overwhelmingly dominated by Windows and OSX, tablets and mobile phones are similarly split between Android and iOS. The software industry likes some level of platform competition, but things tend to shake down to two major choices, and sometimes we end up with quasi monopolies. There’s obviously endless variety of apps and services on top of those foundations, but the software industry really loves monoculture when it comes to platforms. Platform wars in the industry, like the “Windows vs. Linux” evergreen, or “Android vs. iOS” are driven by that desire for monoculture. Software is a complex world, and most people in the industry have little choice but to invest deeply in a particular slice of that world in terms of learning and experience so that they can stay competitive. If their chosen slice of the world doesn’t end up becoming everyone’s favorite monoculture it threatens people’s carreers. People make bets on the future and then try hard to make “their team” win. The people in software love one winning platform - “theirs”. Monoculture (and “duoculture”) is great for scale. If you’re building a mobile phone app, you build for Android and iOS. If you’re building a desktop application you build for Windows and OSX. Or sometimes you start just with the bigger target or the target that’s most used by your target audience. Any of those platform has hundreds of millions of end-users to try your product on. One of the most interesting aspects of the “Internet of Things” (IoT) wave is that it represents the software industry’s attempt to make sense out of the diversity of “Things”; a diversity that is entirely alien in the mainstream software industry. “Things” is a giant and impossible technology umbrella. Under the term “IoT”, the software industry discusses adding digital capabilities to “Things” that span anything between a super tanker ship to a throwaway digital label sticker on a cereal box. And it’s often outright amusing when the software industry treats “Things” as if their approach to making hardware was novel in itself and that the true complexity of building “Things” were not existing. Another difference that software people struggle with, sometimes with outrage about the perceived unfairness of it all, is that the barriers to enter any market requiring manufactured products are significantly higher than in software; you’ll always need a lot more than a notebook, a coffee shop to camp in, and some base funding for cloud compute and storage resources. Creating tangible “Things” requires broad mix of engineering talents, there’s a supply chain to manage, and there are often complex sets of (internationally diverging) safety and other standards regulations to comply with. And because most industries don’t favor monoculture and one king for every hill as much as software, there will always be competing vendors that will aim to play the profit margins game better, and therefore it makes a real difference whether a particular component can be sourced for a few cents more or less per unit and that there is no costly unused capability. Software’s strategy to deal with heterogeneity is standardization; and therefore the mainstream computer/software industry comes up with platform: There are dozens of different tiny computers (“maker boards”) that each provide enough ecosystem scale for someone to invest their time in. Arduino/Genuino has a thriving community, because it provides a family of boards with a matching set of easy-to-use tools that work equally well across that family. Most of those tiny computers have a common way to speak to external components like attached servos and sensors. And those tiny computers are easily networkable, and their software platform has ways to easily integrate with other software on server computers or in the cloud. It’s software’s take on hardware. That sort of standardization is, so far, not hardware’s take on hardware; especially not at consumer product scale. Very many if not most toys you can buy in a toy store today have some electronics; nearly every kitchen appliance, big or small, contains electronics; cars are rolling miniature “data centers” with several dozen microcontrollers and processors. Quasi any of these digital components has a custom design that is made of the exact components required to fulfill a predetermined set of tasks, even if those can be enhanced and varied with software. Microcontroller types come in dozens and sometimes hundreds of different variations that satisfy a basic demand for some level of platform commonality, but nevertheless differ in available memory, nonvolatile storage, clock speed, power consumption, shielding, physical footprint, and special capability such as on-chip cryptography or signal processing. “Embedded systems developers” have the particular skill to deal with such a diverse capability zoo where devices have very little in common and there is no platform standard. The maker boards are great prototyping platforms, but at consumer scale they are far from being cost competitive with a custom circuit board and specially selected and sourced components. It might not be so terrible if that cost could be offset by vastly broader, software-based functionality in a product, but how many devices in addition to the general-purpose phones and tablets do we need where software plays center stage? There’s a different kind of standardization that is common in everyday hardware and that’s centered around user interaction. A hammer is a hammer. In products where a basic function is well known and doesn’t require “smarts”, electronics best enhance the capability; it quickly tips over to the silly if they attempt to take center stage. There are a few and (mostly) intuitive variations for how to control a water faucet in a washroom; the electronically controlled, sensor-operated faucet has become the modern default choice for public spaces. Sensor-operation has several clear benefits, requires no cerenomy to operate, and the function doesn’t get in the way of the design. It’s a perfect enhancement. Software’s leaning towards monoculture sadly reflects in interaction design and how that spills into IoT devices. Today, software generally surfaces to people through some form of a pixel grid display, and it allows interaction via keyboard, touch, stylus, or some pointing device - because that’s how the standard, general-purpose consumer information and communication devices interface with people. That interface model is not necessarily the best way to use functions of a special-purpose tool or machine. Without having such obvious prior art to look at, the most common “IoT” software solution for turning on a faucet might just be to put a touch screen display next to it or, worse, require the user to use a smartphone app. Software wants to play and retain center stage. The hipster “IoT” door bell (or door lock; there are now plenty to choose from) comes with an app and the maker really wants you to think of it as thing you care about as an important part of your life. There’s a motion sensor, a camera, two-way calling, and an affordable cloud service for just a few dollars a month. You can get push notifications! The app has new features every month. And statistics! But these cookie-cutter, standalone door bell devices are mostly clunky and look awfully out of place on mostly any building, and outside the demo videos, few of their features matter after the first excited week of ownership. Besides, if you really need two-way calling between your mobile phone and your door bell you could buy available solutions for more than the last two decades, and in a myriad of style options that fits the design and architecture of your house. And you still can. And some of them even have apps now. Because there’s an existing industry that has done building entry systems for a hundred years and they have, amongst other things, also figured out how to construct those things such that you can’t just easily rip them off the wall and walk away with them. And they already do digital keys, smart phone NFC, card readers, and finger-print access control in a modular fashion; they don’t aim to get in the way or take center stage and the manufacturers have well established relationships with architects and firms who install those systems. For most devices and tools used in our daily lives, we care about the primary function and the form. A spoon needs to be a good spoon. It needs to be comfortable to eat from, comfortable to hold, have an attractive shape, and it must not easily bend out of shape or be susceptible to lasting discolorations. There are indeed several IoT startups that want to hit it big with “smart” forks and spoons; if those spoons or forks are not primarily excellent spoons and forks and then also some sort of revolutionary diet tracker, nobody except the extreme techno geek fringe will ever care about them. And nobody, nobody! will ever want to battery-charge a spoon. Excellent water fixtures are difficult to make. Excellent windows are difficult to make. Excellent piping and pressure vessels are difficult to make. Excellent gears and drives are difficult to make. Excellent vehicle suspension systems are difficult to make. Excellent rocket engines are difficult to make. Machines that have moving parts and that need to deal with the reality of physics, reliabily, safely, and sustainably are hard to make. And the market differentiation for these machines is that they do their primary job better than any other machine, which is largely a physical interaction function that may then be aided by supporting software. But software doesn’t take center stage. As you get to large composite machines like cars and trucks and aircraft, there’s a giant network of multiple tiers of suppliers that form long value chains. Silicon Valley’s favorite auto maker, Tesla, employs dozens of global “Tier 1” suppliers for the various vehicle subsystems outside of what they consider their core competency (in their case, batteries and motors), just like any other car maker. Much of the integration in these complex machines is already digital. Many car steering wheels are rotation sensors with force feedback that feed into the steering system, potentially corrected by assistance systems like lane-keeping or the electronic stability program. If you feel the steering getting stiffer at high speeds that happens because some software makes that happen. The latest generation vehicles from the leading automakers with radar-assisted cruise control will initiate auto emergency braking and actively refuse to run into an obstacle if it’s physically possible to avoid doing so. The array of airbags around you will pop in milliseconds if a collision is inevitable. All software controlled. All highly specialized systems. Hard real time. Some of those systems have just one feature, and often that feature will never run through the main action sequence during the lifetime of the vehicle. This is software that’s not in the limelight. It’s not “agile”, fairly slow moving, and generally subject to rigorous quality assurance processes because letting an oversight slip may end up killing someone. That software is largely not understood by the hipster quarters of the software world. “Software is eating the world” is a recent software industry meme and is often used pointing to the ride-share or apartment-sublet brokers that, so far, cleverly manage to push the capital investments to their “associates” and monetize the information channel between those service providers and the customers. Others point to the torrent of home automation and entertainment gadgets brought about by the IoT hype. The fact is that software already ate a huge chunk of the world, but not necessarily in plain sight. Software on devices often interconnects and orchestrates components, but it’s mostly insular in nature and not wired (or radioed) up to the rest of the world - and in very many cases that is a blessing since software found on devices today had often been written without any expectation that it would ever have to stand up to external security threats. Some of the “Internet of Things” wave is about the information software industry coming to the realization that this other world exists and it discovers, sometimes in horror, how different that world is. Some of that wave is about pretending that intelligence in devices hasn’t existed until about now and that a coffee maker with a timer function or a thermostat with an outdoor sensor (and a timer function) is somehow novel. The most interesting tension developing around the IoT will be how to achieve product scalability. There are analyst predictions for tens of billions of new connected devices in the next 5-10 years, far eclipsing the number of mobile phones. But mobile phones are a class of functionally very similar devices with very similar hardware for which just two competitive operating systems exist, splitting nearly 95% of the market. There’s a driver ecosystem, there are capability profiles, and there is therefore a good foundation for a broad array of common tools and utility libraries to build solutions on. The overwhelming number of special-purpose devices are custom designed to do a particular set of tricks. There is hardly any standardization and the capabilities as well as the components that provide them will necessarily diverge. Available energy budget, required compute power, available physical space, and required environment robustness, and achievable retail/wholesale pricing force hard constraints for devices where software does not take center stage. In addition, many of the tools from IT land are inadequate. Embedded device programming is often “low level” in order to deal with aforementioned constraints, but also because acceptable compromises in IT, such as a second-long pause for memory garbage collection, are wholly inacceptable for real-time devices. It’s far from obvious how a investment-happy and rapid-growth industry with the wide profit margins enjoyed by the software industry can emerge out of such a diverse environment. “IoT” is in large parts about finding middle ground between the monoculture-fueled breadth of platform tooling and capabilities and the wealth of libraries that can grow on top and the need for razor sharp focus for what a device needs. And it’s about software grokking that with physical tools and devices, the are a lot of humble background roles to play in order to make helpful products, and that the key to unlocking useful scenarios is not one device, but a combination of them. We use dozens of tools and devices in the kitchen for a meal, we use dozens of tools to fix the outdoor patio. Each is important for a task, but I’m not going to develop a particularly deep relationship with any one of them. I care about a stocked toolbox more than I care about each tool. A few cheap and humble functions implemented in a common fashion across many devices may quite well enable great higher order scenarios that uniquely benefit from by local or Internet connectivity. I’d love to be able to say “Alexa/Cortana/Siri, where did I put the size 3 cross-slot screwdriver?” and I get told “You put it into a box on the second shelf from the top in the right kitchen storage cabinet last time I saw you having it. There’s also one in the toolbox in the garage.” I’d like that a lot more than my screwdriving performance statistics on an app. Really. Go make that. The “Internet of Things” is not a Silicon Valley startup phenomenon. Adding connected digital capabilities to tools, toys, devices, and machines that surround us at home, at work, and during our fun activities, is something that the software industry will surely be able to help with. But the manufacturers who must ultimately lead in making the “Internet of Things” real are those with experience, depth industry requirements knowledge, supply chain relationships, and capital investments to deliver excellent safe and robust tools, toys, devices, and machines; with digitally enhancements as a secondary capability. Excellent software in an awful hammer still makes an awful hammer.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 19, 2016 at 3:43PM Image source: Getty Images. For investors, it's usually a good idea to greet pitches about the "next big thing" with a hefty dose of skepticism. After all, these hyped-up technologies rarely deliver the transformative shift that they promised. And even if the next Segway scooter or Kindle e-reader does somehow change the rules, that's no guarantee that it will produce good returns for the shareholders of the companies involved. Yet that's no reason to ignore the major trends that threaten to reshape entire industries. One particularly powerful emerging technology is drones, those tiny flying vehicles that you're probably noticing zip through the skies around you with more frequency lately. According to a recent report from PwC (link opens PDF), drones have the potential to replace $130 billion of business across key areas of the economy, including transportation, security, and agriculture. The media and entertainment sector is right in the crosshairs of this shift, with nearly $9 billion of possible impact. Snap a great video Start with the most obvious application: aerial photography and filming. After all, one of the key benefits of a drone is that it can capture images and video with more flexibility and at a tiny fraction of the cost of a helicopter. That's what makes the segment so attractive to GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), whose cameras already find themselves attached to drones that are produced by other companies. With its Karma release this week, the sport-camera specialist aims to tackle this space and begin to capitalize on the fact that consumers already see it as a drone company even though it hasn't sold one under its own brand. Karma is out there. Meet Karma 9.19.16 #GoProKarma https://t.co/45sp1cQa3G pic.twitter.com/zON1m2jzHm — GoPro (@GoPro) September 15, 2016 Teaser video from the Karma drone. Source: GoPro. "We're uniquely positioned to be successful out of the gates with Karma, given the strength of GoPro's brand in the drone category," the company's chief financial officer told investors early this year, adding, "even though GoPro has not had a drone product." That optimistic reading will be put to a serious test this holiday season. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), which produces the tech that powers tiny portable cameras, is another important company to watch in this space. GoPro is one of its biggest customers, and a successful launch of Karma might help it recover its lost growth momentum. However, Ambarella's high-end product focus, which includes features like 4K resolution and electronic image stabilization, also position it for growth in applications outside of the consumer world -- in places like the professional filming of commercials, movies, and sporting events. Investors are hoping that this quality focus is the right strategy to defend against low-cost competitors that are flooding the market. Make a visual impact Rather than just filming the entertainment, however, drones can also turn into the main draw themselves. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) last year put on a light show that featured 100 drones moving in concert to orchestra music. "We have visions of going from 100 to 1,000, over time," CEO Brian Krzanich said, in a nod to how easily the technology could scale. Source: Intel. The applications of Intel's hardware and software solutions include sporting events where drones would entertain onlookers during breaks, as well as use in populated areas where they might project or carry advertisements. In any case, these devices will play a key role in its Internet of Things division. Disney (NYSE:DIS) is also looking to be an early adopter of this technology for entertainment purposes. The House of Mouse plans to use drones around its theme parks for creating lighting effects and potentially replacing those loud nightly firework shows. The devices could eventually do much more, though, including animating dozens of small, or a handful of giant, flying puppet characters in the skies above its resorts. In a few years, the drone shows might just become a staple at Disney parks and help keep those ticket sales churn higher. It's impossible to predict which companies, if any, will capture persistent returns from the emerging popularity of drones in the entertainment and media world. The good news is that investors have a wide range of risk-return matchups to consider -- everything from highly dependent companies like GoPro and Ambarella to more diversified options like Intel and Disney.

Swan, finance chief at EBay Inc. from March 2006 to July 2015, will oversee Intel’s finance, internal technology and strategy offices, the chipmaker said Monday in a statement. He had been an operating partner at private equity firm General Atlantic LLC. Intel had previously announced that Smith was leaving the role he held for nine years to lead manufacturing, sales and operations. Swan, 56, joins a company trying to reinvent itself as a more general provider of chips because its main product, processors for personal computers, is suffering from a multiyear decline in demand. He’ll help Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich transition the company and defend its lead in server chips, a lucrative market that provides much of Intel’s profits. Swan will receive a hiring bonus of $5.5 million and a starting base salary of $850,000, according to a company filing. The company’s shares declined 1.4 percent to $37.16 at the close in New York prior to the announcement. The stock has gained 7.9 percent this year. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This time the Telugu entrepreneur who made it big in the Valley is focussing on computing and phone devices. After co-founding and building the California-based Soft Machines, which developed a chip that attracted the attention of global semiconductor giants, Mahesh Lingareddy began work on Smartron with a co-founder two years ago that aims to become a Huawei or Samsung of India.Focus on IoT Mahesh sees a huge disruption happening in the Internet of Things (IoT) space. He said the two-year-old Smartron is developing phones, notebooks, IoT devices and an IoT app store that can be called ‘Made in India’ products, completely designed here. The firm has already launched two products — one phone and an ultra book. It has two research and development centres in Hyderabad and Bengaluru with a total strength of 170 employees. “Two more are coming before end of the year. And three more in second quarter of next year. Tronx, the IoT app platform continues to get better and richer,” he said.Bought by Intel? Meanwhile, Soft Machines declined to comment on reports that suggested chip-maker Intel acquiring Soft Machines. “We decline to comment. Soft Machines has no comment to offer on rumours and speculations appeared in the press,” it asserted. Several websites had reported last week that the chip-maker is buying Soft Machines for $300 million. Narsi Reddy Posham, Managing Director of Smartron, said the company sees the possibility of getting the products manufactured in India. “We are now sourcing them from Foxconn’s bases outside, going forward we will see possibilities to source from its facilities here,” he said. The company will launch an IoT Hub that will help connect all the ‘smart’ devices in a house or office. Hiring plans As it lines up more products, the company is going hire over 300 people in a year. “By the end of next year, we will have 500 employees in all. Most of them would be engineers, while others will be into marketing and sales,” he said. “At present we are selling the products on Amazon. We will be available on Flipkart and Snapdeal too in some time. We have tied up with Redington for offline sales,” Narsi Reddy said.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 19, 2016 9:32am   Comments Share: Related INTC Intel Corporation, Mobileye May Be Star-Crossed Lovers, But Chowdhry Calls Veronian Tragedy 3 Stocks To Own Under President Trump Stocks Up, Best Buy Soars, Planet Fitness Cools; Can Apple Break Out Again? (Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) raised its Q3 top-line guidance, citing better PC matrices. The company could generate margin expansion over the next several years, provided it is able to successfully “grow its focus areas while deemphasizing PCs,” Argus’s Jim Kelleher said in a report. He maintained a Buy rating on Intel, while raising the price target from $41 to $45. Intel announced an upward revision in its Q3 revenue estimate from $14.9 million, plus or minus $300 million, to $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The non-GAAP gross margin forecast has been raised by 100bps to 63 percent at the midpoint, reflecting volume leverage on higher PC production. “We regard the higher level of PC sales as somewhat seasonal and mainly related to inventory replenishment at distribution,” analyst Kelleher mentioned. Transaction With PE Firm Intel has recently announced plans to partner with private equity firm TPG to jointly invest in a spin-out of Intel Security, which was formerly known as McAfee. The transaction values the business at $4.2 billion. While Intel would not recover the complete investment of $7.7 billion it made in McAfee, the company would receive $3.1 billion in cash from TPG and retain a 49 percent stake in Intel Security, Kelleher noted. Beyond PC “Assuming Intel succeeds in growing its focus areas while deemphasizing PCs, the company’s gross and operating margins should expand over the next several years. Intel remains an impressive cash generator, and its rich dividend yields about 2.8%,” the analyst wrote.

Related Link:Chip Stocks Mostly Soar As Intel Raises Q3 Guidance Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research commented in a research report following Intel's boosted guidance that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s upcoming new Mac computers are the "prime reason" for Intel's improved outlook. Related Link: Chip Stocks Mostly Soar As Intel Raises Q3 Guidance According to Chowdhry's checks, Apple is already seeing strong back-to-school sales. Specifically, Mac computers are outselling Windows PC computers by a margin of three to one, and according to some checks, more than 80 percent of incoming students bought a Mac. Chowdhry continued that the new Macs are just entering production and should launch in the third week of October. The computer will be "significantly refreshed" with a redesigned keyboard. Meanwhile, initial indications suggest the new computer "will have a strong demand." The analyst further suggested that when Intel issued its initial guidance early in the quarter it was "not aware" of Apple's production demand. The company has now updated its guidance to "primarily reflect the demand form Apple's new upcoming Mac's and is less to do with Windows PC's demand." Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

Oracle's OpenWorld is in San Francisco. Supremo Larry Ellison has given his Sunday keynote. Here's a summary of what the database giant is going to reveal today in easily digestible chunks. And, yeah, warning: everything is now cloud. Anything you'd call an application or a software service is now a "cloud" at Oracle. Oracle Database 12c Release 2 is going to be first made available via the tech goliath's cloud service. The Oracle Analytics Cloud will include trained AI models so you can feed in data from sales, marketing, customer feedback, complaints and such stuff to predict outcomes using the supplied machine-learning packages. Oracle's Data Cloud also now touts anonymized customer and business profiles from 1,500 organizations, which is information you can use to train applications and make decisions. New Adaptive Intelligent Applications, running on Oracle's cloud, suck in information about your staff and customers and spit out recommendations on how to squeeze the most out of them. They are basically cyber-PHBs. In Oracle's own words: "These new Adaptive Intelligent Applications ... apply advanced data science to learn and ingest data about an organization’s users and their behaviors to deliver targeted information to customers and employees." The apps can be potentially used in... Finance to negotiate better rates with suppliers and plan better for tedious stuff like cashflow and end-of-the-quarter payments. Human Resources to pick out the best applicants for jobs. Marketing and Commerce to work out what ads work well and what don't. Supply Chain management to select the right distribution channel given the latest transport pricing and availability. There's a new Oracle Engagement Cloud that's essentially a customer service super-portal of "sales automation, service request management, knowledge management, and customer self-service." The frightening sounding Oracle Financial Consolidation and Close (FCCS) Cloud for beancounters to produce quarterly and annual financial reports, and the equally terrifying Oracle Revenue Management Cloud to monitor and audit contracts and money coming into a business. The Oracle Student Cloud for universities to store and process undergrads' records. For healthcare HR departments, there's the Oracle Human Capital Management Cloud for managing "complex labor rules and contractual terms that enable customers to define eligibility rules for core Human Resources and criteria for benefits, absence, time, and labor and payroll." There's a Oracle Internet of Things Cloud that can gobble sensor data in real-time over the 'net. And the Oracle Supply Chain Management Cloud that, well, does what it sounds like. Oracle's Cloud Platform will rent out bare-metal boxes like some kind of fancy data center colocation operation. This is supposed to act as a halfway house for organizations that want to move their software off premises and into the cloud but can't quite make the leap yet, so they'll spin up services on servers in Oracle's data centers. The Oracle Ravello Cloud Service will run VMware and Linux KVM workloads on Big Red's servers, and the Oracle Container Cloud Service supports Docker to deploy container images on Big Red's hosted boxes. Oracle’s Application Container Cloud Service has gained support for PHP, Node.js and Java. The new Oracle Cloud Stack Manager can be used to create and run applications built out of platform-as-a-service software. The Oracle Identity Cloud Service has appeared to manage user identities for off and on-premises accounts. The Oracle Security Monitoring and Analytics Cloud Service will look out for security threats on systems hosting enterprise applications. Then there's the Oracle API Platform Cloud Service "to create, secure and manage their APIs with zero code and pre-built analytics charts, while being able to run the API gateway within the Oracle Cloud, on-premise or on third party clouds." That's enough cloud for now. Ever cloud had the cloud feeling you're cloud being cloud beaten around the cloud head by something? There's lots of other minor little bits and pieces that have been added to Oracle's existing off-premises offerings. We'll be following OpenWorld this week so keep your eyes peeled for updates. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 16 Comments More from The Register Lack of Hurd mentality at Oracle OpenWorld: Co-CEO's cloud claims fall flat live on stage OpenWorld When polling in keynotes goes bad 26 Comments Salesforce claims 'record' quarter record at Oracle and SAP's expense More Salesforce on more AWS promise 7 Comments HP Inc dumps Salesforce, adopts Microsoft's cloudy CRM There is no honour among clouds 6 Comments The next time Salesforce goes down, you'll get six reasons why SaaS-o-saurus Rex preparing more granular status service for September debut 2 Comments Salesforce Einstein: Enterprise AI breakthrough, or CRM Clippy?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 19 September 2016 | MYT 2:30 PM Intel raises revenue forecast as PC market improves Adapting to change: Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. — Reuters Intel Corp raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand.  Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1% to a more than 15-year high of US$38.05 (RM157.19) on Sept 16.  Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs.  Sales in the company's PC business declined 3% to US$7.3bil (RM30.15bil) in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets.  However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering.  HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5% in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved.  FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking."  Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States.  "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to US$42 (RM173.50) from US$40 (RM165.23).  Intel said on Sept 16 it expected third-quarter revenue to be US$15.6bil (RM64.44bil), plus or minus US$300mil (RM1.23bil), compared with its prior forecast of US$14.9bil (RM61.55bil), plus or minus US$500mil (RM2.06bil).  That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts on average were expecting US$14.90bil (RM61.55bil), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilising at Intel, and raised his price target by US$2 (RM8.26) to US$38 (RM156.99).  Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1%, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher.  Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6% at US$37.53 (RM155.05) in afternoon trading.  Up to the close of Sept 15, the stock had risen 6.1% this year, underperforming the 20.8% gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period. — Reuters You May Be Interested AOL to cut 500 jobs US is concerned over Russia blocking access to LinkedIn Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Define your site main menu Understanding Ethernet Networking Ethernet refers to the family of Local Area Network implementation that was jointly developed by Digital Equipment Corporation, Intel Corporation and Xerox Corporation. It consists of certain specifications and standards as well as hardware devices and components. Ethernet Connection The Ethernet protocol provides for a verity of cabling options, one of which is a specification referred to as 10Base5. Connecting cable is known as AUI (Attachment Unit Interface) and network attachment device is known as Media Attachment Unit (MAU) rather than transceiver. CSMA/CD Ethernet is a baseband LAN specification invented by Xerox corporation operates at 10 Mbps using CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection). As a contention-based environment Ethernet allows any station on the network to transmit when ever the Ethernet network is quite. Collisions could be found whenever stations listen for traffic and hear nothing and transmit regularly. In this situation both types of transmissions are damaged and device should transmit later. Back-off algorithm is used whenever colliding stations should retransmit data. Ethernet Network Design Ethernet was designed to serve in network with sporadic, occasionally heavy traffic requirements. A network using Ethernet is usually considered as a low cost LAN. Layer 1 and Layer 2 of OSI model related services are provided by Ethernet. For creating an Ethernet network, you have usually implemented a network interface card on a primary circuit board. Cabling conventions of Ethernet describe use of transceiver for attaching cable to physical medium. Transceiver may perform some physical layer functions such as collision and detection. The transceiver cable connects end stations to a transceiver. How to Set Ethernet Full and Half Duplex Full Duplex Ethernet Full duplex provides the means of transmitting and receiving simultaneously on a single wire. Full duplex Ethernet is used between two endpoint like for between switches and servers, between switches and routers etc. Full duplex also permit bandwidth on Ethernet and Fast Ethernet networks very easy and cost effective and also fast.. By using features such as Fast EtherChannel, "bundles" of Fast Ethernet connections can be grouped together to increase bandwidth to increase bandwidth up to 4000%. Full duplex broadcasting is used in Gigabit Ethernet to increase collective bandwidth ranging from 2 Gbps to 2 Gbps for point to point links and also used to increase distances of for specific type of media. Further more Gigabits Ethernet Channel allows creating 8 Gbps connections between switches. Full duplex Ethernet minimize chances of collisions so that CSMS/CD does not need to be used for flow control. . However, a full duplex flow control method has been put forward in the standards committee with flow control as on option clause. This standard is referred to as IEEE 802.3x; it formalizes full duplex technology and it's expected to be supported in future Gigabit Ethernet products. Because of the volume of full duplex 100 mbps network interfaces cards (NICs), it is likely that this standard will realistically apply to Fast Ethernet. Half Duplex 10g Ethernet For half duplex transmission, CSMA/CD will be utilized to ensure that stations can communicate over a single wire and that collision recovery can take place. CSMS/CD implementation should be same as for Ethernet and Fast Ethernet and also it allows creation of shared Gigabit Ethernet using hub of half duplex via point to point connections. Because the CSMA/CD protocol is delay sensitive, a bit budget per collision domains must be created. When CSMS/CD is used delay sensitivity is always there however full duplex operation has no delay sensitivity and collision domains are defined as time passes fo maximum length frame transmission. This transmission, in turn, governs the maximum separation between two end stations on a shared segment. When network speed grows, frame transmission speed decreases and collision domains diameters is maximum. Budget of collision domain is used as maximum signal delay time for different networking components like repeaters, MAC layer and medium also. Increase in speed of Ethernet speed depends upon some terms that how you are implementing CSMS/CD. Speed which is more than 100 Mbps packet sizes are shorter than length of slot time in bits. (Slot-time is defined as the unit of the time for Ethernet MAC to handle collisions). Handling slot time problem you may find carrier extensions in Ethernet specifications. Carrier extensions are used to add bits to frames until frames meets the minimum requirements which slot time is needed. Following this method, smaller packet sizes can cover with minimum slot time required and it permit seamless operation with current Ethernet CSMS/CD. More change to the Ethernet requirement is the adding up of frame bursting. Frame bursting is an optional feature in which, in a CSMA/CD environment, and an end station can transmit a burst of frames over the wire without having to relinquish control. Other devices are put back to stop transmission when there is no idle time on wire. .The transmitting station that is bursting onto the wire fills the inter-frame interval with extension bits such that the wire never appears free to any other end station.

Matthew Jolliff Hello, I am having the following problem: I have a LG desktop PC that is running Windows XP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 3 and a Toshiba laptop PC that is running Windows 7 Home Premium. My ISP is Comcast. I have a Motorola Surfboard DOCSIS 3.0 modem and a Linksys Wireless-G WRT54G Version 8.0 broadband router. I also have to ethernet cables that state they are category 5. When I hook up the router, all that is supposed to light up does. I plug the cable from the wall to the modem, then to the router, then to the desktop. I have unplugged and replugged everything in making sure to follow the correct order. However, when it looks as though everything is hardwired correctly, I can not access the 192.168.1.1 website and if I try running the “Easy Link Advisor” CD that came with the router, it says it can not detect the router. My first question is, could it be the cables? I read somewhere that category 6 cables were being used, but haven’t found anywhere that states they are necessary. When the router is not hooked up, they work just fine from the modem to the desktop. My second question, if not the cables, is there something I am overlooking? I appreciate any help in advance.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak  ⋮  Rumor Intel Core i7-7700K Flagship Kaby Lake Processor Listed For Pre-Order – 7th Gen CPUs May Work With 100-Series Chipset By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 months ago 294Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel’s fastest Kaby Lake model has been listed by an online retailer months before its release. The processor, known as Core i7-7700K will be the flagship offering. Based on the optimized, 7th generation architecture, Kaby Lake will be delivering improved clock speeds along with decent IPC increments. Intel Core i7-7700K Listed Online – Fastest Clocked Core i7 To Date Kaby Lake has already been introduced on low-power platforms. In the months ahead, Intel would launch Kaby Lake for high-end and mainstream platforms. This would include both mobility and desktop PCs. While Kaby Lake is very similar to Skylake, improvements to the 14nm node deliver increased efficiency and faster clock rates. Intel showcases their 14nm+ wafer which is used to manufacturer 7th gen processors. Intel calls their latest process as 14nm+ which is currently the most advanced form of the 14nm node. This node has up to 12% performance increase over previous 14nm chips. 14nm+ has been thoroughly detailed in our previous post here. Intel’s K Series Kaby Lake CPUs: So talking about the details, first up, we have two “K” series models. These chips have an unlocked design that indicates that they are built for overclocking. The flagship is the Core i7-7700K features 4 cores, 8 threads and 95W TDP. This chip has a base clock of 4.2 GHz and boost clock of 4.5 GHz while featuring 8 MB of L3 cache. The official part number for the model is CM8067702868535. Listed over at an Estonian retail site, the chip is available for pre-order at 360.35 €. This brings the price to roughly $400 US. Now the price is definitely not final and exaggerated since launch is still far away. Actual price should be around the same pattern as the Core i7-6700K. The second chip is the Core i5-7600K. This is a quad core chip without multi-threading support that packs 6  MB of L3 cache and a 95W TDP. The chip features a base clock of 3.8 GHz and would turbo beyond 4 GHz.

The second part of this story is also related to the Kaby Lake chips. Listings over at Geekbench database show several Kaby Lake desktop chips operating on an ASUS Z170-K motherboard. These chips include the Core i5-7400, Core i5-7500 and Core i5-7600K. The motherboard is based on the 100-series chipset which gives us a hint that early samples are already compatible with existing motherboards. It’s up to Intel and their board partners to decide whether they would retain this compatibility down the road when Kaby Lake launches or limit it to the new 200-series boards. As of now, I have a feeling that 100-series and 200-series would allow compatibility with Kaby Lake chips but 200-series motherboards will have better I/O capabilities such as Optane SSD support. Here’s What To Expect From Kaby Lake Desktop Processors Intel Kaby Lake processors in general would be getting increased core performance (expect the usual 5-10% improvement) unless Intel plans to do something very different with Kaby Lake which seems highly unlikely. The processors will retain the basic features such for enthusiasts such as enhanced full range BCLK overclocking and 95W “Unlocked” options to choose from. Intel 200-series chipset will feature support for Kaby Lake CPUs and the latest Optane SSDs. (Image Credits: Benchlife) The Intel 200-Series PCH is a crucial update for the upcoming family of processors as it will allow support for them. The Intel 200-series PCH will include several SKUs such as Z270, H270, Q270, Q250 and B250. While the new chipset doesn’t include any major changes over the Skylake PCH, it does include support for Intel Optane technology. The new tech utilizes Intel’s 3D XPoint memory to deliver high-performance SSDs and memory solutions. The KBL-PCH will be able to support Mansion Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4), Brighton Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4) and Stony Beach (Optane Memory PCIe/NVMe Gen 3 x2 (m.2)) solutions.

In the days leading up to Wednesday’s policy announcement, market volatility has spiked following two months of relative calm. In the last six trading sessions, the benchmark S&P 500 has moved at least 1 per cent four times, twice up and twice down, whipsawed by shifting perceptions of what the Fed may do. The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed gauge of near-term investor anxiety, is holding near two-month highs. Following a week of mixed economic data, investors pared bets the Fed will raise rates next week. As of Friday afternoon, traders predicted only a 15 per cent likelihood of a hike after its two-day meeting, according to the CME’s FedWatch website. “Most of the indicators I’ve seen suggest that the markets really don’t anticipate there’s much chance of a hike this month,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “If they come with a rate hike, a lot of investors will scramble.” If the Fed, as expected, holds off, the focus will shift to its December meeting. Investors were betting such a move was more likely than not as of Friday, with a 52 per cent perceived probability. “If we hear a hawkish tone, in essence getting the market ready for December, the market can absorb that as long as you have the (strong economic) data underpinning,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. One investor believes Fed officials want to raise rates in order to prepare options should the economy soften in the near future. However even hinting at an increase sparks a sell-off that stifles their intentions. “If nothing happens and we begin the cycle of ‘will they do it in December or not?,’ I think volatility continues some,” said Peter Tuz, President of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. He added that elements feeding into volatility also include the US presidential election and global economic conditions. The benign rate environment has helped fuel major US stock indexes to all-time highs in July and August. The S&P 500 now sits about 2.5 per cent below its record close, and it remains up about 4.5 per cent for 2016. The Fed’s decision also will factor into the performance of high dividend-paying telecoms and utilities shares, which tend to benefit from low-rate environments. The sectors have each climbed about 13 per cent in 2016, topping other groups, but have pared gains in recent months. “If the rate increase is priced out, and the Fed language suggests that, then you could see money coming back into these stocks and sectors where yield is a big component of their total return,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Real estate is another high-dividend-paying sector benefiting from muted Fed action, helped by the expectation that mortgage rates will stay low. Real estate stocks will mark on Monday their first full trading day as a major S&P 500 sector, breaking out from financials. “If the Fed holds off, I would think that they would do pretty well,” said Aaron Jett, Vice-President for global equity research at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles. Wall Street was near session lows late on Friday morning as Oracle led a decline in tech stocks and financials came under pressure in the wake of Deutsche Bank’s mammoth $14 billion fine. The far bigger-than-expected penalty was levied by the US Department of Justice to settle claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities. Deutsche Bank’s US-listed shares were down 9.2 per cent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell 1.2 per cent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.98 per cent, the steepest among the 10 major S&P sectors. The KBW Bank index fell 1.25 per cent, putting it on track for its biggest weekly decline since the Brexit vote in late June. “The size of the Deutsche fine is putting pressure on the financials and is combined with the likelihood of the Fed putting off raising rates next week,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 72.62 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 18,139.86. The S&P 500 was down 10.01 points, or 0.47 per cent, at 2,137.25. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.19 points, or 0.27 per cent, at 5,235.50. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← German banks count cost of global shipping crisis Swarovski lights up Muscat with the launch of fall 2016 collection → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Philippine’s Marcos finally gets a hero’s burial amid protests Car bomb injures five in Thailand Trump’s daughter at talks raises eyebrows Chinese astronauts return to earth Read More ...

It’s good to see the Dell XPS 13 again. We were very taken indeed with the 2015 edition of this compact notebook, awarding it a full five stars in our review and heaping praise on its design – that near-borderless monitor really keeps the size down. And now it’s getting a 2016 update, complete with new seventh-generation Intel Core processors and a new colour option. There is one obvious change...The gadget gods have decreed that every product released in 2016 must come with a gold-but-also-a-wee-bit-pink finish, and the XPS 13 is no exception. But here's the specs that matter - the new model comes with a choice of new i3, i5 and i7 Intel chips, and better battery life than its predecessor (Dell says 13 hours if you’re Netflix streaming or web browsing, 22 if you’re just using productivity apps), higher speed Wi-Fi and a Thunderbolt 3 port that’ll allow a single XPS 13 to power two external 4K displays, as well as single-cable docking. Aside from the above, the specs are unchanged from last year’s edition. The base model features a 13.3in 1080p screen, Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage, and upgrades can take that to a 3200 x 1800 touchscreen, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. There’s no sign of the new model on Dell’s Australian site yet, but in the US the 2016 XPS 13 starts at $US799, although you’ll need to pay more ($US1149) for the rose gold model.

Close share panel Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Many of the UK's most promising tech firms have been bought by bigger, overseas firms When it comes to tech, there is no lack of ideas or talent in the UK. But there is, nonetheless, an ever-growing list of promising companies that sell out or simply fail, rather than growing into British titans that could rival the likes of Microsoft, Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, Oracle and Facebook. Below are some notable examples: Sinclair Research Image caption Sinclair Research sold more than 5 million ZX Spectrums over eight years There was a time in the 1980s when video gamers and teenage coders across the UK were more likely to be hunched over one of Sir Clive Sinclair's computers than an American or Asian-made alternative. Sinclair Research may have only made its ZX Spectrums for domestic sale, but it licensed Timex to make clones that were sold elsewhere in Europe, the US and South America. Dozens of unofficial versions were a hit in the Soviet Union too, proving their appeal, if not a source of income. But the firm got unstuck when it tried to enter the business market. Its Sinclair QL was designed to outperform IBM's PCs, but its tape-based Microdrive storage was unreliable and the British company did not offer the kind of telephone support the corporate sector required. Media captionWATCH: Sir Clive Sinclair discusses his role in computing's past and future "Their computer designs were abominable by our standards," Sir Clive later told the BBC. "But because... IBM had such a powerful position, I don't think we could have challenged it." After the C5 electric vehicle also failed to catch on, a cash-strapped Sir Clive sold his firm's brand and assets in 1986 to Amstrad, another domestic computer-maker. Image copyright PA Image caption Sir Clive sold the rights to his computers to Alan Sugar's Amstrad Amstrad later faced troubles with computer storage of its own and eventually switched focus to TV set-top boxes before selling out to BSkyB. Friends Reunited Image copyright Friends Reunited Image caption Friends Reunited led to marriages - and divorces Years before Facebook was founded, let alone open to the public, a couple from Hertfordshire and one of their friends, created a social network that attracted millions of users in the UK, Australia, South Africa and beyond. Friends Reunited connected members with their former classmates by getting them to share the names of their old schools and the year they had left. Over time, the theme was expanded to cover places of work, sports teams and neighbourhoods where users had lived. Spin-off sites were also created to offer online dating, job searches, message boards and ways for users to trace their family trees. When ITV paid £175m to buy the operation in 2005, it expected to continue its red hot growth. Image copyright ITV Image caption By the time ITV made Friends Reunited free to use, many of its members had gone elsewhere But the broadcaster made the mistake of continuing to charge users to contact each other, rather than relying on ad revenue alone, for too long. That allowed Facebook, MySpace and Bebo to take the lead. ITV sold the business for just £25m in 2009. Although it limped on under other UK owners until earlier this year, it never regained its momentum. Lastfm.com (2002-2007) Image copyright Last.fm Image caption Last.fm offered users a free way to get a personalised online radio station Last.fm began its life as an internet radio station and an associated website where users listed the tracks they liked to meet others with similar tastes. But it only really took off after it merged with Audioscrobbler, a plug-in that automatically logged songs that its users had listened to on their computer and MP3 player. This made it possible to build up a deeper picture of its users' habits, which in turn helped the service make song recommendations, and then later suggest nearby concerts and music videos too. By 2007, the service had attracted 15 million users. However, rather than stay independent, its founders opted to sell out to the US media group CBS for $280m (£212m). Image copyright Last.fm Image caption The Last.fm Scrobbler tool automatically notified the service every time the user listened to a song They acknowledged that they had struggled to find a way to be profitable in light of the royalty and copyright fees the music industry was demanding, and said that teaming up with the US broadcaster gave them greater negotiating clout. However, the service continued to rack up losses. A subscription-based music streaming app was a flop, and these days Last.fm is a relatively minor player. It still recommends music but relies on YouTube, Spotify and other third-party services to provide it. Autonomy Image caption Mike Lynch and HP are still fighting a legal battle over the takeover of Autonomy Silicon Valley might have Google, but for a time Autonomy was the UK's most highly regarded search giant. The firm was founded in Cambridge in 1996 and developed software that allowed its clients to hunt through "unstructured data" - emails, videos, social network posts, phone calls, images and other information recorded in apps - that was not kept in neat databases. The service proved popular with a wide range of organisations, which used it to carry out legal checks, create archives and focus their marketing. In 2011, Autonomy proved its data-analysis techniques had further potential when it developed an augmented reality tool that allowed smartphones to superimpose graphics over real-world views. Image copyright Autonomy Image caption Autonomy's augmented reality app showed videos on an iPhone when it was held in front of a relevant poster Hollywood director JJ Abrams was among the first to use it within an app that promoted his film Super 8, and others followed. The same year, Autonomy's chief executive, Mike Lynch, agreed to sell the business to HP for just over £7bn. And that's where things got complicated. Thirteen months after the takeover was completed, HP claimed Mr Lynch had misrepresented his company's financial position and wrote down most of its value. The two sides are now suing each other in a case that is likely to drag on for years.

ARM Holdings Image copyright Apple Image caption Apple took a stake in ARM Holdings to secure a chip for its Newton Until very recently, ARM Holdings was the flag-waver for the UK's tech scene. The computer chip designer was created in Cambridge in 1990 as a joint venture between Acorn Computers and Apple. The US firm wanted a processor to power its first hand-held device, the Newton MessagePad, but later sold its stake after Steve Jobs returned and ditched the product. That didn't end the relationship between the two companies though, as ARM's designs were used in processors that powered first the iPod, then the iPhone and iPad. Most other smartphones are also dependent on ARM's chip creations, in addition to a wide assortment of other technology including smart TVs, cars, fitness trackers, smartwatches and drones. Image copyright ARM Image caption ARM does not build chips itself but licenses its designs to others Many people thought ARM might remain independent as it suited device-makers not to have the firm owned by one of their competitors. But in July, Japan's Softbank agreed to pay £24bn for it. ARM's management suggested the move would help it "move faster in creating new technologies". But its co-founder Hermann Hauser has been critical, saying that ARM could have grown "even faster" if it had stayed solo. Swiftkey Image copyright Swiftkey Image caption Swiftkey anticipates words to prevent users having to enter letters individually The UK is famed for its expertise in artificial intelligence. But several of the sector's start-ups - including DeepMind, Magic Pony and VocalIQ - only became known to the wider public once they had fallen into Silicon Valley hands. Swiftkey was different because it actually brought popular products to market before being taken over. The London-based firm made a keyboard app for Android and iOS handsets. The software predicts what its users want to write - including emojis - after they have only entered a few keystrokes. Over time, its suggestions get more accurate as it studies their habits, and if allowed to review their social network posts, it gets better still. Swiftkey scored a publicity coup when its tech was adapted to help Prof Stephen Hawking type twice as fast as he could before. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prof Hawking uses a version of Swiftkey's technology And in 2014, it decided to accelerate its growth further by making its app free to use, only charging consumers if they wanted to change the keyboard's design and colour. The tactic worked. By the end of 2015, Swiftkey had been installed on about 300 million devices. But it also caused its losses to grow. In February this year, the business was sold for a reported £250m to a deep-pocketed buyer. Image copyright PA Image caption Swiftkeys's founders, Jon Reynolds and Ben Medlock, are now multimillionaires "We believe joining Microsoft is the right next stage in our journey," its co-founders blogged. Maybe. But it also highlights how UK start-ups often feel pressured to sell once their early-stage funding starts to run out.

This holds true now more than ever, with farmers around the country using fertilisers or chemicals that are potentially harmful for the soil. To counter this, Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd (GISBL) introduced mrittikā, a soil test based fertiliser recommendation software three years back. In Khunla and Jessore they have been implementing the project with Solidaridad Network Asia. The project has been implemented so far in 40 locations in Bangladesh. GISBL has also been implementing this software in India and Cambodia to improve paddy production.  Right after its early stages, a pilot project was initiated to test mrittikā on a limited number of crops, including tomato, cauliflower and brinjal. Mrittikā works by identifying the current status of major soil nutrients and then accordingly suggesting the optimum amount of fertiliser and the type of fertiliser that should be used by the farmer. It does not end there; the software also identifies the amount by which fertiliser use can be reduced, thereby helping to optimise the whole process and contributing to healthier soils. To test the effectiveness of mrittikā, demo plots were used where fertilisers were used in three ways: as recommended by Grameen Intel's mrittikā app; as per the recommendations of the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute (BARI) handbook; and in accordance to traditional practice. One decimal of land was allotted for each of the methods. The three methods were used to measure the various outcomes and see where mrittikā stands in terms of efficiency. Once the crops were planted, it was time to monitor them; this was done by farmers, field organisers, technical officers and programme officers of the project. The outcome of the monitoring and evaluation exhibited the impact the mrittikā app can have: it showed higher yields than the BARI handbook and traditional methods, and showed that with mrittikā's fertiliser recommendations, fertiliser costs were also much lower. For instance, in the case of brinjal crops, the fertiliser cost in accordance to mrittikā recommendations were 29% lower than the BARI handbook method and an astonishing 468% lower than the traditional method. These are very significant differences, which is a clear indication of how much the whole process can be optimised while saving huge costs (almost over 400%) over traditional farming practices. With Bangladesh's growing population and high food demands needing to be met, it is essential to maximise all our outputs as well as protect our environment in order to keep growing more and more crops. Mrittikā is not only educating farmers on the ideal method of growing crops and the type and amount of fertiliser that ought to be used, it is helping us reduce a large amount of the costs to make farming processes more efficient and cheap at the same time. The mrittikā app is a very easy-to-implement system and a great initiative for Bangladesh and her farmers, helping them obtain a higher yield per taka spent on fertiliser. If implemented right all over Bangladesh, it is not only great for soil health around the country, but it will also allow farmers to achieve better standards of living and help fight the food shortage in Bangladesh.

In the fall of 2016, a new Macbook Pro is expected, and the latest rumors suggest that it will follow the iPhone 7 and come without a headphone jack. It looks like Apple is heading toward a wireless future, and a user took a screenshot of a survey where Apple asks whether MacBook Pro with Retina owners ever use the headphone jack. @MacRumors pic.twitter.com/ly1xz6Biu7 — Blake A. (@mmodelmusic) September 15, 2016 It makes sense that Apple will also release future products without the headphone port to support the Apple ecosystem among newer device editions. The new MacBook Pro is rumored to come with a touch panel with Touch ID functionality that will allow users quick access with fingerprint login. This may be featured on the MacBook Pro’s power button or Apple may decide to put the fingerprint access functionally on the touchpad. The fingerprint scan may also come with its own strip. The update will also feature a design overhaul with a thinner frame than the currently available models. According to a Bloomberg report, a source stated that the new graphics processor will be powerful enough to run powerful video games. “The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named.” Is the MacBook Pro next to get rid of the headphone jack? https://t.co/WFjOnkpg4t pic.twitter.com/0w0zNx2Xxk — TechRadar (@techradar) September 18, 2016 The late Steve Jobs believed that tablets will eventually replace laptops all together. However, Apple’s 13- and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros are still in high demand and are trending to perform better than the iPad. Bloomberg also reported on Apple potential abandoning the Intel processor. “An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It’s unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel Corp. has supplied this in the past.” Apple is most likely to use Intel’s latest-generation Skylake processors in the new MacBook. However, its sole competitor AMD may offer a better processor that suits the thinner model expected to be released in 2016. “Apple is using one of AMD’s ‘Polaris’ graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 percent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple.” There are also rumors that Apple may be using its own chip on the new MacBook Pro line. The A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7 could be upgraded or developed for the MacBook Pro. The A10 also technically has the power to handle the performance of a laptop. There is no expectation of any changes with the colors of the MacBook Pro, and a 13-inch and 15-inch model will probably make a comeback. The laptop is expected to feature USB-C ports and USB 3.1 Gen 2 10Gb/s support. This will support very high transfer speeds of up to 10GB per second, allowing you to transfer huge files almost instantly. OLED touch panel is expected to have screens that change, depending on what application you are using. This will feature a touch sensitive strip, which allows you to choose certain functions available on the given application. The new MacBook Pro event is expected in October 2016 and will feature very significant changes since it has been almost four years without an update. Are you looking forward to the MacBook Pro? Which features are you hoping Apple will include? Leave your comments below.

Capcom's Street Fighter V installs hidden rootkit on PCs ARM emits Cortex-R52 Popular Bash shell script LetsEncrypt.sh, which is used to manage free SSL/TLS certificates from the Let's Encrypt project, has renamed this week to avoid a trademark row. This comes in the wake of Let's Encrypt successfully fending off Comodo, which tried to cynically snatch "Let's Encrypt" for itself. LetsEncrypt.sh, written by Germany-based Lukas Schauer, is now known as Dehydrated. If you have scripts or apps that rely on pulling in his code and running it, they may stop working as a result of the name change. Dehydrated is developed independently by Schauer and is not officially affiliated with Let's Encrypt. "This project was renamed from letsencrypt.sh because the original name was violating Let's Encrypt's trademark policy. I know that this results in quite a lot of installations failing but I didn't have a choice," reads the new Dehydrated README. Schauer told El Reg this week that the Let's Encrypt project sent him "a very friendly email, asking me very kindly to change the name" of LetsEncrypt.sh, while referencing "their trademark policy and that they didn't want confusion on what really belongs to Let's Encrypt." "There was no direct threat, but it was very clear that I couldn't keep the name for much longer," Schauer added. Let's Encrypt issues free security certificates for HTTPS websites, is backed by various big names, and recommends people use the Python-based Certbot to deploy its SSL/TLS certs. Certbot, developed by the EFF, was previously called the Let's Encrypt Client. In June this year, the Let's Encrypt project was fighting off Comoodo, a paid-for SSL/TLS certificate issuer that was trying to trademark "Let's Encrypt" for itself, presumably so it could snuff out its free-for-all competition. This is despite the Let's Encrypt project first using the term way back in 2014, and that Comodo has never, er, used the words "let's encrypt" in its product branding. In July, the Let's Encrypt project prevailed and registered "Let's Encrypt" as a trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office: it is now mark number 87096675 and belongs to San Francisco's Internet Security Research Group, which runs the organization. It even owns the pseudo mark "Let Us Encrypt" for anyone who hates apostrophe contractions. With that win comes extra responsibility: trademark holders must use and defend their marks or lose them. If you allow other businesses and groups to use your trademark willy-nilly, it may be considered abandoned by a court. Thus, the Let's Encrypt project is working on getting as many of the third-party Let's Encrypt tools – like LetsEncrypt.sh – renamed if they feature the words Let's Encrypt in order to actively protect its trademark. "I did ask [Lukas Schauer] to change the name," Let's Encrypt chief Josh Aas confirmed to The Register this week. "It's something we need to do in order to protect our trademarks and avoid creating confusion as to where the software comes from. Also, we use an open protocol that we're encouraging other certificate authorities to adopt, and when that happens we want it to be clear that ACME clients can be used with CAs besides Let's Encrypt. "These are all of the same reasons that we had the name of the official Let's Encrypt client changed to Certbot when it moved to the EFF, and we've been talking to other client projects with similar trademark issues." "All of that said, we're really grateful for Lukas's contribution to our client ecosystem," Aas added. ® Full disclosure: This article's author uses Let's Encrypt to provide HTTPS encryption for his personal websites.

The IMPD bomb squad conducted numerous unannounced sweeps Sunday at undisclosed locations across the city. Officials said no suspicious activity or devises were detected, characterizing the sweeps as precautionary as opposed to any intelligence pointing toward a threat in Indianapolis. “We act upon our intelligence,” Fries said. “And we have a very robust Intel unit here in Indianapolis and work with our state, local and federal partners.” Gov. Mike Pence was briefed at the governor’s mansion Monday morning before heading to Iowa to campaign for the presidential election. “There is no higher priority than the safety and security of our citizens, and Hoosiers should feel confident that the state of Indiana is taking all appropriate steps to keep Hoosiers safe,” Pence said in a prepared statement. IMPD said it has conducted more than 600 sweeps this year with its bomb squad, a majority of which are out of the public’s eye. Officials said they have responded about 75 times to what they would consider a true ‘suspicious package’ type situation. “Business is okay,” IMPD Lt. Ron Humber said, the bomb squad commander. “Things like what happened over the weekend, all it does it make the requests for us more frequent.” The city also relies on a network of cameras, which helped officials in New York City quickly identify and arrests a suspect. Yet officials acknowledge, like in New York, intelligence can oftentimes be quiet before an attack. FBI officials have told CBS4 agents are monitoring a number of people in Indiana who have shown signs of homegrown violent extremism. “One individual with an agenda or some type of warped thinking can perpetrate an act,” Fries aid. “And you’re vulnerable. We’ve seen that across the country.” Indiana Homeland Security officials ask residents if they see something suspicious to report the activity to the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center by calling 1-877-226-1026 or emailing iifc@iifc.in.gov.

Report claims Samsung rushed to outshine iPhone 7 Reports of exploding Galaxy Note 7s surfaced just days after the release Samsung executives say a manufacturing flaw damaged the batteries  However, sources say the firm rushed production in order to beat Apple  By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 15:55 EST, 19 September 2016 | Updated: 17:34 EST, 19 September 2016 e-mail 67 shares 7 View comments The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco highlights the challenge of packing more power into much thinner phones, all while rushing for earlier release dates. Shortly after its release, reports emerged that the Note 7 handsets were exploding and experts now believe the real culprit was Samsung's urgency to be beat Apple. Once rumors surfaced that Apple's latest device wasn't set to be the year's biggest innovation, Samsung executives 'pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features'. Scroll down for videos  Shortly after Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7, incidents surfaced that handsets were exploding. Although explosions are due to overheating batteries, experts believe the real culprit was Samsung's urgency to be beat Apple BEATING APPLE FOR A PRICE Many believe that the root of the exploding batteries comes from Samsung's rush to beat Apple.  While employees scrambled to meet the early launch date, suppliers also stretched their work hours and were under more pressure than usual.  Samsung executives agreed to move production ahead of schedule in order 'launch a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers' and take advantage of Apple's letdown, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Samsung was able to pack the Note 7 with a range of cutting-edge technology in just a short time. This includes a high-resolution screen that stretches around the edges, iris-recognition security and of course, a faster charging battery. But within a few days of the launch, reports surfaced that the Note 7's battery was bursting into flames. This group of executives, which includes mobile chief D.J. Koh, agreed to move production ahead of schedule in order 'launch a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers' and take advantage of Apple's letdown, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. By doing so, Samsung was able to pack the Note 7 with a range of cutting-edge technology in just a short period of time. This includes a high-resolution screen that stretches around the edges, iris-recognition security and of course, a faster charging battery. However, this accelerated production came at a cost. On August 2, Samsung took the stage in New York to unveil its 5.7 inch handset, a place where the firm also saw an opportunity to take a stab at Apple. 'Want to know what else it comes with?' teased Samsung's vice-president of marketing, Justin Denison. 'An audio jack. I'm just saying.' Within a few days of the launch, it appeared Samsung was eating their own words after reports surfaced that the Note 7 was bursting into flames. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Own a Galaxy Note 7?

US regulators officially recall one MILLION Galaxy Note 7... Share this article Share 67 shares Just a month after the launch, Koh held a press conference in Seoul, South Korea where he announced the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices that would eventually be replaced with a new and safe Note 7.  Although the firm was praised for its quick thinking, it was also criticized for announcing these plans prior to establishing a strategy on how to gather millions of phones in 10 countries and get each person a replacement. This group of executives, which includes mobile chief D.J. Koh, agreed to move production ahead of schedule in order 'launch a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers' and take advantage of Apple's letdown, the iPhone 7 (pictured) In the meantime, Samsung had short-term solutions such as shutting phones off and not using them to a software patch that prevents batteries from overheating. 'This is creating an enormous problem for the company -- for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there's a problem,' David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp, told Bloomberg. While employees scrambled to meet the early launch date, suppliers also stretched their work hours and were under more pressure than usual. One supplier told Bloomberg that 'it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow'. WHY WERE THE BATTERIES EXPLODING?   Lithium batteries are use in a range of consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing.  If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control.  Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president told reporters in Seoul: 'The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together.' It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7.   'Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting.' But with all the sweat and tears, the firm believed they had come out on top. The Note 7 devices were shipped to carriers all over the world in time for an early launch and one executive even said they had time to test the handsets in May, which is 'the typical amount of time to check its capabilities'. However, it wasn't until the devices reached customers were they deemed ticking time bombs. In a case shortly after the release, one man shared a video of a charred Note 7 on YouTube. Within a few days of the launch, it appeared Samsung was eating there own words after reports surfaced that the Note 7's battery was bursting into flames. After the recall announcement, the firm told people to not use their Note 7 devices at all THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 7 RECALL  The world's largest maker of mobile phones recalled 2.5-million units of its top-of-the-range model more than two weeks ago, after batteries began catching fire while charging. But users snubbed the South Korean electronics giant's offer of a temporary replacement until new Note 7s became available, and there seemed to be little urgency among consumers for the permanent fix offered. The success of the recall is seen as crucial to Samsung retaining brand loyalty and preventing customers defecting to arch-rival Apple's new iPhone 7 or cheaper Chinese-made models. A Samsung spokeswoman confirmed the firm had started to offer the replacement handsets. The company began offering replacements for users in Canada and Singapore last week and is set to start soon in other nations including Mexico, Taiwan, New Zealand the United Arab Emirates. But with only a trickle of customers visiting stores in Seoul today for their replacements, the fate of the much-hyped handset remained unclear, although consumers in the South Korean capital were sympathetic. The recall dealt a major blow to the firm's reputation and raised alarm among airline, with several banning passengers from using the device on board. South Korean users have time until March 2017 to hand in their phones for a replacement but Samsung is hoping a software update that will limit battery recharges to 60 percent of capacity will jolt consumers into returning their handsets. The recall crisis erupted as Samsung finds itself squeezed by competition from Apple in the high-end market and Chinese rivals in the low-and mid-end segment. 'Hey YouTube,' Ariel Gonzalez says. 'Be careful out there. Everyone rockin' the new Note 7, it might catch fire y'all.' Another was from family in St. Petersburg, Florida, who reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire and destroyed the vehicle. And most recently, a six-year-old boy was burned after a Samsung phone 'exploded' in his hands. 'This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung's image,' said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. 'Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.' About two weeks ago, the US aviation safety officials warned passengers not to turn on or even charge a Note 7 during while one the plane, after numerous incident reports surfaced. The family said the phone, which was plugged in here, was engulfed in flames which quickly consumed the rest of the vehicle The Federal Aviation Administration also told passengers not to put smartphones in their checked bags, citing 'recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung' about the devices. Delta Air Lines Inc, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it is still studying the issue. 'Delta is in constant contact with the FAA and other bodies in its run of business as a global airline,' spokesman Morgan Durrant said in a statement. 'We will comply with any directive and are studying this matter. Safety and security is always Delta's top priority.' New York and New Jersey have both asked Samsung users to shut their phones down while riding public transportation until every faulty Note 7 has been replaced. HOW LITHIUM ION BATTERIES WORK IN YOUR PHONE Lithium ion batteries have three basic parts - a positive cathode, a negative anode and a chemical layer in between known as an electrolyte. The electrolyte allows electrical charges flow between the electrodes. In lithium ion batteries, the cathode is usually lithium cobalt oxide while the anode is made from graphite. When your battery charges, electrons entering at the anode attract lithium ions, which then nestle in sites between the graphite's carbon layers. During use, lithium atoms at the anode start losing their electrons, allowing electrons to zip through the circuits in the phone to provide power. Meanwhile, lithium ions journey through the electrolyte to be reunited with electrons at the cathode. These processes keep going until all ions reach the cathode, causing that dreaded flashing battery symbol. Every time your battery uses 100 per cent of its charge, known as its capacity, it has been through a single charge cycle. Each charge cycle, however, reduces the battery's total capacity by a tiny amount. Although Samsung voluntarily recalled 2.5 million devices worldwide, the announcement seemed to fall on deaf ears as many stores and carriers continued to sell them. The US Consumer Product Commission was then forced to step in and recall the one million in the US, where some 92 incidences of batteries overheating have been reported. Samsung rushed to produce and ship the Note 7 devices and one executive even said they had time to test the handsets in May, which is 'the typical amount of time to check its capabilities'. However, it wasn't until the devices reached customers were they deemed ticking time bombs GALAXY NOTE 7 SPECS  5.7inch curved screen Measures 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9mm, weighs 169g (5.96 oz) MicroSD card expansion slot that holds up to 256 GB Available in black onyx, silver titanium, gold platinum and blue coral Built with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 Display is a super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen USB-C charger port  64 GB of internal storage, with 4 GB RAM  Non-removable Li-Po 3500 3,500 mAh battery Water-resistant phone body and S Pen  The US notice affects around one million of the global total of 2.5 million handsets being recalled, which has cast a cloud over the South Korean electronics giant and world's largest smartphone vendor, reports AFP.  The recall is the largest the smartphone industry has ever witnessed, however, Samsung did receive a pat on the back from others in the technology industry for the firm's speed and decisiveness, reports The New York Times. 'I thought, 'How is it that this is happening?' ' Jennifer Shecter, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Consumer Reports, told The New York Times. Shecter said the group found an inconsistent response to the recall across America, as some stores and carries continued to keep selling the Note 7 even days after Samsung made the recall announcement. 'Samsung made an announcement, but the government wasn't involved, there wasn't a clear message, there wasn't an approved remedy and there wasn't a clear fix,' she said. Samsung has started an exchange program for Galaxy Note 7 owners in the UK and Ireland today, which allows them to trade in their ticking time bombs for safe smartphones. 'Samsung is fully confident that the battery issue has been completely resolved in the replacement Note 7 devices that will be available to customers in UK and Ireland from this week,' said the firm in a statement. The tech company added that while there had only been 'a small number of reported incidents, safety is the number one concern. 'Our absolute priority is the safety of our customers – that's why we are asking all Galaxy Note 7 customers to act now and exchange today,' said Conor Pierce, vice president of IT & Mobile at Samsung UK & Ireland.  IPHONE 7 AT A GLANCE  - New gloss black and black colours - Faster A10 processor  - iPhone 7 plus now has a wide angle and a telephoto lens - New Retina HD display is 25% brighter  - Now water and dustproof  - Home button has force feedback  - Stereo speakers at top and bottom with double the volume of previous version - New wireless AirPod headphones available as an extra - No headphone socket - but adapter and lightning EarPods will be in every box  - Boosted battery life Apple claims could add 2 hours Read more: www.nytimes.com/...

Report claims Samsung rushed to outshine iPhone 7 Reports of exploding Galaxy Note 7s surfaced just days after the release Samsung executives say a manufacturing flaw damaged the batteries  However, sources say the firm rushed production in order to beat Apple  By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 15:55 EST, 19 September 2016 | Updated: 17:34 EST, 19 September 2016 e-mail 67 shares 7 View comments The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 fiasco highlights the challenge of packing more power into much thinner phones, all while rushing for earlier release dates. Shortly after its release, reports emerged that the Note 7 handsets were exploding and experts now believe the real culprit was Samsung's urgency to be beat Apple. Once rumors surfaced that Apple's latest device wasn't set to be the year's biggest innovation, Samsung executives 'pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features'. Scroll down for videos  Shortly after Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7, incidents surfaced that handsets were exploding. Although explosions are due to overheating batteries, experts believe the real culprit was Samsung's urgency to be beat Apple BEATING APPLE FOR A PRICE Many believe that the root of the exploding batteries comes from Samsung's rush to beat Apple.  While employees scrambled to meet the early launch date, suppliers also stretched their work hours and were under more pressure than usual.  Samsung executives agreed to move production ahead of schedule in order 'launch a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers' and take advantage of Apple's letdown, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Samsung was able to pack the Note 7 with a range of cutting-edge technology in just a short time. This includes a high-resolution screen that stretches around the edges, iris-recognition security and of course, a faster charging battery. But within a few days of the launch, reports surfaced that the Note 7's battery was bursting into flames. This group of executives, which includes mobile chief D.J. Koh, agreed to move production ahead of schedule in order 'launch a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers' and take advantage of Apple's letdown, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. By doing so, Samsung was able to pack the Note 7 with a range of cutting-edge technology in just a short period of time. This includes a high-resolution screen that stretches around the edges, iris-recognition security and of course, a faster charging battery. However, this accelerated production came at a cost. On August 2, Samsung took the stage in New York to unveil its 5.7 inch handset, a place where the firm also saw an opportunity to take a stab at Apple. 'Want to know what else it comes with?' teased Samsung's vice-president of marketing, Justin Denison. 'An audio jack. I'm just saying.' Within a few days of the launch, it appeared Samsung was eating their own words after reports surfaced that the Note 7 was bursting into flames. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Own a Galaxy Note 7? Samsung is now replacing handsets in... Does your iPhone 7 HISS? Users are startled by strange... Now two Galaxy Note 7s 'catch fire' in China: Samsung's... US regulators officially recall one MILLION Galaxy Note 7... Share this article Share 67 shares Just a month after the launch, Koh held a press conference in Seoul, South Korea where he announced the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 devices that would eventually be replaced with a new and safe Note 7.  Although the firm was praised for its quick thinking, it was also criticized for announcing these plans prior to establishing a strategy on how to gather millions of phones in 10 countries and get each person a replacement. This group of executives, which includes mobile chief D.J. Koh, agreed to move production ahead of schedule in order 'launch a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers' and take advantage of Apple's letdown, the iPhone 7 (pictured) In the meantime, Samsung had short-term solutions such as shutting phones off and not using them to a software patch that prevents batteries from overheating. 'This is creating an enormous problem for the company -- for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there's a problem,' David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp, told Bloomberg. While employees scrambled to meet the early launch date, suppliers also stretched their work hours and were under more pressure than usual. One supplier told Bloomberg that 'it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow'. WHY WERE THE BATTERIES EXPLODING?   Lithium batteries are use in a range of consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing.  If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control.  Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president told reporters in Seoul: 'The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together.' It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7.   'Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting.' But with all the sweat and tears, the firm believed they had come out on top. The Note 7 devices were shipped to carriers all over the world in time for an early launch and one executive even said they had time to test the handsets in May, which is 'the typical amount of time to check its capabilities'. However, it wasn't until the devices reached customers were they deemed ticking time bombs. In a case shortly after the release, one man shared a video of a charred Note 7 on YouTube. Within a few days of the launch, it appeared Samsung was eating there own words after reports surfaced that the Note 7's battery was bursting into flames. After the recall announcement, the firm told people to not use their Note 7 devices at all THE SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 7 RECALL  The world's largest maker of mobile phones recalled 2.5-million units of its top-of-the-range model more than two weeks ago, after batteries began catching fire while charging. But users snubbed the South Korean electronics giant's offer of a temporary replacement until new Note 7s became available, and there seemed to be little urgency among consumers for the permanent fix offered. The success of the recall is seen as crucial to Samsung retaining brand loyalty and preventing customers defecting to arch-rival Apple's new iPhone 7 or cheaper Chinese-made models. A Samsung spokeswoman confirmed the firm had started to offer the replacement handsets. The company began offering replacements for users in Canada and Singapore last week and is set to start soon in other nations including Mexico, Taiwan, New Zealand the United Arab Emirates. But with only a trickle of customers visiting stores in Seoul today for their replacements, the fate of the much-hyped handset remained unclear, although consumers in the South Korean capital were sympathetic. The recall dealt a major blow to the firm's reputation and raised alarm among airline, with several banning passengers from using the device on board. South Korean users have time until March 2017 to hand in their phones for a replacement but Samsung is hoping a software update that will limit battery recharges to 60 percent of capacity will jolt consumers into returning their handsets. The recall crisis erupted as Samsung finds itself squeezed by competition from Apple in the high-end market and Chinese rivals in the low-and mid-end segment. 'Hey YouTube,' Ariel Gonzalez says. 'Be careful out there. Everyone rockin' the new Note 7, it might catch fire y'all.' Another was from family in St. Petersburg, Florida, who reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire and destroyed the vehicle. And most recently, a six-year-old boy was burned after a Samsung phone 'exploded' in his hands. 'This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung's image,' said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. 'Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.' About two weeks ago, the US aviation safety officials warned passengers not to turn on or even charge a Note 7 during while one the plane, after numerous incident reports surfaced. The family said the phone, which was plugged in here, was engulfed in flames which quickly consumed the rest of the vehicle The Federal Aviation Administration also told passengers not to put smartphones in their checked bags, citing 'recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung' about the devices. Delta Air Lines Inc, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it is still studying the issue. 'Delta is in constant contact with the FAA and other bodies in its run of business as a global airline,' spokesman Morgan Durrant said in a statement. 'We will comply with any directive and are studying this matter. Safety and security is always Delta's top priority.' New York and New Jersey have both asked Samsung users to shut their phones down while riding public transportation until every faulty Note 7 has been replaced. HOW LITHIUM ION BATTERIES WORK IN YOUR PHONE Lithium ion batteries have three basic parts - a positive cathode, a negative anode and a chemical layer in between known as an electrolyte. The electrolyte allows electrical charges flow between the electrodes. In lithium ion batteries, the cathode is usually lithium cobalt oxide while the anode is made from graphite. When your battery charges, electrons entering at the anode attract lithium ions, which then nestle in sites between the graphite's carbon layers. During use, lithium atoms at the anode start losing their electrons, allowing electrons to zip through the circuits in the phone to provide power. Meanwhile, lithium ions journey through the electrolyte to be reunited with electrons at the cathode. These processes keep going until all ions reach the cathode, causing that dreaded flashing battery symbol. Every time your battery uses 100 per cent of its charge, known as its capacity, it has been through a single charge cycle. Each charge cycle, however, reduces the battery's total capacity by a tiny amount. Although Samsung voluntarily recalled 2.5 million devices worldwide, the announcement seemed to fall on deaf ears as many stores and carriers continued to sell them. The US Consumer Product Commission was then forced to step in and recall the one million in the US, where some 92 incidences of batteries overheating have been reported. Samsung rushed to produce and ship the Note 7 devices and one executive even said they had time to test the handsets in May, which is 'the typical amount of time to check its capabilities'. However, it wasn't until the devices reached customers were they deemed ticking time bombs GALAXY NOTE 7 SPECS  5.7inch curved screen Measures 153.5 x 73.9 x 7.9mm, weighs 169g (5.96 oz) MicroSD card expansion slot that holds up to 256 GB Available in black onyx, silver titanium, gold platinum and blue coral Built with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 Display is a super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen USB-C charger port  64 GB of internal storage, with 4 GB RAM  Non-removable Li-Po 3500 3,500 mAh battery Water-resistant phone body and S Pen  The US notice affects around one million of the global total of 2.5 million handsets being recalled, which has cast a cloud over the South Korean electronics giant and world's largest smartphone vendor, reports AFP.  The recall is the largest the smartphone industry has ever witnessed, however, Samsung did receive a pat on the back from others in the technology industry for the firm's speed and decisiveness, reports The New York Times. 'I thought, 'How is it that this is happening?' ' Jennifer Shecter, a spokeswoman for the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Consumer Reports, told The New York Times. Shecter said the group found an inconsistent response to the recall across America, as some stores and carries continued to keep selling the Note 7 even days after Samsung made the recall announcement. 'Samsung made an announcement, but the government wasn't involved, there wasn't a clear message, there wasn't an approved remedy and there wasn't a clear fix,' she said. Samsung has started an exchange program for Galaxy Note 7 owners in the UK and Ireland today, which allows them to trade in their ticking time bombs for safe smartphones. 'Samsung is fully confident that the battery issue has been completely resolved in the replacement Note 7 devices that will be available to customers in UK and Ireland from this week,' said the firm in a statement. The tech company added that while there had only been 'a small number of reported incidents, safety is the number one concern. 'Our absolute priority is the safety of our customers – that's why we are asking all Galaxy Note 7 customers to act now and exchange today,' said Conor Pierce, vice president of IT & Mobile at Samsung UK & Ireland.  IPHONE 7 AT A GLANCE  - New gloss black and black colours - Faster A10 processor  - iPhone 7 plus now has a wide angle and a telephoto lens - New Retina HD display is 25% brighter  - Now water and dustproof  - Home button has force feedback  - Stereo speakers at top and bottom with double the volume of previous version - New wireless AirPod headphones available as an extra - No headphone socket - but adapter and lightning EarPods will be in every box  - Boosted battery life Apple claims could add 2 hours Read more: www.nytimes.com/...

REUTERS/Joe Skipper By Noel Randewich and Jim Finkle Shares in a firm led by anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee fell 24 percent on Monday after it disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, MGT Capital Investments Inc MGT.A, said in a statement that it was cooperating with the SEC after receiving the subpoena on Thursday and that it does not believe it is or will be subject to any enforcement proceedings. In May of this year, shares in MGT surged more than 1,200 percent after the mobile gaming company said McAfee would become its chief executive. It said it would enter the fast-growing cyber-security market through acquisitions. MGT shares fell 97 cents to $2.47 in late-afternoon trade, trimming its market capitalization to about $64 million. An SEC spokesman declined to say why it subpoenaed MGT and what information it wanted. An MGT spokesman also declined to comment. With McAfee at the helm, MGT has said it plans to acquire security technologies to address threats to mobile and personal devices. McAfee was the subject of a media frenzy in 2012 when he fled his home in Belize after police sought to question him about the murder of a neighbor. They ultimately said he was not a suspect. Chipmaker Intel (INTC.O), which bought McAfee Inc for $7.7 billion in 2010, long after its founder had left the company, said recently that it would spin off the unit. McAfee and MGT recently sued Intel for the right to use the McAfee name. McAfee said during a conference call on Thursday that he expected MGT to begin generating revenue in the second quarter of next year after launching its first product at the end of 2016. He declined several requests from callers to provide financial projections. "I really can't say now about future revenue streams, but I certainly tell you that what we are doing and what we are building is going to be monumental," McAfee said in response to one of the questions, from a man identified as an individual investor. "Good enough for me, man. Good enough," the man replied. MGT also said it launched a Bitcoin mining operation, which involves using customized computers to earn Bitcoins in return for recording and verifying transactions in the crypto-currency.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple Inc. Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung Electronics Co., including phone chief D.J. Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalize on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On Sept. 2, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Related Samsung to recall Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in U.S. following 92 reports of battery overheating, agency says Samsung Electronics caps Galaxy Note 7 battery charging through software update to prevent overheating Hoverboards, laptops and now the Note 7 : Can you trust lithium-ion batteries in your device? Samsung drew criticism for the recall too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signaling consumers could keep using the phones. “This is creating an enormous problem for the company — for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem,” said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode “humiliating.” The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y. Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy S and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers seeking the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. With Chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman G.S. Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus — and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was Aug. 3 this year, compared with Aug. 13 last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI Co., a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20 per cent owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T Inc. in the U.S. and Telstra Corp. in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on Sept. 1, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologized to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the U.S. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery to explode. The chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology Ltd., a unit of Japan’s TDK Corp., according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement program is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor Corp., and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organize such programs. In the U.S. for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis Samsung, which may pay as much as US$2 billion for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML Holding NV, Seagate Technology Plc, Rambus Inc. and Sharp Corp. for a total value of about 1 trillion won (US$891 million). While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around Sept. 28, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume. The tumult has raised questions about whether Samsung’s current management approach is sufficiently robust to handle the crisis fallout. In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, Chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 19, 2016 1:39pm   Comments Share: Related INTC Intel Corporation, Mobileye May Be Star-Crossed Lovers, But Chowdhry Calls Veronian Tragedy 3 Stocks To Own Under President Trump Nobody Has Talked About What AMD Is Doing In Deep Learning (Seeking Alpha) Following Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) meaningfully raising its third-quarter revenue guidance last Friday, Baird bumped up its estimates and price target. Leaping Ahead On Data Center Momentum The firm's senior research analyst Tristan Gerra believes accelerating data center order momentum will benefit the company in the fourth quarter and well into the first quarter of 2017. PC Market Slump Slowing The optimism vested on the U.S. chip giant is also due to Baird's expectations that the year-over-year decline in PC unit shipments will slow more than market expectations. This is premised on a trifecta of factors, including continued Windows 10 upgrades, accelerating SSD adoption and new form factors. Related Link: As Intel Lifts Guidance, Argus Raises Price Target To $45 iPhone Lends Support In Partnership Arena Baird also sees support emerging from iPhone, as it believes that Intel will retain its market share position in the iPhone 8. This, according to the firm, will help the company to tide over mobile losses in 2018. Baird stated that the partnership with Apple will eventually lead to a foundry partnership in a few years. Raising Estimates The brokerage raised its 2016 earnings estimate for Intel to $2.05 per share from $2 per share and the 2017 estimate to $2.45 per share from $2.42 per share. This follows close on heels of the company raising its third-quarter revenue estimate to $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion from $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion previously, citing inventory replenishment in the PC supply chain and signs of improvement in PC demand. Intel also raised its non-GAAP gross margin guidance to 63 percent from 62 percent, while R&D and MG&A guidance was upped to $5.2 billion from $5.1 billion and tax rate raised to 22 percent from 21 percent. Price Target Revised Baird raised its price target for Intel's shares to $42 from $40, while maintaining its rating at Outperform. The revised price target is based on the company's shares trading at 15 to 16 times P/E multiple of its 2018 GAAP earnings per share, which is below the company's historical P/E ratio of 18 times. At time of writing, Intel was trading at $37.88, up 0.56 percent. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Password Processors and motherboards Intel Is that Core i7 or X99 chipset giving you a hard time? Enter this forum, this is all about Intel baby.   Thread Tools Display Modes Get upcoming Skylake or wait for Cannonlake? 14nm vs 10nm   (#1) cryohellinc Master Guru     Videocard: MSI 1080 SeaHawkX+PG348Q Processor: Intel i7 4770k @4.5ghz Mainboard: MSI Z87 Mpower Memory: Corsair DDR3 @1600 Soundcard: Sound Blaster ZxR + Amp PSU: ANTEC 1200W Get upcoming Skylake or wait for Cannonlake? 14nm vs 10nm - 09-19-2016, 09:12 | posts: 218 | Location: St. Petersburg Hey guys! While my system is perfectly stable right now, I am making some plans for future, hence the question: Next processor line - Skylake will be last 3rd Intel CPU generation based on 14nm manufacturing process, while Cannonlake will be first new 10nm manufacturing process generation. Question as follows, is there any point of getting i7-7700k or rather wait for i7-8700k (or what ever its branding model will be)? Yes I can bet the performance will be higher on 10nm, however I am not a processor guru and cant really figure out, will it be that significant, or will we see once again a steady increase of something like 4-6% performance increase as in previous generations? I can assume for calculations and rendering new generations will be better as well, due to larger amount of physical processors and as a result threads, however gaming wise, will it make any difference? Is there any information on this matter, or is it still too early?     cryohellinc View Public Profile Find all posts by cryohellinc     (#2) Singleton99 Master Guru     Videocard: 2 x MSI Gaming 980TI SLI Processor: i7 6700k @ 4.5- H105 Mainboard: Gigabyte Z170X-GAMING 7 Memory: 16g DDR4 2666mhz Fury Soundcard: S/Blaster Recon3D PCIE PSU: Super Flower 1200w Plat 09-19-2016, 13:47 | posts: 699 | Location: UK England from what i've understand so far is that Karby Lake (i7 7700k) will be 10 - 15% performance boost over skylake , with a boost clock of 4.5 instead of 4.2 from skylake. If you was to buy a skylake setup now it will be the same socket as kaby lake will use, so you could just swap out cpu's later if u wanted to. As for Cannonlake yes there will be another performance boost of 14nm cpus and i suppose i new chipset with support for newer tech , as to what the performance will be who knows .     Singleton99 View Public Profile Find all posts by Singleton99   (#3) thatguy91 Ancient Guru   Videocard: XFX RX 480 RS 4 GB Processor: i5-3570K Mainboard: Asrock Z77 Extreme6 Memory: DDR3-2400 2x8GB Soundcard: ALC898 + Microlab FC-730 PSU: Enermax Platimax 750W 09-19-2016, 14:25 | posts: 5,964 | Location: Australia Cannonlake is 10 nm, but has failed. Kaby Lake is actually the CPU to take it's initial position when it was first delayed, now there's Coffee Lake on 14 nm and Cannonlake will be for low powered devices only.

The way it seems, x99 will be a logical way to upgrade, however il wait for i7-7700k. Mobo's will get cheaper, same goes for ddr4, so sounds like upgrade time then. Looking forward for that overclock. AMD wise, never again, unless they really step up. I was and still am disappointing at how they work, and wont touch them any time soon.

As we argued recently there is little reason to buy a smartwatch, or indeed any wearable, unless you’re the kind of ostentatious exercise freak that needs to track every step, mile and calorie and share those Herculean efforts with the rest of the world. The problem, you see, is the user interface. A one-inch square watch face is just not enough screen real estate for even the smallest human being to interact with on anything but the most rudimentary level. This problem is insurmountable so long as you treat them like mini smartphones, but if you completely rethink the UI then there’s hope. Perennial mobile strugglers Intel and Amazon have, through their VC arms, joined forces with Fidelity Investments Canada to provide $120 million in Series B funding to gesture UI startup Thalmic. Thalmic’s signature product is the Myo Armband, a wearable you wrap around your arm which senses both the movements and the electrical activity in your arm to convert those gestures into digital commands. As the video below demonstrates, this allows control of other stuff like pointers, devices and even remote controlled gadgets. It’s easy to imagine smartwatches enabled with this technology to offer several things they currently don’t. While they could be used to control external devices the real value might be added by augmenting their own control via gestures. Additionally, if the gesture UI is sophisticated enough, users could even write via gesture and while there will be cultural challenges created by people walking around waving their arms like deranged conductors, this could be the sort of thing that makes wearables worth buying. Intel spent a decade or so trying to become relevant in mobile before admitting defeat earlier this year and deciding IoT and cloud are the future. Meanwhile Amazon had the bright idea of launching a de-featured smartphone at a premium price point a couple of years ago and has been licking its mobile wounds ever since. If, though investments like this, the two US giants get a head start in the wearables space they might just have the last laugh, although their track record suggests otherwise.

The DT395 tablets are highly durable to withstand extreme environments, designed with fully integrated options to eliminate easily broken attachments in mission critical scenarios and include security, privacy and productivity settings. "Many businesses have adopted mobile tablets with the goal of increasing productivity by leveraging the versatile tablet form-factor," said Daw Tsai Sc.D., president of DT Research. "But companies within construction, field service, logistics, manufacturing and warehousing have found that consumer-grade tablets are too fragile for their environment -- requiring costly repairs and replacements that introduce expensive downtime. Our new DT395 rugged tablets give vertical industries exactly what they need with high reliability and lower TCO over the lifetime of the product." According to a VDC Research study, the average annual TCO (total cost of ownership) of a ruggedized tablet is 22% lower than the average annual TCO of a non-rugged tablet. The study found average failure rates for non-rugged tablets is 15.2% compared to 6.9% for rugged tablets. Lost productivity, as a result of mobile device failure, was a leading contributor to higher TCO for non-rugged tablets. Mobile workers lost an average of 52-80 minutes of productivity when their mobile device failed. (source:VDC Research)(source:Total Cost of Ownership Models for Mobile Computing and Wireless Platforms)(source:Third Edition.) Unmatched Reliability Unlike consumer-grade tablets, the DT395CR and DT395GS ruggedized tablets are designed to be used in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments with full HD anti-reflection outdoor viewable displays. The tablets are IP65 and MIL-STD-810G rated to withstand 4-foot drops, broad temperatures (-4°F to 140°F) and resist water, dust and humidity. "We tried iPads, but they were not suited for our environment," said Marty Phillips, Director of Engineering at Murray Equipment, Inc. "Our customers do millions of dollars of fertilizer loading within an 8-week window in a broad range of weather conditions. If a remote control tablet is down for even an hour, it's a significant revenue loss. We have used DT Research rugged tablets in our automated liquid handling facilities across the U.S. for more than three years with no downtime or repair/replacement costs. The reliability of DT Research's rugged tablets is unmatched." The DT395CR and DT395GS have an 8.9 inch display with 1920x1200 resolution and capacitive touch, weighing only 2.87 pounds. The tablets run on an Intel® Atom Quad Coreä CPU with 4GB RAM running Microsoft® Windows® 10 IoT Enterprise OS. The DT395GS tablet is designed for field applications with a high-accuracy GNSS module that is compatible with existing GIS software for mapping applications and brings together the advanced workflow for GIS data capture, accurate positioning, and data transmission. The u-blox M8 GNSS module is capable of concurrent reception of GPS and GLONASS for up to 2 meter accuracy. Security, Privacy & Productivity Settings "Security, privacy and productivity are a growing concern in many organizations," Helen Fanucci, GM of Americas Device IoT Experience, Microsoft. "We are pleased to see DT Research utilize the Windows 10 IoT Enterprise grade security to support mission critical rugged tablets for customers and deliver a safer device experience, which enhances productivity for a variety of mobile scenarios in manufacturing, field service, logistics and other industries." The DT395 tablets leverage advanced Windows 10 IoT Enterprise OS security including Device Guard, combining hardware and software security to lock down a device so that it can only run trusted applications. The DT395 also includes Lock Down features to protect against malicious users while providing a custom defined user experience. Bluetooth, WiFi, and RFID can pose a security issue when using consumer-grade tablets within a business environment. DT Research DT395 rugged tablets can be purpose-built with a camera privacy mode and/or preconfigured with Bluetooth, RFID and WiFi disable functions. The DT395 rugged tablets can also eliminate access to internet or social media applications to address productivity challenges. Fully Integrated Options DT Research offers customizable options for the DT395CR and DT395GS including an optimized OS and BIOS. Customers can choose to have the options below fully-integrated. 3G WWAN or 4G LTE 2D Barcode Scanner Class 1 Bluetooth (1000 feet) Camera (5 Megapixel back camera) GNSS Module (u-blox M8) HF/RFID 13.56MHz reader HDMI-in and Ethernet port 6-pin push/pull connector for EIA/RS-232/485/422, USB port and Ethernet port Pricing and Availability The DT395CR and DT395GS rugged tablets will be available in September 2016 through authorized resellers and partners. The cost of a base unit is $1,200 MSRP.

According to internal documents, the company is aware of and investigating the issue. Apple’s reportedly advised authorized service providers to instruct customers to restart the affected devices and, if service persists, remove and re-insert the device’s SIM card. MacRumors reader Yasser El-Haggan posted the following video showing an iPhone 7 unable to regain cellular network access after exiting Airplane Mode alongside an iPhone 6s, which regains two bars of LTE after Airplane Mode is cancelled. Both devices are apparently AT&T models. Now, the AT&T iPhone 7 has an Intel modem versus Qualcomm’s in Verizon and Sprint models so this issue may have something to do with the decision to dual-source baseband chips for this year’s iPhone refresh. El-Haggan took his handset to an Apple Store and they swapped it out with a new one. “The employee had allegedly seen the issue on a few previous handsets, and he immediately replaced the device per Apple’s instructions in lieu of running a basic diagnostic test,” reads the article. It’s unclear if this was a one-off replacement or whether Apple’s instructed stores to replace any iPhone 7 units exhibiting the Airplane Mode symptoms, no questions asked. This isn’t the first issue to hit Apple’s new phone. Two days ago, some owners of new iPhones reported hearing an odd hissing noise coming from the logic board when the CPU is pegged out.

Mr_Coldharbour I guess the CPUs are so fast that the SIM cards just can’t keep up. *sarcasm* appletimemac I had this happen with my Sprint iPhone 7. I had to reboot for it to recognize the LTE network after it dropped to 3G. And I had 3/5 bars of LTE, which is odd. Mr_Coldharbour I encountered this problem a few times on my iPhone 6S Plus where it would suddenly enter “No Service” mode and nothing but a reboot would fix it. Nothing new here. 5723alex . I too encountered this problem a few times on my iPhone 6S Plus where it would suddenly enter “No Service” . Switching Airplane Mode on/off fixed it.

The city, which is the home of the giant panda, will see more than 3000 delegates in attendance at the weekend. Located in the Sichuan Province, Chengdu is preparing to host this year’s World Routes forum. This will see over 3,100 delegates from 240 airlines, 470 airports and 80 tourism authorities coming to the city to potentially create brand new routes. World Routes was last held in China seven years ago, when the forum was hosted in Beijing. Chengdu is one of the most important economic, financial and transportation centres in western China. The city is not just home to the giant panda, but to more than 270 Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Intel and IBM. This year, Chengdu was voted the 12th most liveable city in China by Sapore di Cina, citing Jiuzhaigou as one of the most breath-taking sites in the country. The provincial capital of Sichuan province has been indentified as an important hub to improve air services to Wester Asia, the Middle East and Europe in China’s ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative. This initiative has the potential to be the world’s largest platform for regional collaboration, which covers 65 percent of the world’s population. The vast growth of Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport has seen passenger numbers rise by 40 percent in just three years. This is due in part to new international routes to the likes of Frankfurt, Melbourne and Doha. The fourth busiest airport in mainland China handled 42.2 million passengers in 2015 and are expected to handle 47 million this year. Chengdu Tianfu International Airport is currently under construction, but will have the capacity handle 40 million passengers when the first building phases are complete. It will make Chengdu the third largest aviation hub in China after Beijing and Shanghai when it opens in 2020. Aside from the hundreds of meetings that take place during the event, there is also a whole wealth of live content on offer to delegates. The Strategy Summit, taking place on Sunday 25 September, includes a keynote interview with Peter Bellew, CEO of Malaysia Airlines and a panel session looking at the state of the industry. This panel will feature Brian Hedberg, director of Office of International Aviation for the US Department of Transportation, André van der Berg, executive vice president and CCO of Schiphol Group and will be moderated by John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting. The Tourism Summit on Monday 26 September will have a panel on aviation and tourism partnerships, moderated by Alfredo Gonzalez, vice president of sales and global development for Visit Florida. Presentations will be given by Professor Dr. Wolfgang Arlt on Chinese outbound tourism and Sarah Matthews on the impact of travel technology on destination marketing. Routes Talks are also on offer during both days. Many of the world's major airlines will be represented at World Routes in Chengdu, including Air Asia, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Lufthansa and Qantas.

Ada Gets Promoted To Being A First-Class Language In Coreboot Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 19 September 2016 at 09:47 AM EDT. 10 Comments Coreboot has mainlined a months-old patch to make the Ada programming language "a first class citizen" in this low-level open-source project. As of today in Coreboot GNAT runtime system was also added today for the Ada code. This Ada Coreboot code was written by Nico Huber. Last year he inquired about Ada support in Coreboot as he wrote a native graphics init system covering some Intel hardware (at least eDP on Ivy Bridge but could work for other hardware too) and it was written in the SPARK Ada subset. The Ada programming language remains popular in many development circles for its safety-critical features and very strong typing. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

It is the only route development forum that brings together aviation professionals to discuss new air services on a global scale. Rapid economic growth since the 1990s has transformed Chengdu into the largest city in western China with a population of over 1.4 million. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and home to 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Chengdu's GDP increased by 7.9 % in 2015 to 1.08 trillion Yuan which is 1.1% above the national average. Chengdu was included in The New York Times' "52 Places to Go in 2015" list and it is one of China's top ten tourist destinations. The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, ancient archaeological ruins, the remains of the Old City and many other attractions drew 2.3 million overseas visitors last year. Economic success and a burgeoning tourism industry has led to high demand for air services. Between 2012 and 2015 Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport's passenger numbers increased by 40% from 30 million to 42 million. During this time dozens of new international routes were launched to cities including Vancouver, Frankfurt, Doha, London, Melbourne, San Francisco, Moscow and Paris. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 47 million by the end of this year. The wider context of China's investment in aviation is crucial to Chengdu's success. The government aims to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) aviation market by 2020 and a national construction programme will increase the number of Chinese airports to 260, one of which will be in Chengdu. Chengdu Tianfu International Airport (currently under construction) will have the capacity to handle 40 million passengers when the first building phases are complete. It will make Chengdu the third largest aviation hub in China after Beijing and Shanghai when it opens in 2020. Chengdu will also benefit from President Xi Jinping's initiative to create a modern day Silk Road through improved international transport connections. The 'One Road, One Belt' strategy has identified Chengdu as an important hub to improve air services to western Asian, the Middle East and Europe. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, will show over 3,100 delegates from 230 airlines, 470 airports and 80 tourism authorities what the destination has to offer while making the case for new air services. Most of the world's major airlines will be present including Air Asia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Qantas. The latest challenges facing the aviation industry will be debated at the Strategy Summit conference. The high profile speakers include Peter Bellew, CEO of Malaysia Airlines; Hou Wei, vice president of Hainan Airlines and Benyamin Ismail, CEO of AirAsia X Berhad. The Tourism Summit conference will explore how destinations can attract Chinese tourists and the changing nature of marketing. Speakers include Shanzhong Zhu, executive director of World Tourism Organization (UNWTO); Professor Dr Wolfgang Arlt, director of China's Outbound Tourism Research Institute and David Scowsill, president and CEO of World Travel & Tourism Council. Adrian Newton, group director at UBM EMEA (the organiser of World Routes) said: "The airlines are increasingly looking east for future growth and no other country is currently investing in aviation like China. World Routes will provide a fantastic international platform to plan new air services across the globe." Mr Liwei, board chairman of Sichuan Province Airport Group Co Ltd said: "Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the largest international aviation hub in central-western China with significant potential for growth. "We are looking forward to meeting senior decision makers from the airlines at World Routes to discuss global aviation and development strategy and share the achievement of cooperation and communication."

Five 'regional' route development forums are held between February and June in the Americas, Asia, Europe and Africa, with the flagship World Routes event taking place in September. https://www.routesonline.com The events revolve around pre-scheduled meetings and an exhibition and conference which are delivered in partnership with host stakeholders. Hosts tend to be a collaboration between airports, tourism authorities and investment partners (the bidding process takes place two to three years before the event takes place). Routes was founded in 1995 and is part of the EMEA division of UBM plc.   For further information contact: Karen Reeves Communications & Content Marketing Manager Routes, UBM EMEA T: +44(0)161-234-2721 M: +44(0)796-6405-105 E: Karen.Reeves@ubm.com SOURCE Routes More by this Source Adelaide to Host First Australian World Routes 23 Oct, 2016, 23:45 BST Singapore Changi Airport Wins World Routes Marketing Awards 27 Sep, 2016, 07:38 BST Chengdu Fuels Aviation Growth With World Routes 24 Aug, 2016, 12:52 BST View all news by Routes Journalists and Bloggers Visit PR Newswire for Journalists for releases, photos and customised feeds just for media.

The project up for the prestigious recognition is an EV fast-charging station that was installed at Intel's corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The 30kW, 43kWh battery system is part of a solar plus storage structure that utilizes Powin Energy's patented Battery Pack Operating System (bp-OS). The solar+storage setup is engineered to shield the facility from high demand charges due to rapid power consumption and is capable of charging two electric vehicles per day. "This installation with EV4 displays how our modular, scalable storage solutions can be designed to meet the demands of any project and application," said Danny Lu, Vice President of Marketing for Powin Energy. "The client needed a solar powered charging station coupled with storage that mitigates high utility bills caused by additional demand charges from the electrical grid due to fast EV charging, and our battery system helped deliver that." Powin Energy's advanced battery management technology and its unique design of the battery assisted fast charging solution can eliminate the need to install three-phase power, which enabled EV4 to grid-tie the ETM™ (Energy Transfer Merchant) via a single phase 120/240 VAC connection. It also increases the safety and functionality of lithium-ion battery storage by managing the level of charge and discharge across the entire system to ensure the batteries stay within optimal state-of-charge parameters. The bp-OS actively monitors and manages every battery in the system and can isolate underperforming battery packs or entire strings, sending maintenance alerts and filing warranty claims automatically, which is crucial for the safety of an outdoor battery storage system operating across a range of ambient temperatures. The charging station's roof consists of 15 solar panels with a capacity of 4.1 kW which will provide an estimated 7,300 kWh of power per year. The ETM also utilizes Austin, Texas, company Ideal Power's highly efficient 30kW bi-directional power conversion system to convert AC to DC and vice-versa. "We took great care while developing the ETM charging station," said Hans van der Meer, president and CEO of EV4. "We wanted to bring together the best solution for every component in the system. Powin Energy's battery storage system along with their comprehensive bp-OS software brought an added element of functionality and reliability." Earlier this year, Powin Energy announced that its unique bp-OS -- including the industry-exclusive Battery Odometer and Warranty Tracker™ -- had received a United States patent. The bp-OS is a standard component in every Powin Energy Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The BESS is a self-contained 125 kW/250 kWh modular shipping container that can be scaled to service projects that are multiple megawatts in size. BESS units are less than 20 feet long, giving the system a modest footprint. Voting is open until September 20 at ESNA's website. Winners will be announced October 5 during ESNA's 2016 conference in San Diego, California. About Powin Energy Corporation Powin Energy, a subsidiary of Powin Corporation (stock symbol: PWON), is a leading designer and developer of safe and scalable battery energy storage solutions, based on its patented Battery Pack Operating System (bp-OS), for utility, microgrid and EV fast-charging applications. Over 100 years of collective energy and engineering experience goes into every Powin Energy battery storage system. Powin Energy's patented Battery Pack Operating System helps extend the life of batteries by actively and reactively balancing battery functions down to the cell level. It also provides critical insight into battery system functions and lifespan via its proprietary Battery Odometer and Warranty Tracker™. For more information, visit http://PowinEnergy.com/.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150730/250177LOGO ) World Routes moves to a different location every year to highlight different aviation markets. It is the only route development forum that brings together aviation professionals to discuss new air services on a global scale. Rapid economic growth since the 1990s has transformed Chengdu into the largest city in western China with a population of over 1.4 million. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and home to 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Chengdu's GDP increased by 7.9 % in 2015 to 1.08 trillion Yuan which is 1.1% above the national average. Chengdu was included in The New York Times' "52 Places to Go in 2015" list and it is one of China's top ten tourist destinations. The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, ancient archaeological ruins, the remains of the Old City and many other attractions drew 2.3 million overseas visitors last year. Economic success and a burgeoning tourism industry has led to high demand for air services. Between 2012 and 2015 Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport's passenger numbers increased by 40% from 30 million to 42 million. During this time dozens of new international routes were launched to cities including Vancouver, Frankfurt, Doha, London, Melbourne, San Francisco, Moscow and Paris. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 47 million by the end of this year. The wider context of China's investment in aviation is crucial to Chengdu's success. The government aims to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) aviation market by 2020 and a national construction programme will increase the number of Chinese airports to 260, one of which will be in Chengdu. Chengdu Tianfu International Airport (currently under construction) will have the capacity to handle 40 million passengers when the first building phases are complete. It will make Chengdu the third largest aviation hub in China after Beijing and Shanghai when it opens in 2020. Chengdu will also benefit from PresidentXi Jinping's initiative to create a modern day Silk Road through improved international transport connections. The 'One Road, One Belt' strategy has identified Chengdu as an important hub to improve air services to western Asian, the Middle East and Europe. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, will show over 3,100 delegates from 230 airlines, 470 airports and 80 tourism authorities what the destination has to offer while making the case for new air services. Most of the world's major airlines will be present including Air Asia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Qantas. The latest challenges facing the aviation industry will be debated at the Strategy Summit conference. The high profile speakers include Peter Bellew, CEO of Malaysia Airlines;Hou Wei, vice president of Hainan Airlines and Benyamin Ismail, CEO of AirAsia X Berhad. The Tourism Summit conference will explore how destinations can attract Chinese tourists and the changing nature of marketing. Speakers include Shanzhong Zhu, executive director of World Tourism Organization (UNWTO);Professor Dr Wolfgang Arlt, director of China's Outbound Tourism Research Institute and David Scowsill, president and CEO of World Travel & Tourism Council. Adrian Newton, group director at UBM EMEA (the organiser of World Routes) said: "The airlines are increasingly looking east for future growth and no other country is currently investing in aviation like China. World Routes will provide a fantastic international platform to plan new air services across the globe." Mr Liwei, board chairman of Sichuan Province Airport Group Co Ltd said: "Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the largest international aviation hub in central-western China with significant potential for growth. "We are looking forward to meeting senior decision makers from the airlines at World Routes to discuss global aviation and development strategy and share the achievement of cooperation and communication."

The project up for the prestigious recognition is an EV fast-charging station that was installed at Intel's corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. The 30kW, 43kWh battery system is part of a solar plus storage structure that utilizes Powin Energy's patented Battery Pack Operating System (bp-OS). The solar+storage setup is engineered to shield the facility from high demand charges due to rapid power consumption and is capable of charging two electric vehicles per day. "This installation with EV4 displays how our modular, scalable storage solutions can be designed to meet the demands of any project and application," said Danny Lu, Vice President of Marketing for Powin Energy. "The client needed a solar powered charging station coupled with storage that mitigates high utility bills caused by additional demand charges from the electrical grid due to fast EV charging, and our battery system helped deliver that." Powin Energy's advanced battery management technology and its unique design of the battery assisted fast charging solution can eliminate the need to install three-phase power, which enabled EV4 to grid-tie the ETM™ (Energy Transfer Merchant) via a single phase 120/240 VAC connection. It also increases the safety and functionality of lithium-ion battery storage by managing the level of charge and discharge across the entire system to ensure the batteries stay within optimal state-of-charge parameters. The bp-OS actively monitors and manages every battery in the system and can isolate underperforming battery packs or entire strings, sending maintenance alerts and filing warranty claims automatically, which is crucial for the safety of an outdoor battery storage system operating across a range of ambient temperatures. The charging station's roof consists of 15 solar panels with a capacity of 4.1 kW which will provide an estimated 7,300 kWh of power per year. The ETM also utilizes Austin, Texas, company Ideal Power's highly efficient 30kW bi-directional power conversion system to convert AC to DC and vice-versa. "We took great care while developing the ETM charging station," said Hans van der Meer, president and CEO of EV4. "We wanted to bring together the best solution for every component in the system. Powin Energy's battery storage system along with their comprehensive bp-OS software brought an added element of functionality and reliability." Earlier this year, Powin Energy announced that its unique bp-OS -- including the industry-exclusive Battery Odometer and Warranty Tracker™ -- had received a United States patent. The bp-OS is a standard component in every Powin Energy Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The BESS is a self-contained 125 kW/250 kWh modular shipping container that can be scaled to service projects that are multiple megawatts in size. BESS units are less than 20 feet long, giving the system a modest footprint. Voting is open until September 20 at ESNA's website. Winners will be announced October 5 during ESNA's 2016 conference in San Diego, California. About Powin Energy Corporation Powin Energy, a subsidiary of Powin Corporation (stock symbol: PWON), is a leading designer and developer of safe and scalable battery energy storage solutions, based on its patented Battery Pack Operating System (bp-OS), for utility, microgrid and EV fast-charging applications. Over 100 years of collective energy and engineering experience goes into every Powin Energy battery storage system. Powin Energy's patented Battery Pack Operating System helps extend the life of batteries by actively and reactively balancing battery functions down to the cell level. It also provides critical insight into battery system functions and lifespan via its proprietary Battery Odometer and Warranty Tracker™. For more information, visit http://PowinEnergy.com/.

September 19, 2016 08:00 ET DT Research Delivers Rugged Tablets Purpose-Built for Industry With Lower TCO Than Consumer Devices Cost-Effective IP65 Rated Tablets Beat Consumer Devices in Durability, Reliability, Productivity and Security SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - September 19, 2016) - DT Research, the leading designer and manufacturer of purpose-built computing solutions for vertical markets, today announced the DT395CR and DT395GS Rugged Tablets designed for the unique needs of vertical industries, but cost less than consumer-grade tablets over the lifetime of the product. The DT395 tablets are highly durable to withstand extreme environments, designed with fully integrated options to eliminate easily broken attachments in mission critical scenarios and include security, privacy and productivity settings. "Many businesses have adopted mobile tablets with the goal of increasing productivity by leveraging the versatile tablet form-factor," said Daw Tsai Sc.D., president of DT Research. "But companies within construction, field service, logistics, manufacturing and warehousing have found that consumer-grade tablets are too fragile for their environment -- requiring costly repairs and replacements that introduce expensive downtime. Our new DT395 rugged tablets give vertical industries exactly what they need with high reliability and lower TCO over the lifetime of the product." According to a VDC Research study, the average annual TCO (total cost of ownership) of a ruggedized tablet is 22% lower than the average annual TCO of a non-rugged tablet. The study found average failure rates for non-rugged tablets is 15.2% compared to 6.9% for rugged tablets. Lost productivity, as a result of mobile device failure, was a leading contributor to higher TCO for non-rugged tablets. Mobile workers lost an average of 52-80 minutes of productivity when their mobile device failed. (Source: VDC Research, Total Cost of Ownership Models for Mobile Computing and Wireless Platforms, Third Edition.) Unmatched Reliability Unlike consumer-grade tablets, the DT395CR and DT395GS ruggedized tablets are designed to be used in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments with full HD anti-reflection outdoor viewable displays. The tablets are IP65 and MIL-STD-810G rated to withstand 4-foot drops, broad temperatures (-4°F to 140°F) and resist water, dust and humidity. "We tried iPads, but they were not suited for our environment," said Marty Phillips, Director of Engineering at Murray Equipment, Inc. "Our customers do millions of dollars of fertilizer loading within an 8-week window in a broad range of weather conditions. If a remote control tablet is down for even an hour, it's a significant revenue loss. We have used DT Research rugged tablets in our automated liquid handling facilities across the U.S. for more than three years with no downtime or repair/replacement costs. The reliability of DT Research's rugged tablets is unmatched." The DT395CR and DT395GS have an 8.9 inch display with 1920x1200 resolution and capacitive touch, weighing only 2.87 pounds. The tablets run on an Intel® Atom Quad Coreä CPU with 4GB RAM running Microsoft® Windows® 10 IoT Enterprise OS.

The u-blox M8 GNSS module is capable of concurrent reception of GPS and GLONASS for up to 2 meter accuracy. Security, Privacy & Productivity Settings "Security, privacy and productivity are a growing concern in many organizations," Helen Fanucci, GM of Americas Device IoT Experience, Microsoft. "We are pleased to see DT Research utilize the Windows 10 IoT Enterprise grade security to support mission critical rugged tablets for customers and deliver a safer device experience, which enhances productivity for a variety of mobile scenarios in manufacturing, field service, logistics and other industries." The DT395 tablets leverage advanced Windows 10 IoT Enterprise OS security including Device Guard, combining hardware and software security to lock down a device so that it can only run trusted applications. The DT395 also includes Lock Down features to protect against malicious users while providing a custom defined user experience. Bluetooth, WiFi, and RFID can pose a security issue when using consumer-grade tablets within a business environment. DT Research DT395 rugged tablets can be purpose-built with a camera privacy mode and/or preconfigured with Bluetooth, RFID and WiFi disable functions. The DT395 rugged tablets can also eliminate access to internet or social media applications to address productivity challenges.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / JoTo PR: Failed Corporate Social Responsibility Equals Brand Alienation JoTo PR: Failed Corporate Social Responsibility Equals Brand Alienation Posted on September 19, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer JoTo PR, an international public relations agency, responds to a recent survey and stresses the importance of how a company’s Corporate Social Responsibility needs to be aligned with a public relations strategy in order to gain the proper recognition and generate a larger ROI while remaining in the good graces of the public eye. Clearwater, Fla. (PRWEB) September 19, 2016 Many companies in America have been given a bad persona that can usually be traced back to one thing, their lack of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). A study by Cone Communications and Echo Research of 10,000 global consumers found that 91 percent of shoppers worldwide will likely switch to brands that support a social or environmental cause (1). On the other hand, 90 percent of shoppers will boycott a company based off of moral or irresponsible business practices. JoTo PR, an innovative public relations firm in the Tampa Bay area, has found that many company’s PR budget allocations are dramatically changing course by focusing as much as 50 percent of their marketing budgets toward PR to influence people before they buy. In order to accomplish this, many more companies are implementing CSR efforts to fall in line with their reputation strategy. Karla Jo Helms, public relations innovator and veteran CEO of JoTo PR, has been advising her clients since the founding of her PR firm to contribute back towards economic development while also improving the overall quality of the workforce by aiding in social, environmental and ethical concerns. Companies such as SeaWorld can agree that all press is not good press. When the release of the documentary ‘Blackfish’ exposed the cruel treatment of the orca whales within the park, people’s opinion of the business plummeted, and their response towards the documentary didn't help their case. Other companies such as Nestle, Walmart and Chase Bank are not only lacking on the spectrum of their environmental responsibilities, but are also criticized for human rights violations, unethical promotions, financial schemes and more. “Positive publicity and PR will increase the overall success of any CSR being performed simply by creating better word of mouth and getting the news out to the media and ultimately to the public,” stated Helms. “By leveraging your CSR efforts with a proactive PR strategy, the public eye will take notice of the work your company is doing, which studies show heavily influences buying decisions.” There are several industries where this is evident, both through successful and failed CSR. Helms says tech companies understand the importance of CSR and leverage their strategies with PR in order to sway consumer’s interests. With a rise in the field of technology, millennials are a particularly important niche. With 18- to 34-year-olds becoming the largest consumer base in the U.S., the most reputable tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple and Intel, are faring especially well with that age group. These tech companies are listed among the top 10 companies in the world with the best CSR reputations according to a study by the Reputation Institute (2). 42 percent of how people feel about a company is based on their perceptions of the firm’s CSR efforts. (3) In an effort to increase the trust and public perception, companies are strongly encouraged to not only do well, but publicize their CSR activities. It’s a common understanding now that the government cannot be held solely responsible for ethical and societal changes. People believe that businesses have a civic duty to utilize their wealth and success to coincide with strides to improve society by aiding in the growth and wellbeing of society. Helms points out that companies are developing their own CSR departments to solely focus on their sustainable growth. “The tech industry is one that understands the importance of catering to their consumer’s opinions,” said Helms. “Other industries, such as healthcare, are losing the battle to enter into a positive light in the eyes of the public.” One example of this is pharmaceutical companies. Over the last 25 years, they have defrauded federal and state governments by $35 billion, most commonly by marketing drugs for unapproved uses. (4) This turns into a PR nightmare, and gives many pharmaceutical companies a horrible reputation. Positive PR increases return on investment (ROI) for marketing dollars, lowers cost per lead and increases overall revenues for new business by making people more interested and comfortable in doing business with a particular company. (5) “Consumers today – whether B2B or B2C – want to support businesses that make concerted efforts to better their community and the world,” said Helms. “There are now B-corporations requiring companies to contribute to the greater good in their bylaws.” Helms states that companies can no longer reply off of their actions speaking volumes. With today’s cluttered marketing environment, companies have to publicize their good works. “PR creates safe havens of goodwill for businesses today to be able to expand safely by being in control of public opinion.” To learn more about JoTo PR and their strategic efforts to assist in crisis management and CSR to PR correlation, visit http://www.jotopr.com/.

It is the only route development forum that brings together aviation professionals to discuss new air services on a global scale. Rapid economic growth since the 1990s has transformed Chengdu into the largest city in western China with a population of over 1.4 million. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and home to 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft. Chengdu’s GDP increased by 7.9 % in 2015 to 1.08 trillion Yuan which is 1.1% above the national average. Chengdu was included in The New York Times’ ‘52 Places to Go in 2015’ list and it is one of China’s top ten tourist destinations. The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, ancient archaeological ruins, the remains of the Old City and many other attractions drew 2.3 million overseas visitors last year. Economic success and a burgeoning tourism industry has led to high demand for air services. Between 2012 and 2015 Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport’s passenger numbers increased by 40% from 30 million to 42 million. During this time dozens of new international routes were launched to cities including Vancouver, Frankfurt, Doha, London, Melbourne, San Francisco, Moscow and Paris. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 47 million by the end of this year. The wider context of China’s investment in aviation is crucial to Chengdu’s success. The government aims to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) aviation market by 2020 and a national construction programme will increase the number of Chinese airports to 260, one of which will be in Chengdu. Chengdu Tianfu International Airport (currently under construction) will have the capacity to handle 40 million passengers when the first building phases are complete. It will make Chengdu the third largest aviation hub in China after Beijing and Shanghai when it opens in 2020. Chengdu will also benefit from President Xi Jinping’s initiative to create a modern day Silk Road through improved international transport connections. The ‘One Road, One Belt’ strategy has identified Chengdu as an important hub to improve air services to western Asian, the Middle East and Europe. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, will show over 3,100 delegates from 230 airlines, 470 airports and 80 tourism authorities what the destination has to offer while making the case for new air services. Most of the world’s major airlines will be present including Air Asia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Qantas. The latest challenges facing the aviation industry will be debated at the Strategy Summit conference. The high profile speakers include Peter Bellew, CEO of Malaysia Airlines; Hou Wei, vice president of Hainan Airlines and Benyamin Ismail, CEO of AirAsia X Berhad.

Now it looks like someone has opened up one of these new machines, or else found an AWOL motherboard, and taken a nice clear photo of the AM4 processor socket. The socket, as pictured above, features a PGA (Pin Grid Array) design. It is clearly labelled 'Socket AM4' and there are 1331 pins present – a significant increase on the 942 pins supported by AMD's AM3+ socket. (For further comparison Intel's current LGA 1151 sports 1151 pins.) As a reminder, AMD Socket AM4 is designed to support the currently shipping 7th Generation AMD A-Series ('Bristol Ridge') desktop PC systems and the upcoming Zen-Series ('Summit Ridge') processors. The beefed up number of pin connections will likely be used for the platform's new dual channel DDR4 (up-to 3200MHz) memory configuration, support for up to 24 PCIe lanes, and the integrated Northbridge in upcoming processors. 'Bristol Ridge' processor pins The new AM4 socket is the same size as previous AMD sockets, at 40mm square, however there is some confusion about CPU cooler compatibility. Some manufacturers, such as Noctua, have previously shown off a 'mounting upgrade kit' to make its coolers AM4 compatible - thus it looks like cooler compatibility could be an issue. WCCF Tech says that the socket's mounting holes had to be relocated due to the increased amount of traces going in and out of the socket. Retail availability of AM4 motherboards is expected sometime next month. AMD Zen-based 'Summit Ridge' processors are expected in February next year, followed up by 'Raven Ridge' Zen-based APUs in the summer.

File picture: Kim Hong-Ji Singapore - Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple. Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models, too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung Electronics, including phone chief D.J. Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalise on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Read also: Note 7 recall: Samsung blames minor battery flaw Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On September 2, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Criticism Samsung drew criticism for the recall, too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signaling consumers could keep using the phones. “This is creating an enormous problem for the company - for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem,” said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. Read also: Samsung caps Note 7 battery charging The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode “humiliating”. Strain on management The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y. Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Read also: Samsung scion joins board amid Note 7 crisis Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy S and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers seeking the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. Pressure The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. Read also: Samsung to restart Note 7 sales in South Korea With Chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman G.S. Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus - and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was August 3 this year, compared with August 13 last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI, a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20 percent owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. Longer hours, less sleep As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T in the US and Telstra in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Shock Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on September 1, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note 7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologised to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. Cause of the problem Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the US. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery to explode. The chairman of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology, a unit of Japan’s TDK Corporation, according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. Recall The replacement programme is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor, and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organise such programmes. In the US for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. Samsung, which may pay as much as $2 billion for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML Holding NV, Seagate Technology, Rambus and Sharp for a total value of about 1 trillion won ($891 million). While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around Sept. 28, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume. The tumult has raised questions about whether Samsung’s current management approach is sufficiently robust to handle the crisis fallout. In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. Image at risk “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, Chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore.  * With assistance from Sohee Kim, Mark Gurman, Adam Satariano, Jing Cao and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

So, it decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalise on the opportunity. Then it all backfired. By Yoolim Lee and Min Jeong Lee. Added by Editor on 19 September 2016. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Apple, DJ Koh, Jay Y Lee, Lee Kun-Hee, Samsung, Samsung Electronics Tweet Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple. Earlier this year, managers at the Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models, too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung, including phone chief DJ Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalise on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flames. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On 2 September, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2,5m phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Samsung drew criticism for the recall, too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signalling consumers could keep using the phones. “This is creating an enormous problem for the company — for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem,” said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode “humiliating”. The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy S and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers seeking the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the Web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. Pressure from the Plus The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. The iPhone 6s Plus, 6s and SE With chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman GS Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus — and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was on 3 August this year, compared with 13 August last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note7 a 3 500mAh battery compared with 3 000mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2 900mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note7 was Samsung SDI, a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20% owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone makers, too, including Apple. As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Then the fires began Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T in the US and Telstra in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the Web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Clearly, they missed something. They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then, on 1 September, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologised to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the US. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery to explode. iPhone 7 Plus The chairman of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology, a unit of Japan’s TDK, according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement. “All replacement Galaxy Note7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement programme is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota, and the conclusion seemed clear: move quickly and dramatically. The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organise such programmes. In the US, for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. Samsung, which may pay as much as US$2bn for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML, Seagate, Rambus and Sharp for a total value of about a trillion won ($891m). While Samsung says Galaxy Note7 sales will resume in Korea around 28 September, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume. A crisis The tumult has raised questions about whether Samsung’s current management approach is sufficiently robust to handle the crisis fallout. In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet André Schild Very good read! Andrew Fraser Few people are aware how much energy is stored in a phone’s lithium ion battery. A Note 7 battery is rated at 3500mAh, or nominally capable of providing 350 milliAmps for 10 hours. In reality this is a tremendous amount of chemical energy (approximately 27Wh), stored in a very small amount of space with some very fine tolerances. Sony (one of the inventors of lithium-ion battery technology) learned this with a similar issue in their VAIO notebook batteries. In that case, it wasn’t a design issue, but rather a contamination in the battery manufacturing process at Sanyo, but the results were similar. The failure rate in both these cases is relatively small, but in those cases the failure is spectacular. Nobody wants the phone in their pocket to burst into flames, or a passenger’s notebook PC or tablet to ignite on a plane. Unfortunately, there are few alternatives to these technologies, and as long as there is a drive to ever thinner, ever more powerful products, we will have this risk. Now you know why airlines restrict the number of Li-ion batteries that you can carry, and some restrict them in checked luggage completely.

Anxiety ahead of next week's central-bank meetings weighed on sentiment. However, for the week, major stock-index gauges eked out small gains, in part, thanks to Apple Inc.'s stellar climb. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 88.68 points, or 0.5%, to 18,123.80, for a weekly gain of 0.2%. The S&P 500 index under fire from the energy and financials sectors, declined 8.11 points, or 0.4%, to close at 2,139.15, for a weekly gain of 0.5%. The Nasdaq Composite index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 5,244.57. The tech-heavy index logged a weekly gain of 2.3% as Apple shares rose more than 11% on the week. The financial and energy sectors led the day's losses, while utilities and health-care shares finished in positive territory. The blue-chip gauge was led by a 3% rise in shares of Intel Corp. while a 2.5% fall in United Technology Corp. topped laggards. Apple slid 0.6% after a four-day advance that propelled it 12% higher, amid growing buzz over its updated iPhone. It is the best product-launch linked performance for the stock since 2011 when the company introduced the iPhone 4S, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Apple's 11.4% weekly jump is also its sharpest since October 2011, FactSet data show. The Federal Open Market Committee and the Bank of Japan are both scheduled to wrap up their policy meetings on Wednesday. The BOJ is seen as easing policy slightly, while the Fed is widely expected to keep rates on hold. Economic data at Wall Street on Friday showed that the U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in August, outpacing a forecast for 0.1% advance. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core consumer prices climbed 0.3%. Consumer inflation is firming (as is producer price inflation) and there is some data-based rationalization in the core CPI rate for the Fed to raise the fed funds rate. Both central banks are eyeing divergent directions for their respective monetary policies, when their policy-setting committees separately convene Sept. 20-21. Their actions, or simply their commentary, could influence their currencies and dollar-priced assets like metals. Separately, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey for September was unchanged from the final August reading, holding at 89.8. and that negotiations were only just beginning. Crudde oil futures settled at lows last seen more than a month ago on Friday, 16 September 2016, suffering a sharp loss for the week as traders braced for an expected increase in oil exports from Libya and Nigeria. October West Texas Intermediate crude fell 88 cents, or 2%, to settle at $43.03 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. November Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange fell 82 cents, or 1.8%, to $45.77 a barrel. That was its lowest finish month to date. It fell about 4.7% for the week. Nigeria and Libya are both preparing to ramp up their oil exports. Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil have both lifted force majeure on Nigerian exports after militants had caused the shut-in of supply. Libya's state oil company also lifted curbs on sales from three ports on Wednesday. The news on the two OPEC producers come just over a week ahead of an informal meeting of major oil producers on the sidelines of an energy forum in Algeria set for Sept. 26-28. Bullion prices ended lower ar Comex on Friday, 16 September 2016. Gold futures finished at their lowest level in almost three months on Friday, logging a seventh drop in eight sessions to finish the week with a nearly 2% loss as the U.S. dollar climbed sharply in the run up to key central bank policy meetings next week.A report on inflation muddied the short-term fate for U.S. interest rates ahead of separate meetings of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan. Attention was fixed on inflation data and any implications it has for Fed decision-making. Quadruple witching, when certain futures and options expire at the same time, added volatility to the trading session, prompting prices to end closer to the day's lows. December gold fell $7.80, or 0.6%, to $1,310.20 an ounce. Prices saw the lowest settlement since June 23 and lost 1.8% for the week. December silver also fell by 17.9 cents, or 0.9%, to $18.862 an ounce, down around 2.6% for the week. Treasuries ended on a mixed note with the short end of the curve demonstrating relative weakness. The yield on the 2-yr note rose four basis points to 0.77% while the yield on the 10-yr note finished flat at 1.69%. The spread between the 2-yr and 10-yr note expanded to 92 basis points from 89 basis points last Friday. Today's participation was above the recent average as more than two billion shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Friday's participation was above the recent average as more than two billion shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Monday's economic data will be limited to the NAHB Housing Market Index (consensus 59), which will cross the wires at 10:00 ET.

Photo: AFP Singapore/Tokyo: Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple Inc. Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, including phone chief D.J. Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalize on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On 2 September, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Samsung drew criticism for the recall too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signalling consumers could keep using the phones. “This is creating an enormous problem for the company—for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem,” said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode “humiliating”. The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y. Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers who wanted the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and last year it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. With chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman G.S. Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus—and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was 3 August this year, compared with 13 August last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster and handle more features. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI Co., a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20% owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time around, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T Inc. in the US and Telstra Corp. in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on 1 September, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologized to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the US. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery explodes. The chairman of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology Ltd, a unit of Japan’s TDK Corp., according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement, without identifying the supplier. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement program is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor Corp., and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organize such programs. In the US for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around 28 September it has yet to specify when global sales would resume. The tumult has raised questions about whether Samsung’s current management approach is sufficiently robust to handle the crisis fallout. In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore.

Image Source: Ars Technica Dell subsidiary Alienware claims that virtual reality (VR) laptops will soon compete with established video game consoles like the Nintendo Wii U. The computer hardware company launched its VR-ready Alienware 17, 15, and 13 laptops at the Tokyo Game Show 2016. Even though VR rigs like these are still relatively expensive, Alienware global marketing director Joe Olmsted thinks its mobility aspect will allow them to become the new home entertainment device. The new Alienware laptops have VR capability thanks to NVIDIA’s GTX 10-Series graphics, but they are only another step in a major scheme. Olmsted claims the next-generation VR-ready Alienware notebook coupled with the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift will be the future of gaming. Olmsted considers the GTX 10-Series as the biggest performance jump he’s ever seen on laptops. It easily surpasses Alienware’s previous effort, the Alpha R2 mini PC powered by the older GTX 960. Alienware’s gaming PCs and laptops aim to compete with consoles Founded in 1996 to develop and sell gaming PCs and laptops, Alienware was bought by Dell in March 2006. The new subsidiary became Dell’s premier gaming brand in 2008, and it released the M17x laptop, the first Alienware/Dell system, in 2009. In 2014, Alienware announced that it would release a series of Windows OS-based video game consoles to compete with Sony’s PlayStation, the Nintendo Wii U, and Microsoft’s Xbox One. The first version, the Alpha, runs Windows 8.1 and allows to play PC games. Alienware Unveiled A Host Of Updated Products At E3, Showoff VR Backpack. Image Source: Mike Shouts At E3 2016, Alienware unveiled the Alpha R2 with sixth generation Intel processors and NVIDIA GeForce 960 graphics card. It runs Windows 10 and supports Alienware’s proprietary Graphics Amplifier. Alienware 17, 15, and 13 laptops before the next-gen gaming notebook The next stage ahead of the next-gen gaming laptop, which apparently Olmsted is already using, are Alienware’s 17, 15, and 13 laptops. The thinner lineup comes equipped with VR and the latest NVIDIA laptop cards. Alienware’s big-screen 17 sports the top-end NVIDIA GTX 1080 chip, while the Alienware 15 and 13 champion the GTX 1070 and 1060, respectively. All three models support the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets. The new laptops feature sixth-generation Intel Core i7 CPUs instead of the next-gen Kaby Lake. However, the flagship 17-inch version will get a K series Intel processor. The 15- and 17-inch models have 1080p IPS screens, 2667 MHz DDR4 RAM, TactX keyboards, and can support up to 10 keys at once. Although Dell hasn’t revealed pricing yet, release dates for the trio are already known. The 15- and 17-inch models will hit US stores on September 30th, while the 13-inch will be made available sometime in November.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Samsung exploding battery crisis began with rush to beat iPhone 2016-09-19 07:21 - Yoolim Lee and Min Jeong Lee Post a comment 0 share: Samsung's Note 7 has experienced exploding battery problems. (Ariel Gonzalez / YouTube) RELATED ARTICLES US recalls one million Samsung Note 7 phones How ‘better, faster’ batteries backfired for Samsung PICS: Samsung's new 360 camera heads to SA Singapore - Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple. Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung Electronics, including phone chief DJ Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalise on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On September 2, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Samsung drew criticism for the recall too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signalling consumers could keep using the phones. "This is creating an enormous problem for the company - for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem," said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode "humiliating." The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairperson of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since.

Samsung, which may pay as much as $2bn for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML Holding, Seagate Technology, Rambus and Sharp for a total value of about 1 trillion won ($891m). While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around September 28, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume.

Samsung Exploding Battery Crisis Began With Rush to Beat iPhone Bloomberg 19/09/2016 Yoolim Lee and Min Jeong Lee © Yoolim Lee and Min Jeong Lee BC-SAMSUNG-CRISIS (Bloomberg) -- Few things motivate Samsung employees like the opportunity to take advantage of weakness at Apple Inc. Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung Electronics Co., including phone chief D.J. Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalize on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On Sept. 2, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Samsung drew criticism for the recall too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signaling consumers could keep using the phones. "This is creating an enormous problem for the company -- for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem," said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. © Yoolim Lee and Min Jeong Lee BC-SAMSUNG-CRISIS The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode "humiliating." The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y. Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy S and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers seeking the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. With Chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman G.S. Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus -- and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was Aug. 3 this year, compared with Aug. 13 last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI Co., a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20 percent owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T Inc. in the U.S. and Telstra Corp. in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on Sept. 1, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologized to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the U.S. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery to explode.  The chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology Ltd., a unit of Japan’s TDK Corp., according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement program is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor Corp., and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organize such programs. In the U.S. for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. Samsung, which may pay as much as $2 billion for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML Holding NV, Seagate Technology Plc, Rambus Inc. and Sharp Corp. for a total value of about 1 trillion won ($891 million). While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around Sept. 28, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume. The tumult has raised questions about whether Samsung’s current management approach is sufficiently robust to handle the crisis fallout. In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, Chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore. --With assistance from Sohee Kim Mark Gurman Adam Satariano Jing Cao and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier To contact the reporters on this story: Yoolim Lee in Singapore at yoolim@bloomberg.net, Min Jeong Lee in Tokyo at mlee754@bloomberg.net.

If you’ve been following eSports, it’s easy enough to see that there’s quite a bit of gain to be had when considering a professional career in gaming and its competitions. Such is the goal of Splyce, a top European Call of Duty team and Call of Duty World Championship 2016 runner-up. In a report by ESPN, we learn of the roster changes that Splyce has made to its players. We see that Splyce has chosen to remove slayers Rhys “Rated” Price and Joseph “Joee” Pinnington. Slayers play a specific role in combat, bringing up the gun skill of the team. They fill multiple roles, fitting in where need be to help ensure victory. With Rated and Joee removed from place, Splyce has opted to pick up Joshua-Lee “Joshh” Sheppard. Interestingly enough, Joshh had been released from Splyce only days prior. Additionally, former Millenium slayer Jordan “Jurd” Crowley has joined the team. BREAKING – Splyce pickup @MadCat as new fourth. Full team info – https://t.co/by7rrg40xp — Dexerto Intel (@DexertoIntel) September 18, 2016 Squad member Ben “Bance” Bance will retain his position. Bance weighs in on the roster change, crediting his decision to remove Joshh out of impulse decision-making. “It was an on-the-spot decision, straight away, without having any kind of thought process into it, so we dropped him,” Bance stated. “But after thinking about it, I wanted to pick Joshh back up. The whole reason is because me and Joshh have teamed for the whole of the year and we have had success in three different rosters. Me and him, more or less, just bounce off each other really well so I don’t really want to leave him when I’ve had so much success with him.” It makes sense that Splyce’s Bance would want to keep the team synergy, though Splyce wasn’t quite successful in taking 1st place in Los Angeles. He continued to weigh in on the team, specifically how they performed in the championship setting. “Obviously second is good in everyone’s eyes, but that was a short-term team,” the Pro player says. “If we thought about long-term, going into the next game (Infinite Warfare) and trying to learn a game where some people don’t agree with others and where some people don’t enjoy each other’s company, it would made the team morale low and no one would’ve wanted to play Call of Duty.” Team EnVyUs defeat Splyce 3-1, win Call of Duty World Championship https://t.co/r3fdFqlaCV #TeamReZolve #GetReZolved — Team ReZolve (@TeamReZolve) September 5, 2016 The chemistry between player and team is critical to victory. Bance proves this with dominating the World Championship 2016. According to a report by Redbull, Bance was the MVP who performed exceptionally well during games. Bance had this to say about Jurd’s addition to the team. “They’ve both had success in the past from Ghosts and other titles and [Jurd] is arguably the best player in Europe,” Bance begins. “He brings the slaying power that we need.” Of course, eSports requires a great teamwork to dominate other groups that are as much a threat as Splyce. Millenium, FaZe Clan, FAB Games Esports, and Team eLevate are among the notable teams that Splyce had to contend with in the past. Will Bance have as much success with the new roster as he would hope? He seems to believe that it could only get better. Splyce is currently seeking a fourth, hanging on the hopes that the competition will only grow more fierce in later matches. “Team change was necessary and hopefully with the right fourth, we can beat the expectations of what people think now, because they’re thinking we can’t get a better team than World Championship. But I feel like we can.” What do you think of Team Splyce? Do you believe that Bance made the right choice in changing the roster? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

Some of virtual reality’s potential as a meeting and collaboration tool is suggested in a video recently recorded at the NYU Media Research Lab. In the video, lab researchers strap on Samsung Gear VR headsets with antler-like sensors attached to the goggles. The headsets usher the researchers into a virtual-reality environment in which they see digital avatars of themselves moving around a simulated environment. Soon, using hand-held electronic wands, the researchers are drawing 3-D models together. Ken Perlin, a computer-science professor at New York University and director of the research lab, has been studying collaboration in the virtual world for the past two years, attempting to understand how virtual reality might change society—including the workplace.

The New Fashion Mantra: Comfort People Are Happy to Pay for Music. If It’s Live Take Our Quiz on the Gambling Business “Of course we’re going to embrace any technology that makes us feel more connected,” Prof. Perlin says. A global survey of attitudes toward technology in the workplace suggests he may be right. The survey, in a report from Dell Inc., Intel Corp. and consultants Penn Schoen Berland, found that 57% of employees around the world prefer face-to-face conversations with colleagues. But more than half said that better communications technology could make such interactions obsolete in the future. Millennials particularly were open to using virtual- and augmented-reality products at work, with 77% saying they would try it. Jeremy Bailenson, the founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, says business calls using virtual-reality technology can offer many benefits over videoconferencing. “VR meetings will allow for nuanced nonverbal communication—proper eye contact, subtle cues such as interpersonal distance, and eventually virtual touch and smell (when desired),” Prof. Bailenson writes in a recent email. For most companies investing in the medium, virtual-reality meetings are still experimental. Employees from the Bank of Ireland and National Grid PLC, the British utility, have tweeted about their early sampling of virtual-reality meeting software. Mike Harlick, head of the Bank of Ireland Worklab, said to him it felt like “the future of collaboration.” Mr. Harlick told The Wall Street Journal that his firm has been experimenting with several virtual conferencing centers. He said he doesn’t see virtual reality replacing video calls, but that it provides functions that other office collaboration tools do not offer. He said he thinks it will help his team be more effective in how they communicate. “In the context of office meetings you now have a whole virtual environment where you can co-create and interact,” he wrote in an email. “So you may have white boards on one wall, a shared document on another.” The National Grid employee who tweeted, David Goldsby, said a team he presented to was “seriously impressed” by the technology. However, he said the Wi-Fi in their hotel presented challenges. The company didn't respond to a request for comment. Still, for many companies, experts say virtual-reality meetings may offer real improvements over the typical videoconference experience. Some of the earliest adopters are in videogaming and the virtual-reality industry itself. Neil Glenister, founder of a London-based gaming company called 232 Studios, says his team has typically conducted lengthy weekly group meetings on Skype. But the team, he says, is tired of videoconferencing. It doesn’t make them feel as if they are in the same room, he says, and they have trouble seeing each other’s hand gestures. Instead, Mr. Glenister and his team recently tried an app called vTime, which allows people to meet in virtual environments using avatars. From a menu of possible settings, Mr. Glenister and his employees chose to meet in a simulation of outer space. At times, he says, they struggled to focus on work-related topics because they were distracted by the planets surrounding them. Still, he says, “that sense of presence was really good. The dynamics of the calls through Skype weren’t as friendly.” Skype, which is owned by Microsoft Corp., didn’t say if it has developed a virtual-reality application, but a spokesman says the company is testing the waters in augmented reality, a close cousin of virtual reality in which a viewer sees digital images imposed over real-world environments. Skype says it has developed an application for the HoloLens, Microsoft’s augmented-reality device that is currently only available to developers. Eye contact Something else that virtual reality provides that video calls typically don’t: eye contact. Though they’re looking through their avatars’ eyes, participants in a virtual-reality meeting get the feeling they are making eye contact, says Eric Romo, chief executive of AltspaceVR Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., company that designs environments for virtual-reality meetings using avatars. Some virtual-reality companies are experimenting with eye-tracking technology that would allow the goggles to better track users’ eye movements and convey even more realistic eye contact. In a typical video call, by contrast, a participant may think he or she is making eye contact, but to the other person they appear to be looking down. Instead of looking directly at each other’s image, you have to look into the camera for the other person to get the feeling you are looking into their eyes. Other kinds of physical cues missing from most telecommunication may be incorporated into virtual-reality calls as well. While arms are frequently out of sight in video chats when people are sitting close to the camera, some virtual-reality headsets are able to capture arm and hand gestures that are then imitated by an avatar. Participants can get visual insights into group dynamics, as well, such as how close certain avatars stand to one another. “There are all these nonverbal cues we have physically that we don’t have in [most] communication technologies except for VR,” Mr. Romo says. One of the biggest challenges today for companies creating meeting spaces in virtual reality is to make avatars that realistically capture and instantly reflect the users’ emotions. Some companies are putting transitional technologies, like emojis, into their virtual environments. But companies are experimenting with technologies that would allow avatars to capture facial expressions. Fine movements Another hurdle that technologists are addressing is capturing fine movements. With hand controllers, avatars can imitate simple gestures, like waving a hand. Researchers and businesses are pushing to capture finger movements. Other impediments remain as well. Even if a person or a business invests in the equipment needed to hold a virtual-reality meeting, the equipment is still relatively rare. Others have to invest as well for meetings to be possible. Early headsets that use mobile phones also have very limited battery life, connectivity issues and can overheat. If virtual-reality meetings do catch on, researchers are at odds over whether they will dramatically change the amount of business that people conduct in person. Prof. Bailenson says he believes that adoption of virtual-reality meetings will result in a major decline in commuting. Prof. Perlin, meanwhile, says the impact of virtual-reality meetings will be similar to other communication technologies that have come before. “I think it’s important also to keep in mind when you look at historical trends, the more we’ve embraced new kinds of telecommunication media, things like Skype, the more we’ve traveled,” he says. “The more we feel connected to people, the more we want to physically be together.” Ms. Zakrzewski is a reporter in The Wall Street Journal’s San Francisco bureau.

Earlier this year, managers at the South Korean company began hearing the next iPhone wouldn’t have any eye-popping innovations. The device would look just like the previous two models too. It sounded like a potential opening for Samsung to leap ahead. So the top brass at Samsung Electronics Co, including phone chief DJ Koh, decided to accelerate the launch of a new phone they were confident would dazzle consumers and capitalise on the opportunity, according to people familiar with the matter. They pushed suppliers to meet tighter deadlines, despite loads of new features, another person with direct knowledge said. The Note 7 would have a high-resolution screen that wraps around the edges, iris-recognition security and a more powerful, faster-charging battery. Apple’s taunts that Samsung was a copycat would be silenced for good. Then it all backfired. Just days after Samsung introduced the Note 7 in August, reports surfaced online that the phone’s batteries were bursting into flame. By the end of the month, there were dozens of fires and Samsung was rushing to understand what went wrong. On Sept 2, Koh held a grim press conference in Seoul where he announced Samsung would replace all 2.5 million phones shipped so far. What was supposed to be triumph had turned into a fiasco. Samsung drew criticism for the recall too. It announced the plans publicly before working out how millions of consumers in 10 countries would actually get replacements. Then it sent mixed signals about what customers should do. First, Samsung told people to shut off their phones and stop using them. A few days later, it offered a software patch to prevent batteries from overheating, signaling consumers could keep using the phones. “This is creating an enormous problem for the company — for its reputation and ability to support its customers when there’s a problem,” said David Yoffie, a management professor at Harvard Business School and board member at Intel Corp. Samsung declined to comment specifically on whether it moved up the Note 7 launch because of its perception of the iPhone. “Timing of any new mobile product launch is determined by the Mobile business division based on the proper completion of the development process and the readiness of the product for the market,” the company said in a statement. The misstep has set off soul-searching at the Samsung conglomerate and in South Korea, where the company employs hundreds of thousands and is revered for leading the nation’s rise since the Korean War. Samsung’s flagship electronics unit built its reputation on high-quality products and cutting-edge technology, becoming the largest phone maker in the world and a powerful rival to Apple in innovation. One employee, in an online discussion group, called the episode “humiliating.” The crisis is straining a management team that’s been without clear leadership for more than two years. Lee Kun-Hee, the Samsung patriarch who is chairman of both the electronics unit and the broader conglomerate, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and hasn’t been back to the business since. His son, Jay Y Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers who wanted the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and last year it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. With Chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman GS Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus — and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was Aug 3 this year, compared with Aug 13 last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster and handle more features. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3,500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3,000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2,900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI Co, a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20 per cent owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time around, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T Inc in the US and Telstra Corp in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on Sept 1, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologised to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the US. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery explodes. The chairman of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology Ltd, a unit of Japan’s TDK Corp, according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement, without identifying the supplier. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement programme is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor Corp, and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organise such programmes. In the US for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around Sept 28 it has yet to specify when global sales would resume. The tumult has raised questions about whether Samsung’s current management approach is sufficiently robust to handle the crisis fallout. In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, Chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election How Twitter, Instagram and Facebook are stepping up measures to fight online abuse (VIDEO) Pushing the limits of science at the first Cyborg Olympics (VIDEO) Soar above the planet’s most spectacular sights with Google Earth VR (VIDEO) Twitter CEO apologises for allowing white supremacist ad Sony’s PS3 celebrates 10-year anniversary WhatsApp joins rivals from Snapchat to WeChat in video calls Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Tinder launches transgender-inclusive update, allowing users to select personalised gender identity (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Samsung apologises for Galaxy Note phones in US ads Samsung third-quarter profit drops amid Note 7 phone crisis Samsung’s prestige takes another hit over lawsuit Galaxy Note 7 recall dismays S.

Samsung Electronics saw its chip sales reach US$9.45 billion in the April-June period to account for 11.3 percent of the global chip market, while Intel's shipments stood at $12.27 billion with a 14.7 percent market share, according to the data compiled by industry tracker IHS. While the gap between the two stood at 5.3 percentage points in 2012, it gradually narrowed to 4.2 percentage points in 2013 and 3.2 percentage points in 2015. IHS said the narrowed gap in the second quarter resulted from a surge in Samsung's sales of NAND flash memory products that are widely used in smartphones and laptops. U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Ltd. followed with 4.6 percent and 4.3 percent market shares, respectively. Samsung's smaller local rival SK hynix Inc. took the 5th spot with a 4 percent market share. khj@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

His son, Jay Y. Lee, is heir apparent, but hasn’t taken his father’s title because Korean culture precludes such a move while the elder Lee is alive. The result is that no one appears to have the kind of authority that, say, Tim Cook wields at Apple to take responsibility and hammer out solutions. “The battery issue arrived at the worst moment for Samsung and it seems like there was a delay in reacting to this communication crisis,” said Thomas Husson, an analyst at Forrester Research. “This may indeed be due to the change in top management.” Samsung said in the statement that its focus now is on doing the right thing for customers and that it is working to replace the Note 7s as quickly as possible. “For us at Samsung, to earn consumers’ trust back is very important.” For a Gadfly column on Samsung’s strategic challenges, click here. The roots of the battery crisis can be traced back more than a year, when Samsung was contemplating what features to include in new phones. The Korean company has two primary lines of premium devices, the Galaxy S and the larger Note. When the Note was first unveiled in 2011, it was panned by some critics, who mocked its massive screen. But it was a surprise hit with customers seeking the added real estate to watch videos, play games and browse the web. Samsung pretty much had the high end of the oversized smartphone market to itself until Apple followed with its larger iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Plus’s debut put pressure on Samsung to defend its turf and it moved up the 2015 introduction of the new Note from September to August, just weeks before Apple unveiled the iPhone 6s. Samsung’s engineers met the deadline, but Apple still grabbed a chunk of market share. In December, the chief of Samsung’s mobile division was replaced. The 55-year-old Koh, a company veteran who had managed development of several Galaxy phones, took his place on the hot seat. Koh faced not just intensifying competition with Apple but slower growth as the whole smartphone market became saturated. When Samsung became aware that Apple didn’t plan any major design changes, the Korean executives saw an opportunity. After a select group of top managers got their hands on early versions of the Note, they gushed over the upgrades and praised each other’s work, according to one of the people. If Apple wasn’t going to offer consumers anything exciting, Samsung certainly would. With Chairman Lee in the hospital, the younger Lee and co-vice chairman G.S. Choi huddled with Koh and executives of other Samsung affiliates, which make semiconductors, glass panels and batteries. They went ahead with a slew of new features that had been on the company’s product road map, including an improved screen and stylus -- and then approved a launch date 10 days earlier than last year, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Samsung’s unveiling was Aug. 3 this year, compared with Aug. 13 last year. The battery is a critical component. Smartphone makers have been pushing the boundaries of the technology for years as they try to satisfy consumer demands for long-lasting devices that charge faster. That increases manufacturing challenges and raises the risks of defects. Samsung opted to give the Note 7 a 3500 milliampere hour battery compared with 3000 mAh for the previous model. For comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus has a 2900 mAh battery. The main battery supplier for the Note 7 was Samsung SDI Co., a person with knowledge of the matter has said. The company, founded in 1970 and 20 percent owned by Samsung Electronics, makes batteries for other phone-makers too, including Apple. The Galaxy Note 7 Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg As the launch date approached, employees at Samsung and suppliers stretched their work hours and made do with less sleep. Though it’s not unusual to have a scramble, suppliers were under more pressure than usual this time around and were pushed harder than by other customers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. One supplier said it was particularly challenging to work with Samsung employees this time, as they repeatedly changed their minds about specs and work flow. Some Samsung workers began sleeping in the office to avoid time lost in commuting, the supplier said. Samsung declined to comment on whether deadlines were moved, reiterating that products are only introduced after proper testing. Still, by August, it looked like Samsung had made it. The company shipped early models of the Note 7 to wireless operators around the world, including AT&T Inc. in the U.S. and Telstra Corp. in Australia. An executive at one carrier said his team started testing the device in May and had the typical amount of time to check its capabilities. They focused on antenna performance and data speeds and didn’t uncover the battery problem, the executive said. But when customers started using the phones, the fires began. The first signs of trouble emerged online, as they’re wont to do in this age of social media. Photos and videos of charred phones were posted on the web. “Hey YouTube,” said one man, as he described how his phone had burst into flame and showed off the blackened remains. “Be careful out there. Everyone rockin’ the new Note 7, it might catch fire y’all.” Executives at Samsung headquarters in Suwon were in shock. Choi, the co-vice chairman, gathered senior managers, demanding to know what went wrong, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The phone division pointed fingers at battery maker Samsung SDI, while managers there argued the problem could be elsewhere, including in the phone design or insulation. Samsung said there is no ongoing debate on the issue and that the phone unit has taken responsibility. Samsung’s top managers knew they needed to move fast. Internally, there was a debate about whether to do a full-blown recall or to take less dramatic steps, like a battery replacement program. Then on Sept. 1, an engineer wrote on the company’s internal online bulletin board. “Please recall all Note7s and exchange them with new ones. I don’t have to get my PS,” he said, referring to his profit sharing, or bonus. “It’s humiliating.” The post prompted many impassioned responses, mostly in support of the idea. Another worker said Samsung had trained everyone at the company to make no compromises with customers and the company needed a recall to live up to that standard. Then Koh himself weighed in. He apologized to employees and said he would consider their input in taking the appropriate steps. The next day, Koh went public with the full recall. For details of the U.S. recall, click here. Samsung engineers rushed to determine the cause of the problem, working through the Harvest Festival holiday last week. The company’s most complete explanations so far have come in reports to government agencies in Korea, China and the U.S. The initial conclusions indicated an error in production that put pressure on plates within the battery cells. That in turn brought negative and positive poles into contact, triggering excessive heat that caused the battery to explode. The chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was more explicit when his agency announced an official recall on Thursday. He said the phone’s battery was slightly too big for its compartment and the tight space pinched the battery, causing a short circuit. “Clearly, they missed something,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They were rushing to beat Apple and they made a mistake.” As it investigates, Samsung has stopped buying batteries for the Note 7 from the SDI affiliate. It shifted purchases to Amperex Technology Ltd., a unit of Japan’s TDK Corp., according to local media reports. “After extensive testing and as reported to multiple regulatory agencies, this issue is isolated to the battery cell from one supplier only,” the company said in its statement. “All replacement Galaxy Note 7 devices will have batteries from other suppliers.” A spokesman for Samsung SDI said the company’s stance on the recall is in line with what’s been previously announced by Samsung’s mobile unit and declined to elaborate. The replacement program is prompting more reflection. The fast response was driven by good intentions. Samsung managers have studied past product recalls, including those at Toyota Motor Corp., and the conclusion seemed clear: Move quickly and dramatically. But Samsung moved so fast it got ahead of regulators who help organize such programs. In the U.S. for example, companies are supposed to notify the Consumer Product Safety Commission within 24 hours of uncovering problems. Instead, Samsung went public on its own and consumers didn’t have clear guidance on how to exchange their phones. “The official recall process provides a lot of clarity to consumers and there’s someone checking to make sure the fix is a good one that serves the consumers in terms of safety,” said Jerry Beilinson, a technology editor at Consumer Reports. Samsung, which may pay as much as $2 billion for the recall, said on Sunday it sold stakes in ASML Holding NV, Seagate Technology Plc, Rambus Inc. and Sharp Corp. for a total value of about 1 trillion won ($891 million). While Samsung says Galaxy Note 7 sales will resume in Korea around Sept. 28, it has yet to specify when global sales would resume.

In the wake of the recall, Samsung said it had nominated the younger Lee to join the company’s nine-member board, a move that will give him a more active, and legitimate, role across its businesses. However, the younger Lee, who has kept a low profile inside and outside the company, is still far from having the kind of direct authority his father had. In addition to the corporate strategy office that oversees about 60 Samsung companies, Samsung Electronics has three CEOs. “This is a crisis and a blow to Samsung’s image,” said Kim Sang Jo, economics professor at Hansung University in Seoul. “Clearly there were procedural missteps and the company will have to restore consumer and investor confidence.” Apple’s iPhone 7 also wasn’t as uninspiring as Samsung may have anticipated. Though it kept the same physical design with modest technology changes, loyalists still lined up at stores around the world on Friday to get the company’s latest gadget. Twenty years ago, in a chapter of Samsung Group history that employees can recite by heart, Chairman Lee grew so frustrated by faulty mobile phones that he piled up thousands of the devices and lit the whole heap ablaze. Never compromise on quality, he exhorted the workers watching, putting Samsung on course to become the top seller of mobile phones in the world. Today, Samsung phones are ablaze once again, only this time the flames threaten the company’s hard-won image. “The potential damage to reputation is far greater than short-term financial losses,” said Chang Sea Jin, a professor at National University of Singapore.

(A24) Share Written by Olivia Goldhill Obsession Machines with Brains September 18, 2016 When you talk to an AI chatbot, who do you think writes those professional, peppy responses? There’s certainly an algorithm behind the scenes, but humans put together those phrases. Tech companies are creating teams of writers, including playwrights, poets, and novelists, to help write lines that don’t sound like they came from a machine. The work can range from creating a consistent character for a chatbot, to inspiring an immersive virtual reality. Jonathan Foster, manager for Cortana’s editorial team at Microsoft, heads a team of 22 writers around the world who help give Cortana, Microsoft’s personal assistant, a consistent voice. Foster has worked as a film and TV screenwriter in Hollywood (and continues to write screenplays on the side), but he says he’s fascinated by the immersive challenge of writing for tech. He and his team have a detailed set of principles that define Cortana’s character and work to make sure the dialog reflects her voice. “She isn’t a chatty teenager, she’s a professional assistant,” he says. And so Cortana is positive without being naïve or chipper, and steers clear of dark humor. “The nuance of what a writer can do sometimes looks a lot easier than it actually is,” says Foster. “Conversation seems simple because we do it every day but when you have to write it in a logical way that doesn’t feel broken, it takes a new kind of expertise that’s just burgeoning.” Foster’s writers include poets, playwrights, novelists, and the author of children’s books. They don’t try to convince users that Cortana is human, and in fact make very clear that she’s artificial. When it comes to difficult and divisive questions, such as the election, Foster’s team avoids alienating users and has Cortana instead suggest that such topics are best left for human discussion. In other areas, Cortana has firm views. Foster says his team changed its position on Cortana’s favorite film, for example. “We used to do a more pervasive ‘I don’t have an opinion about that.’ But when we saw people were asking, we realized they really want to know what her favorite movie is,” he says. And so the team picked Star Trek, which aligns with her science fiction personality. Writing for tech companies can be more involved than composing a script for a chatbot. Nathan Phillips, playwright and co-founder of a creative agency in New York, has worked for Intel and as a collaborator on the Google Creative Lab, among other tech projects. His projects include a mixed reality experience for Intel, where fish (including turtle that measured time and a whale that lit up when it found the strongest wifi signal) would eat the 3G and wifi waves that surround us, making them visible as they consumed them. He’s also worked on an interactive billboard, and an interactive documentary that creates a film about the viewer based on responses to questions. Though Phillips understands tech fairly well, he refuses to talk about it when building the projects. “There has to be someone who adamantly refuses to talk about how it works but instead talks about what it is,’ he says. The biggest difference in writing for VR rather than a play, for example, is that the writer is making the user the protagonist rather than trying to show the actions of the protagonist. Otherwise, Phillips believes the central concept is the most important element, and it’s just a matter of how it’s expressed. “There’s no such thing as a VR idea or a book idea,” he says. “There’s an idea that requires you use VR to convey it, or idea that requires you have a book to convey it. Think about how many incredible stories have been lost because someone was like ‘I write books.’ When you stop focusing on how it works and start focusing on what it is, you can push into a realm of idea-focused innovation.” Both Phillips and Foster note that writing for tech can have a significant impact. Users have an emotional response when they talk to AI, says Foster. Writers are shaping the layer technological information that exists everywhere and is largely invisible. Philips says messaging applications such as WhatsApp will get smarter, will know more about you and how to respond. “As a writer, that’s something that is and will be very much part of my job,” he says. “Figuring out what those voices are, what type of personality they have, should they feel like machines.” Writers will also have to help users feel comfortable using this technology, and give them agency as they move “from VR to AR to MR to talking to a human or an enhanced human.” Storytelling have existed for millennia, says Phillips, but thanks partly to such phenomena as reality TV, the film equipment inside our phones, and the rise of virtual reality, the line between fiction and reality is blurring. “If you get rid of the writer, all you have is the technology,” he says. “You have no one taking advantage of the fact that reality is over.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

News Rumor: Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Xbox One Beta Release Date Revealed Share Tweet by Damian Seeto on September 18, 2016 The release date for the Xbox One beta of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare may have been leaked thanks to the Microsoft Store. It’s only a few days after the PS4 gets it. As reported by Charlie Intel, the Microsoft Store briefly showed the release date for the beta on Xbox One. They posted: “Beta starts October 21, 2016 on Xbox One. Availability and launch date(s) subject to change. See www.callofduty.com/beta for more details. Minimum Beta duration is 3 days.” The information about the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare beta release date has now been removed from the Microsoft Store. Activision has yet to officially announce the beta dates for PC and Xbox One owners so this is why this is being posted as a rumor for now. For PS4 owners, the beta starts on October 14th. You have to pre-order the game either digitally or physically at a retail store in order to gain access to it. An October 21st date seems feasible since a beta will need to be done before the full game comes out on November 4th, 2016.

HDCP 2.x is in many ways different from HDCP 1.x, and likely to cause as many interoperability issues as its older brother did – unless system designers understand a few key points. The formats are not compatible, but awareness of the differences and similarities, along with the relationship to HDMI 2 and 4K, will help you ensure seamless end-to-end support for old and new HDCP material in all your installations. 1 THE SOURCE MAKES ALL DECISIONS It is important to understand this first, and it makes good sense when you think about it. The source is the gatekeeper of the content, whether that content is delivered via the internet or a spinning plastic disc. The source knows the demands of the content itself, and implements those demands by enabling HDCP protection or not. 2 HDCP 1.X AND HDCP 2.X ARE NOT COMPATIBLE Not compatible? It’s okay. There’s no real problem with that. A year ago, the source’s decision was simple: to enable HDCP or not. But in the past year or so, a new version of HDCP has entered the world. (Note: the latest versions of the two major HDCP revisions are HDCP 1.4 and HDCP 2.2. The minor differences in the sub-version number – e.g. HDCP 1.2 vs 1.4, or HDCP 2.0 vs 2.2 – are not critical to understand. Therefore, I use the shorthand “HDCP 1.x” and “HDCP 2.x” to refer to the two major versions that now coexist in the market. In fact, practically all real products use versions 1.4 and 2.2 exclusively.) HDCP 2.x is a complete re-write of the HDCP specification, with no backward compatibility. That sounds terrible, but in fact it’s not a big problem. There are no HDMI transceiver chips that provide HDCP 2.x without support also for HDCP 1.x. Both systems are included on the same chip. This means the products you encounter that support HDCP 2.x will also support HDCP 1.x. 3 HDCP 2.X OFFERS MUCH STRONGER ENCRYPTION A major component of any content protection scheme is its encryption. HDCP 1.x used a custom-built scheme designed to be simple and cheap to implement. This may be why HDCP 1.x was “cracked” in 2010. In September of that year, Intel (the creator of HDCP) confirmed that a master key had been made public. This key makes it possible to generate valid decryption keys and totally defeat HDCP 1.x protection. A key upgrade to HDCP 2.x is the use of AES-128 encryption. This is the same encryption used for secure government and business communication all over the world. If AES- 128 is broken, we’ll have bigger problems than a few pirated movies! 4 THERE ARE NO TECHNICAL LINKS WITH HDMI 2.0 OR 4K This one is simple. There is nothing in the HDMI specification that says you have to use HDCP 2.x (or, for that matter, that you must use HDCP at all). And by extension, there is no technical rule or standard that says 4K content must be protected by HDCP 2.x. 5 THERE ARE DE FACTO LINKS Practically speaking, we will see all Hollywood 4K content demanding HDCP 2.x protection. HDCP 2.x was really invented by and for Hollywood, who felt that the protection offered by HDCP 1.x is not sufficient for their valuable 4K intellectual property. This is probably a reasonable position, considering the broken cryptography of HDCP 1.x. 6 EVERY SINGLE DEVICE IN THE CHAIN MUST COOPERATE Once a source has decided on the content protection required, the content goes out with the protection applied. Of course this means that the display device must support the same level of protection in order to decrypt the signal. But it also means that every piece of electronics in the chain – transmitters, receivers and switches – must support the content protection. If you have a source insisting on HDCP 2.x and a three year old HDMI switch that can only support HDCP 1.x, you get a dead end and a black screen. 7 SOME HDCP 2.X CONTENT CAN BE DOWNGRADED TO HDCP 1.X This again comes down to decision making by the source, driven by the content. The first 4K Blu-ray player to hit the market (by Samsung) will allow an image out with only HDCP 1.x protection. However, when it allows this, it forces the image to the scaled down to 1080p. Again, this is a demand of Hollywood – that their 4K content must be protected by HDCP 2.x. There is no guarantee that a source will behave this way, so it is certainly best to assume you will need HDCP 2.x gear everywhere. 8 HDCP 2.X IS ETHERNETFRIENDLY HDCP 2.x finally means that protected content (even HDCP 1.x) may be moved across an Ethernet network. Despite claims (and products!) from various manufacturers of video-over- IP gear, the HDCP 1.x specification is very clear about what can (and what cannot) be done with HDCP 1.x protected content. It cannot be transmitted across an Ethernet network without violating that specification. HDCP 2.x has introduced a new set of rules and techniques which finally do allow this. In fact, even HDCP 1.x content may be upgraded to HDCP 2.x, transmitted across the network according to HDCP 2.x rules, and then downgraded to HDCP 1.x content for output to a display at the far end. HDCP 2.x content may also be transmitted across Ethernet, but of course must still be protected by HDCP 2.x at the end.

Telecoms software outfit Brite:bill got a sum of around €70m from US competitor Amdocs. A few weeks before, Dublin chip designer Movidius agreed to an Intel bid estimated at over €300m. Both sales are (rightly) hailed as success stories for their founders and backers. But with both having shown such bright futures, selling up now leaves a question dangling about what might have been. Could Movidius have become a major multinational? Might Brite:bill have expanded into a software powerhouse? Or should we care that the desire to sell means we may never grow a Spotify, a Soundcloud or a Deliveroo? "It's a fair question," says Brian Caulfield, a partner in venture capital firm Draper Esprit, one of the successful investors in Movidius's recent exit. "But Ireland is a small country. And undercapitalisation is a problem." Caulfield says that tech firms funded from US sources have far more financial leeway to scale for longer because of bigger, more flexible funding rounds. He says that founders have mortgages to pay and families to feed. In a stricter funding environment than that available in other countries, a healthy takeover offer has significant appeal. "When you look at a company like Movidius, those guys have been on the road for 11 years, some of it quite hard. You can't really blame them." To be fair, Movidius is a strong case in favour of Caulfield's argument. In the semiconductor industry, there's no overnight hypergrowth as seen in the software industry. Sales channels are specialised without the flick-of-a-switch installation economics of other sectors. In this context, Intel offered Movidius a golden chance to develop its technology further while rewarding the company's founders and backers to the tune of €300m. Who would turn that down? (Not me). And yet there's still a nagging question that persists. Movidius had developed a ground-breaking chip that gives 'sight' and some intelligence to all sorts of machines and gadgets (including the latest drones). It was tipped to be Ireland's first 'unicorn' (a private company with a valuation of more than $1bn). Would it have become a flagbearer for Irish technology, renowned around the world? We'll never know. As strong and enabling as Intel's environment will undoubtedly be, the old giant will have its own rules and priorities for what Movidius may or may not develop in the future. To reiterate, the Movidius exit can not be characterised as anything but a success for all involved. And the company's founders are undoubtedly the right people to decide what was, and is, in the company's best interest going forward. The same is true for Brite:bill, which brilliantly targeted a billing niche in the telecoms industry. But if Movidius and Brite:bill were based in San Jose, Jerusalem or Berlin, would they have hung on to see how far they could take the company organically? Israel is a small country with a population only half as big as ours. It has 93 companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Some, such as the €9bn computer vision firm Mobileye, are world-beating players that remain headquartered in Israel with the majority of research happening there. Granted, the country's massive institutional spending on defence gives it a head start in engineering and tech spin-offs. But there is surely still as much risk for those start-ups on the issue of scaling and selling as there is for Irish ones. It should be added that Irish tech companies do sometimes break through. Fleetmatics raised around €100m when it floated in the US in 2012. This summer, the company was acquired for €2.15bn by Verizon. Maybe none of this really matters. Maybe what does matter is a higher number of companies coming through the ranks. This is unquestionably happening. But it would be exciting to have our very own Stripe sometime. Should we care that startups' desire to sell means we may never grow a Spotify, a Soundcloud or a Deliveroo?

REX Shutterstock. Augmented reality and virtual reality have long been one of the biggest technology opportunities in fashion, and it looks like the spring ’17 shows mark the season designers embraced VR en masse. London Fashion Week designers kicked off events using the technology in their shows. At Malone Souliers’ Sept. 18 presentation, the design team incorporated a green screen on the catwalk. The setup allowed guests to walk the runway and be filmed with a pretaped front row featuring designer Mary-Alice Malone and her managing director Roy Luwolt looking on. Related Designers Tap Virtual Reality Buzz For Retail, Fashion Week Similarly, retailer Lyst tapped an augmented reality audience with a new installation for London Fashion Week. Visitors to the setup could point a tablet at several nude models and virtually dress them. The interactive display was meant to show the power of AR when it comes to picking out clothes at home. “Fashion as an industry has been flirting with VR, but it hasn’t dived in yet,” Henry Stuart, co-founder and CEO of virtual-reality production company Visualize, told FN earlier this year. “There are such great applications for it: You can immerse someone in a beautiful world filled with these incredible aspirational things. In advertising, you can’t get a more captive audience than with virtual reality.” Besides being a cool branding experience, virtual reality has major potential for streamlining shopping and allowing people to truly make purchasing decisions online. Rebecca Minkoff has long been a fan of VR and tested out the technology a few seasons ago. For her Sept. 10 show at New York Fashion Week, Minkoff took her see-now, buy-now collection not just literally to the streets of Soho, but also streamed the show as a virtual reality video. The designer added an augmented reality element to the store allowing women to virtually “try on” the collection online and in store after it had literally walked the runway. “Our goal was really to strip away the stigma of the industry and give our consumers the ability to come and watch in person or see it live in VR 360. We’ve been breaking the rules our customer, and she likes it,” said Minkoff, the creative director and co-founder of her namesake label. At New York Fashion Week, Prabal Gurung and Band of Outsiders were among several labels selected to partner with Intel (NYFW’s official technology partner) to create shows that could be streamed with virtual reality app by VR production firm Voke and Samsung headset. The moves mark a major shift for brands that are looking to help ease the pain points of shopping online (such as deciding whether the silhouette of the shoes or dress you’re eyeing actually works for you and harnessing see-now, buy-now) and also helping to better engage shoppers who can’t make it to the glamorous events like fashion week.

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Sept. 19: PARAM-ISHAN, the super computer launched at IIT Guwahati today, is no less than the computing version of Superman. With an ability to solve 250 trillion maths problems in a second, the super computer was launched by Union human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar. The unit was built at the institute by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune. "It's a great moment for the people of Assam as it now has the fastest and most powerful computer in the eastern and southern regions," Javadekar said in his address after the launch here this afternoon. Gautam Biswas, the director of IIT Guwahati, told The Telegraph that the facility cost the institute nearly Rs 10 crore. "It will not only augment research initiatives in the institute but also help create an ecosystem for attracting talent in research," said Biswas. PARAM-ISHAN can be used in computational biology, chemistry, structural building, material structure, nano-block self- assemble and optimisation. The facility has a 300 terabyte (1 terabyte equals 1,000 gigabyte) storage unit, which has a magnitude of 250 teraflops. It consists of 162 computing nodes, including 130 central processing unit nodes, 16 graphic processing unit nodes of NVIDIA K40 and 19 instruction nodes or phi nodes of Intel Xeon, at the Computer and Communication Centre (CCC) of the institute. "The Northeast receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon, which leads to flooding and landslides. PARAM-ISHAN can be used for weather, climate modelling and seismic data processing," said S.V. Rao, the head of CCC. "India needs such research facilities in every institute so that no student needs to go abroad for education and research purposes," Javadekar said. The Union minister also took the opportunity to inform the students of the IIT Guwahati about two research scholarships launched by the government. "The central government, for the first time, has asked all the institutes in the country to give innovative ideas, and following our proposals, we received 2,000 ideas. We scanned and selected 400 such ideas to be funded by the government. The funding starts from Rs 20 lakh and rises up to Rs 20 crore for big ideas. A total of Rs 1,200 crore has been sanctioned for the project," Javadekar said. "From next year, under the Prime Minister's scholarship for the best of the best researchers, Rs 60,000 per month will be provided," he added.  More stories in North East The homeless pin hope on relief HC bins plea to stay eviction Court order should be reviewed: Gogoi Govt sets bonus deadline Tura film fest enthralls kids Abductor rumours stalk Dibrugarh Lawyers rally against bandhs LIC targets Rs 100-crore premium Meeting over ST status Funds for rural areas Tripura royal scion to join BJP Gogoi trains guns on Modi Act inconclusive: UDP BSNL awaits Centre nod Training on farming methods Shutdown total Award for 25 artistes of Manipur Sarma dismay at hospital condition    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

Global stock markets started the new trading week strongly Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, as investors appeared to put last week's jitters behind them as they awaited the outcome of the latest policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan later this week. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, said investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan's plans. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms," he said. "One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?" While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Tech Data says the deal will give it operations in 35 countries. Its stock rose $15.46, or 22.3 percent, to $84.80 and Avnet gained $2.68, or 6.8 percent, to $41.89. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Apple, which surged last week and reached its highest price this year, lost $1.34, or 1.2 percent, to $113.58 and Intel fell 51 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.16. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there was little evidence it worked. Its approval is based on a study of only 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. Health website operator WebMD slumped after it said CEO David Schlanger is leaving the company by mutual agreement. Schlanger is being replaced by President Steven Zatz, who is in charge of WebMD's advertising and sponsorship business. WebMD fell $2.95, or 5.7 percent, to $49.02 and it is down 27 percent since May 25. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to "Overweight" and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. » Next page...

Home Industries Financial Services Investing investing Volatility trade flames out as VIX-loving bears cash in on notes Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Monday, September 19, 2016 5:08 pm By Dani Burger Bloomberg News economic indicators Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index holds at lowest since April (Sept. 16, 2016) economic indicators Consumer prices in U.S. increased more than forecast in August (Sept. 16, 2016) retail Retail sales in U.S. decline in August by more than forecast (Sept.15 , 2016) workforce Applications for U.S. jobless benefits rise less than forecast (Sept. 15, 2016) NEW YORK - After months of waiting for the volatility trade to pay off, U.S. equity bears are finally cashing in. Individuals took a break from loading up on protective positions and sold exchange-traded notes and funds that track the CBOE Volatility Index at the fastest pace since the start of the year. It came as stocks were jolted from a slumber that persisted for almost two months, giving volatility-obsessed bears a rare payday. The S&P 500 Index wavered again Monday, closing little changed at 2,139.13 at 4 p.m. in New York, after erasing a 0.7 percent rally. Take the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, the biggest security tracking the stock market’s fear gauge. Owning the VXX amounts to speculation that swings will grow more frenetic in U.S. equities, and outstanding shares increased nearly 11-fold this year. In the five days through Friday, outstanding shares fell 16 percent for the biggest drop since December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “There have been very large inflows into the VXX in 2016, and being long VXX this year has been a very unprofitable trade,” said Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at the New York-based Macro Risk Advisors. “So on any vol spike, people are trying to sell out.” <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Through last week, flows into the VXX had piled up to $2 billion, putting the security on pace for its biggest year since 2012. After the VIX climbed 40 percent in one day for its biggest daily advance since the Brexit vote, investors sold out of their VXX holdings at the fastest rate in a year. On futures exchanges, venues dominated by hedge funds, bulls have been taking the opposite bet, going all-in on the end of market turbulence. Their conviction showed signs of wavering last week as net short positions fell by nearly 16 percent. On the other side of the trade, long VIX, almost 50,000 contracts were sold, the biggest weekly contraction since June, according to data compiled by Macro Risk Advisors. The S&P 500 Index failed to hold a rally Monday, with a rebound in banks offset by declines of at least 1.1 percent in Apple Inc. and Intel Corp. Lenders trimmed gains by half as U.S. Treasuries swung between gains and losses. “There’s a chance for volatility to remain, simply because I don’t think the Fed is going to clear up any uncertainty about the path of interest rates,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based Robert W. Baird, which oversees $110 billion. “The Fed will not raise interest rates this week, but they will be pretty aggressive in saying a rate increase is coming.” Volatility has flared as central banks signaled they are rethinking the approach to the monetary stimulus. The S&P 500 wobbled Monday, after rising 0.5 percent in the five days through Friday to bounce from its worst week since February. The benchmark trades at about 18.2 times estimated earnings, the highest since 2009, and for stocks to hit forecasts for next year, they would have to increase profits by 13 percent, something that hasn’t happened since 2011. A report on August housing starts Tuesday is the last bit of significant data to offer an indication on the strength of U.S. growth before the Federal Reserve announces its interest-rate decision on Wednesday. A measure Monday showed confidence among homebuilders rose to an 11-month high in September. Reports last week offered contrasting evidence of the state of the economy: the cost of living rose more in August than projected, while consumer confidence this month held at the lowest level since April. A gauge tracking the degree to which data miss or exceed economists’ estimates is near a two-month low. The odds for a September rate increase have fallen to 20 percent from 30 percent less than two weeks ago, with December the first month with more than even odds of a hike. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged, while strengthening guidance about its intentions to raise borrowing costs soon. The Bank of Japan will also undertake a review of its monetary policy this week.

The lawsuit, filed on Friday by a former LG Sales Manager identified as A Frost, said that the agreement between the two companies was of the “highest levels”, which he learned through a recruiter in 2013.  According to Frost, a recruiter seeking to fill a role at Samsung contacted him via LinkedIn in 2013. However, the recruiter later told Frost on the same day: “I made a mistake! I’m not supposed to poach LG for Samsung!!! Sorry! The two companies have an agreement that they won’t steal each other's employees.” The lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of all LG and Samsung employees in California – Wall Street Journal reports. Frost said in the suit that it would be unlikely that the poaching agreement could have been reached in the US without consulting the company’s corporate parent in South Korea. An attorney for Frost, Joseph Saveri, who also filed previous cases against Apple and Google, allegedly said the agreements were anticompetitive. In September 2015, Apple, Intel, Adobe and Google faced similar allegations, of conspiring to limit job mobility and driving down salaries. The four tech giants denied wrongdoing; however, they agreed to pay $415million to over 60,000 current and former employees to settle a class-action lawsuit.  The ‘no-hire’ policy meant that staff could not move to new roles with competitors and therefore restricted their potential earnings.
