Gallery: the weird and wonderful gadgets unveiled at CES 2017 Gallery: the weird and wonderful gadgets unveiled at CES 2017 CES 2017 56 items 08 Jan 2017 ADVERTISEMENT The chipmaker's Project Alloy was unveiled in 2016, but since its first demo it has been refined and the headset is set to be turned into a product by other companies before the end of this year. At CES 2017, the firm went big on its VR technologies - showing journalists applications that broadcast live 360-degree footage - and included tests of Alloy. WIRED tried the firm's hardware for size. Read more This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel By Matt Burgess The first completely noticeable thing about Intel's developmental headset is the wires. Or, to be precise, the lack of them. Unlike other forms of high-end VR (Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive) the unit is self-contained: the battery, sensors, screen and more is all within the headset and allows complete freedom of movement around a room. It is closer to Microsoft's HoloLens than traditional VR sets. To wear, the headset is comfortable and doesn't feel heavy on the head or neck, although the test was only five minutes and a prolonged use may end-up with different results. Intel staff demonstrate Alloy at CES Intel By scanning Intel's testing room with its real-sense technology (a depth sensor and array of cameras) the company is able to change the physical environment around you into a digital one. When Alloy was set-up, the mock living room buried within the Las Vegas convention centre became a gaming environment. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Death to the dashboard: AR windscreens in cars could make driving safer and easier Death to the dashboard: AR windscreens in cars could make driving safer and easier By Matt Burgess Inside the headset, the scenario presented by Intel was a game where you are placed on a spaceship and face incoming aliens. Waves of floating machines fly towards the player and using a handheld controller – created by a third party manufacturer – WIRED had to point and fire a gun, while trying to avoid incoming shots. The in-game view, when played with two players Intel Real-world objects become digital. For instance, the couch and coffee table within the room were turned into physical objects on the spacecraft you are transported to. The idea behind this, and the entire premise of Alloy, is to allow someone to 'merge' their world and still be able to walk and move around while wearing a VR headset. WIRED managed to bump into the physical table several times while trying to shoot aliens in the digital world. But the technology works. ADVERTISEMENT Read more Dog voices, binge eating: Podcast 300 Dog voices, binge eating: Podcast 300 By WIRED It was completely possible to move around the room, walking from one wall to another and avoiding in-game objects that in reality are obstacles. After watching multiple videos of people falling over in VR after becoming too immersed, WIRED's first steps were extremely tentative (almost a shuffle). The Project Alloy headset turns physical spaces into digital worlds Intel Once acclimatised to the merged realities, also with repeated encouragement from Intel staff, it was possible to move around the room at an almost walking pace. The company's spokespeople encouraged faster movements and ducking behind the coffee table. ADVERTISEMENT There were some laggy glitches with the headset when we tried the headset, although Intel staff put this down to a the Wi-Fi within the heavily populated CES conference centre. Moving the controller, which was a gun in the game, was not quite as smooth as it could have been and (as with many VR headsets) the screen resolution could be higher. Intel staff said the device, currently in its first generation, has a battery life of 30 minutes but it hopes to treble this when production ready. WIRED Overall, the gameplay is immersive. WIRED managed to become engrossed in the game and the gaming world was plausible. As with other VR experiences, this is not enough to make you truly believe you're on a spaceship. But being able to move around the room does show promise. Being able to walk within VR is more satisfying than pressing a button on a controller and the system gives a possible glimpse of VR's future. There's still a lot of unknowns about Intel's VR efforts though. The firm isn't making the headsets itself but is licensing them and the technologies to third party companies, who will manufacture and sell their own products. This leaves questions about the price, how it will stack-up against competitors, and who will make software that is immersive. Whatever happens, Intel has developed technologies other VR providers haven't yet made, giving them a possible advantage.

Freedman Jan 6, 2017, 6:12 PM Intel found a way to keep your smart home from becoming obsolete. It's called the Compute Card, and it's a computer, about the size of a credit card, that will provide the entire platform for smart technology, making it easy to upgrade at your whim. The tiny computer has a CPU, RAM, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and it can run anything that has a slot for the card. Intel representatives told me that it's meant to simplify the design process for smart gadgets, as they'll already know the computer they're using. They just need to include a slot for the card. MORE: Intel Launches More 7th Gen CPUs: 5 Things You Need to Know It's also a benefit for consumers. In three years when your specs are outdated, you can buy a new Compute Card with the latest and greatest without throwing away an entire smart refrigerator. Those worried about obsolete smart tech will be able to upgrade at will. Alternatively, if the PC breaks, you can just swap in a new one. Products using the card will come from partners including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp and inFocus by the end of the year. While Intel showed me the Compute card at its booth at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, the official launch will come at Computex in May with full specs and demos. All Intel reps would mention is that there will be a lineup of Compute Cards at different price points, and will that they will include 7th Generation processors.

More videos Advertisers flock to Instagram Instagram will overtake Twitter next year in attracting US advertisers, according to research firm eMarketer. But how much do these teens understand what they've agreed to give up when they start an account with those sites? Probably very little, according to a report released last week — and dense terms and conditions that are "impenetrable and largely ignored" are partly to blame. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Instagram's terms of use in total run at least seven printed pages, with more than 5000 words.  "'Terms and conditions' is one of the first things you agree to when you come upon a site," said Jenny Afia, a privacy lawyer and partner at Schillings law firm in London. "But of course no one reads them. I mean, most adults don't read them." Afia was a member of a "Growing Up Digital" task force group convened by the Children's Commissioner for England to study internet use among teens and the concerns children might face as they grow up in the digital age. Advertisement The group found more than a third of internet users are younger than 18, with 12- to 15-year-olds spending more than 20 hours a week online. Most of those children have no idea what their privacy rights are, despite all of them agreeing to terms and conditions before starting their social media accounts, Afia said. The task force, which included experts from the public and private sector, worked for a year and released its report Wednesday. "The situation is serious," Afia said in the report. "Young people are unwittingly giving away personal information, with no real understanding of who is holding that information, where they are holding it and what they are going to do with it." One reason for this became apparent when the task force asked a group of teenagers to read and interpret Instagram's terms and conditions. Many of them balked at the exercise: Instagram's terms of use in total run at least seven printed pages, with more than 5000 words, mostly written in legalese. "Boring!" one 13-year-old girl declared during the exercise. "It doesn't make any sense." After 20 minutes, the same teen questioned why she should continue reading. "Are you sure this is necessary?" she said. "There are, like, 100 pages." Afterward, the teenagers said they understood very little about privacy rights on Instagram, despite getting through the terms and conditions. "I don't know due to the sheer amount of writing and the lack of clarity within the document," a 15-year-old said, according to the report. The group ran Instagram's terms and conditions through a readability study and found that it registered at a postgraduate reading level, Afia said. She was tasked with rewriting the company's terms and conditions "in plain English." It took her several hours, she said. "It was doable," Afia said. "But it was quite taxing and definitely time-consuming." The simplified terms of service fit on a single page. The following paragraph is taken from Instagram's terms of use: "You are responsible for any activity that occurs through your account and you agree you will not sell, transfer, license or assign your account, followers, username, or any account rights. With the exception of people or businesses that are expressly authorised to create accounts on behalf of their employers or clients, Instagram prohibits the creation of and you agree that you will not create an account for anyone other than yourself. You also represent that all information you provide or provided to Instagram upon registration and at all other times will be true, accurate, current and complete and you agree to update your information as necessary to maintain its truth and accuracy." After Afia rewrote it for teenagers to be able to understand, it became, simply: "Don't use anybody else's account without their permission or try to find out their login details." Other complex paragraphs were similarly condensed to sentences that were easier to digest: "Don't bully anyone or post anything horrible about people." "Officially you own any original pictures and videos you post, but we are allowed to use them, and we can let others use them as well, anywhere around the world. Other people might pay us to use them and we will not pay you for that." "Although you are responsible for the information you put on Instagram, we may keep, use and share your personal information with companies connected with Instagram. This information includes your name, email address, school, where you live, pictures, phone number, your likes and dislikes, where you go, who your friends are, how often you use Instagram, and any other personal information we find such as your birthday or who you are chatting with, including in private messages (DMs)." The result was heartening, the report said. The task force asked the same group of children and teenagers to read the simplified terms and found they understood them far more clearly. "I think they should show these Terms and Conditions to people who sign up because otherwise you don't really know what you're signing up to," said the 13-year-old who had declared the original document "Boring!" "I would use Direct Messaging a lot less if I knew (Instagram) could read them," she added. The task force said the same message could be applied to most social media sites, but it focused on Instagram for its ubiquity and popularity among teenagers. Last month, Instagram announced that it had grown to 600 million users, with 100 million of those joining during the previous six-month period. According to the report, more than half of 12- to 15-year-olds in the United Kingdom — and nearly half of 8- to 11-year-olds — who are active on social media have an account on Instagram, despite the company dictating in its terms that users have to be at least 13. "Instagram, like many social networks, leaves the user with very little information to exercise their rights or any genuine privacy," the report said. "This exercise makes it clear that the current offering made by websites and apps to their users is not acceptable. Children and young people have the right to know how the relationship between their rights and the rights of the service that they have signed up to use, functions." Instagram did not respond to an interview request over the weekend. The group hopes its study — and the simplified terms of use — will spur conversations between parents and their children that privacy online is important, no matter the platform. "I think the timely goal is just plain English so that children can actually give informed consent," Afia said. "And then once there is more transparency around how the site works, we hope that will lead to some consumer pressure from the children and they will start demanding more. And parents need to bear in mind children are children until they become adults — not until they pick up a smartphone. We need to treat them as children." At least one teenager quoted in the report said he would take privacy matters into his own hands, however, after going through the exercise. "I'm deleting Instagram," 13-year-old Alex said, "because it's weird." The Washington Post 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Twenty-five years ago, the man who is now CEO of the world's largest maker of computer chips was an engineer at the company. And he made an error that almost got him fired. "I wiped out the output of an entire factory for a week," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Fortt Knox podcast in an interview. "I'm lucky to be employed at Intel, sometimes I say." Instead of dooming him, his handling of the problem influenced the company culture, helping to birth a system called "Copy Exactly" that's become part of its identity. Krzanich went on to make a name for himself as the executive responsible for all of Intel's factories, a job that prepared him to be CEO. It happened in the 1990s; Krzanich was in his early 30s. At the time, Intel was just beginning to hit its stride with a strategy that would make it the world's top supplier of chips for personal computers. His job was to transfer the chip manufacturing process from one facility in New Mexico to the one next door. It didn't work. Production ground to a halt. And for an agonizingly long time, he had no idea why. "It went all the way up to the CEO. And my boss at one point walked into my office and said, 'You have about two more weeks to figure out this issue, and if you don't, I've got to let you go,'" Krzanich recalled. "And luckily, a friend of mine and I, we said we're just not going to sleep until we solve this. And then, sure enough, we found the problem about a week into that two week time period." What sets Krzanich apart as a leader isn't just the way he rallied in a situation like this, though his conversation with Fortt Knox did unearth some gems that should help anyone navigate a career crisis. What sets him apart is the no-frills approach he brings to his work, and the adaptability that has allowed him to push his career – and now, Intel itself – in unexpected directions. Here are just a few of the concepts explored in a fascinating episode of Fortt Knox: Reality Beats Résumé Getty Images Intel Corp. CEO Brian Krzanich delivers a keynote address at CES 2016 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 5, 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Krzanich grew up in San Jose, California, just miles from Intel headquarters. He didn't go to an Ivy League school: He got his bachelor's degree in Chemistry from San Jose State University. The prestige of a college's brand on a résumé doesn't impress him. "I've told my daughters this; my older daughter's about to go into college. It doesn't matter what college you go to. The thing that was great about San Jose State was, I got connected with some very good professors," he said. He did research for their projects on the side. "When I went into interviews, I could talk about real work that I'd done, not just textbook stuff," Krzanich added. That informs how he deals with job candidates today. "I ask real simple questions that just tell me, does this person know how to think?" This gets you fired Krzanich had some more advice. "The other thing I tell my daughters is, I've had to terminate or fire more people for being difficult to work with than being dumb." That said, former CEOs of Intel haven't exactly distinguished themselves by being easy to work with—the legendary Andy Grove comes to mind. So what does he mean? "I think if you don't give people the tools and the expectations for success, and yet hold them to some value, then you're difficult to work with. I think the one thing about Andy was, if you listened to him, if you tried to understand him, then you actually understood what the expectations were," the CEO said. "They may be hard, and you may not have been able to do it, but you at least had a chance. The difficult bosses – the ones that have been hard for me to work for – have been the ones where, I never knew what success meant," Krzanich added. In other words, it's okay to challenge your team. But it's also important to recognize the value of their different perspectives, give them the tools, and clearly define success. Use Your Lifelines show chapters Intel CEO: Need to make the US more competitive for manufacturing    Friday, 6 Jan 2017 | 11:17 AM ET | 01:40 In the show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," contestants can solve difficult problems by asking the audience, or phoning a friend. Moments in Krzanich's career are reminiscent of that. A friend helped him solve the early puzzle that had brought production to a halt. And when Intel began searching for a new CEO about four years ago, he took an unorthodox approach to competing for it: He teamed up with another Intel executive and presented to the board together. The board ended up naming him CEO, and his teammate president—the number two position. "It was more important to me that it was an insider, because I felt like anybody from the outside would slow the company down," Krzanich said. "Even if they were better, it would take them two years to learn how Intel works and to figure out how to make Moore's Law happen." The CEO "was willing to do whatever it took to have an insider, even if that wasn't me, or if it was a group of us, I was going to figure out a way .... By partnering up, I figured that was our best chance. Two of us could beat one outsider." Fortt Knox is a weekly podcast from CNBC anchor Jon Fortt.

That all changed this week at CES, where Intel showed off a developer kit to select media. Gizmodo was lucky enough to be invited into the private demonstration — and we're happy to report that it was well worth the wait. Before we dive into the experience, it's important to make a few caveats: First of all, this is not a finished product. The images you're looking at are just a reference design. Intel plans to work with hardware manufacturers to build different versions of the headset. What enables Project Alloy is Intel RealSense, a tiny camera array that debuted at CES 2014. The camera set is able make a 3D map of any room and the objects in it. Developers can then use the 3D computer model created by the cameras to layer graphics on top of it, which becomes especially handy for creating immersive VR experiences inside of a room. The developer kit is actually a ridiculously good-looking headset considering it's only a reference design. It's completely black and has unnoticeable RealSense camera arrays in the front of the goggles. At the back of the headset is the big battery that enables the headset to be completely untethered. Eliminating the wire from the back of a VR headset is a huge deal. Anyone that's ever played around with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive will tell you one of the major pain points about those headsets is that you're always tripping over the wire that connects it to power and a nearby computer — especially if you have room tracking enabled. The Project Alloy headset I played around with let me walk around a room filled with book shelves, a coffee table and other objects in it. The demo room was basically made to look like a small apartment. The RealSense cameras took about a minute to scan the room, then another minute to turn the objects inside of the real room into elements in the game. The coffee table was turned into a big generator and the book shelves turned into rusty pipes and other weird objects straight out of a sci-fi film. The game demonstrated doesn't have a name and will never be available for public release. It was made to show off the room mapping and 3D tracking as you walk around the room shooting bad guys. The gameplay was similar to SuperHot VR, but I was shooting drones rather than humans. The graphics were also solid and easily comparable to anything I've played on the Oculus or Vive. My only major complaint about Project Alloy was the controller. It felt a little too flimsy and is most comparable to the controller that comes with the Google Daydream headset. It has a trackpad right where your thumb goes and a trigger on the back. They're basically standard VR controller elements at this point, but the quality just wasn't as good as the higher-end headsets. Still, the whole experience was awesome, especially compared to the other high-end virtual reality headsets out there. I was a little sceptical about how important the cable-free headset would be — but it makes tremendous difference when you're walking around the room, ducking behind objects to dodge bullets, swinging your head in every direction to fire at bad guys. This is one of the few truly innovative products at CES and one I'm extremely glad I had a chance to play around with. The Project Alloy developer kit will be made available to in the second quarter of this year, and there's still no price tag on it yet. The public probably won't see this thing for sale for a long time, but let me be the first to say it will be well worth the wait once an untethered VR headset finally makes its way into your home.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 8, 2017 at 4:00PM It's no secret that the personal computer market is shrinking. There are many common explanations about why it's happening, but whatever the reasons, this is the reality that personal computer manufacturers, as well as their many component vendors, must cope with. Intel's Navin Shenoy. Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) enjoyed tremendous success over the years by dominating the market for personal computer processors. However, the company's dependence on PCs turned from a clear benefit to a clear negative as the market suffered a multiyear decline in unit shipments. Although there's not a lot that Intel can do to fundamentally change the trajectory of the personal computer market, the company has taken actions to try to maximize its profitability within this market. These include the development (and in some cases integration) of auxiliary chips and technologies to boost its content share within personal computers, as well as aggressive market segmentation actions to encourage up-sell to higher-value products. These moves appear to have paid off, at least based on the company's year-to-date financial results. During the first nine months of 2016, Intel reported a reduction in notebook platform shipments of 1% and desktop platform shipments of 5%. However, it enjoyed overall revenue growth (albeit anemic in nature) in notebook revenue thanks to a 2% boost in average selling prices. Desktop average selling prices were, too, up 2%, though that wasn't enough to completely counteract the unit decline. At a recent investor conference, Navin Shenoy, the head of Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG), offered some insight into the potential drivers of the company's desktop and notebook average selling price trends going forward. The overall strategy Shenoy began by offering a high-level overview of the company's strategy in these markets. "When I think about our strategy going forward, there's a few key tenets that we have in the strategy that ultimately drive the [average selling prices]," he said. First, the company needs to deliver an "annual cadence of new products," asserting that delivering on that timeline is "core and fundamental" to CCG. Intel's seventh-generation Core processor. Image source: Intel.  He noted that delivering new products in a predictable fashion helps the company to maintain or grow its average selling prices. Beyond that, Shenoy said Intel is "focused on integration." "As we look at future [manufacturing technology] nodes, we think about what more we can integrate," he explained, referring to combining of technologies that previous would have required separate chips into the company's processors. Shenoy obviously didn't give specifics about future products, but did speak about what kinds of technologies Intel is looking to integrate into its chip in broader terms. "As we think about where we go in the future, we look at things like voltage regulation, communications capabilities, and various auxiliary chips that are around the [system-on-chip] today and we think about how we can integrate those things and use Moore's Law to our advantage," he said. He pointed out that as the company integrates technologies into its chips, it has the "ability to monetize provided [that] the end user sees utility." Finally, Shenoy claims Intel is "focused on the segments of the market that are growing," citing gaming, 2-in-1, and commercial personal computers as examples of stable-to-growing sub-markets within the overall personal computer market. Can Intel keep raising its average selling prices? After outlining the company's broader strategy, Shenoy circled back to address the core question: Can Intel continue to grow personal computer processor average selling prices? He was candid in saying that this depends on Intel's execution toward the strategy that he laid out, implying that Intel has some degree of control over its fate (at the very least, the average selling price portion of it) in a market that's largely viewed to be in secular decline. We'll get a better sense of Intel's expectations for personal computer processor average selling price trends during 2017 when the company hosts its annual investor meeting next month.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Rosenwald facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More The US government has strictly limited the sale of firearm silencers for as long as James Bond and big-screen gangsters have used them to discreetly shoot enemies between the eyes. Now the gun industry, which for decades has complained about the restrictions, is pursuing new legislation to make silencers easier to buy, and a key backer is Donald Trump jnr, an avid hunter and the oldest son of the president-elect, who campaigned as a friend of the gun industry.

Lee, a suspect in an influence-peddling investigation. More videos Donald Trump Jr. backs Hearing Protection Act The oldest son of President-elect Donald Trump has lent his support to proposed legislation that will make firearm silencers easier to buy. The legislation stalled in Congress last year. But with Republicans in charge of the House and Senate and the elder Trump moving into the White House, gun rights advocates are excited about its prospects this year. They hope to position the bill the same way this time - not as a Constitutional issue, but as a public-health effort to safeguard the eardrums of the nation's 55 million gun owners. They even named it the Hearing Protection Act. It would end treating silencers as the same category as machine guns and grenades, thus eliminating a $US200 tax and a nine-month approval process. Related Content Trump insider Jared Kushner chases a massive Chinese deal for family firm Among red state Donald Trump supporters, indifference to Russian interference "It's about safety," Trump jnr explained in a September video interview with the founder of SilencerCo, a Utah silencer manufacturer. "It's a health issue, frankly." Violence prevention advocates are outraged that the industry is trying to ease silencer restrictions by linking the issue to the eardrums of gun owners. They argue the legislation will make it easier for criminals and potential mass shooters to obtain devices to conceal attacks. Advertisement "They want the general public to think it's about hearing aids or something," said Kristen Rand, the legislative director of the Violence Policy Centre. "It's both a silly and smart way to do it, I guess. But when the general public finds out what's really happening, there will be outrage." The silencer industry and gun rights groups say critics are vastly overstating the dangers, arguing that Hollywood has created an unrealistic image of silencers, which they prefer to call "suppressors." They cite studies showing that silencers reduce the decibel level of a gunshot from a dangerous 165 to about 135 - the sound of a jackhammer - and that they are rarely used in crimes. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Donald Trump jnr wants silencers to be more readily available in the US. Photo: AP But gun-control activists say silencers are getting quieter, particularly in combination with subsonic ammunition, which is less lethal but still damaging. They point to videos on YouTube in which silencers make high-powered rifles have "no more sound than a pellet gun," according to one demonstrator showing off a silenced semiautomatic .22LR. Proponents say that's not a good way to judge the sound. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link All about protecting your hearing. Photo: iStock "You're still going to hear the gunfire from far away," said Knox Williams, president of the American Suppressor Association. "These things are still incredibly loud." Even with the restrictions, silencers have become one of the fastest-growing segments of the gun industry, which pushed accessories as gun sales level off. In 2010, there were 285,087 registered silencers. Last year: 902,085. Representative Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who regularly shoots with silencers, introduced the Hearing Protection Act in the House in 2015. A companion bill in the Senate was championed by Senator Mike Crapo, R-Idaho. Though the bill never made it to committee hearings, it generated tremendous interest, becoming the third-most-viewed piece of legislation on Congress's website last year. (Top was the Democrat-led Assault Weapons Ban of 2015.) Salmon recently retired, and it's not clear yet who will reintroduce the measure. The bill had 82 co-sponsors - all but two of them Republicans. Easing the restrictions could have a profound public-health impact, champions of the legislation say. Hunters often shoot without hearing protection so they can hear prey moving. Many recreational shooters don't like wearing ear covers, which can be heavy and hot and in gun ranges lead to many conversations ending with, "I can't hear you." Silencers are also marketed as must-have attachments for high-powered rifles - a tactical necessity that reduces recoil, thus improving aim. "Quiet guns are easier to shoot," the National Rifle Association says in its American Rifleman magazine. "Try it." Silencer use in crimes is likely to be the focus of the legislative debate later this year. Gun rights proponents and the silencer industry cite a study showing that in California, from 1995 to 2005, silencers appeared to be used for criminal purposes only 153 times in federal cases. "Suppressed firearms are clearly not the choice of criminals," according to a briefing paper by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, Connecticut, and represents gun manufacturers. "The fears and concerns about suppressor ownership and use are unfounded and have not been seen in the over 100-year history of suppressors." Gun-control advocates contend that serious crimes are being committed with silencers on guns. Former police officer Christopher Dorner used silencers on an AR-15 and a 9mm handgun during two-day rampage in Los Angeles in 2013. A serial killer in Vermont used a silencer in the killing of at least one of his 11 victims. And the planner of a disrupted mass shooting targeting a Masonic temple in Milwaukee last year was charged with possessing a silencer, in addition to other weapons charges. "They wanted these things so they could kill quietly," said Rand, of the Violence Policy Centre. "The industry wants to make silencers less scary, but they can't." Gun owners such as Trump jnr can't understand why people like Rand don't get it. In the video, after he's shown shooting several guns with silencers, Trump jnr says they can help with getting "little kids into the game." "It's just a great instrument," he says. "There's nothing bad about it at all."

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. "Bunch of crybabies," Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released Friday by US intelligence chiefs informing President-elect Donald Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed "trolls" on social media and used their "state-run propaganda machine" to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. Related Content Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, chief of staff Russians dismiss US intelligence's election meddling charge as baseless In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the president-elect's legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia's boldest effort yet to meddle with US elections, to spread discontent and to "undermine the US-led democratic order." But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the president-elect won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. Advertisement "From the parts of the report I've seen," said Rob Maness, a retired US Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as a Tea Party favourite, "it seems silly." There are genuine concerns about Russia's cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally in November.  Photo: AP Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, "90 percent of them are like, 'What's the big deal?'" The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in US elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries' elections. Even if the Russians did do it -- which some were more willing to concede than others -- what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Clinton, Trump's election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, "just being sore losers." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump. Photo: AP "I don't think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves," said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops from a small table at a frigid outdoor farmers' market. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Emenes said. He added that, as long as Trump was not involved himself, "it doesn't change the way I view him." Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, Louisiana, front yard after the previous night's frost, had a similar attitude. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link No big deal: Russian President Vladimir Putin  Photo: AP "Trump is Trump," she said. "Do I think he's going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don't. I think -- I hope -- his focus will be on making America great again." Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Trump's slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. "I don't believe it," Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his "Make America Great Again" flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. "Why would Putin even want Trump?" Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Barack Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Putin get away with things, Yates continued. Trump would be much tougher. But Yates then added: "Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I'm not against Putin." This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was "a basket case," and not the powerful foe it once was, said Marino, from his seat at McDonald's. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Indiana. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as "somewhere in the middle" between friend and enemy, but agreed with Trump that the United States could work with Russia to defeat the Islamic State group. "We may have to line up with people who may not be our 'friend' to make that happen," she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the CIA. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. "The idea of a fair election" had been placed in doubt, Willis said. "We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you're talking about espionage." The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. "Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?" Willis said. "Yes, I'm very concerned about that." In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20's cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Gubert came to a different conclusion. "If that's what it took," he said, "I'm glad they did it."

Advertisement "From the parts of the report I've seen," said Rob Maness, a retired US Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as a Tea Party favourite, "it seems silly." There are genuine concerns about Russia's cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.)

The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in US elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries' elections. Even if the Russians did do it -- which some were more willing to concede than others -- what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Clinton, Trump's election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, "just being sore losers."

Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Emenes said. He added that, as long as Trump was not involved himself, "it doesn't change the way I view him." Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, Louisiana, front yard after the previous night's frost, had a similar attitude. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link No big deal: Russian President Vladimir Putin  Photo: AP "Trump is Trump," she said. "Do I think he's going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don't. I think -- I hope -- his focus will be on making America great again." Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Trump's slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. "I don't believe it," Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his "Make America Great Again" flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. "Why would Putin even want Trump?" Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Barack Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Putin get away with things, Yates continued. Trump would be much tougher. But Yates then added: "Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I'm not against Putin." This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was "a basket case," and not the powerful foe it once was, said Marino, from his seat at McDonald's. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Indiana. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as "somewhere in the middle" between friend and enemy, but agreed with Trump that the United States could work with Russia to defeat the Islamic State group. "We may have to line up with people who may not be our 'friend' to make that happen," she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the CIA. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. "The idea of a fair election" had been placed in doubt, Willis said. "We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you're talking about espionage." The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. "Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?" Willis said. "Yes, I'm very concerned about that." In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20's cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Gubert came to a different conclusion. "If that's what it took," he said, "I'm glad they did it."

Intel Working With Wine Developers On User-Mode Instruction Prevention Written by Michael Larabel in WINE on 8 January 2017 at 02:24 PM EST. 8 Comments The Intel developer working on UMIP (User-Mode Instruction Prevention) support for the Linux kernel has been collaborating with Wine developers about this security-minded feature to be introduced with future Intel CPUs. The User-Mode Instruction Prevention (UMIP) feature prevents SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, SMSW, and STR instructions from being executed outside of ring 0. UMIP was developed to help prevent user-space applications from using these instructions in exploiting code execution vulnerabilities. But given Wine's design, this could be a bit of a problem but fortunately the involved Intel developer is working with Wine to ensure a sufficient design with their kernel implementation. Those wishing to learn more about UMIP and Wine can read today's latest World Wine News and the associated mailing list thread. It looks like UMIP will debut with Intel Cannonlake processors. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Project Alloy is an all-in-one virtual reality headset. The device is a full computer on your face allowing for an untethered VR experience, meaning no cords. It also removes the need for outside sensors and cameras for tracking, as it’s equipped with computer vision technology leveraging Intel’s RealSense offering inside-out tracking. Alloy’s computer vision capabilities, which are made possible by Intel’s RealSense cameras and chips from Movidius, which Intel acquired late last year, is what allows the device to create what Intel has coined “merged reality.” As there is a sea of definitions being used when it comes to VR and AR, I began my interview with Intel vice president and general manage of its perpetual computing group, Achin Bhowmik, by asking him to define the term and put it in context to the other realities. Here is what he told me: “If you look at the definitions there is VR where you are completely occluded you don’t see the real world you only see what is rendered. Then there is augmented reality where you see a display overlaid, then there is mixed reality where you render objects in the real world. So what is merged reality? Blending in the real world into the virtual world. In other words, I can have a VR headset like Alloy but I am able to blend in the real world objects into it. You are bringing in the real world into the virtual world. That is merged reality.” Alloy is not a mixed reality device like HoloLens and it’s also not an augmented reality device like Epson Moverio BT-300. It isn’t even a VR headset like the Oculus Rift. Rather, it’s a virtual reality device that can bring in real world elements to enrich the experience. And this is exactly the type of experience I had during the demo. While the current prototype of Alloy is large, it was actually pretty comfortable considering I was wearing a laptop running a PC class core processor on my face. But my demo was extremely short so I would have to wear the device a lot longer to really conclude anything here. And ultimately this doesn’t matter as Intel is not the one that will be producing the consumer ready device, although the company is continuing to iterate on the design to work on things like balance. The device fit on my head very similarly to Playstation VR although the back of the headband was much larger since it contains the battery. After my demo I did notice that the top of the device got pretty heated but I didn’t hear any fans like I have in other AR/VR devices. With the headset on I first saw the room around me which was previously scanned. Slowly the objects in the room around me started to change into game elements. The coffee table in the middle of the room became a glowing generator, and the walls were finally removed to show the sky which quickly became filled with enemy drones (which by the way were almost too cute to shoot).  The game itself was pretty simple. I was given an Ximmerse 3 degrees of freedom controller which I would use to point and shoot the drones and when I was out of ammo, I had to walk around the room to collect some more to continue shooting. One of Alloy’s main features was to use the room around me to make it easier to walk within the space without crashing into things. There were a couple of times when I bumped into the coffee table — which in the game was the virtual generator — as they didn’t completely exactly line up. Overall, I would say that I didn’t leave the demo feeling entirely confident I could run around the room in the game with the same ease as I do in the real world without knocking into things but it was clear that the real world objects were being taken in consideration in the virtual environment and I was able to move about the game again without the need for outside sensors.  While Intel did say that down in the main area at CES they had a demo of Alloy where you could put your hands in the experience to interact with the virtual world, the demo I experienced used a controller which left a lot to be desired. My virtual hand in the game was a good 15 degrees from where my real hand was. Bhowmik did tell me that Alloy can work with various inputs including controllers with six degrees of freedom and that eventually at launch the device will also feature voice control. I asked Bhowmik what he thought the predominant use cases would be for Alloy. Gaming topped his list as he felt that Alloy could provide a “richer experience when you are not connected to the PC.” Virtual tourism, education and sports rounded out his list of experiences we may expect to see using the production version of the device. Intel has confirmed that Alloy developer kits are already in the hands of partners that they will work with to commercialize this technology. And in a press conference earlier at CES, Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, confirmed that we will see Alloy technology ship in Q4 of 2017. Intel could not confirm who these “major” partners were, but Intel previously stated that they are “collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy.” Bhowmik told me that some of the partners will use the Project Alloy developer kit as a reference design while others with more stronger device design capabilities will take the guts of it to create their own including one 400 RealSens camera and the Movidius chip (in the version I tried Intel used two specially-developed variations of our 200 RealSense cameras). RealSense also has a chip on it that calculates the 3D data points. While the battery life will depend on the partner, Bhowmik did say that like a laptop you should expect multiple hours of battery life. Overall I would say that I left pretty excited about Alloy, although the experience wasn’t as magical as I had hoped. I am a huge believer that an all-in-one untethered device with no need for outside sensors is the future. And I have no doubt that with the help of major partners that Intel will continue to improve upon the technology.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. "Bunch of crybabies," Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released Friday by US intelligence chiefs informing President-elect Donald Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed "trolls" on social media and used their "state-run propaganda machine" to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. Related Content Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, chief of staff Russians dismiss US intelligence's election meddling charge as baseless In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the president-elect's legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia's boldest effort yet to meddle with US elections, to spread discontent and to "undermine the US-led democratic order." But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the president-elect won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. Advertisement "From the parts of the report I've seen," said Rob Maness, a retired US Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as a Tea Party favourite, "it seems silly." There are genuine concerns about Russia's cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.)

The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in US elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries' elections. Even if the Russians did do it -- which some were more willing to concede than others -- what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Clinton, Trump's election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, "just being sore losers."

Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Emenes said. He added that, as long as Trump was not involved himself, "it doesn't change the way I view him." Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, Louisiana, front yard after the previous night's frost, had a similar attitude.

"Do I think he's going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don't. I think -- I hope -- his focus will be on making America great again." Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Trump's slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. "I don't believe it," Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his "Make America Great Again" flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. "Why would Putin even want Trump?" Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Barack Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Putin get away with things, Yates continued. Trump would be much tougher. But Yates then added: "Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I'm not against Putin." This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was "a basket case," and not the powerful foe it once was, said Marino, from his seat at McDonald's. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Indiana. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as "somewhere in the middle" between friend and enemy, but agreed with Trump that the United States could work with Russia to defeat the Islamic State group. "We may have to line up with people who may not be our 'friend' to make that happen," she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the CIA. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. "The idea of a fair election" had been placed in doubt, Willis said. "We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you're talking about espionage." The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Sen. John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. "Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?" Willis said. "Yes, I'm very concerned about that." In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56, chain-smoked Eagle 20's cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Gubert came to a different conclusion. "If that's what it took," he said, "I'm glad they did it."

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. "Bunch of crybabies," Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released Friday by US intelligence chiefs informing President-elect Donald Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed "trolls" on social media and used their "state-run propaganda machine" to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. Related Content Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, chief of staff Russians dismiss US intelligence's election meddling charge as baseless In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the president-elect's legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia's boldest effort yet to meddle with US elections, to spread discontent and to "undermine the US-led democratic order." But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the president-elect won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. Advertisement "From the parts of the report I've seen," said Rob Maness, a retired US Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as a Tea Party favourite, "it seems silly." There are genuine concerns about Russia's cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump cheer during a campaign rally in November.  Photo: AP Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, "90 percent of them are like, 'What's the big deal?'" The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in US elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries' elections. Even if the Russians did do it -- which some were more willing to concede than others -- what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Clinton, Trump's election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, "just being sore losers."

Lee, a suspect in an influence-peddling investigation. More videos North Korea close to test of ICBM North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says that the isolated nuclear-capable country is close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). "The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK," an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official KCNA news agency, using the acronym for the country's name. The North is formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Related Content Trump's Asia stance likely to further increase tensions Trump tweets North Korean missile test 'won't happen' US Defence Secretary Ash Carter said on Sunday that North Korea's nuclear weapons capabilities and ballistic missile defence programs constitute a "serious threat" to the United States and that it was prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile launch or test. "We only would shoot them down ... if it was threatening, that is if it were coming toward our territory or the territory of our friends and allies," Carter said during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" program. Advertisement The United States said on January 5 that North Korea had demonstrated a "qualitative" improvement in its nuclear and missile capabilities after an unprecedented level of tests last year. North Korea has been testing rocket engines and heat-shields for an ICBM while developing the technology to guide a missile after re-entry into the atmosphere following a lift-off, experts have said.

Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9000 km from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5500 km , but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or further. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link People watch a TV news channel airing an image of North Korea's ballistic missile launch published on Thursday in North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper. Photo: AP US President-elect Donald Trump responded to Kim's comments on an ICBM test by declaring in a tweet last week that "It won't happen!" A US State Department spokesman said last week that the United States does not believe that North Korea is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile. North Korea has been under UN sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The sanctions were tightened last month after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test on September 9. "The US is wholly to blame for pushing the DPRK to have developed ICBM as it has desperately resorted to anachronistic policy hostile toward the DPRK for decades to encroach upon its sovereignty and vital rights," KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. "Anyone who wants to deal with the DPRK would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking after having clear understanding of it," the spokesman said, according to KCNA.  Reuters Related Content Kim Jong-un says North Korea close to testing inter-continental missiles Enough of the tweets, China's state media tells Donald Trump Advertisement Most Popular If you thought you'd deciphered Trump's master tweeting plan, you're probably wrong 'Pence could be the most powerful VP ever, or he could be kicked to the curb really fast' Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Pendant identical to Anne Frank's found at notorious Nazi camp Follow Fairfax Foreign Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow SMH Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide World Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Video shows police tackling and beating a black man suspected of stealing a car.

"And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does." Advertisement Trump on Saturday suggested warmer relations were coming between the Washington and Moscow, a day after US intelligence chiefs briefed him on the evidence tying interference in the election campaign to Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said in a series of three tweets. "Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think it is bad!

SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Senator Lindsey Graham plans to introduce legislation for tougher sanctions against Russia. Photo: AP McCain, also speaking on NBC, said the Senate Armed Services Committee, which he chairs, will continue to conduct hearings around cyber threats. McCain said he supports appointing a special Senate committee to investigate the campaign hacking, rather than having several committees do their own probes. Trump's approach to Russia is expected to be debated on January 11 at the confirmation hearing for Rex Tillerson, his nominee for secretary of state, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Panel members have said they'll press Tillerson, the former chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation, about his years of friendly business dealings with Putin. While Committee Chairman Bob Corker said on Friday that Tillerson's views on Russia "are not in any way out of the mainstream," the Tennessee Republican added that Russia has done "very nefarious things." Similarly, Graham said Tillerson has to convince him that as a career oilman he sees Putin as undermining democracy with actions such as the hacking attacks, and that new sanctions are justified. "I'm looking for a secretary of state who understands Russia and understands the world as it really is. I had a great meeting with him," Graham said. "I hope he can articulate to the American people that he understands Putin has been a disruptive force when it comes to democracy."

Dell's latest XPS 13 2-in-1 tries to woo consumers with an eye-catching display, a thin, durable chassis, and the latest processors from Intel. The XPS 13 convertible's 360° hinge allows it to function as both a laptop or a tablet, depending on the display's orientation. The hinges are constructed of solid steel wrapped in aluminum. Solid materials aren't restricted to the hinges, since the main body is made of aluminum, carbon fiber, and Gorilla Glass. The convertible is 0.54" (13.7mm( thick, and weighs 2.7 lbs (1.24 kg). Dell claims that this is the world's smallest 13" 2-in-1, and that's partly thanks to its display portion. The InfinityEdge touch display has a very thin bezel and an IGZO IPS panel with wide viewing angles. Shoppers can pick between a display with 1920x1080 or 3200x1800 resolution. Under the hood, Dell installs one of two processors. The base model comes with Intel's Core i5-7Y54 processor, which has a max turbo frequency of 3.2 GHz and a 4.5W TDP. Buyers can upgrade to Intel's Core i7-7Y75, a dual-core processor with four threads, a max turbo frequency of 3.6 GHz, and a 4.5W TDP. For graphics, the convertible uses the processor's integrated HD Graphics 615. The XPS 13 2-in-1's different configurations either have 4GB or 8GB of 1866Mhz LPDDR3, and users can pick between a 128GB SSD or a 256GB PCIe SSD. The XPS 13 convertible employs a fanless design to dispel heat, enabling it to run very quietly. Dell claims the machine can go for about 15 hours when running productivity applications, and about 13 hours when streaming Netflix. For connectivity, the laptop offers has two USB Type-C ports, one of which supports Thunderbolt 3. Both ports have charging and display functionality. Since some users might miss their old USB ports, Dell includes a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter in the box. The convertible has a backlit keyboard, and is equipped with a fingerprint reader. The XPS 13 2-in-1 is sold exclusively at dell.com and Best Buy stores, and is available right away. Pricing ranges from $1,000 to $1,300 depending on the options.   Tags: Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

According to the authors, the report covers "the motivation and scope of Moscow’s intentions regarding US elections and Moscow’s use of cyber tools and media campaigns to influence US public opinion." In the preamble to the report, the authors made all remarks needed for such an important document. For example, the published document is described as a "declassified version of a highly classified assessment" that has been submitted only to the US president and to people approved by the President. In such a context, the declassified version omits the input information and provides only the conclusive assessment US intelligence analysts. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy US Intel Report: 'RT & Sputnik Are Being Accused of Doing Journalism'The authors also underscored that they used the most advanced and refined analytical methods, especially concerning critical assessment of collected data. Thus, the report is expected to be politically unbiased and technically accurate. Moreover, they pointed out the apparent difficulties of their analytical process when it comes to cyber activities. "The nature of cyberspace makes attribution of cyber operations difficult but not impossible. Every kind of cyber operation – malicious or not – leaves a trail," according to the document. The analysts stressed that their assessment of attribution of activities in cyberspace is not a "simple statement of who conducted an operation, but rather a series of judgments that describe whether it was an isolated incident, who was the likely perpetrator, that perpetrator’s possible motivations, and whether a foreign government had a role in ordering or leading the operation." Such a long and sophisticated preamble to the report is indicative of its considerable political importance though. The political significance of the document can be considered in two dimensions, according to an article in the Russian online publication Gazeta.ru. "On the one hand, the authors send a signal to the next US presidential administration that they are ready to cooperate and this report is just their job. On the other hand, finally the US intelligence community seems to be ready to express solidarity with the Barack Obama administration on Russia’s meddling in the election," the article read. © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes WikiLeaks: US Intel Report on Russia Hacking 'Has Poor Sourcing and No Evidence'The analysis came to a conclusion: "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.  Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments." "Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations – such as cyber activity – with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls,'" the report read. Furthermore, the report also read that the Russian military intelligence (GRU) used a hacker or a group of hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 and the whistleblowing project WikiLeaks, in order to publish leaked data, including emails of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). WikiLeaks was quick to respond to the allegations, saying: "US government's declassified 'Russian hacking' report has the curious disclaimer that it is based on watching TV and reading Tweets."

The assessment provided in the report is unlikely to have a serious impact on relations between Washington and Moscow, according to Ivan Kurilla, a professor at the European University at St. Petersburg. "I think that in this situation no one gains anything. Of course, nothing will change for those who don’t like Putin. As for those supporting Putin, this report is another example of his valor. I don’t think the situation will change," Kurilla told Gazeta.ru. © REUTERS/ Carlo Allegri/File Photo Trump Says US Intel Has 'Absolutely No Evidence' Alleged Hacking Affected ElectionRussian officials have repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. After receiving an intelligence briefing on the report, US President-elect Trump said the election outcome had not been affected. US House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan also suggested that the assessment should not be used by partisans to delegitimize Trump's presidency. Kurilla also suggested that President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to embrace a more hardline stance towards Moscow, in a bid to shake off a reputation of a pro-Kremlin man. "There are no guarantees that this will work. If he does he will have to prove he didn’t have contacts with Russia. Such a defensive position is not good for Trump. He is likely to apply a different approach, stressing that Moscow is a friend, not a foe," Kurilla concluded.  ...

The document entitled "Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections" was jointly prepared by analysts of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA).] This report is a trick. There is just no possible way all three of these agencies could be this stupid. They are trying to make it look fake in a calculated way. For example switching the date from April 7th to July 4th: well July 4th is Independence Day, a date which registers pride in every American, even when reported on RT as a mistake. It is also difficult to believe that the CIA-FBI-NSA could ever be so utterly and blindly supportive of Hillary Clinton or the Democrats, to make charges that look this ridiculous and transparently false. It looks like they are sandbagging on Hilary's unpopularity and how idiotic these charges sound to send secret messages to people or something. If this is the best the US has, then they are all doomed. This report just has to be some kind of advanced trick, designed to distract people from some more important deeper purpose to all of this election hacking nonsense. I no longer believe that these intelligence agencies believe in this report at face value. They seem to be making purposeful and amateur-like errors, to cover-up something else entirely. These guys are acting like idiots on purpose, and the report is posing as an amateurish joke, while masquerading some serious forms of maliciousness hidden underneath. Why is the US government pretending to look so stupid and moronic to the rest of the world? Reply drblack 22:40 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete AHAHAHAHA!!!!

While it reinforces hysteria in some, more and more people are getting tired of this hateful stunt. Trump wants to improve relations with Russia in a sincere way and he has popular support on this. He will prevail no matter how hard these hawks try to stop them. They are just exposing their true colors. Long before WikiLeaks brought this out, Trump had huge crowds that quickly filled any facility he used. Despite all the negative press coverage and the polls they used, it was clear the presidency was within his grasp throughout the campaign. As far as Russia helping him goes it was his words that made a difference. The whole idea of getting along and working with Russia and not against was popular. Reply Adrienne Adonis 23:43 08.01.2017 | 2 | Edit | Delete All of their assessments is based on judgements and percentages ............ The report has to be written this way in order to avoid egg on their faces. They have no choice but to stick to their own narratives.

When I first saw the first political adds, the one I saw was NOT from Russia. It was from MSN online. They had a CLINTON picture saying to click, saying I am with you. SWAMP POLITICS. Not a single Trump add was there. ALL was ridicule and saying he should step off. I saw the potential and came and said, they don't have an idea what they facing. Not even OBAMA have an idea. They will lose and will never understand it. I understand the kind TRUMP is . But they don't. Just KEEP pushing buttons to please OBAMA , Clinton. Actually it was their own fault, that TRUMP won. But that happened long ago. \You don';t go to an educated country spreading that BULL HORN. TRUMP would had respond harshly IF he found real evidence. Electoral college went and accessed the same evidence. And found no evidence of tampering with U.S elections. Was all BULL HORN from a server that did NOT stopped Democrats from voting. \ Time to MATURE. Reply hopscotch64 04:28 09.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete The sanctions keep coming and the troops keep moving east and war is on the horizon. Russia cannot continue to ignore these developments and pretend it is business as usual. Trump today is signaling that he accepts the intel evaluation and no matter what is being said about this incident not changing Russian/US relations, it certainly will and not for the good.

They would need to invest time and effort far beyond their budget to research background information on Podesta's connections to the Clinton Foundation, or that the US State department knowing allowed arms supplies to be channeled to ISIS. In Auckland we have only one newspaper, and its 'World' page is buried somewhere between Christmas sales and Real estate advertisements.😀Most world stories are just cut and pasted from the Associated Press, Washington Times etc. 😀 Local journalists spend most of their time covering stories about such things as traffic accidents, whale sightings and ... real estate prices then off for drinks at 16:30 on Friday. Without the support of the large news organisations provincial newspapers can only publish the stories coming down the wire. So if the Main Stream Media choose to run weeks of stories about a diversion they effectively mask for the greater public, the more important issues of corruption and duplicitious foreign policy. It is called 'framing' I believe. Reply affordable.guy 05:07 09.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete Can you say: Pathetic loser's? Sure, I knew you could.

Plaintiff: 'Err, I got you your honour – we overheard Russians laughing with joy after Trump won the election.' Judge: 'O-k everybody, court dismissed.' Seriously, this needs to be taken to some kind of International Tribunal for slander, and the phoney US intelligence better have some good hard evidence or Russia to sue for billions and the result of the court outcome to be broadcast on every MSM outlet in the world.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

The big deal with this refresh is that not only has LG stuffed seventh-generation Intel processors into these laptops, but batteries capable of up to 24 hours of use on a single charge. That is a bold claim, but the company states that its LG Chem branch is using new materials in the batteries it’s producing, enabling the long lifespans. News of the refresh stem out of LG Electronics in South Korea and lists eight models spanning 15.6, 14, and 13.3-inch form factors. There are actually two sets of LG Gram laptops: one “Alligram” group weighing between 2.07 pounds and 2.40 pounds, and an ultra-light “Glimmer” group with devices weighing from 1.82 pounds to 2.16 pounds. Here are the refreshed laptops in the first Alligram group: 15Z970-GA75K 14Z970-GA5HK 13Z970-GR30K 13ZD970-GX3PK Size: 15.6 inches 14 inches 13.3 inches 13.3 inches Panel type: IPS IPS IPS IPS Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 Processor: Core i7-7500U Core i5-7200U Core i3-7100U Core i3-7100U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Memory: 16GB DDR4 @2,133MHz (8GB x 2) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (8GB + one open) 4GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB + one open) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB x 2) Storage: 512GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Weight: 2.40 pounds 2.13 pounds 2.07 pounds 2.07 pounds Color: Snow Pearl White Snow Pearl White Snow Pearl White Metal Pink Ports: HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 Battery: 60 Watt-hour 60 Watt-hour 60 Watt-hour 60 Watt-hour Max battery usage: 22 hours 23 hours 24 hours 24 hours OS: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Unknown Price: $2,049 $1,480 $1,279 $1,187 LG Electronics labels this group as Alligram, which is apparently short for “All Day Gram.” The company doesn’t explain what exactly makes the 60 Watt-hour battery so special in this group, only stating that owners won’t need to carry a heavy charger or hunt down an electrical outlet in coffee shops. The company adds that these batteries feature fast charging too, coughing up three hours of use after charging for merely 20 minutes and up to 10 hours after charging for a single hour. In addition to a new battery, LG Electronics also improved the internal cooling system by optimizing the blade structure of the cooling fan. The fan is based on a material that causes less sound, thus the laptop only reaches up to 30 decibels (dB). The fan is also 40 percent larger than the one used in the previous generation and the passageways that send the heat outward are twice as large too. Other notable features with the Alligram group include backlighting in the keyboard that can be switched on and off, optional fingerprint readers, and optional touchscreens. The company notes that this group will actually offer three colors instead of the two listed above — Snow Pearl White, Dark Silver, and Metal Pink. Now here are the four ultra-light Glimmer models: 15Z970-EA50K 14Z970-EA50K 13Z970-ER3NK 13ZD970-EX3PK Size: 15.6 inches 14 inches 13.3 inches 13.3 inches Panel type: IPS IPS IPS IPS Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 1,920 x 1,080 Processor: Core i5-7200U Core i5-7200U Core i3-7100U Core i3-7100U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 620 Memory: 8GB DDR4 @2,133MHz (8GB + one open) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (8GB + one open) 4GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB + one open) 8GB DDR4 @ 2,133MHz (4GB x 2) Storage: 256GB SSD 256GB SSD 180GB SSD 256GB SSD Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Wireless AC (2×2) Weight: 2.16 pounds 1.89 pounds 1.82 pounds 1.82 pounds Color: Snow Pearl White Snow Pearl White Metal Pink Metal Pink Ports: HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 HDMI USB Type-C USB 3.0 Battery: 34 Watt-hour 34 Watt-hour 34 Watt-hour 34 Watt-hour OS: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Home Unknown Price: $1,530 $1,446 $1,196 $1,137 As the specs show, the thinner form factor required LG Electronics to swap out the special 60 Watt-hour battery for a 34 Watt-hour version. There are no seventh-generation Core i7 processor in this group, there is not a 512GB SSD option, nor is there a model that ships with 16GB of system memory. Otherwise, these four units are similar in features. Of course, that could change when LG’s updated Gram notebooks begin to ship. More: As thin as cardboard, LG’s ‘wallpaper’ OLED TV slaps on your wall like a poster As the charts above show, the Alligram group will range between $1,187 and $2,049 whereas the Glimmer group will range from $1,137 to $1,530. All these numbers are converted from South Korean Won, so they may change when the units arrive in North America. Currently, they are set to hit store shelves in the first half of 2017, so there could be adjustments in the pricing before then. Also watch: Share

The new range includes the highly-anticipated next-generation Republic of Gamers (ROG) Maximus IX gaming motherboards — with Maximus IX Apex having already secured its place in history by claiming eight world records and 13 global first places in some of the world’s toughest benchmarks. Also included in the lineup are the latest ROG Strix gaming motherboards for style-conscious enthusiast, the all-new ASUS Prime series for everyday customization and tuning, and the latest ASUS TUF boards with 24/7 stability and newly-added overclocking abilities. The ASUS workstation motherboard series has also been updated for the Z270 revolution — and all boards are loaded with exclusive technologies to enable users to extract every ounce of performance from Intel’s latest CPUs. Commenting on the Z270 motherboard series, Joe Hsieh, ASUS Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Motherboard Business Unit & New Product Planning Division said, "Our previous generations have been validated and most awarded by many respected media outlets, proving that ASUS is the number-one motherboard brand. We strive to offer Best-selling, Easy-to-use, Stable and Trusted motherboards — that’s why we call them BEST. For our Z270 generation, we’ve taken innovation and customization to the max, with personalization features such as Aura Sync RGB lighting and support for 3D-printed components. We’ve also co-operated with Shapeways to launch a dedicated ASUS shop where users are able to purchase, download and customize and 3D-printable accessories worldwide — so they’ll never again have to stare into a drab, unexciting computer case. It’s time to unlock the power of 7th Generation Intel Core processors — and an ASUS Z270-series motherboard is the perfect way to do just that!" Built for performance: Multiple overclocking-friendly technologies ASUS is the world's foremost motherboard manufacturer. Our world-class research-and-development teams are devoted to providing the best performance to users, with exhaustive testing that exceeds industry standards, giving users the ability and confidence to overclock to 5.0GHz or even beyond — and all with a single click from the ready-made UEFI profile. ASUS Z270 motherboards have multiple features to aid overclockers in their endeavors. ASUS-exclusive 5-Way Optimization dynamically optimizes essential aspects of the system based on real-time use, including the all-new Stress Test Distribution feature that allows users to adjust the proportion of CPU and DRAM stress for the best overclocking performance. As well, the latest-generation Fan Xpert 4 allows users to monitor the GPU temperature to ensure cooler usage scenarios when the graphics card is under heavy loads, such as during 3D content creation or when gaming. ASUS Pro Clock technology has a dedicated base-clock (BCLK) generator designed for 7th Generation Intel processors, enabling overclocked base-clock frequencies of up to 425MHz and beyond. It works in tandem with the ASUS TurboV Processing Unit (TPU) to enhance voltage and base-clock overclocking control, and boosts performance up to 5.4GHz and beyond. Third-generation ASUS T-Topology takes DDR4 memory overclocking to new heights — up to 4133MHz or even beyond. Refined manufacturing ensures ultra-consistent quality and minimal crosstalk between custom trace paths, so users can enjoy the thrill of overclocking DDR4 with time-aligned signaling for superior stability. And ASUS motherboards are tested for compatibility with industry-leading 790+ DDR4 memory modules — for great flexibility and reassurance. Built for customization: Aura Sync and 3D-printable components ASUS Aura Sync is the world's first motherboard-RGB-synchronization technology, delivering distinctive light shows across Aura Sync-capable motherboards, graphics cards and peripherals for up to nine effects — all controlled via the simple and intuitive Aura app. The all-new Music mode is also able to pulse synchronized LEDs in time to the user’s favorite tunes. Users are able enhance their illumination still further, either via the integrated 4-pin/12V Aura RGB header or the included extension cable.

I don't like the decals and "ROG!" badges shown in some other pics. I really don't like the Apex having traces for both DDR4 and DDR3 at the expense of 2 DDR4 slots. It isn't that hard to stabilize DDR4 - most of the problems are just users not understanding the CPUs have the IMC and are specified for 2133/2400 and expecting 3600 to work out of the box. Heck, I still see posts on the ROG forums of people shouting "ATTENTION: M8HERO FORCING MY 3200 RAM TO 2133 THIS BOARD SUX!!!!"

"Only thing I could tell you was when he came out of Iraq, he wasn't feeling too good," his uncle, Hernan Rivera, told Newark's Star-Ledger newspaper. His aunt told the newspaper that Santiago was hospitalised after returning from Iraq. Related Content Suspect in Florida shooting charged with federal crimes, could face death penalty Gun given back to Florida shooting suspect "He lost his mind," Ruiz Rivera said in Spanish. He had seemed to get the help he needed, and became a father in September, she told Noticias Telemundo. But his mental health issues, she said, worsened in December. Advertisement "They took him to the hospital, but they didn't tell me what for, but they had him in an isolated room because he was a little wrong in the head and he started to like hear things," she said. Santiago should have been hospitalised for longer than four days given the gravity of his claims, his brother, Bryan Santiago, said, according to NBC News.

Federal law enforcement officials investigated Santiago last year. He told FBI agents that he heard voices in his head that told him to watch Islamic State videos, but he said he was in control and had no intention of hurting anyone, according to The New York Times.

"The area was crowded with newly-arrived passengers retrieving their luggage," according to a news release from the Department of Justice. "Santiago started shooting, aiming at his victims' heads until he was out of ammunition." SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago flew specifically to Florida to carry out the attack. Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office Santiago is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday at 11am before a magistrate judge in Fort Lauderdale. Investigators said on Saturday that Santiago drew frequent police attention for domestic violence in his Alaska home town and twice was arrested within the past year. Two months before the shooting, they said, he was admitted to a mental-health facility after showing up at an FBI field office and telling agents that his mind was being controlled, complaining that the government was forcing him to watch Islamic State videos. Police held his gun for a month and then gave it back to him, authorities said. Those sporadic run-ins now raise questions about how Santiago evaded detection as he boarded two flights – checking in a weapon – before he landed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and allegedly fired at unsuspecting travellers. Investigators said they were still trying to determine if there was a terrorism motive. A day after the shooting, agents had interviewed more than 100 people, including Santiago, who surrendered after firing all of his ammunition by dropping onto the floor, spread-eagle, near a baggage area when a sheriff's deputy approached him, according to an FBI affidavit. Investigators are scouring Santiago's electronics and digital media and are trying to determine whether he had any real contact with Islamic State sympathisers, and whether that motivated him to carry out the shooting, said a law enforcement official familiar with the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We have not ruled out anything," George Piro, the FBI special agent in charge of the bureau's Miami division, said on Saturday morning at a briefing. "We continue to look at all avenues, all motives for this attack. And we continue to look at the terrorism aspect as a motive." The bloody rampage sent people scrambling through the terminals and across the airfield at one of the country's busiest airports, shutting down all flights for hours as paramedics flooded the scene along with federal and local law enforcement officers. Six people were injured in the shooting, and dozens more were hurt in the chaos that followed. Santiago was placed in federal custody on Saturday morning, following a lengthy interview by Broward County Sheriff's deputies and FBI agents. The federal charges against him are: performing an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation that caused serious bodily injury; using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence; and causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm. The FBI is leading a sprawling investigation that spans from Florida to Alaska. Names of the victims have not yet been released, because not all families have been notified. The Associated Press reported that at least four of the five were vacationers picking up their bags before going to board cruise ships. Santiago is believed to have lived most recently in Anchorage, with a girlfriend and a young child. Neighbours said two other children also lived at the house. Local police and FBI officials in a Saturday news conference described his life as chaotic, with frequent police run-ins. At least four times in 2016, police were called to Santiago's house for physical disturbances or domestic violence. It is unclear who made those calls. In one case, he appears to have taken a plea deal and, in exchange for compliance with its terms, the charges were dismissed. When he showed up in November at the local FBI office, he had a newborn and a weapon in the car, Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley said. But in an interview at the time with the FBI, Santiago stated that "he did not wish to harm anyone," said Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the FBI's Anchorage field office. "Our agents contacted local authorities who took custody of Mr Santiago and transported him to a local mental-health facility for evaluation," Ritzman said. He said that the FBI interviewed his family members, conducted database reviews and interagency checks, and ultimately closed what it termed an "assessment" of Santiago. Santiago's weapon was logged "for safekeeping," Tolley said. But one month later, the weapon was released to him. Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale on Friday after flying from Anchorage, with a layover in Minneapolis. He travelled alone and checked a single bag – one that contained his firearm, said Jesse Davis, chief of police at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where passengers routinely check weapons. "We're a big hunting state, so we get quite a lot of that," Davis said. Travellers are allowed to bring firearms with them onto flights as long as the guns are unloaded, locked in a hard-sided container and in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Ammunition can be brought onto flights but also must be placed in checked baggage. "Everything appeared normal," Davis said. Santiago checked in for his Delta flight more than four hours early, which was unusual, Davis said, but "didn't call attention to himself at all." In Fort Lauderdale, at the Terminal 2 baggage claim, Santiago picked up his bag from the carousel, went to the bathroom and loaded his Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun, federal officials said. When he came out, he began firing, shooting the first people he encountered, according to an FBI affidavit. Mario Andrade, a driver from Carey Limousine, was waiting for his customer, Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, near the bottom of the escalator in the Delta baggage area of Terminal 2. He was holding a sign with Fleischer's last name and talking on the phone with another driver. Fleischer's 12:15pm flight was late, and it was nearly 1pm. Then, Andrade heard gunfire. "It was very fast, like tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat," Andrade said. "I said, 'Oh my God, someone is shooting!' " He said that he immediately dropped to the floor, people were running and he heard screaming all around him. Andrade said he looked up and saw a man in a blue shirt who had a gun in his hand. The gunman, he said, began walking slowly toward him and had a "surprised look" on his face, "like, 'Oh my God, what happened?'

More videos US Senators weigh in on Russia sanctions US Republican Senators criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin as the Obama administration prepared to announce a series of retaliatory measures against Russia for hacking the US election. This Week host George Stephanopolous reminded Obama that he had dismissed Republican Mitt Romney's contention during a debate in the 2012 campaign that Russia was the biggest geopolitical threat to the United States. The report released on Friday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Russian operatives hacked into the emails of Democratic Party officials and released them publicly to harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and, ultimately, help Republican Donald Trump, who emerged victorious. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Obama says he underestimated the degree to which cyber hacking could influence an election. Photo: AP Obama said he ordered the the intelligence review "to make sure that we understand this is something that Putin has been doing for quite some time in Europe, initially in the former satellite states where there are a lot of Russian speakers, but increasingly in Western democracies." Trump, who has expressed scepticism over the findings, received a private briefing on the report from US officials on Friday in New York. In a statement afterward, Trump acknowledged that foreign actors from China, Russia and other countries attempt to hack into US institutions, but he emphasised that the election outcomes were not altered in any way by foreign actors. The intelligence report stated that officials did not attempt to assess the effect on the outcome. Advertisement Obama reiterated his concerns that some Republicans seem "to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be." Asked if Obama included Trump in that category, the president said: "We have to remind ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin's not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this country feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a threat to him, then we're gonna have bigger problems than just cyber hacking." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Obama: "Russia is not on our team." Photo: AP Some Republican leaders expressed their own concerns about Russia and questioned Trump's judgment in disputing the intelligence community's work. In an interview on NBC's Meet The Press," Senator Lindsey O. Graham, R-S.C., said: "When it comes to Trump and Russia, I am really perplexed. I'm not questioning his motives. I'm questioning President-elect Trump's judgment. I don't care why the Russians hacked into our system. I don't care if they were trying to help Trump or trying to help Clinton. I want to stop it. I don't know what drives him on Russia, but I do know this. That if our policies don't change vis a vis Russia, the worst is yet to come. And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does."

Page 1 of 5. 29 Comments In preparation for Intel Kaby Lake socketed CPU benchmark results soon on Phoronix, the past number of days I have been re-tested many of the systems in our benchmark server room for comparing to the performance of the new Kaby Lake hardware. For those wanting to see how existing Intel and AMD systems compare when using Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 and the latest Linux 4.10 Git kernel, here are those benchmarks ahead of our Kaby Lake Linux CPU reviews. 26 different Intel/AMD CPUs/APUs were tested for this comparison and all of them were running Ubuntu 16.10 with the Linux 4.10 kernel. Each system had an appropriate motherboard and each system was using the maximum number of memory channels supported for the given system and at the maximum supported memory frequency. None of the CPUs in this comparison were overclocked. These tests are focusing exclusively on the CPU performance and not the graphics or storage performance due to those components varying in the test systems. Those wanting to see integrated graphics results can see yesterday's Intel IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1. The CPUs/APUs chosen were simply with what hardware I had available and for the systems that weren't preoccupied in other benchmarking / development tasks at Phoronix at the time of testing. Each time Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 was cleanly installed on each of the systems and using an EXT4 file-system, the stock GCC 6.2 compiler, etc. The tests were freshly built from source and the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS were set to "-O3 -march=native" for the built-from-source tests being configured to make use of each CPU's available instruction set extensions. All of these Intel/AMD Linux CPU benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. With that said, if you would like to compare how your own Linux system(s) speed compares to all of the results in this article, simply run phoronix-test-suite benchmark 1701086-RI-RACKRACK803 for your own fully-automated, side-by-side benchmark comparison.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles PC In Theory: Can AMD Ryzen break the Intel CPU monopoly? It's time for a processor upgrade - and 2017 could finally shake up the gaming CPU market. By Richard Leadbetter Published 08/01/2017 This week, we reviewed the Core i5 7600K, the latest mainstream gaming processor from Intel. The verdict? In line with every Intel Core i5 release since 2012, it's the fastest offering available in its price bracket and therefore the best buy. However, Intel has effectively had no rival for years now, leading to only small jumps in performance from one year to the next while graphics power has moved on from strength to strength. Genuine advances in CPU power are lacking to the point where Ars Technica wonders whether the desktop CPU is dead. We'd prefer to be a little more optimistic, and there are some promising signs that the processor market will get the shake-up it needs over the next 12-18 months. For starters, AMD is returning with a new 'Ryzen' CPU - and it's looking very promising. Little has been seen of the Ryzen processors' capabilities outside of controlled demos, but the impression AMD wants to give is that an eight core, 16 thread Ryzen processor is faster than an Intel equivalent. Multi-threaded benchmarks shown by AMD have revealed a 10 per cent advantage compared to an equivalent Core i7 6900K, something we've seen recently in an on-stage demo of video encoding using x264/x265 tool, Handbrake (video embedded below). The Ryzen chip was shown running at 3.4GHz with turbo disabled, while the Intel chip was operating at its stock performance of between 3.2GHz to 3.7GHz, depending on how the workload affects its turbo state. There are a few caveats to these demos - it would have been easy to lock the 6900K to the same 3.4GHz as the Ryzen chip for example, and it's direct IPC head-to-heads that are often most illuminating. Secondly, we have to wonder what market segment AMD is choosing for its Ryzen debut - by targeting the Core i7 6900K, it's attacking a highly lucrative market sector, the $1000 premium-price CPU. What we don't know is how much cheaper Ryzen will be, and what the timing is for taking on Intel in the mainstream gaming markets. An eight-core Ryzen chip for quad-core money seems... unlikely. Competition in the gaming segments will come, but in the meantime, Intel still has an iron grip on this market - perhaps explaining the lack of ground-breaking innovation. However, with the arrival of its new desktop Kaby Lake processors, what we are seeing is - perhaps - the final iteration of Intel's current mainstream i3/i5/i7 load-out of dual-core and quad-core chips. Kaby Lake features higher clocks and overclocking finally hits an attainable 5GHz, but we're hitting the frequency wall and further architectural advances in the desktop space are years away - so where does Intel go next? AMD big boss Lisa Su demos AMD Ryzen beating Intel Core i7 6900K in a video encoding benchmark. And it does so with a 95W TDP vs the Intel chip's 140W. Impressive. Recent roadmap leaks point towards a challenging time ahead for Chipzilla. 10nm chips dubbed 'Cannonlake' are coming, effectively shrinking the current processors (with tweaks) to a new 10nm process - but this appears to be limited to mobile CPUs only. The desktop chips will seemingly remain on 14nm and will retain the same Kaby Lake core - and the suggestion is that Intel will finally offer a six-core CPU solution to the mainstream market in order to provide a performance advantage over its existing parts. Prior to this, six, eight and ten core i7s have been restricted to the enthusiast market with hefty price-premiums to match. Will a mainstream six-core CPU result in lower prices for the still-excellent dual-core and quad-core Intel processors? Quite possibly, but this will depend on how competitive Ryzen is from a performance standpoint and the price-points AMD delivers. And it's also going to depend somewhat on how eager consumers are to embrace the new products. After all, AMD's efforts in offering performance and value in the GPU market with the RX 470 and RX 480 have made little impact on Nvidia's dominance, nor the pricing of GeForce products. In the mainstream market, the power of the brand is all-important - which may explain in part why AMD's early focus seems to be on the enthusiast high-end and server markets. Establishing credentials with enthusiasts and key opinion-formers, then scaling down is a good strategy. For Intel, moving up to six cores is the obvious solution to providing more performance when clocks can go no higher - and in theory, games should benefit. Virtually all modern games are built with current-gen consoles in mind, meaning that a new six-core i7 should offer tangible upgrade over today's quads. However, the reality is that despite widespread adoption of full multi-core support, something is holding back these chips from full utilisation - as I discovered last year when I compared the quad-core i7 6700K with the six-core 5820K and the mighty eight-core 5960X in a full-on Core i7 Face-Off. We want more cores and more performance - but these results suggest it's going to take a profound shift in game design to make the most of them. 1080p/Titan X Maxwell OC i7 6700K/ 3000MHz DDR4 i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ 3000MHz DDR4 i7 5820K/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5820K 4.6GHz/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5960X/ 3200MHz DDR4 i7 5960X 4.4GHz/ 3200MHz DDR4 Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 88.4 89.3 84.2 84.6 84.4 84.6 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA 124.4 124.7 119.4 120.8 124.4 125.5 Grand Theft Auto 5, Ultra, no MSAA 89.4 92.7 79.0 86.7 81.9 90.3 Far Cry 4, Ultra, SMAA 120.4 125.9 92.0 104.5 84.8 95.4 Shadow of Mordor, Ultra, FXAA 141.0 142.9 139.6 139.5 139.9 139.9 The Witcher 3, Ultra, HairWorks Off, Custom AA 105.8 106.4 103.4 103.4 103.5 103.8 The surprise result was that in only in the most well-threaded titles did the six and eight core chips perform better than the quad, and for the most part, the mainstream i7 6700K beat off the challenge of its competitors. A more modern Intel architecture (Skylake vs Haswell) combined with higher clocks proved decisive - and in titles run by one dominant core (the Far Cry engine is a great example of this), the 6700K didn't just inch-out the many-core competition, but clock-for-clock at 4.6GHz, it offered a 15 per cent advantage over a six-core i7 5820K. The remarkable reality is that even though we're now well into the new console era, where multi-threaded game engines are the norm, performance in PC gaming is still more reliant on efficient architecture paired with high per-core frequency than it is on core count. At this point, it's fair to say that the PC's legacy underpinnings - specifically the DirectX 11 API - are perhaps more of a serious bottleneck to performance increases. This is likely to continue because DX12 - which brings multi-core optimisation to the fore - still isn't the primary target for games developers. Instead, we've only seen DX11 ports to the new API, as opposed to new engines built from the ground up for the new technology. All of which is to say that a potential move from four to six cores for Intel will be an enthusiast crowd-pleaser, but actual performance increases in games may be fairly minimal without a profound shift in the way titles are made. It'll take time but history suggests we'll get there eventually - after all, there was a time when an Intel dual-core chip was preferable to a Core 2 Quad, a processor that proved to have a far longer lifespan overall. Rich's video review of the Core i5 7600K - by default it's the best mainstream gaming CPU, but improvements over Skylake are minimal. However, in the short term, the continuing importance of single core performance also lays down a daunting challenge to AMD: either it matches or exceeds Intel's IPC and clocks, or it provides a better balance of price vs performance. Ideally we'd like to see both but value can be defined in many ways, of course. A standard, single-socket motherboard standard with more longevity than the Intel equivalent is a good start. The new AM4 standard is looking promising here, allowing entry-level CPU and APU users to transition to full-power performance processors - though this assumes that there's not an AM4+ coming along (something we saw with both FM2 and AM3). On top of that, CES announcements appear to confirm that all Ryzen chips will have unlocked multipliers and all but the very cheapest boards will allow for overclocking. This can only be good news, adding value beyond the stock clocks. Destiny: Rise of Iron guide, tips and tricks Get ahead in Year 3 of Bungie's online shooter. While games are still predominantly limited by the GPU, clearly there is an opportunity here for AMD to do well in the processor market. Many gamers are still using first and second-gen Core processors, and as we discussed last year, there are still avenues available for a cheap upgrade that offers tangible leaps in performance on these older platforms - faster memory combined with an i7 upgrade can help. But in maintaining 60fps gameplay throughout, older CPUs are starting to show their age. Meanwhile, other areas in PC hardware have become much more important, making an upgrade even more compelling: the advances made in solid-state storage are profound and wider memory bandwidth is unlocking further processor performance. To get the most out of both, a CPU and motherboard upgrade is required. It's going to be a fascinating 12-18 months. If 2018's Coffee Lake is effectively another 14nm Skylake refresh with the frequency wall hit, where does Intel go from there? More CPU cores at the top-end will help, but what extras can Intel offer the mainstream - and to what extent can Ryzen shake things up? Where AMD intends to pitch its eight core/16 thread flagship processor will set the tone for the releases to come - and we can't wait to put it through its paces later this year.

Underwhelming? Maybe. Harbinger of death for the desktop CPU? Probably not. reader comments 324 Share this story Further ReadingIntel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake review: Is the desktop CPU dead? Our review of Intel’s new flagship consumer desktop CPU, the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K, was less-than-favorable. Out of the box, the chip runs faster than the i7-6700K that preceded it, but that’s just because it ships at a higher default clock speed. When running at the same clock speed—something easily achievable because these chips are specifically intended for overclocking—CPU and GPU performance is identical. This feeds into a growing perception that, after several years of modest-at-best performance improvements, Intel is having trouble making its processors faster. Granted, that's not a problem for many casual-to-moderate PC users, and it's not like Intel's chips haven't improved in other big ways in the last half-decade. Power consumption is down, battery life is up, and integrated graphics performance isn't nearly as laughable as it was ten years ago. But for high-end pro users who don't want to spend $1,000 or more on a processor, the lack of performance improvements in Intel's mainstream quad-core desktop processors in particular has been frustrating. This is an unfortunate reality brought on by the difficulties Intel is having switching to new process architectures. Moving from the 22nm process to the 14nm process in 2013 and 2014 caused several delays that pushed back the launch of the Broadwell architecture and protracted its rollout. The move from 14nm to 10nm is proving even more difficult, breaking Intel's longstanding “tick-tock” development model in which it changed manufacturing processes every two years. If leaked roadmaps are correct, “Cannonlake” laptop chips may move to the 10nm process at the tail end of 2017. But the “Coffee Lake” desktop chips will remain on the 14nm process until well into 2018. If you don’t know why this is a big deal, here’s a brief explainer: a manufacturing process shrink makes it possible to fit more transistors in a smaller amount of space and reduce the amount of electrical current needed to switch transistors on and off (the type of material used and the type of transistor, two other things that Intel and others often change when they change processes, affects power usage too). This lets chip companies add more features and improve performance (usually by adding more transistors) while keeping power consumption at around the same level as before (or sometimes reducing it). Without process shrinks, improving performance without also hurting battery life becomes that much more difficult. That's Intel's current predicament. But it doesn’t mean that desktop performance needs to stop improving. It just means that Intel needs to do things a little differently if it wants to make those improvements. Adding more cores Surprise! Adding more cores makes CPUs faster. The 10-core and 8-core chips are well ahead of the dual- and quad-core offerings in multi-threaded tasks, regardless of architecture. The most obvious way to improve performance, at least in desktops, is to add more cores. This was what both Intel and AMD started doing a little over a decade ago when improving performance primarily through clock-speed increases began to become more difficult. And desktops have more room for cooling fans, which means that there’s headroom to push their maximum power consumption up without straining systems too badly; a mainstream quad-core desktop processor from Intel today has a TDP of 65W where a mainstream desktop Pentium 4 chip had a TDP of 115W. We wouldn’t want to return to 2004’s power consumption levels, but there’s some wiggle room. In fact, Intel already does this in its small enthusiast processor lineup. Six, eight, and ten-core processors with a 140W TDP already exist, and multi-core performance is excellent. But these CPUs are ridiculously expensive—you could build a respectable quad-core gaming computer for the cost of the $1000-ish eight-core chip, to say nothing of the $1700 ten-core version. They also use more expensive motherboards with chipsets that are updated less regularly, and they usually trail Intel’s flagship processor architectures by 12 to 18 months. Finally, they need more robust quad-channel memory controllers to keep all of those cores fed compared to the dual-channel controllers in mainstream processors. All those controllers add even more transistors and complexity. Further ReadingIntel pushes out the rest of its Kaby Lake processors for 2017’s PCs Even with those downsides, adding more cores is probably the easiest and best way to boost performance at the high-end and convince consumers to replace that three-to-five-year-old PC. Enough apps are built to take advantage of multiple cores that users would see benefits immediately. Intel’s Turbo Boost tech (particularly Turbo Boost 3.0, introduced in the aforementioned Broadwell-E CPUs but not available anywhere else yet) can maintain good performance for single-threaded or lightly threaded tasks. If the leaked roadmaps we cited before are to be believed, Intel may be planning to do this when the “Coffee Lake” processors are released in 2018. The highest-end versions of these CPUs on the roadmap are six-core part, giving users a reason to be optimistic about Intel’s fourth (!) CPU architecture shipped using some version of its 14nm process. Still, it’s disappointing that Intel has taken this long to improve its mainstream desktop processor performance, and the company could still decide to price those high-end chips far above the prices that current quad-core processors command. Luckily, some serious competition at the high end could both speed Intel up and force its prices down. Competitive pressure from AMD... and from Intel? AMD talks a big game with its upcoming desktop processors. AMD The underlying platform looks modern, at any rate. AMD Let’s begin by saying that no one in the last decade has lost money by underestimating AMD. The company’s “Bulldozer” architecture and its many descendants could never rise above mediocrity, and Intel has shut AMD out of the mid-to-high-end desktop market and almost every segment of the laptop market. AMD has a history of over-promising and under-delivering, and if Intel’s recent CPU launch delays have been disappointing, AMD’s delays are just business as usual. That said! Given what little we’ve seen about AMD’s upcoming Zen architecture (now called “Ryzen,” pronounced rye-zen), AMD might conceivably challenge Intel at the mid-to-high end of the market for the first time in years. AMD is boasting that a high-end Zen chip with eight cores and sixteen threads can hold its own with the $1,000 Intel chip we highlighted above. If AMD can deliver a full range of dual-, quad-, hexa-, and octa-cores alongside an appealing AM4 platform that provides PCI Express-based storage and integrated 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen 2—and if it can do so while significantly undercutting Intel on price—AMD could definitely regain some credibility with the enthusiast crowd. The rise of Ryzen is obviously a good thing, even if you don't want to buy into an AMD platform. If Intel feels threatened, it will be quicker to drop prices and introduce new chips to counter AMD’s. Intel just hasn’t had a reason to feel threatened in a while. Further ReadingAMD’s Zen CPU is now called Ryzen, and it might actually challenge Intel But even if AMD never fulfills its promises, Intel still has one big competitor in this space: itself. If you pay attention to the slides in Intel’s presentations and its message in recent ads, you may have noticed that the company hardly mentions AMD at all. It doesn’t spend much time comparing its newest chips to the previous generation, either. What the company focuses on overwhelmingly is PCs from about five years ago. The PC market is saturated, which means most computers sold are replacing an older one. What Intel has to do is convince you that you need a new computer, and none of the chips from the last two or three years has made a great argument for that. Processors are complicated, and two to three years normally elapse between the start of development and shipping them to consumers. Let’s assume that, as of 2013 or even 2014, Intel assumed it could still rely on the same tick-tock engine that kept things marching forward. Intel wouldn’t need to overhaul its lineup to keep selling chips because it would be able to improve speed and power consumption enough that there would be clear benefits to upgrading every three years or so, give or take a year. Now say that somewhere between the official announcement of the Kaby Lake refresh in 2015 and the public death of the tick-tock model in early 2016, Intel saw the writing on the wall and decided it couldn't just rely on improved manufacturing tech to speed up its chips. Assuming a two-to-three year lead time for new architectures, it makes sense that we won’t see six-core mainstream desktop chips from Intel until 2018. Intel just didn’t know that it would need them to keep incentivizing upgrades until pretty late in the game. Whatever the catalyst ends up being, there’s still life in the desktop CPU. Plenty of people get by with fanless convertible laptops and lightweight Ultrabooks, but people in STEM fields, graphic design, publishing, photo and video production, gaming, app development, and elsewhere can still benefit from high-end processors that are both relatively speedy and relatively affordable. For an unusually long period of time, that sweet spot has been occupied by quad-core CPUs from Intel. But in the next year or two, more competition and realigned priorities ought to get things moving again.

This news follows the partnership that was announced between the BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye in July of last year. The companies have since developed a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands. The offerings scale from individual key integrated modules to a complete end-to-end solution providing a wide range of differentiated consumer experiences. "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,” said Klaus Fröhlich, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies – manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies – to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform. This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle.”  “From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform. The car to cloud system will perform with consistent, predictable behaviour and is validated to the highest level of safety,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “That’s why this partnership is breaking new ground.  We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.” “Over the last six months, we have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs,” said Mobileye co-founder, chairman and CTO Professor Amnon Shashua. As part of this partnership, the BMW Group will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety including setting up a high performance simulation engine, overall component integration, production of prototypes and eventually scaling the platform via deployment partners. Intel brings to the partnership innovative high performance computing elements that span from the vehicle to the data center. The newly launched Intel GO solution for autonomous driving offers world class processor and FPGA technologies for the most efficient balance of performance and power, while meeting the stringent thermal and safety requirements of the automotive industry. Within the car, the Intel GO solution offers a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modelling, path planning and decision making.  In the data center, Intel GO offers a wide range of technologies ranging from the high performance Intel Xeon processors, to Intel Arria 10 FPGAs and Intel Solid State Drives to the Intel Nervana platform for artificial intelligence that provides a powerful machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry. Mobileye contributes its proprietary EyeQ 5 high-performance computer vision processor offering automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The EyeQ 5 is responsible for processing and interpretation of input from the 360-degree surround view vision sensors as well as localization. EyeQ 5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, which forms the Central Computing Platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle. Mobileye will further collaborate with the BMW Group to develop the sensor fusion solution, creating a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar, and lidar sensors. As well as establishing a driving policy, including Mobileye’s reinforcement learning algorithms used to endow the vehicle system with the artificial intelligence required to safely negotiate complex driving situations. To further propel the development of the autonomous platform, the partnership plans to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years. The BMW iNEXT model, which will be introduced in 2021, will be the foundation for BMW Group’s autonomous driving strategy. Following this vehicle, a range of highly automated models from all BMW Group brands will follow. – TradeArabia News Service Tags: Intel | BMW | autonomous vehicles | Mobileye | More Motoring Stories BMW i pilots augmented reality product visualiser Dubai Taxi set to launch smart car recovery project Toyota launches new bold, stylish 2017 Corolla Souq.com launches new automotive section Fiat Chrysler accused of emissions cheating Al Haddad Motors presents Fab 5 Volkswagen 2016 sales top 10m vehicles Volkswagen agrees $4.3bn settlement in emissions case Dubai RTA in deal with Uber to deploy 14,000 cars McLaren reports record sales growth in 2016 Hertz connects vehicles with Orange IoT solutions Ebrahim K Kanoo sponsors Japan National Day reception Infiniti showcases 'co-pilot' technology BlackBerry offers advanced OS for automotive sector BMW Group appoints head of corporate communications Michelin selected as official tyre partner for Roborace Nissan looks to ‘zero-emission, zero-fatality’ future Nissan announces key breakthrough technologies, tieups Hyundai unveils vision for hyper-connected car New colour scheme for Dubai metro feeder buses Dubai plans 64 initiatives for taxi service Dubai’s RTA links 4,500 taxis with GPS system Du provides Dubai Taxi with wi-fi, smart screen 35pc of UAE drivers to pay more for insurance Dollar Rent A Car opens new branch in Muscat airport Bahrain F1 race tickets go on sale Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds
Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Intel's 5G modem makes its debut at CES, but there's a lot of 4G tech behind it Ed Oswald Digital TrendsJanuary 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Intel's modem relies on quite a bit of 4G technology to make "5G" speeds a reality, but says it wants to lay the foundation for early trials. Still, real 5G might be years away from being a reality.More There’s a continuing argument in the wireless industry over 5G — even what it actually will look like — but that’s not stopping companies like Intel from pushing forward with efforts to at least attain 5G speeds during 2017. Intel is showing off at CES 2017 a sample of its 5G modem, which according to press materials will attain speeds of over 5Gbps. While no speed standard has been set by the industry, it’s generally agreed that 5G networks will offer multigigabit-per-second connections. Intel’s 5G modem also attains the ultra low latency and bandwidth aggregation sought by the industry as part of transition to 5G. More: AT&T lays out its 2017 5G deployment plans In more layman’s terms, in order for our wireless networks to attain those crazy speeds, devices will need to mesh together several channels of downstream data to do so. At the same time, to make all of these new technologies truly work over wireless — say augmented reality or AI-infused autonomous vehicles — you’ll need to reduce lag to almost nil to make them viable in real-time applications. Intel hopes to have samples ready by the second half of this year, with full production starting soon after. But in the interest of accuracy, we should mention that this “5G” is really just an effort to make today’s technology work in a next-generation like manner rather than a full-blown new standard. “Today’s communications systems weren’t designed to accommodate the massive bandwidth required to support such an evolution, or the ultra-low latency needed to allow devices or even vehicles to react to split-second events,” said Aicha Evans, corporate vice president and general manager of Intel’s Communication and Devices Group. What the Intel 5G modem does is take several different current technologies, including both sub-6Ghz and mmWave capabilities and MIMO. Some of these are key parts of the 3GPP 5G new radio technology, and the company says that’s by design. “Our goal is to support both early trials and to lay a foundation enabling accelerated development of products that will support the 3GPP NR specification and help drive global adoption of the 3GPP 5G standard,” Evans adds. Standard or not, it’s clear the industry is clamoring for 5G. When we actually get there though is another question — and it’s likely that we won’t see true 5G for many more years to come. There's no HTC Vive 2 (yet), but a wireless upgrade and new peripherals are incoming AT&T will begin testing 5G network technologies in Texas later this year Start getting ready for 5G!

In the past, this was a technology only reserved for Core i5 and Core i7 series processors, but times have changed. When Intel rolled out the Kaby Lake desktop processor lineup earlier this week we were excited about the Intel Core i3-7350K processor. The Intel Core i3-7350K is an interesting part it is a dual-core unlocked K-sku processor with relatively high clock speeds (4.2GHz) and hyper-threading technology for a modest $168. Not bad for a chip that has 4MB of L3 cache, Intel HD 630 graphics and a TDP of just 60 Watts. While we were meeting with Intel at CES 2017 we were shown a demo on an Intel Core i3-7350K processor overclocked to 5.0GHz. Not bad for a CPU that comes from Intel without Turbo Boost being enabled. Intel was using Mini-ITX Small Form Factor (SFF) system and was using a Corsair H115i CPU liquid cooler to pull off the rather impressive overclock. Intel Kaby Lake processors all seem to overclock to 5.0GHz and beyond, so we are really excited about the headroom in this new 14nm processor series. Intel ran Cinebench R15 on the system and got an overall score of 514 points on the standard CPU test that runs on all available cores/threads and then 204 points on the CPU single core test. We took a peak at the CPU core voltage in CPU-Z to see what Intel was using on the MSI Z270 mini-ITX board and the software was showing it was using 1.440V, which isn’t too bad. Single-threaded performance looks great on this processor, so we see it being a hit for those that can get away with two physical cores. A dual-core processor with Hyper-Threading running at 5 GHz yields a very responsive system when combined with a SATA SSD or PCIe SSD. Those looking for a low-cost build should be able to build a system around this processor and use a low-cost high-capacity hard drive and then a 16GB Intel Optane Memory M.2 solution to also have a peppy little system without breaking the bank. We have an Intel Core i3-7350K processor being delivered this week and will have our own in-depth review and analysis real soon. We are excited by Intel’s teaser and hope you are as well! Paulo Felisberto Not that impressive if it requires a Z motherboard. Maybe if some vendor releases BIOS for H110 or B150/B250 Motherboards, it turns diferente as it worked with old Pentium K G3258 Terry Perry Like my 6350 AMD 6 core. Tried to load Titan 2 the game came on and said the game needs a Real 4 core to run.go get the I7. gerwingr Exciting, i say that because, i am so finding that going from 32 bit to 64 bit operating system: that core speed, and fast hard drive response, is so needed. i have championed my getting my video work done on x58 operating platforms. i have moved from 920’s to 960’s and am in the blueprint of getting to where many of you have been for years. i have purchased a 980x and have on call a 990, what i have found, is higher clock, and limited threads, still gets my video work done quicker, what i speculate is, my program is one or two core efficient ” that”s all ” call me out on my errors, but going up to 4 Ghz. has made a striking improvement. So, i would like to follow these benchmarks with an i3, and go to the z270 platform, to get the equivalent or better. then on craigslist, goes all my old hardware. i would like to follow along on your test and set up, and build two systems. i know of x99 v3, ” like it, but still retro imo” i think you can get me into ddr4 with this, and i won’t stay stuck with ddr3 🙂 ., cheers, love reading your set ups, builds, and testing, thomas, gx, vancouver canada, best 2017 to yourselves and readers.

Politics Entertainment World U.S. Tech Arts + Culture Drink + Food Style via Twitter Joke’s on You The Media’s Favorite ‘Millennial’ Is 55 Years Old Dan Nainan is known as a 35-year-old former Intel engineer who now makes millions as a comedian. The fact that he’s 20 years older is the least weird part of his story. Ben Collins 01.05.17 6:13 AM ET Last week, it happened again. This time it was Forbes, smack dab in the headline. “Millennial Dan Nainan Left Intel To Make His Millions Entertaining Others With Comedy.” Millennial Dan Nainan has been the go-to millennial in a whole lot of news stories in the past year. He was 35 in an AP story that appeared in the Chicago Tribune about undecided voters on Nov. 6, two days before the election. A few weeks later, he was 35 in a Vocativ story about Obama voters who wound up voting for Donald Trump. “I think people who felt like an underdog might have identified with Trump more, because he was being picked on so much,” Nainan said. “I felt it was very liberating to vote for him and thumb my nose at everybody.” There he was again in Cosmopolitan in July. This time he was a millennial who swore off porn. “Of course I liked looking at it, but after awhile, something about it struck me as wrong,” he said. He claimed once in an interview that the website Help a Reporter Out had gotten him “100 media placements, large and small” by 2013, from Fox News to CNN to NPR. For reporters, Nainan’s a unicorn: a punctual, on-topic, quasi-funny man with a hell of a life story. Just ask Forbes. Nainan left his career as a senior engineer at Intel to travel the world and tell jokes. Twenty-eight countries and a Tesla, all by the age of 35. He’s performed for Donald Trump. He’s met Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama endorsed him in a four-second YouTube video. And on Sept. 11, 2001, while at Intel, Nainan “was able to watch both towers fall from his corner in Manhattan, NYC,” according to Business Insider in 2011. “After watching so many people die right in front of him, he realized that he needed a change. He left his job to pursue comedy full time,” Business Insider’s Personal Branding Blog wrote. Wait a minute. “A few years prior to September 11th, 2001, Dan Nainan was a senior engineer with Intel Corp.,” the story reads. It’s written by Millennial Branding LLC media branding expert Bill Connolly. “His job was to travel the world with Chairman Andy Grove, doing technical demonstrations on stage at events.” After years of giving technical demonstrations with the chairman of Intel, millennial Dan Nainan, then 20 years old, watched the towers fall from his corner office as a senior engineer, and decided he needed a career change? “His story is incredible, though as we are learning, not unique,” Connolly writes.

Nainan was 36 in 2012 in The Wall Street Journal, but 31 in The New York Times in the same year. In 2006, he remembered when he got the bug to do comedy: In 1998, while he was working as a senior engineer at Intel. As a 17-year-old. Then, there it is on paper: a Maryland traffic court case from last year. “Failure to display registration card upon demand by police officer.” Daniel Nainan of New York City. Date of birth: May 1961. And then, for good measure, there’s a Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department incident report for the time a sprightly 32-year-old Nainan punched then-Daily Beast reporter Josh Rogin after he made fun of his set at a D.C. comedy club in 2013. (Rogin and I have never met, for what it’s worth.) Under “exact age or range” it says this: 52. Nainan pleaded guilty and served probation. A Virginia speeding ticket in the database Lexis-Nexis says Nainan was pulled over for speeding in 1987. The ticket is so old that it’s not retrievable anywhere but on archived public-records searches. Fairfax County General District Court only retains records for resolved traffic cases for 10 years, according to both a FCGDC spokesperson and Virginia law. Millennial Dan Nainan would’ve had to have been a 6-year-old with a speeding ticket. “He’s been called that several times,” said Rob Maher, who has been sparring with Nainan for years now, of Nainan being described as a millennial. “He’s obsessed with being 20 years younger than he really is.” Millennial millionaire Dan Nainan is 55 years old. He doesn’t really even look 35. If you Google Dan Nainan, it will say his age: 55 years old. There’s even a website called ComedianDanNainanIsOver50YearsOldAndHisFollowersAreFake.com. Last week, one of the world’s most successful international comedians, Russell Peters, called him a “sociopath that is a 55yr old man child” on Twitter. Nainan used to open for him. It is not a well-kept secret. So why is he telling every journalist he can find that he’s something else? And why hasn’t anybody told them? *** The first of the few hundred angry emails Joe Robinson got from Dan Nainan came a little while after they did a show together at a Hyatt in Bethesda, Maryland. Joe was the headliner and Dan was the emcee. “It went all right. After the show, he sold a book, a DVD, and a CD. He did eight minutes of comedy. So I decided to say something about it, about how he shouldn’t be selling a book about how to make it in comedy if he’s emceeing at a Hyatt,” Robinson said. He then brought up the exchange on his podcast with Maher, a fellow D.C.- and Baltimore-based comedian. “He’s had a long reputation of having battles with comics. I didn’t know that,” said Robinson. “To be frank with you, I never would’ve said anything if I had known that back then.” Ever since, Robinson has been on an infamous email chain featuring every comic who has ever slighted Dan Nainan. “I’ve gotten, without exaggeration, 300 emails,” he said. Sometimes the emails were only addressed to him. Sometimes they were to every comic, dozens of them, all lumped in together. At their peak, they’d come a few times per day. The gist of the emails? Nainan would go down his rival comics’ tour dates and alert them to the much bigger room he would be performing at halfway across the world on the same day. “He loves to say comedians are drunks and drug addicts, and he likes to champion that he’s a clean-living person,” said Maher. That’s just the start of it. “He can play 19 instruments. He speaks x number of languages fluently, flies first class, drives a Tesla. I’ve never met anybody that cared more about what other people thought,” said Robinson. “Did he tell you about how he’s able to slam dunk a basketball?” There were times, Robinson said, where it got out of hand. Robinson claims Nainan called his bosses at his day job at one point to try to get him fired. “I saw him. I made fun of him. I just made fun of the practice of what he was doing once. He went through a criminal history. He talked to my employers,” said Robinson. “Then there was that email he offered to fight me to the death on the Isle of Man.” That’s not a joke. “Yeah, he gave places you’re allowed to legally fight to the death,” said Maher. “No, we’re not going to fight you to the death. By the way, my buddy has kids. He’s gonna fight to the death? Just be 55. It’s OK.” All of this because Joe made fun of him for selling a book at a Hyatt? “If you think this is bad, you should talk to J-L Cauvin,” said Robinson. *** “I became his enemy No. 1,” said J-L Cauvin. Cauvin is a part-time comic who’s also a lawyer in New York. He doesn’t have many dates booked nowadays, he said, but he is a regular on The Adam Carolla Show. He spends a lot of time wondering what it’s going to take to break through, if he’s on the precipice of something big, or if he said the wrong thing to the wrong booker along the way. One time, he wrote a blog post about “how feature acts are being squeezed out of comedy, like the middle class in America.” He mentioned corporate comedians, ones who play birthday parties and company meetings for cash. He mentioned Dan Nainan. “He wrote about 40 comments under his real name under the post,” said Cauvin. “He’s never subtle about this stuff.” After his blog post, Cauvin made the email list. Probably the top of the list. “I became the go-to,” said Cauvin. “In the mass emails, I’m the one he’s calling out a lot of the time. I’m the specific target. They were insane and mean-spirited emails. It took a turn for the aggressive." Then, by some miracle, the emails stopped. And that miracle was Patrick Melton. Melton was on the list. He has a comedy podcast called Nobody Likes Onions. He knows Joe and Rob and J-L and a lot of the other people on the chain. “I kept badgering [Nainan] to do the podcast. I said, ‘I’ll let you talk as much as you want.’ I knew if I didn’t have him come on, I’d regret it,” Melton said. “I don’t get it because he’s successful. He goes to do these corporate gigs. I’d imagine he makes a half-million a year doing comedy. It seems to drive him nuts he doesn’t have respect. I don’t get why he needs approval of these ‘nobodies,’ as he calls them.” Plus, Melton was not particularly worried about a visit to the Isle of Man. “I’m a big dude, anyway,” he said. Nainan shows up on the podcast in April 2015. He lies about his age. He says, jokingly, over and over that he’s 74. Otherwise, the show goes smoothly. Joe Robinson and a few other comics call in and Melton plays mediator. “After the show, I say, ‘We should get all the comics you hated on, the ones you emailed, and let’s put on a charity show.’ He agreed to do all that. He took a photo with me. He seemed happy,” said Melton. “Then he left.” Within 20 minutes of leaving, Nainan blocked Melton and his podcast on Twitter and never answered an email from him again, Melton said. “Whatever that interview did broke him. He stopped the emails to everybody. He stopped harassing me entirely,” he said. So that might be why Nainan, a 55-year-old man, winds up giving millennial sex tips in Cosmo in July and nobody corrects it until months later. Cauvin said he feels bad for him a little bit, but he also doesn’t want the emails to restart. “I feel bad, but it also feels like there’s some sort of danger to it. Other than speaking to you, I, for the most part, have abstained from talking about it. It’s 85 percent because I don’t want to bother him,” said Cauvin. “It’s like Catch Me if You Can. That’s what I’m worried about, is that one day he’ll get a movie out of his bad behavior.” After all, if this is a bit, it’s the best bit Dan Nainan has ever dreamed up. He’s duped the media countless times just by going onto a help-a-reporter website. Even if it isn’t a bit, why wouldn’t he just pretend it was? It’s so transparent. He doesn’t look 35. Every official record says he was born in May 1961. Why won’t he just admit to it? “If your article ends up being a big thing, the real joke is that he’ll end up optioning his story,” said Cauvin. “Then he really will be rich.” *** Forbes had just pulled its story on Dan, along with the accompanying video calling him a “Millennial Funnyman,” when I emailed him last Thursday. People had been tweeting about his age. Eleven minutes later, I got a response. “You’re doing a story about a story? Now that’s a first!” Nainan wrote. He followed it with a smiley face. I know. Pretty weird, I told him. “But, yeah, it appears to be scrubbed from the internet because of discrepancies about your age, which is the second time it happened in the last few months,” I said. “So are you 35 or 55? It appears from a couple of official documents you’re 55.” This time Nainan replied in 18 minutes. He ignored the question. “You might enjoy this—my goal for next year is to get a sitcom made which closely parallels my life. I’m pitching it as Seinfeld meets Silicon Valley,” he wrote. He then attached the screenplay. “Logline: After suffering a traumatic brain injury, an introverted Intel engineer terrifies his parents by deciding to pursue his dream of becoming the only half-Indian, half-Japanese comedian in the world, and opens the country’s first all-clean comedy club.” Then, a few minutes later, he sent over his hospital admission paperwork for the brain injury. It says he checked into Bellevue Hospital on December 16, 2015. No birthday. I asked him again: Wouldn’t this be a good place to start telling people your real age? Nothing. The next day, I called Dan. His cellphone number was on his website. I told him: Cosmo just ran a correction. They know you’re 55. “I just don’t think there’s any benefit to me commenting. It is what it is,” he said. “Just to see what’s going on with Twitter and all this stuff, it’s amazing that people would be so concerned about someone that isn’t on the radar. I’m not well-known in any shape or form. It’s really amusing to me to have all this going on. It’s quite amusing.” That’s understandable. So why not just give your real age? “The thing of it is, there’s no benefit. Whatever I say, it’s not going to matter,” he said. “I’ve been trying to get clubs and agents and Comedy Central to notice me. Nobody paid me even a second of time. I’ve performed for the president, president-elect, Hillary. I’ve been to 28 countries. I’ve tried and tried and tried to get on TV. I can’t even perform at the local clubs.” That’s when I asked him about Joe Robinson. “That guy went on and posted a whole bunch of lies,” he said. “I contacted an attorney. I was seriously thinking of suing him for everything he had. He didn’t have any money. The ones who criticize me the most are the ones who are the least successful.” I said I understood. “The only way I’ve gotten attention is with this, of all things. I friggin’ hate this industry so much and the people in it. I’m flying first class around the world. Despite what these people say, I’m a happy guy. I’ve done all of this with nobody’s help. I did it all myself,” he said. “The only time that anyone has paid attention to me is when something like this happens.” I get it, I told him. It’s time to tell the whole story, I said. Being in your forties and leaving Intel to become a millionaire comedian is even more impressive than some guy in his twenties making it in comedy like everybody else, right? We talked for a half-hour. After a long discussion about internet hate mobs, he asked, “Are you threatening me?” with the internet hate mob. I told him I’m not. I just want to hear your real story, I said. At points, he asked if I was being pressured by an editor to publish the story, if he could ask for it not to be published, if he could make all the stuff he previously said off the record. I told him no, no, and that he couldn’t. At one point he asked, “Can it get any worse?” Finally, I laid it all out. I have official state documents with his real age on them. They’re public records. His timeline with Intel doesn’t make any sense. He gives different ages at different times depending on which publication he’s talking to. It’s all over. It’s OK. The jig is up. So tell me, are you 35 or 55? Then a pause. “I’m 35,” he said. “The mistake is in my birth record.” A few minutes later, he said he wanted to talk to his lawyer before he said anything else. The next day, in an email, I asked him to show me any document proving a mistake in his birth record, or that his real age is 35. I called him back repeatedly to ask for comment on this and other specific allegations Joe and Rob and Patrick and J-L have made. Nainan never responded. At press time, his website was no longer online. *** Rob Maher said Dan asked him if he wanted to be on a reality-TV show a few years ago. “It was something about ‘people think that you’re lying but you’re not and you want to prove it to them.’ He wanted me and Joe to go on his show,” said Maher. So, Maher said, to prove that he was “talking to the producer,” Nainan showed him a screenshot of a call log on his phone. “It’s an 800 number. He was calling the switchboard of the network,” he said. “In the same screenshot, he has Barack Obama calling him. Like, it says ‘Barack Obama.’ He’s trying to get us to believe he’s talking to the president about who knows what.” Maybe it’s a bit? “He’s not funny enough to do that as a joke,” said Maher. “It would be funny if it was performance art. But it’s not. He does this constantly.” Cauvin has a brother who works at The New York Times, in which Nainan has appeared at least six times. He believes what Maher just said—that Nainan’s antics are not funny enough to be a joke, and not unbelievable enough to be worth making up—is what got him this far. “It reminds me of Sean Connery in The Untouchables. He says, ‘Who would claim to be that who is not?’ Why would I claim to be 35? Exactly! Nobody ever cares enough to check. He’s built an empire out of lies and manipulation,” said Cauvin. “Other than that, he’s a really good guy and a good comedian.” He’s joking, if you can’t tell. After all this, it’s hard to know anymore. “Comedy is a tough business,” said Cauvin. “You can either deal with it and grit through it, or you can create an alternate universe.” READ THIS LIST 1 The Media’s Favorite ‘Millennial’ Is 55 Ben Collins About Advertise Contact Jobs Help Privacy Community Policy Terms & Conditions Copyright & Trademark © 2017 The Daily Beast Company LLC

With its introduction of its Ryzen CPU, AMD has countered Intel’s best with some excellent performance of its own. Ryzen represents a more aggressive improvement over AMD’s previous architecture, Excavator, with the new Zen chips offering a full 40 percent improvement. That’s much more significant than Intel’s more conservative improvements with its latest generation of CPUs, which focused on smaller performance increases and better mobile battery life. This is an important accomplishment for AMD, because apparently, it’s going to have to last for at least four years, as PCWorld reports. More: Watch AMD demo upcoming desktop CPUs during its ‘New Horizon’ event right here The news came during CES 2017, where AMD’s computing and graphics senior vice president and general manager Jim Anderson discussed the new architecture. As he put it, comparing AMD’s process to Intel’s “tick-tock” development cycle that was actually skipped this time around, “We’re not going tick-tock. Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” While Intel’s methodology usually results in a brand new architecture every two years, AMD has averaged closer to three to four years. It’s Opteron and Athlon architectures lasted from 2003 until 2007, and its K10 lasted from 2007 until 2010. The bottom line is that AMD simply must introduce impressive new performance metrics each cycle because its new architectures must remain competitive for far longer. With Zen and Ryzen, AMD has taken the tactic of improving not only clock speeds but also making the chips better at guessing at what data will be processed next, called “branch prediction,” as well as build in the ability for chips to process more information at a time. That means AMD is focusing on going beyond Moore’s Law, which has predicted increased processor performance in PCs for decades, into “Moore’s Law Plus” that focuses on more than just manufacturing processes. Judging by CES 2017, AMD’s efforts are paying dividends. A number of leading motherboard makers announced Ryzen-based components, with a total of 16 AM4-based solutions that are primed to plug in new Ryzen desktop processors. Not only AMD’s newest CPUs are supported in this year’s round of components, but also other high-end PC parts such as PCIe 3.0, M.2 SATA devices, USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3, and more. ASRock Asus Biostar Gigabyte MSI X370 Taichi B350M-C X370GT7 GA-AX370-Gaming K5 A320M Pro-VD X370 Gaming K4 X350GT5 GA-AX370-Gaming 5 X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium AB350 Gaming K4 X350GT3 AB350-Gaming 3 B350 Tomahawk A320M Pro4 A320M-HD3 B350M Mortar Clearly, AMD is not messing around in making Ryzen a real product. As Anderson put it, “We’re not going to do a paper launch [where products are announced long before they actually ship]. We’ve done that before. We’re not going to mess with it.” That means that AMD and its customers will be able to squeeze every bit of life out of the Zen architecture for its entire four-year lifespan. Competition is a good thing, and so AMD’s efforts are welcome in pushing PC’s forward. Intel isn’t standing still itself, of course, with its own upcoming advancements such as the 10mm manufacturing process coming with its own next generation of CPUs. But AMD is apparently confident that it’s positioned itself well to remain relevant in PCs well into the next decade. Also watch: Share

Zeman   @phonescooper New Balance partnered with Intel and Strava to create the runner-focused RunIQ. This smartwatch runs Android Wear and includes core features such as GPS and a heart rate monitor. Here are Phone Scoop's first impressions. AD       article continues below... The RunIQ from New Balance is an Android-based smartwatch that specifically targets runners. The watch is a collaboration between New Balance, Intel, and Strava. It hopes to gain traction with people who prioritize fitness over the connected features typically associated with smartwatches, though it offers those tools, as well. There's no question the RunIQ is a sport watch. It is made from hard plastics and silicon, it features oversized buttons that are easy to use, and it is water resistant for those times when you get caught running in a downpour. The RunIQ is not overly fancy, and in fact is downright simple in appearance. The core watch is available only in a dark gray color, but a wide variety of colored, silicon straps are available (orange, green blue, purple, red). New Balance says the RunIQ is compatible with any standard 22mm strap, so you can swap them out if you want. New Balance RunIQ   I like that the RunIQ keeps the size under control. Compared to the Casio WSD-F20, the RunIQ is downright dainty. It is lightweight and not too wide. It should be comfortable enough for most people. The materials are decent, but not the best. The hard plastic of the main watch body is certainly strong, but the silicon straps felt a bit flimsy to me. Three hardware buttons are located on the right side of the watch. They are quite large and easy to find and use, even when wearing gloves. The travel and feedback on the upper and lower buttons is just okay, but the large, central button works very well. An optical heart rate monitor is positioned on the bottom of the watch. New Balance took a slightly unique approach with the design of the underbelly. Typically, wearables with optical heart rate monitors need to be worn tightly in order to work well. Optical heart rate monitors rely on darkness, hence the need to be snuffed against your wrist. New Balance added a donut-shaped buffer around the heart rate monitor. New Balance says this lets people wear the watch at a comfortable degree of snugness while still blocking enough light so the heart rate monitor works properly. New Balance didn't do anything fancy with the display. Like nearly all Android smartwatches, the display measures 1.39 inches an has 360 x 360 resolution. The unit we examined looked good. The size/resolution combo mean on-screen elements are plenty sharp. Indoors, the brightness appeared to be good but we were unable to see just how well the display does outdoors under the sun. The RunIQ will ship with Android Wear 1.2 aboard, but New Balance insists the watch will be updated to Android Wear 2.0 as soon as Google releases the refreshed platform. The unit we saw was still running Android Wear 1.2. The core user experience (settings, apps, menus, controls) works just like any other Android Wear smartwatch. New Balance has added a significant number of its own fitness-focused functions for running. Chiefly, the RunIQ offers Strava, which is a fitness app available to Android and iOS devices. Strava allows users to track workouts and share them with an online community. Beyond Strava, the RunIQ has GPS for tracking runs, walks, and hikes. The heart rate monitor can hook into workouts, too, for tracking fitness levels and performance. The wearable includes a wide variety of stopwatches and other timing functions, including easy controls for managing laps when running loops. I didn't see any performance issues with the unit on hand in Las Vegas, but it will be critical to see how the RunIQ functions with Android Wear 2.0 aboard. Interface   face 1 face 1 face 2 face 2 changing faces changing faces face color options face color options running running running running running running running running running running music music music music New Balance didn't share too many specifications for the watch. We know it runs an Intel processor, but not which one. We also know that it has 24 hours of normal battery life, but only 5 hours of battery life when using GPS and the heart rate monitor at the same time. That's not so great. The price is decent at $299. That puts it inline with most other modern Android Wear devices, and much less than that of Casio's $500 F20. New Balance says the RunIQ will ship before February 1.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. But for all the running commentary, Trump's transition has been particularly opaque. Over the next week, he and many of his Cabinet nominees will all be out in public, providing answers that could start to bring his administration into sharper focus. The focal point will be Trump's news conference on Wednesday in New York (Thursday in Australia), with two issues uppermost: how he answers questions about the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's emails; and how he explains the steps he plans to take with his business enterprises to avoid conflicts of interests as president. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Trump says 'only reason' hacking is a hot topic is because of Democratic loss Confirmations hearings are scheduled for a slew of his Cabinet picks, so many there won't be enough television screens to accommodate them all. They include two of the most controversial nominees: Exxon's Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the early Trump supporter named to be attorney-general. The many confirmation hearings likely will be overshadowed by Trump's event, but they deserve as much attention as can be given. The coincidence in timing for Trump's news conference couldn't have been written by a Hollywood scriptwriter. The president-elect hasn't met with the press corps for a full-fledged question-and-answer session since last July (days after the first DNC emails were leaked by WikiLeaks), when he approvingly called on the Russians to find and reveal emails from Hillary Clinton's private server. Advertisement "They probably have them," he said that day. "I'd like to have them released." He's sung a different song about the Russians since then. Could he have imagined that questions about Russian interference with the election would be front and centre as he prepares to take the oath of office? Trump's decision to delay until next week a scheduled December news conference puts him up against the release of a declassified version of the intelligence findings that pinned the orders to interfere in the election squarely on the Russian President Vladimir Putin and that ascribed the Russians' motivation as intending to hurt Clinton and help him. That leaves Trump open to more pointed questions about the Russians' role and motivations and his confidence level - or lack thereof - in the intelligence community he will soon oversee - all of which he has avoided since winning the presidency. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump has preferred making statements over Twitter than traditional press conferences. That will change this week. Photo: AP Nothing has caused more consternation - among leading Republicans and more broadly - than the president-elect's disparagement of the intelligence community's findings. His written statement after being briefed on the findings did pay respect to the men and women in the intelligence community and called for stepped up efforts to combat future cyber attacks. Republicans found reasons to be reassured by what he said, but some will need to see more. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Senator John McCain is among senior politicians questioning Russian hacking of the US election. Photo: AP/Wong Maye-E Notably, however, he stopped short of declaring that he now accepts that the Russians were solely responsible for what happened during the campaign, the DNC hacking and other nefarious activities. Trump also will have an opportunity to explain why he resisted the conclusions of the intelligence community, why he gave more credence to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks (he claimed later that wasn't his intent) and whether the new report has changed his perspective in any significant ways. Led by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans have sought to put Trump in a position of having to choose between the US intelligence community that he will soon oversee and Assange, who claims that the information he released did not come from the Russians. Trump has been determined to avoid being pinned down. Trump's motivations for his multiple tweets questioning whether the Russians were to blame are not clear. Is he worried that any suggestion of Russian interference aimed at helping him diminishes his victory? He told Mike Shear of The New York Times that the whole issue is part of a "political witch hunt," presumably designed to delegitimise his presidency. He would like the whole issue to go away, but there was enough history before the hacking to raise questions about why he has treated Putin with such respect. Is that friendly posture a genuine effort to recast US-Russian relations with a goal of making them more productive, without making concessions to an adversary? Is his reluctance caused, perhaps, by business relationships with Russians that he does not want jeopardised or exposed? He has said no, but the full extent of his business arrangements isn't fully known. Is he, in some clever way, playing Putin on his way into the Oval Office with some clear strategic purpose? Should Putin actually be nervous about getting what he wished for - a Trump presidency? Meanwhile, Tillerson will be going through his own grilling before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His relationship with Putin while serving as chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil has put Republicans like McCain on edge, fearful of a pro-Russian tilt in the new administration. His private conversations on Capitol Hill, described by some of the senators with whom he met, have conveyed the impression that he will state clearly that he understands the difference between protecting the interest of shareholders and protecting the interests of the country. But where will that leave him with respect to the president-elect in his assessment of Putin, Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, the value of sanctions imposed and how US policy could or should change after eight years of the Obama presidency? That's ultimately up to Trump, but will Tillerson act as a counterbalance or cheerleader for the instincts the president-elect has shown up to now? Sessions can expect a modicum of senatorial courtesy, given his long tenure in that body, but however polite, his hearings will expose some of the rawness that remains in the aftermath of the election. No nomination has brought about more opposition from the base of the Democratic Party, particularly in the civil rights community. Though his nomination appears in no danger, his allies have worked strenuously to counteract the opposition and smooth his path. Beyond those hearings, Trump's choices for the departments of homeland security, education, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce, labor and the Central Intelligence Agency will all have their moments in the public spotlight. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have set some clear priorities, along with GOP congressional leaders, starting with the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare), a series of executive orders on day one designed to reverse some of President Barack Obama's actions, and a focus on building a wall along the US-Mexican border and a focus on job creation. Still, there is much that remains unsettled, both about those priorities and with other sensitive issues. Details will have to come eventually. How long will the president-elect, who has said many times he wants to be unpredictable, wait to begin to provide more answers?

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. But for all the running commentary, Trump's transition has been particularly opaque. Over the next week, he and many of his Cabinet nominees will all be out in public, providing answers that could start to bring his administration into sharper focus. The focal point will be Trump's news conference on Wednesday in New York (Thursday in Australia), with two issues uppermost: how he answers questions about the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's emails; and how he explains the steps he plans to take with his business enterprises to avoid conflicts of interests as president. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Trump says 'only reason' hacking is a hot topic is because of Democratic loss Confirmations hearings are scheduled for a slew of his Cabinet picks, so many there won't be enough television screens to accommodate them all. They include two of the most controversial nominees: Exxon's Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the early Trump supporter named to be attorney-general. The many confirmation hearings likely will be overshadowed by Trump's event, but they deserve as much attention as can be given. The coincidence in timing for Trump's news conference couldn't have been written by a Hollywood scriptwriter. The president-elect hasn't met with the press corps for a full-fledged question-and-answer session since last July (days after the first DNC emails were leaked by WikiLeaks), when he approvingly called on the Russians to find and reveal emails from Hillary Clinton's private server. Advertisement "They probably have them," he said that day. "I'd like to have them released." He's sung a different song about the Russians since then. Could he have imagined that questions about Russian interference with the election would be front and centre as he prepares to take the oath of office? Trump's decision to delay until next week a scheduled December news conference puts him up against the release of a declassified version of the intelligence findings that pinned the orders to interfere in the election squarely on the Russian President Vladimir Putin and that ascribed the Russians' motivation as intending to hurt Clinton and help him. That leaves Trump open to more pointed questions about the Russians' role and motivations and his confidence level - or lack thereof - in the intelligence community he will soon oversee - all of which he has avoided since winning the presidency. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump has preferred making statements over Twitter than traditional press conferences. That will change this week. Photo: AP Nothing has caused more consternation - among leading Republicans and more broadly - than the president-elect's disparagement of the intelligence community's findings. His written statement after being briefed on the findings did pay respect to the men and women in the intelligence community and called for stepped up efforts to combat future cyber attacks. Republicans found reasons to be reassured by what he said, but some will need to see more. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Senator John McCain is among senior politicians questioning Russian hacking of the US election. Photo: AP/Wong Maye-E Notably, however, he stopped short of declaring that he now accepts that the Russians were solely responsible for what happened during the campaign, the DNC hacking and other nefarious activities. Trump also will have an opportunity to explain why he resisted the conclusions of the intelligence community, why he gave more credence to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks (he claimed later that wasn't his intent) and whether the new report has changed his perspective in any significant ways. Led by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans have sought to put Trump in a position of having to choose between the US intelligence community that he will soon oversee and Assange, who claims that the information he released did not come from the Russians. Trump has been determined to avoid being pinned down. Trump's motivations for his multiple tweets questioning whether the Russians were to blame are not clear. Is he worried that any suggestion of Russian interference aimed at helping him diminishes his victory? He told Mike Shear of The New York Times that the whole issue is part of a "political witch hunt," presumably designed to delegitimise his presidency. He would like the whole issue to go away, but there was enough history before the hacking to raise questions about why he has treated Putin with such respect. Is that friendly posture a genuine effort to recast US-Russian relations with a goal of making them more productive, without making concessions to an adversary? Is his reluctance caused, perhaps, by business relationships with Russians that he does not want jeopardised or exposed? He has said no, but the full extent of his business arrangements isn't fully known. Is he, in some clever way, playing Putin on his way into the Oval Office with some clear strategic purpose? Should Putin actually be nervous about getting what he wished for - a Trump presidency? Meanwhile, Tillerson will be going through his own grilling before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His relationship with Putin while serving as chairman and chief executive of ExxonMobil has put Republicans like McCain on edge, fearful of a pro-Russian tilt in the new administration. His private conversations on Capitol Hill, described by some of the senators with whom he met, have conveyed the impression that he will state clearly that he understands the difference between protecting the interest of shareholders and protecting the interests of the country. But where will that leave him with respect to the president-elect in his assessment of Putin, Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, the value of sanctions imposed and how US policy could or should change after eight years of the Obama presidency? That's ultimately up to Trump, but will Tillerson act as a counterbalance or cheerleader for the instincts the president-elect has shown up to now? Sessions can expect a modicum of senatorial courtesy, given his long tenure in that body, but however polite, his hearings will expose some of the rawness that remains in the aftermath of the election. No nomination has brought about more opposition from the base of the Democratic Party, particularly in the civil rights community. Though his nomination appears in no danger, his allies have worked strenuously to counteract the opposition and smooth his path. Beyond those hearings, Trump's choices for the departments of homeland security, education, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce, labor and the Central Intelligence Agency will all have their moments in the public spotlight. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have set some clear priorities, along with GOP congressional leaders, starting with the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare), a series of executive orders on day one designed to reverse some of President Barack Obama's actions, and a focus on building a wall along the US-Mexican border and a focus on job creation. Still, there is much that remains unsettled, both about those priorities and with other sensitive issues. Details will have to come eventually. How long will the president-elect, who has said many times he wants to be unpredictable, wait to begin to provide more answers?

But where will that leave him with respect to the president-elect in his assessment of Putin, Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, the value of sanctions imposed and how US policy could or should change after eight years of the Obama presidency? That's ultimately up to Trump, but will Tillerson act as a counterbalance or cheerleader for the instincts the president-elect has shown up to now? Sessions can expect a modicum of senatorial courtesy, given his long tenure in that body, but however polite, his hearings will expose some of the rawness that remains in the aftermath of the election. No nomination has brought about more opposition from the base of the Democratic Party, particularly in the civil rights community. Though his nomination appears in no danger, his allies have worked strenuously to counteract the opposition and smooth his path. Beyond those hearings, Trump's choices for the departments of homeland security, education, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce, labor and the Central Intelligence Agency will all have their moments in the public spotlight. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have set some clear priorities, along with GOP congressional leaders, starting with the dismantlement of the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare), a series of executive orders on day one designed to reverse some of President Barack Obama's actions, and a focus on building a wall along the US-Mexican border and a focus on job creation. Still, there is much that remains unsettled, both about those priorities and with other sensitive issues. Details will have to come eventually. How long will the president-elect, who has said many times he wants to be unpredictable, wait to begin to provide more answers?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 7, 2017 at 1:00PM In April of 2016, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that it would be undergoing a restructuring program designed to "accelerate [Intel's] evolution from a [personal computer] company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices." The net effect of this restructuring was the elimination of "up to 12,000 positions globally" as well as "annual run rate savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017." It is widely believed that much of the cost-cutting happened in the company's Client Computing Group (CCG), which sells components for personal computers as well as for phones, tablets, and so on. Although investors were made aware of the company's investment reductions in areas like smartphone and tablet processors, there were some questions about where else the company might have cut costs. Did the company significantly cut expenses in its core personal computer processor and platform businesses, for example? The General Manager of Intel's CCG, Navin Shenoy, recently spoke at the J.P. Morgan Annual Tech Forum, providing some critical insight into just what was cut and what wasn't. Let's take a closer look at what he had to say. Image source: Intel.  Tablets and phones get cut -- PCs, not so much Shenoy began by saying: The first thing we did is a complete, 360-degree view of the business, and, yeah, the first obvious decisions were to shed ourselves of some of the very low [return on investment] investments in markets that, maybe, three or four years ago, held a lot of promise and now are, in some cases, declining. "It was prudent for us to trim some of those investments in tablets and phones," Shenoy further elaborated. However, Shenoy made it clear that the company didn't cut any of its key personal computer product lines and projects as the company's efforts here are "highly profitable." "It didn't make sense to stop doing those," Shenoy explained. That's not to say, though, that the company didn't cut costs in these areas in a bid to participate in those markets "more efficiently." "We did the things you typically see companies do," Shenoy began. "We shifted resources to lower cost geographies, we combined things, we found site consolidation opportunities, and a lot of that yielded very good cost reduction that you see flowing through our bottom line now." Full impact to be seen in 2017 Year to date, Intel has reported operating profit growth in CCG of just under 31% against revenues that are up about 1.3%. Part of that improvement has been due to operating expense reductions, and part of it has been due to product margin improvements (improved 14-nanometer yields, lower contra-revenue, etc.).  Intel announced its restructuring actions back in April, so -- as Shenoy pointed out -- the full impact of the investment reductions on operating profit won't show itself in Intel's full-year 2016 results. "I think what you'll see in 2017 is, since most of that activity really didn't hit fully until the back half of [2016], you'll see now a full-year of benefit on a lot of that cost reduction in 2017," Shenoy said. Investment takeaway Only time will tell whether Intel has cut spending in its core personal computer product efforts too deeply, but Shenoy's commentary seems encouraging. With the company's operational cost structure reduced to where it's likely going to be going forward, investors must look for the company to either grow its revenue and/or its gross profit margins to deliver continued profit growth in CCG. Considering that the personal computer market is likely to remain challenging in the years ahead, investors may want to keep their expectations in check, here. If Intel can keep revenues and profits in CCG roughly flat while growing its other businesses, then the company should be able to deliver overall revenue and profit growth. Investors should keep a close eye on the revenue and profit expectations Intel puts out there when it hosts its annual investor meeting on February 9 of this year. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Amazon’s AI assistant was everywhere at this year’s CES, from phones and cars to robots and refrigerators. But that wasn’t the only big theme at the world’s biggest tech trade show. The team at Tom’s Guide met with more than 200 companies to arrive at this list of the best and most exciting new products. Our picks include a TV that’s so thin you can almost floss with it, a breakthrough that charges your phone across the room, an AI-powered concept car and a 4K streaming box that puts Apple TV to shame. And it has Google Assistant inside. Take that, Alexa. Best of Show: LG Signature OLED TV W Picture 2 of 25 There’s a reason LG nicknamed this TV “wallpaper.” At just about a tenth of an inch thick, the gorgeous W7 OLED set blends so seamlessly into its surroundings, you wonder how it works at all. Available in 65- and 77-inches, we were also blown away by the W7’s stunning picture quality, as well as the audio from its equally impressive Dolby Atmos soundbar, whose upfiring speakers raise and lower with the push of a button on the remote. Because why not! MORE: LG W7 Hands-on Best Virtual Reality: Project Alloy Picture 3 of 25 Intel’s Project Alloy is a VR experience unlike any other. The standalone headset uses four RealSense cameras to scan a room and implement its furniture and walls into the game you’re playing. It also includes an entire computer in the headset, including CPU and battery, which lets you play without being tethered to a computer. The result is an interactive experience that had us ducking behind a table as we waged war with robot enemies. We can’t wait to see what happens when Intel’s partners include the technology in headsets that should appear later this year. MORE: Project Alloy Hands-On Best Innovation: Ossia Cota Tile Picture 4 of 25 Forget about all the so-called "wireless charging" technologies you've seen before. A game-changing breakthrough, Ossia's Cota Tile lives in the ceiling and sends electricity through the air to your device just like a router sends out a Wi-Fi signal. Your phone can charge all day while it sits in your pocket and your smart home devices can get juiced constantly, even if they're nowhere near an outlet. MORE: Ossia Cota Tile Hands-on Editor's Choice: Lego Boost Picture 5 of 25 To succeed in the 21st century job market, today's kids need to learn how to code when they're young. The Lego Boost kit teaches basic programming concepts to children as young as seven as they build any of five really cute robots and control them with a tablet app. Since this is Lego, you can customize these robots with standard bricks too. MORE: Lego Boost Hands-on Best Car Tech: Toyota Concept-i Picture 6 of 25 It will greet you with a wink when you walk up to it, play calming tunes to soothe your mind in difficult times, and it will even let you drive when you want. Toyota's Concept-i isn't just a self-driving car, it's a friend on wheels. Oh, and it looks amazing, too. With the way the Concept-i implements AI, Toyota has elevated what a car can be, and if this is a vision of the kind of tech that's coming down the road, it can't get here soon enough. MORE: Toyota Concept-i Hands-on Best Robot: Ubtech Lynx Picture 7 of 25 The Lynx from Ubtech is a robot like no other. That’s because it’s the first humanoid with Alexa inside. Ask Lynx a question or give it a command, and it will turn it’s head towards you. Don’t be creeped out, because this is a robot with a heart. And a lot of dexterity. The Lynx can execute crazy Yoga poses, dance and even hug your child while you’re on a video call with him from half-way around the world. MORE: Ubtech Lynx Hands-on Best Phone: Asus ZenFone AR Picture 8 of 25 The Asus ZenFone AR is a phone that stands out. It’s the first Android handset to run both the Google Tango augmented reality platform and Daydream VR, and it doesn’t skimp on specs, either. The ZenFone AR is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 CPU, 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU. It also packs a 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 AMOLED display that will look great when using apps or the Google Daydream VR headset. MORE: Asus ZenFone AR Hands-On Best Budget Phone: Honor 6X Picture 9 of 25 The Honor 6X is the kind of phone that makes you wonder why you pay several hundred bucks for a flagship device. This $249 device packs a dual-lens rear camera (for achieving the iPhone 7 Plus’ portrait mode effect on the cheap) and a fingerprint sensor while boasting all-day battery life. Actually, make that two days, at least when you’re not using it heavily. The 6X is proof that you don’t need to bust your budget just to enjoy some of the finer features smartphones have to offer. MORE: Honor 6X Hands-on Best Smart Home Product: LG Instaview Refrigerator Picture 10 of 25 This Alexa-enabled fridge has a 29-inch touchscreen that runs not just Windows 10, but webOS, too. Among other things, you can check the weather, play music, and leave notes for your family. Cameras inside the LG Instaview refrigerator send photos to your smartphone to let you see if you’re running low on eggs, or you can simply tap the display, and it will turn clear. This lets you look inside without ever having to open the door. MORE: LG Instaview Hands-on Best Design: Dell Canvas 27 Picture 11 of 25 It has a screen that folds down, a pen, and a dial that you can use to select tools and change colors on the fly. No, it’s not the Surface Studio. Dell’s Canvas 27 gives creative professionals a fantastically versatile workspace for a fraction of the price. This display plugs into any existing Windows 10 PC and offers a new interface (in partnership with Stardock) that will make you feel Minority Report-powerful. MORE: Dell Canvas 27 Hands-on Best Laptop: Acer Predator 21X Picture 12 of 25 The Predator 21X is what happens when you throw caution (and budgets) to the wind. This head-turning beast of a gaming laptop sports a curved 21-inch display, which is a first for any laptop. There’s also a mechanical keyboard on board, dual Nvidia 1080 graphics cards and a very nifty magnetic touchpad that you can flip over that turns into a number pad. Sure, this brute costs $9,000, but if you have the means, why the hell not? MORE: Acer Predator 21x Hands-on Best PC: Dell XPS 27 Picture 13 of 25 Plenty of all-in-one PCs look stunning, but the Dell XPS 27 is one of the few that sounds great as well. That's because this desktop packs a whopping 10-speaker soundbar right below its display, allowing you to hear your music, movies and shows the way they were meant to sound. Factor in a 27-inch 4K touch display that can be laid flat, and you've got a spectacular all-in-one for artists, musicians or simply anyone who wants their content to both look and sound fantastic. MORE: Dell XPS 27 Hands-On Best TV: Sony Bravia XBR-A1E Picture 14 of 25 Sony insists on both great picture and great sound for its TVs, but that’s hard to accomplish when sets are becoming thinner and thinner. With the Bravia XBR-A1E, Sony devised a novel solution: turn the screen itself into a speaker. The Bravia XBR-A1E boasts a gorgeous 4K HDR OLED screen, but what really sets it apart is that the screen itself vibrates to produce sound. Not only are there no speakers required, but its novel Acoustic Surface technology should sound even better than most tiny flat screen TV speakers. MORE: Sony Bravia XBR-AIE Hands-on Best Streaming Box: Nvidia Shield Picture 15 of 25 The first Nvidia Shield was a respectable streaming box/game console hybrid; the new Nvidia Shield has the potential to be the centerpiece of your house. With an integrated games store that draws from three robust sources, full support for 4K and HDR games streamed through Steam and built-in Google Assistant with smart home commands, the Nvidia Shield could be one of the most powerful and versatile streaming players to ever hit the market. It’s also the only Android TV system with access to Amazon Video. MORE: Nvidia Shield Hands-on Best Monitor: Dell UltraSharp 32 8K Monitor Picture 16 of 25 Dell's 32-inch UltraSharp 8K monitor is the kind of product that you truly need to see to believe. This droolworthy screen can display over one billion colors and close to 33 billion pixels, which makes photos look incredibly true to life while allowing you to see every fine detail of a map or schematic. The UP3218K's $5,000 price tag means that it's not for everyone, but it's stunning sharpness makes it the ultimate display for creative professionals. MORE: Dell UP3218K Hands-On Best Gaming PC: CyberPower Luxe Picture 17 of 25 CyberPower manages to out-crazy itself every CES, making its new Luxe PC an easy pick for our favorite gaming desktop of the show. The CyberPower Luxe looks like it rolled out of a monster truck show in the best way possible, with a stunning, cage-like chassis that you can easily lift open to access the rainbow of backlit components waiting inside. With support for multiple graphics cards, the highest-end processors and a variety of custom cooling options, the Luxe is just as much a geeky work of art as it is a beastly gaming desktop. MORE: CyberPower Luxe Hands-On Best Security: Bitdefender Box Picture 18 of 25 Most smart home tech doesn’t have very good security. You have three choices: don’t use it, leave yourself open to cybercrime or invest in hardware to protect yourself. The new Bitdefender Box is a router add-on (although you can also use it as a standalone router) that monitors not only the security of your PC and mobile devices, but your IoT gadgets as well. Users can block unauthorized devices attempting to the network, or prevent existing devices from accessing malicious sites. Over time, the Bitdefender Box will learn new smart home vulnerabilities, and defend against them, too.

Trust us, Project Ariana has to be seen to be believed.  MORE: Razer Project Ariana Hands-on Best Gaming Hardware: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ Picture 22 of 25 There are lots of gaming monitors with 4K resolution and Nvidia G-Sync, but for some reason, not many systems have embraced the vibrant color technology of high dynamic range (HDR).

Intel IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 7 January 2017. Page 1 of 4. 11 Comments With running fresh benchmarks on all of my Intel systems for comparison with my upcoming Kaby Lake desktop CPU Linux reviews, this weekend I have some fresh results of the past few generations of Intel hardware when looking at their HD/Iris Graphics performance when using the latest Linux driver code as of Linux 4.10 Git and Mesa 13.1-devel Git from this week. While we mostly benchmark Skylake graphics on Linux these days and routinely the Broadwell Iris Graphics, it's been a while since delivering many comparison benchmarks going back to Haswell and Ivy Bridge. Thus ahead of the Kaby Lake reviews I figured I'd share these results by themselves. For comparison is also an AMD A10-7850K Kaveri APU with the same Linux 4.10 / Mesa 13.1-dev driver stack as the latest generation desktop APU I have from AMD. The Intel hardware tested was the Core i7 3770K (Ivy Bridge), Core i7 4770K (Haswell), Core i7 4790K (Haswell), Core i7 5775C (Broadwell Iris Graphics), Core i5 6500 (Skylake), and Core i5 6600K (Skylake) based upon the CPUs I have available for testing. On each of these systems, Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 was loaded followed by switching to Linux 4.10 Git and Mesa 13.1-devel from the Padoka PPA. A variety of OpenGL benchmarks were run on this bleeding-edge open-source GPU driver stack followed by some fresh Vulkan benchmarks too later in this article. All of these benchmarks were facilitated in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

His early-morning assessment came in a series of tweets on the subject and the morning after the release of a declassified report by US intelligence agencies that concluded Russia carried out a comprehensive cyber campaign to sabotage the presidential election and sought to aid Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. Saturday morning's tweets were the latest from Trump to portray the episode in starkly partisan terms, even as some senior Republicans in Congress have called for harsher sanctions against Russia than recently ordered by President Barack Obama. "Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!" Trump said in one of his tweets, referring to an election in which Clinton won the popular vote but he prevailed in the electoral college. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-elect Donald Trump is still questioning the validity of the Russian hacking findings. Photo: Evan Vucci/AP In another tweet on Saturday morning, Trump said intelligence officials "state very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results." "Voting machines not touched!" he added. Advertisement Trump's later comment appeared to be consistent with the findings of the report, though it noted that Russia "obtained and maintained access" to numerous election systems that "were not involved in vote tallying." Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 Trump also said that only "fools" would think it was bad to have a good relationship with Russia and predicted that Russia will respect the US "far more" once he reaches the Oval Office. Putin developed "a clear preference" for Trump to win, the intelligence agencies said on Friday in a declassified report on their findings. The agencies said they "assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him," according to the report. "All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence," the report said. Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017 In a statement after Friday's meeting, the president-elect sought to tamp down his differences with the intelligence agencies – he said he has "tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation" – although he didn't explicitly endorse their conclusions that Russia was responsible. "While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organisations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines," Trump said in the statement. Posting on Twitter early Saturday, Trump repeated that voting machines were not touched. The intelligence agencies agreed there was no evidence of ballots being hacked but said in the report that, "We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election." Trump has expressed admiration for Putin as a strong leader and predicted they can work together on issues such as fighting Islamic State terrorists. He returned to that theme on Saturday. "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing," Trump said on Twitter.  "Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now." Trump on Saturday also repeated his contention that Democrats were largely to blame for their accounts being hacked. Hackers penetrated email at the Democratic National Committee and of John Podesta, the chairman of Clinton's campaign. "Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense!" Trump tweeted.

According to a senior law enforcement official, the gunman, identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, walked into the FBI office in Anchorage, Alaska, in November and made disturbing remarks that prompted officials to urge him to seek mental health care.

Santiago, appearing "agitated and incoherent," said "that his mind was being controlled by a US intelligence agency," the official said. Other officials said it was too early to tell whether Santiago, who was captured in the airport, had been inspired by terrorist groups, including the Islamic State. The officials said he had viewed extremist materials on the internet.

The shooting spurred a scene of panic and confusion that played out on live television as scores of travelers burst out of the terminal and onto the tarmac, running and seeking cover, at times in response to erroneous rumours of follow-up attacks.

"Everybody was dropping gear, panicking, jumping over tables," Fogarty said in a phone interview. "We were saying: What is going on? Are there people shooting? I am not hearing any gunshots, and the whole place is panicking."

The senior law enforcement official said Santiago was making "disjointed" statements in his Anchorage FBI visit. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago. Photo: Broward Sheriff's Office "Although Santiago stated that he did not wish to harm anyone, as a result of his erratic behavior, interviewing agents contacted local authorities," who took him to a medical facility for evaluation, the official said. "The FBI closed its assessment of Santiago after conducting database reviews, interagency checks and interviews of his family members," the official said. On Twitter, President-elect Donald Trump said that he was "monitoring the terrible situation in Florida" and that he had spoken to Governor Rick Scott. Hours after the attack, a picture began to emerge of Santiago as a man who had served his country but who had experienced trouble and failure. Santiago was discharged in August from the Alaska Army National Guard for "unsatisfactory performance," according to Lt. Col. Candis A. Olmstead, spokeswoman for the Alaska Guard. In September, Santiago became a father when his son was born, according to an aunt, Maria Luisa Ruiz, a resident of Union City, New Jersey, who spoke on Friday to the newspaper The Record. In an email, Olmstead said that Santiago joined the Puerto Rico National Guard in December 2007. In 2010 he deployed to Balad, Iraq, with the 130th Engineer Battalion, which spent a year clearing roads of improvised explosives and maintaining bridges; he was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. At least two soldiers from his company were killed in insurgent attacks during the tour, but there is nothing in the record that indicates Santiago had been in combat. Olmstead said he served in the Army Reserves before joining the Alaska Army National Guard in November 2014. Before his discharge last year, he had worked as a combat engineer as a private first class. An official service record released by the Army on Friday showed that Santiago had received a number of commendations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal. Santiago's brother, Bryan Santiago, told The Associated Press that Esteban was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. Nelson Cruz, a Puerto Rico senator who represents Pe??uelas, the city in Puerto Rico where Santiago grew up, said he met him about seven or eight years ago and found him to be a "good young man" who loved his family. Cruz said he spoke Friday with Bryan Santiago, who relayed that the family was shocked by the news of the killings. The family offered no motive for the crime but noted that Esteban Santiago had recently been hallucinating and was receiving psychological treatment. "Bryan said his brother went to Iraq or Afghanistan, one of those places, and came back with psychological problems," Cruz said. "He would suddenly see visions but that he was a calm young man and was never violent." ​The New York Times Advertisement Most Popular If you thought you'd deciphered Trump's master tweeting plan, you're probably wrong 'Pence could be the most powerful VP ever, or he could be kicked to the curb really fast' Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Pendant identical to Anne Frank's found at notorious Nazi camp Follow Fairfax Foreign Share on FacebookFacebook Share on TwitterTwitter Follow SMH Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on EmailNewsletters Advertisement Most Viewed Today Previous slide Next slide World Trump dumps top officials in purge without precedent CIA director tells Donald Trump to watch his words Video shows police tackling and beating a black man suspected of stealing a car.

Piro said Santiago had turned up at an FBI office in Anchorage in November of last year behaving erratically and was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental health evaluation. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said he came back from his deployment "a different person", MSNBC reported. The attack was the latest in a series of mass shootings that have plagued the United States in recent years, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Nearly two months ago a former Southwest Airlines worker killed an employee of the company at Oklahoma City's airport in what police called a premeditated act. The deadliest mass shooting in modern US history took place last June, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

The Purge Election Year Logo (image by Wikipedia (commons.wikimedia.org))   License   DMCA   Details President-elect Donald J. Trump's transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day. Any doubt about purging the current US Administration's foreign affairs and intel community relations around the Globe is a dead horse! It is well known that Intel operations are operated from embassies and their staffing. Internal Intel is being purged at home and abroad and will be held accountable to the incoming President and Staff as December 23rd, a mandate with no exceptions was issued to the State Department recalling all appointed ambassadors, they must vacate their posts by Inauguration Day, January 20th. Is there any doubt now of the insurrection of the existing criminal cabal across the globe being dismantled? It is my humble opinion that a Special Investigative Prosecutor will be assigned to look into actions taken against the incoming President, his Administration and the American people. - Advertisement - This is the war we wanted not the one the neocons and the MIC wanted but the one of purge of unwanted endless wars of murder for profit and their creators. Has Hillary's "If Trump is elected we all go to jail" coming to fruition? The war parties are screaming that many of Trump's Senate-confirmed envoys will not be confirmed in time and the posts could be vacant for months. There is no grace period on this directive. Trump appears to be grabbing the bull by the balls, forget the horns and possibly circumventing any assignation attempt/s or other shenanigans from the ousted regime. Trump is cleaning house fast. Many of the ambassadors are long time diplomats and lifelong politicians as well as heavy donors of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Trump leaves no doubt he wants them gone yesterday! A senior Trump transition official said "there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama's overseas appointees leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do". The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations, said "the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date, this is what a businessman does as president" he makes the trains run on time". As Terresa Monroe-Hamilton of the Right Wing News reported: YOU'RE FIRED! Trump pink slips these MAJOR Obama appointments! "Trump is shaking up every aspect of the government it would seem and these people just got a rude wake-up call. Opponents are saying this will signal an abrupt change in US policy internationally. Good. The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20th. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. And I would bet none of those so-called justifications will be approved. There is a new sheriff in town and he's coming in taking names and kicking butt. Diplomats just got the memo in the form of a pink slip." - Advertisement -   - Advertisement - 4   3   3   View Ratings | Rate It George King has been involved in civil rights and started protesting government as a US Marine protesting the Vietnam War in 1967.

Glad to see you monitoring the fast pace that things are moving towards Jan 20th. Clapper announced his resignation in response I am sure to his letter the day after the election that they were all to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20th. I have been missing your thoughts and take on current events recently as most of us have been overwhelmed in looking for signs in what may be the most interesting and dangerous of times. Although I fear as some the underworld will try and derail world events through this thrashing and gasps of a dying transnational regime which may unleash a taking to the streets of revolution not seen in the last two centuries. That multi polar world may be within reach and that will be the catalyst for the Battle of the Sinners and Saints (metaphor).

I doubt any other president-elect has been accused of treason with virtually no evidence. Even the circumstantial evidence is so vague as to need a leap of faith to pin it on Russia, let alone pin it specifically on Putin, while ignoring all other possibilities. Yet, many here on OEN are able to take that leap, some with an extraordinary amount of time on their hands. I wonder if these are really individuals or an organized group masquerading as individuals. All this is being spearheaded by Obama, the outgoing president. Another unprecedented development belying his initial promise of a smooth transition. The man had the grace and credibility of a snake oil salesman for eight interminable years. He is surpassing himself in these last weeks. The heads of the intelligence agencies daring to level such charges against an incoming president are all his appointees. In poisoning the well for Trump, they are dragging the office of the president through a dung heap. A scorched earth, we won't go quietly insurrection that can end very badly. It is not Trump who should be impeached. He hasn't done anything to merit that fate without taking office for a single day. It is Obama, Clinton and the heads of intelligence agencies behind this report who need to be prosecuted for high treason.

However he is not so naive as to the powers and forces aligned and directed at him. We all know them well, too well. No matter what we think of his personal choices based on past images we can be assured he has assembled an experienced national security team that has been around the track a few times. This gives him the edge in defeating those powers arrayed against him and the US citizens as well.

In fact, I am counting on the economic motivations prevailing over ideologically driven imperial wars. Although the oil industry is by no means an innocent beneficiary of wars, the nature of the industry is such that a perpetual state of war is not conducive to its business. Well heads, refineries and oil and gas pipelines are the first casualties of imperial armies and jihadi gangs alike. Trump and cronies want to make money and war is bad for their business. The two-headed war party, on the other hand, wants war because it make its money out of the war business. No one is wearing a halo here. But between someone who has to kill to make money and someone who can make money only by having less killing, it's a no-brainer. Am sure people in the target countries would much rather be ranting and raving about their stolen wealth from six centimeters above the ground than from six feet under. Few of us calling for Trump to be given a fair chance have any illusions about him. But he is the lesser evil this time.

The public found out about it and raised holy hell. The meeting was about a pipeline the industry wanted to build across Afghanistan. The results of this meeting and its likely followup planning was the first Iraq war and all that followed. The US oil industry has never shirked from the use of the military to maintain its hegemony in the world economy.

We never got to see its minutes, so we won't know all the plotting and scheming. But it wasn't about the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project alone. That project had a strategic rather than money-making objective. The US wanted it to kill the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline which would have run the oil blockade against Iran. Cheney's meeting was more about the carving out Iraqi oil and gas fields, and laying the groundwork for the Qatar-Syria-Europe gas pipeline. The first was anti-Iran, the second was anti-Russia. I take your point about the oil industry's role in imperial wars. What I was pointing out was it requires a relative peace to operate the trade lines. The wars are for initial capture of supply sources and pipeline routes. Once this part is accomplished, a state of continuing war defeats the purpose of cornering supplies.

The ultimate goal is profit and hegemony. Murder and genocide are just collateral damage to them (and well worth it). Incidentally, I don't think of the US government as an independent player at the table in the war room. They are servants of the oligarchs. The US doesn't give a damn about "bringing democracy to the world". That is a cover for their service to oligarchs.

He is in an information war, with the entire corrupt corporate media arrayed against him in a solid phalanx. If he is tweeting, it is because he has few other means to fight back. It is an asymmetrical war as he has no chance of winning it symmetrically. If even a third of the MSM were willing to give him balanced coverage, he wouldn't be doing this. Except for Fox News, virtually all other bought and paid media is viciously attacking and undermining him around the clock. He may be brash, he may be narcissistic and anything else you want to call him. But the man has balls. He is not knuckling under. I admire his sheer guts. For having come this far and still having to fight tooth and nail on the last mile. This truly extraordinary spectacle is stripping the MSM naked. People are realizing how organized and controlled the corporate media is. If the price of their awakening is to put up with Trump's tendency to go off the rails now and then, it is well worth it. Besides, it is only an assumption -- a rather convenient one for those opposed to him -- that he will be doing this once he assumes office. I would give him a chance to get there and hold my judgment for now.

Fox (Faux) News is the least credible of the lot. Trump changes his intentions without logic and without explanation and doesn't care to respond to anyone who points out that fact. He behaves like a very loose cannon whose brief remarks are shot through with unexplained 180 degree changes of intent and emotional claims that he is under personal attack. It's all about him. He has a bully pulpit from which he could make any logical and credible explanation of any of his behavior that he wanted to advance. It is bizarre to suggest that his only available means to communicate is Twitter. If anyone has had the opportunity to convey a positive, thoughtful, approach to the critically important challenges facing the next POTUS it is he. Yet he has refused or is unable to do that. The electorate had plenty of reason to expect sensible answers and honest clarity from him during the campaign and, not receiving any of that, it is absurd, IMO, to advise withholding judgment in favor of a wait and see approach.

Quite uncharacteristically so. You are questioning his ability to govern. He hasn't had a chance to govern. There is nothing absurd in suggesting one should hold one's judgement until he does. Anything else is premature. As for his mercurial twists and turns, I feel this a calculated strategy to keep people guessing. This is how he got people to sit up and take notice of him during the campaign. Having found a winning formula, he is sticking to it. For now. Once he takes office, things might change as he has proven capable of being tactful when the situation called for it. Right now, he's still fighting a war as I said (which you ignored altogether). All is fair considering kitchen sinks are being thrown at him. You talk as if he is facing a normal situation with the courtesy of the customary honeymoon period extended to his predecessors. His enemies can't even wait for him to take office and they are already calling for his impeachment. What is absurd is not recognizing the absurdity of the all out war against him. It's rather difficult to be (potentially) presidential under a barrage of abuses, insults and accusations. Those expecting greater poise and dignity from Trump should reflect on their own conduct first.

I never found an answer to that riddle. I wondered if it could happen again, maybe even here". "I recall Goering's shocking statements, "Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship." and "...the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country." "These, I have come to recognize, are the statements of a psychopath. We have been seeing an eerily similar (functionally identical) process of transformation of our democracy into a pathocratic caricature of itself over a period extending back at least to the Watergate era."

Yet he has refused or is unable to do that." In my humble opinion the current seat of power which includes the Obama Administration, appointees, corporate and MIC pay to play control of the MSM that offers no conveyance of any such communications from Trump or the incoming Administration much less one of or by the people. We all see this in the Russian scare of be afraid, very afraid and the inclusion of Trump as an agent of a foreign threat to discredit what they know is their undoing. That is why I see your "But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship." and "...the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country" as relevant as an answer. Do you not see a possible reason? To try and respond against the MSM megaphone of the status quo in its dying throes is a non starter and would only further the attempts of discrediting. I think it has been the correct response so far and blame the above as the reason. In that light I will with hold criticism rather than succumb to what I see aligned against the changing of power in accordance to our laws and tradition. "The electorate had plenty of reason to expect sensible answers and honest clarity from him during the campaign and, not receiving any of that, it is absurd, IMO, to advise withholding judgment in favor of a wait and see approach." Bernie's common sense delivered by a scholar and a gentleman could not stand against what I consider to be a criminal cabal, why would Trump duplicate a failed challenge to the status quo?

I have not been thinking of Twitter as a communication medium suitable for responding to the MSM megaphone. In fact, I wasn't referring to a need for such. I was referring to the hours and hours of TV time and debate time that were available to him to make a serious case to the electorate for why he should be the next POTUS. There was nothing stopping him from doing that, but he chose to deliver nonstop inanities and attacks on people instead. Now, as President-elect, he still has the opportunity to address the public on matters of grave concern. Yet he chooses to post late night tweets mocking Schwarzenegger's performance on a stupid reality TV show instead. I just can't give him a pass. It is irresponsible IMO and insulting.

And I hope you don't think I believe you should. This stuff about hacking is irrelevant to me. There is much more that concerns me which Trump should have used tweet time or full page newspaper ads or free TV time to discuss. The electorate is entitled to know what candidates intend to do if elected. We never got that from him, and now that he has been elected he thinks mocking Schwarzenegger is more important than showing statesmanship and leadership. This is frightening.

That is undoubtedly why Americans elected him, because he emphasized that platform. If Trump's past relations with Russia but him in good stead to carry out that policy, more power to it.

The advent of connected cars is creating a new sales battleground, and using a vehicle's windshield may be the next way to pitch more products and services to consumers. McKinsey & Co. estimates that mobile and data-driven services in autos will generate $US1.5 trillion ($2.1 trillion) by 2030. At least part of that will be spent projecting information to drivers and passengers right before their eyes. Related Content Smartphone ads not as annoying as you might think How many more ads will people take? Facebook warns growth will slow "When you think of a person driving and what your needs are when you're on a typical trip, it's food, it's fuel and it's rest stops," said John Butler, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. "Owning the inside of the car is critical, it's really where the money is made. The real value is locked up in the ad opportunity." Advertisement Here's how a smart windshield may work. A driver that's close to running out of petrol would see an alert pop up that notes the fuel situation and offers to find a nearby petrol station. The car's virtual assistant will offer a choice, again on the windshield, of two options, including directions to a station where the driver is eligible for a free cup of coffee -- an ad placed by the petrol company that fits with the driver's buying patterns, also known by his smart car. Panasonic demonstrated technology at CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week, that lets a driver order and pay for fast food through a heads-up display, before pulling off the freeway to collect it. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Forget using the iPhone in the car - the info may soon be on your windscreen. Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg Pairing such offerings with other connected subscription services could generate hundreds of dollars in additional recurring revenue per car each year, according to Tom Gebhardt, the head of Panasonic's automotive business in North America. "When you start doing payments out of the vehicle, you have to secure those payments somehow, so we're matching the facial recognition with your credit card," he said. "We're really investing in an integrated solution, merging the infotainment system, the instrument cluster and the heads-up display." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Carmakers are considering the ability to push content such as video in front of passengers, says BMW's Klaus Froehlich. Photo: Bloomberg Corning Inc. is starting to sell carmakers the glass used in Apple's iPhones for windshields and in-car entertainment systems. The company said the durability and thinness of the glass means that any image projected onto it is sharper than onto a typical windshield. While the product is less than 25 centimetres wide, Corning is working to expand it to a full windshield-size display. "They could be here in less than two years," Corning Chief Technology Officer Jeff Evenson said in an interview on Thursday. "We're making the car much more active to set things up for these kinds of services." Owning the inside of the car is critical, it's really where the money is made. John Butler Connected cars Turning a car windshield into a billboard is part of broader efforts by automakers and tech companies to transform vehicles into connected devices. Multiple companies at CES this week have announced deals and partnerships that use software, digital voice technology and cloud computing to handle everything from automatically scheduling a maintenance appointment to ordering a take-away pizza while on the road. Automakers such as BMW, Hyundai and Toyota already offer basic heads-up displays near the windshield in some models that show information such as the vehicle's speed. Google parent Alphabet, through its Waze navigation app, suggests nearby restaurants and points of interest during your drive, as does TripAdvisor. The next step is merging these two ideas: projecting points of interest onto your windshield. Eventually mapping and navigational data could be superimposed onto the road in front of the driver, much in the way that Google Street View currently displays information about an area on a static image. BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler acquired Nokia's HERE mapping unit in 2015 to ensure they were no longer dependent on Google for maps. Intel announced Tuesday it had bought a 15 per cent stake in HERE. "This is exactly the sort of thing the high-end carmakers are promoting as part of their highly integrated, immersive 'cockpit' concepts,'" said Richard York, an executive at chip designer ARM Holdings who is responsible for automotive sales. Safety concerns The question of how the technology is regulated remains open, given concerns about driver distraction. For now, suppliers are eager to promote heads-up displays as safety tools. For example, the speed and location of vehicles in a car's blind spot might be projected onto the windshield. "We're going to bring the safety aspect of the vehicles" into the augmented reality products, said Joseph Yoon, head of LG Electronics' automotive research and development team. Boosters also say a windshield display is a safer alternative than drivers taking their eyes off the road to glance down and tap a dashboard infotainment system or check a smartphone. For many years BMW, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive worked with the Munich-based startup Metaio to investigate possible applications for augmented reality technology in cars, according to someone familiar with Metaio's business. The main hurdle to superimposing an enhanced image for the driver was the "tracking problem" -- establishing the direction of a driver's gaze and adapting the image projected onto the windscreen accordingly, the person said. Metaio was acquired by Apple last year, and ended its contracts with the carmakers. Panasonic's Gebhardt said his company had mastered the technology and is seeking a customer willing to deploy it in a car. People usually understand information presented in an augmented reality format more quickly than on paper or a smartphone, according to Sunny Webb, who leads Accenture's research and development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. That makes AR an appealing medium through which to present location-based ads, as well as safety and contextual information to drivers. "Being able to overlay content in a windshield is a really interesting application," she said. "There's a lot of energy going into how to distribute content to passengers and drivers." First steps Meanwhile, Harman International Industries, the in-car infotainment systems giant in the process of being acquired by Samsung, is moving into heads-up displays. In December it announced an investment in Navdy, a San Francisco-based maker of a projection display that sits on the dashboard in front of the windshield and provides navigation guidance, car behaviour data and smartphone alerts. The two companies will start selling a jointly branded heads-up display this year. Automotive supplier Magna International also is likely to unveil an augmented reality product with a major German carmaker this year, according to someone familiar with the plan. Automakers also are considering the ability to push content such as video in front of passengers in addition to mapping or road services as a way to generate more revenue from each vehicle. "We want to have our direct customer relationship delivering premium services to them and being their direct contact," said Klaus Froehlich, BMW's head of research and development. "That's the clear goal for a premium car manufacturer." Bloomberg Related Content Google drops ban on personally identifiable web tracking 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The world's biggest consumer electronics show puts a spotlight on razor-thin laptops, as well as faster and powerful smartphones, and thinner flat panel televisions at the annual event in Las Vegas. The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is gadget heaven for technology lovers. CES mainstay Intel is hoping to create a new market and some buzz with something called the "Ultrabook." Intel's Merlyn Kister: SOUNDBITE: MERLYN KISTER, INTEL MARKETING (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Ultrabooks marry the best of a tablet. You think of thin and light designs with ultra responsiveness and fast start up, with the full performance of a PC that you know and like; a full keyboard." Tablets, however, have sort of faded in significance at this year's show compared to recent years, as manufacturers admit they can't replicate the success of the Apple iPad. But the industry has also learned another lesson or two from Apple, which does not particpate in CES. Peter Choi of iLuv Marketing: SOUNDBITE: PETER CHOI, ILUV MARKETING (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Apple just designs beautiful products. Again, they design things that consumers need and what we do is bring out the full functionality of these products." And the merging of aesthetic beauty and functionality is evident across the massive 1.8 million square feet of showspace, including these video name tags that can be displayed in clothing and not just on. And speaking of displays...flat panel TVs continue to get thinner and smarter - and the industry has yet to give up on the home 3D market, which has yet to catch on. Smartphones are still the talk of the town as wireless carriers roll out new devices for faster mobile networks. The event is still popular even though there haven't been many ground-breaking products announced in recent years. Microsoft is not expected to come back next year, but Bearking Hsuing of Immersive Motion says CES is still the place for technology companies to get the word out. SOUNDBITE: BEARKING C. HSIUNG, PRESIDENT, IMMERSIVE MOTION (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The CES is the biggest show in the world. We developed the product ourselves and we would like to find a distributor for the worldwide market, especially in the United States." Organizers expect some 140,000 to 150,000 attendees to get first look at some of the new gadgets coming to market, with some 2,700 exhibitors hoping to hit the right beat with consumers.

The historic sense of a face-off that likely will inform one of the most vital relationships in Donald Trump's presidency was captured in a blunt observation by former Obama-appointed CIA chief Leon Panetta, who told NBC: "I've never seen anything like this in my lifetime, [with a President-elect] undermining the credibility of the very intelligence agencies that have to provide information to him in order for him to be president of the United States."

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. And to a point, it seemed that Trump might have seen the wisdom of outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden's advice that it was "absolutely mindless" for a new president to feud with the intelligence services – the President-elect was not too vigorous in his comments after the intelligence showdown at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The guts of the report, by the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency, was the most detailed formal account to date of what, much to Trump's fury, has been leaked in dribs and drabs in the weeks – that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a huge cyber attack and influence campaign aiming to deny Hillary Clinton the White House. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte courts Russia in snub to US This was unprecedented stuff – the spooks were effectively putting a question mark over the legitimacy of the man they will serve as president before he takes the oath of office on January 20. The Russian objective – according to a 25-page, sanitised version of the agencies' classified report – was not to manipulate the actual vote so much as to mess with voters' minds by generating negative coverage of Clinton. Advertisement "Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavourably to him," the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded. Without revealing how they acquired the information, the agencies concluded "with high confidence" that Moscow's military intelligence unit, the GRU, had crafted a "persona" called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release damaging emails harvested from the Democrats' computers – and when the release of the emails on DCLeaks.com failed to draw media attention, they were subsequently dumped through WikiLeaks. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Donald Trump has big spending and tax cuts plans. Photo: Evan Vucci/AP Just hours before Friday's intelligence briefing at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the President-elect was spinning his usual line, telling The New York Times that efforts to prove Russian interference was "a political witch-hunt". Just as Trump refuses to accept that he lost the popular national vote by as many as 3 million, he bitterly resents any suggestion that his campaign might have had a Russian leg-up – but a statement he issued after Friday's briefing was notable for the absence of his customary mockery of the intelligence services and the inclusion of an oblique concession that the Russians had intervened. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US Vice-President-elect Mike Pence has pledged action. Photo: Bloomberg In a separate statement, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence said the new administration would act "to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future". In its generality, the report is politically damaging for Trump. And in its particulars it is damaging for his newly appointed national security adviser Michael Flynn – Flynn has a close relationship with RT, the Russian English-language news organisation that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation pressed into service in the campaign to cripple Clinton. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Vladimir Putin's people have denied they were spying on Trump.  Photo: AP Intriguingly, in ascribing motives, the agencies conclude that Putin held a grudge against Clinton who, he believed, had denigrated him when, as US secretary of state, she had encouraged pro-democracy protests in Moscow in 2011. He also believed that the US was responsible for the leaking of the so-called Panama Papers, which had embarrassed Putin associates; and for revelations on Russian Olympians' abuse of performance-enhancing drugs. The "Russians did it!" row will not go away any time soon. But it remains to be seen just where the intelligence agencies' report fits in to it. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Illustration: Matt Golding  "This is big: CIA, NSA & FBI publish perhaps the most high-profile intelligence community assessment in US history," Thomas Rid, a professor at King's College London and an expert on cyber warfare, wrote on Twitter.

There’s a lot of excitement in the air and it’s not just because we’re in the middle of CES week. AMD hasn’t been competitive with Intel in what feels like ages, a realization that has allowed Intel to take its foot off the throttle in recent years. Its latest Kaby Lake processor series, for example, is hardly any better than the Skylake chips before it (and Broadwell before it and so on). The hope among enthusiasts is that Ryzen is enough of a threat to force Intel to once again get serious about innovation. AMD is well aware of the situation and isn’t taking the opportunity lightly. Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD’s Computing and Graphics business, told PCWorld that they aren’t going to do a paper launch of Ryzen. It’s something they’ve done in the past but aren’t going to mess with this time around. Instead, Anderson said Ryzen chips will be available from day one. The key word there is “chips” as in, multiple chips, not just the high-end eight-core, 16-thread model that AMD has been talking up in recent demos. What’s more, AMD product manager Jim Prior revealed to the publication that every Ryzen chip you can buy can be overclocked (assuming you have a capable motherboard, of course). It’s also worth mentioning that only the high-end X370-based AM4 motherboards will support Radeon CrossFire / Nvidia SLI multi-card setups. AMD’s Rob Hallock said data has shown that those who buy mainstream PCs simply don’t get into multi-GPU setups. What’s more, the most popular Radeon cards for CrossFire are the highest-end (expensive) models which aren't what mainstream users will be going after. As for Zen’s lifespan, Papermaster said they aren’t going tick-tock (in reference to the tick-tock release cadence that Intel had utilized for many years before abandoning it with Kaby Lake). Zen, he said, will be tock, tock, tock. Here’s to hoping that roadmap pans out.

And to a point, it seemed that Trump might have seen the wisdom of outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden's advice that it was "absolutely mindless" for a new president to feud with the intelligence services – the President-elect was not too vigorous in his comments after the intelligence showdown at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The guts of the report, by the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency, was the most detailed formal account to date of what, much to Trump's fury, has been leaked in dribs and drabs in the weeks – that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a huge cyber attack and influence campaign aiming to deny Hillary Clinton the White House. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte courts Russia in snub to US This was unprecedented stuff – the spooks were effectively putting a question mark over the legitimacy of the man they will serve as president before he takes the oath of office on January 20. The Russian objective – according to a 25-page, sanitised version of the agencies' classified report – was not to manipulate the actual vote so much as to mess with voters' minds by generating negative coverage of Clinton. Advertisement "Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavourably to him," the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded. Without revealing how they acquired the information, the agencies concluded "with high confidence" that Moscow's military intelligence unit, the GRU, had crafted a "persona" called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release damaging emails harvested from the Democrats' computers – and when the release of the emails on DCLeaks.com failed to draw media attention, they were subsequently dumped through WikiLeaks.

Just as Trump refuses to accept that he lost the popular national vote by as many as 3 million, he bitterly resents any suggestion that his campaign might have had a Russian leg-up – but a statement he issued after Friday's briefing was notable for the absence of his customary mockery of the intelligence services and the inclusion of an oblique concession that the Russians had intervened.

More videos Russia hacks: Intel chief pushes back at Trump Speaking to a Senate panel, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pushed back on President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion the intelligence community did not have solid evidence that Vladimir Putin's Russia was responsible for email hacks during the 2016 election. And to a point, it seemed that Trump might have seen the wisdom of outgoing Vice-President Joe Biden's advice that it was "absolutely mindless" for a new president to feud with the intelligence services – the President-elect was not too vigorous in his comments after the intelligence showdown at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The guts of the report, by the CIA, FBI and the National Security Agency, was the most detailed formal account to date of what, much to Trump's fury, has been leaked in dribs and drabs in the weeks – that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a huge cyber attack and influence campaign aiming to deny Hillary Clinton the White House. Related Content Russia aimed to influence US election, top spies tell Trump Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte courts Russia in snub to US This was unprecedented stuff – the spooks were effectively putting a question mark over the legitimacy of the man they will serve as president before he takes the oath of office on January 20. The Russian objective – according to a 25-page, sanitised version of the agencies' classified report – was not to manipulate the actual vote so much as to mess with voters' minds by generating negative coverage of Clinton. Advertisement "Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavourably to him," the report by the nation's intelligence agencies concluded. Without revealing how they acquired the information, the agencies concluded "with high confidence" that Moscow's military intelligence unit, the GRU, had crafted a "persona" called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release damaging emails harvested from the Democrats' computers – and when the release of the emails on DCLeaks.com failed to draw media attention, they were subsequently dumped through WikiLeaks.

Just as Trump refuses to accept that he lost the popular national vote by as many as 3 million, he bitterly resents any suggestion that his campaign might have had a Russian leg-up – but a statement he issued after Friday's briefing was notable for the absence of his customary mockery of the intelligence services and the inclusion of an oblique concession that the Russians had intervened. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link US Vice-President-elect Mike Pence has pledged action. Photo: Bloomberg In a separate statement, Vice-President-elect Mike Pence said the new administration would act "to combat cyber attacks and protect the security of the American people from this type of intrusion in the future". In its generality, the report is politically damaging for Trump. And in its particulars it is damaging for his newly appointed national security adviser Michael Flynn – Flynn has a close relationship with RT, the Russian English-language news organisation that American intelligence says is a Kremlin propaganda operation pressed into service in the campaign to cripple Clinton. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Vladimir Putin's people have denied they were spying on Trump.  Photo: AP Intriguingly, in ascribing motives, the agencies conclude that Putin held a grudge against Clinton who, he believed, had denigrated him when, as US secretary of state, she had encouraged pro-democracy protests in Moscow in 2011. He also believed that the US was responsible for the leaking of the so-called Panama Papers, which had embarrassed Putin associates; and for revelations on Russian Olympians' abuse of performance-enhancing drugs. The "Russians did it!" row will not go away any time soon. But it remains to be seen just where the intelligence agencies' report fits in to it. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Illustration: Matt Golding  "This is big: CIA, NSA & FBI publish perhaps the most high-profile intelligence community assessment in US history," Thomas Rid, a professor at King's College London and an expert on cyber warfare, wrote on Twitter. Maybe. Susan Hennessey, a former intelligence agency lawyer who now runs the online journal Lawfare, wrote: "The unclassified report is underwhelming at best. There is essentially no new information for those who have been paying attention."

Intel has agreed to purchase a 15% stake in Here, a global provider of digital maps and location-based services for automotive and the “internet of things.” The deal will see Intel acquire the stake from Here’s current indirect shareholders Audi AG, BMW AG and Daimler AG. As part of the investment, Intel and Here signed an agreement to collaborate on the research and development of a proof-of-concept architecture designed to support real-time updates of high-definition maps targeting automated driving. The two firms also plan to jointly explore strategic opportunities targeting edge-computing devices with location data. Intel said should the deal gain regulatory approval it expects the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2017. “We look forward to working with Here and its automotive partners to deliver an important technology foundation for smart and connected cars of the future,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, in a statement. Last week, Here and Chinese companies NavInfo and Tencent announced a strategic partnership to develop and offer location services for the Chinese market. The deal includes a joint venture in China targeting location services for Chinese and global customers across a range of industries. Based on the JV, Here would extend its services to China making use of NavInfo data and services. The two Chinese companies, together with global investment firm GIC, also announced plans to jointly acquire a 10% stake in Here. Nokia sold its 100% ownership stake in Here in early 2015 to the three German carmakers for $3 billion.

The intel chiefs are highly confident the core motivations behind the extensive Russian campaign were to undermine the integrity of the election, denigrate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and undermine her potential presidency. Although the report states Russia developed a “preference” for Trump late in the campaign, it’s clear they believe the underlying goal was always to hurt Clinton. “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,” the report states. “Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.” (RELATED: Intel Report Destroys Democrat Talking Point On Leaked Emails) Given the timeline of the hacks and the bad blood between Putin and Clinton, the intel assessment of his motivations isn’t surprising. U.S. intelligence has traced the launch of the hacks as far back as Spring 2015 — months before Trump announced his bid for the presidency — and that launch almost certainly took several months of planning. Trump was a media punchline, if anything, at that point, while Clinton had long been on Putin’s bad side. Their rocky relationships goes back to her tenure as secretary of state and as senator. At one point she accused his party of rigging an election, and Putin accused her of inciting protests against his government. Even Clinton herself has attributed a grudge toward her as the motivation for the Russian hacks. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,” the report adds. The New York Times rushed to hype this bit of the assessment, seemingly confirming headlines the paper and other outlets such as The Washington Post have been running for weeks about Russia’s supposed goal of helping Trump. (RELATED: Three Bungled WaPo Stories On Russian Meddling All Show The Same Mistakes) But since the report states Putin’s original intent had nothing to do with Trump, it’s not clear what conclusions can be drawn from Russia’s eventual siding with the president-elect. If Putin wanted to denigrate Clinton, it’s reasonable to assume he would have come to “prefer” any candidate opposing her in the general election. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign then focused on undermining her expected presidency,” the report adds, making it clear the underlying goal was about hurting Clinton.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte congratulates Donald Trump on his election win and says he now wishes to stop quarreling with ally, the United States. "Friends, long live…that's from the heart," he told top Russian naval officers, thumping his chest. The comments came after Russia's ambassador to the Philippines, Igor Khovaev, said his country is ready to supply the Philippines with sophisticated weapons.

Mr Duterte signalled during a rare visit to the Philippines of two Russian warships that he will allow joint military exercises between the Philippines and Russia, and declared he intends to visit Russia in April.

Khovaev. Photo: AP Since being swept office at elections in May last year Mr Duterte has thrown the Philippines' future relations with the US into question as he sought closer ties with China, threatening to "separate" from the US alliance, end joint exercises and remove US troops from the Philippines. Mr Duterte's reaching out to Russia at a time of heightened tensions between the out-going US administration and Russia over telephone hacking during the US election is a further blow to Barack Obama's key strategy to "pivot" US forces and diplomatic emphasis to Asia.

Richard Heydarian, a Manila-based analyst, said Donald Trump's election in the US could see a turnabout in US-Philippine relations.

The US's criticism of the killings prompted Mr Duterte to tell Mr Obama to "go to hell" and to call him the "son of a whore." Professor Heydarian said Mr Trump's tough approach to China is likely to benefit the Philippines. "For Duterte, this means the Philippines could step back and let the two superpowers slug it out in the high seas, while Manila tries to reap the benefits of friendly ties with Beijing and Washington," said Professor Heydarian, the author of Asia's New Battlefield: The US, China and the Struggle for Western Pacific. "For the Philippine leader it is best to keep out of the clash of the titans," he said. Mr Duterte, who has been described as the "Trump of Asia," has praised Mr Trump and said he hopes to boost business with the US during his time in office.  In November, Mr Duterte appointed Philippine real estate tycoon Jose Antonio to be US trade envoy. Mr Antonio built the almost completed US$150 million 57-storey Trump Tower in Manila, through his Century Propertries Group. "I've always loved the Philippines," Mr Trump says the Trump Tower Manila website. "I think it's just a special place and Manila is one of Asia's spectacular cities," he says.

Russian Ambassador to the Philippines, Igor Anatolyevich Khovaev, reiterated Moscow's support, stating they are willing to provide sophisticated arms to the Philippines, including light weapons, submarines and helicopters. Moscow is no novice when it comes to dealing with terrorism, with Islamic militants continuing to threaten Russia's stability until this day. Most of the terror attacks stem from instability in Chechnya, a region that historically fought for independence from Moscow. Related Content Duterte threatens to throw corrupt officials out of a helicopter Rodrigo Duterte must be investigated, says UN official Although most acts of terrorism are confined to Chechnya and neighbouring Dagestan, occasionally Islamic militants have conducted terror operations elsewhere in Russia, most notably the 1999 Russian apartment bombings, the 2002 Moscow theatre hostage crisis, and the 2004 Beslan School siege. In 2013 alone, 31 terrorist attacks claimed 40 lives and injured dozens more, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia. Moscow has adopted a policy of collective punishment, whereby the entire population of Chechnya has suffered as a result of Islamic militancy. Putin led the campaign against Chechnya, being accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity along the way in an attempt to put an end to the terrorist attacks. Human rights are regularly dismissed in defiance of the law in order to advance counter-terrorism operations.  Advertisement For decades, 8252 kilometres away from Moscow, Manila has been facing an Islamic insurgency in the southern island of Mindanao. Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani formed a violent extremist group in the Philippines known as Abu Sayyaf, who split from the separatist movement Moro National Liberation in 1991. Today, Abu Sayyaf seeks an independent Islamic state on Mindanao, not so different from the Caucasus Emirate in southwest Russia, who aspire to expel Russia from the North Caucasus and create an Islamic emirate in its place.

"I have six years to do it. I do not know how many concessions God can [give], but he made me a President, so I hope He helps me," he said. With the threat of battle-hardened Islamic State fighters returning from the Middle-East to South-East Asia, aspiring to create a caliphate in the region, the prospect of terrorism is growing. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Russia's Rear Admiral Eduard Mikhailov, front right, leads the way as he guides Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the anti-submarine navy ship docked in Manila, Philippines. Photo: AP In the past, the Philippine military have tried to halt terrorist gangs such as Abu Sayyaf with support from the United States and Australia to little avail. The new relationship with Russia offers an alternative. According to officials, the Philippines is "open to cooperating with the Russian Ministry of Defense through education and training exchanges on counter-terrorism operations". Duterte has shown a liking to Putin's brash politics, often emphasising his admiration for the Russian president. The two men met for the first time at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leader's meeting in Lima, Peru last November. "You know, we have become fast friends", Duterte said in the aftermath. Putin and Duterte claim to share not only a mutual understanding of Western hypocrisy in global affairs, but similar outlooks on how to best handle terrorism. According to Duterte, Indonesian and Malaysian authorities have permission to bomb fleeing Filipino militants and their hostages at sea. "[B]omb them. If they cannot be captured, you bomb them. How about the hostages? Eh, bomb them also," he allegedly told Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Indonesian President Joko "Jokowi" Widodo. For Duterte, the loss of civilian life is justified if it means combating terror. Putin has regularly conducted operations in a similar way, ignoring large-scale loss of civilian life in its counter-terrorism campaign, most notably in 2002 and 2004. Taking counter-terrorism advice from Putin may suit Duterte, but it will undermine the rule of law in the Philippines as it has in Russia. At present Duterte's "war on drugs" is making headlines with the death roll reaching 6200 since his election. But the second war Duterte may decide to wage, the "war on terror", is just around the corner, which may prove equally damaging for the country.

They were worth about $US136 million ($186 million) when they vested -- the biggest distribution Cook has received in a single year from the award. The value of the shares isn't included in the proxy filing's summary compensation table since it only lists new equity grants.

He also received 980,000 shares tied to him remaining on the job. Combined with previous payouts, Cook has collected stock worth more than $US350 million ($479 million) since he became CEO. He's also on track to get half of the shares tied to relative stock return and scheduled to pay out in August 2017 and 2018 based on three-year shareholder returns, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The iPhone-maker's 2016 calendar year stock return including dividends topped 12 per cent, beating almost half of S&P 500 businesses. Equity awards for senior vice presidents Angela Ahrendts, Eddy Cue, Luca Maestri, Dan Riccio and Bruce Sewell are also partially tied to Apple's relative stock return over three years. The remainder typically vests within four-and-a-half years after they're granted. The cash bonuses paid out below target as the company missed net sales and operating income goals. Absent from Apple's compensation disclosures is Chief Design Officer Jony Ive, called by some the company's most important employee. Ive designed many of Apple's most iconic products including the iMac, iPod and iPhone. Apple representatives didn't immediately respond to a call and an email sent outside business hours.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 6, 2017 at 5:00PM Earlier this week, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a second wave of chips from its seventh-generation Core processor family, also commonly referred to by the code name Kaby Lake. Image source: Intel.  The company released an initial set of processors based on this architecture targeted at thin-and-light/2-in-1 computers late last year, but now the company is releasing chips to target the broader personal computer market. These chips will power desktop computers, high-performance notebooks, and other devices. Here are three things that investors should know about these new chips. They're built using 14-nanometer+ technology In the past, Intel would usually transition to a new manufacturing technology (named "[XY]-nanometer"), build two generations' worth of products using that technology, and then transition to an all-new manufacturing technology. These all-new technologies were expected to deliver benefits in terms of performance, power consumption, and chip area. However, due to the difficulties associated with transitioning to the company's upcoming 10-nanometer technology, the company's latest processors are built on a performance-enhanced variant of the company's 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+. This technology allowed the company to deliver more performance with this product family without having to grapple with the challenges associated with an unhealthy manufacturing technology. The catch? Intel doesn't get a chip-area reduction with this new technology. The 14-nanometer+ technology is likely in good shape at this point, meaning that the company is unlikely to face cost-structure problems or supply constraints as it did in the early innings of the transition from 22-nanometer technology to 14-nanometer technology. Image source: Intel.  Big boosts for low-power laptops The biggest gains in performance relative to the prior-generation sixth-generation Core processors, or Skylake processor family, seem to come in power-constrained mobile form factors. For example, Intel's seventh-generation Core processor lineup includes a chip known as the Core i7-7560U. This is a dual-core processor rated at a 15-watt thermal-design power, complete with the company's Iris Plus graphics technology. The chip runs at a base speed of 2.4GHz, a single-core turbo speed of 3.8GHz, and a dual-core turbo speed of 3.7GHz. The direct predecessor to this chip, known as the Core i7-6560U, ran at a base speed of 2.2GHz, a single-core turbo speed of 3.2GHz, and a dual-core turbo speed of 3.1GHz. That's an 18.75% gain in single-core frequency and a 19.35% gain in dual-core turbo frequency -- both substantial uplifts in performance. In higher performance/power products, there are still gains, but they're less substantial. The company's workhorse in gaming laptops, the 45-watt Core i7-6700HQ, ran at a base speed of 2.6GHz and offered single-, dual-, and quad-core turbo speeds of 3.5GHz, 3.3GHz, and 3.1GHz, respectively. The follow-on to this part, the Core i7-7700HQ, runs at a base speed of 2.8GHz, and offers single-, dual-, and quad-core turbo speeds of 3.8GHz, 3.6GHz, and 3.4GHz, respectively. The frequency gains here are between 8.5% and 10% -- tangible performance increases, to be sure, but not quite as robust as the gains seen in the very low-power processors. Whatever improvements Intel made to the manufacturing technology and the chip design appear to have been geared more at lower-power chips -- the bulk of the market -- rather than the higher-power/performance models. The lineup is all done There have been rumors making the rounds that Intel is planning a processor known as Kaby Lake-Refresh U -- essentially, variants of the 15-watt Kaby Lake chips that just launched, but with four processor cores instead of just two. Given that these appeared to be called Kaby Lake, it wasn't clear whether or not these chips would be part of, perhaps, a third wave of seventh-generation Core processors that would launch later. However, thanks to a relatively new leak from generally reliable website BenchLife.info, it appears that Intel plans to kick off the eighth-generation Core processor family with these chips. This strongly suggests, then, that Intel has completed the rollout of its seventh-generation Core processors. Investor takeaway Intel has made it clear that it aims to deliver new products to the marketplace on an annual cadence, irrespective of any challenges that the company faces in trying to migrate to all-new manufacturing technologies. With the seventh-generation Core lineup, it looks as though the company has made good on bringing enhanced products to the marketplace, with the improvements most evident in the segments of the market that are most sensitive to power consumption/power efficiency. That said, a single data point doesn't make a trend -- it'll be interesting to see if Intel can sustain this annual product cadence over a longer time horizon. After all, Intel's prior Tick-Tock methodology worked great early on, but execution problems cropped up, leading the company to formally abandon the methodology after less than a decade -- with cracks in the armor showing up well before then.

Ryzen is the culmination of four years of development at AMD, and that happens to be the same amount of time the chip designer expects its forthcoming CPU architecture to be relevant. After four years, AMD will move onto something else. We know this because PCWorld had a chat with Mark Papermaster, AMD's chief technology officer, who told the site AMD was aiming for a four-year lifespan out of Ryzen. Essentially what AMD wants to do is release processors that have a bigger impact on performance compared to the previous generation. It is a different approach from Intel, which for many years followed a two-year "tick-tock" release cadence with less of a performance gap in between CPU architecture releases. "We're not going tick-tock. Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock," Papermaster said. A "tick" in Intel's tick-tock cadence represents a CPU release built on a smaller process technology than its predecessor, whereas a "tock" is a completely new architecture released on the same manufacturing process. For example, Intel's 14nm Broadwell architecture is a tick, as it is a refined version of Haswell (22nm). What came after Broadwell is Skylake (14nm), a new architecture built on the same 14nm process node as Broadwell, making it a tock. The performance gap between Skylake and Haswell is greater than it is between Broadwell and Haswell. To be clear, Papermaster is not saying that AMD will release a batch of Ryzen CPUs and then make users wait four years before new processors arrive. AMD will likely release new CPUs every year, but the improvements it makes to Ryzen with each release will go beyond minor upgrades consisting of power efficiency improvements with a few performance optimizations sprinkled in. Of course we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Before any of this can come to fruition, Ryzen has to live up to the hype. Whether or not it will is something we'll find out in just a couple of months. If it does, one good thing to note is that AMD plans to be ready with available stock. "We're not going to do a paper launch," Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics business, added. "We've done that before. We're not going to mess with it." Ryzen is scheduled to release in March. For enthusiasts who are hot to trot with Ryzen, there will be plenty of high-end accompanying hardware to go with AMD's new CPUs, as AMD has worked with all of the big names in the motherboard market to have AM4-based boards ready to go.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  iBUYPOWER Snowblind Gaming PC Features Transparent LCD Side Panel iBUYPOWER Snowblind Gaming PC Features Transparent LCD Side Panel Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Sun, Jan 08, 2017 - 3:19 PM iBUYPOWER announced back in May 2016 that they were working on an LCD side panel-equipped gaming PC called Snowblind. We actually totally forgot all about the project, but when we were on the CES 2017 show floor we ran across the new iBUYPOWER Snowblind PC that is actually coming to market next month. iBUYPOWER teamed up with Intel to create the panel and together they created half a dozen panels before finally being happy with the one they picked to go into production with. Pricing for the Snowblind Gaming PC is not finalized yet, but they said that the tempered glass side panel that has the translucent 19-inch 1280 x 1024 LCD display on it only costs about $250. The other thing that will drive up the cost for this side panel is that the inside of the case needs to be a uniform color in order to get the best clarity on the translucent display. The iBuypower Snowblind gaming PC will be fully customizable, but the inside is all white and silver to get the best image quality on the display. That means they’ll have to paint the inside of the chassis white and use white PSU cable sleeves, motherboards, case fans and so on. We see this driving up the price of the PC a good bit as that will likely increase the build cost due to sourcing all the white parts and the extra time needed to switch come components out. You can see a video of the demo that iBUYPOWER was doing in their private meeting suite below. Check out our new #Snowblind #GamingPC! Want one? Available early February! #CES2017 www.ibuypower.com/Snowblind Posted by iBUYPOWER on Thursday, January 5, 2017   The case in the Intel booth was basically showing the Windows desktop when we saw it (see below), but you can program the display to do whatever you want with open-source software. If you aren’t a coder you’ll be able to run multiple pre-configured effects. You can also play a video, show system specifications (Rainmeter was shown at CES 2017) or a custom message on the digital side panel while still being able to show off the inside of your system. You can find out more on the iBUYPOWER Snowblind Gaming PC on it’s landing page. If you want the side panel you will not be able to buy it alone as it is designed for the iBUYPOWER Noctis gaming case that is exclusive to iBUYPOWER. iBUYPOWER is also not selling the case by itself, so you’ll have to configure and purchase an entire Snowblind Gaming PC to get this side panel technology. We can’t wait to see what the entry-level price will be next month!

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us YEAR IN REVIEW 2016 National World Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage Reuters8 January 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos An autonomous car from Delphi departs Treasure Island for a cross-country trip from San Francisco to New York City in San Francisco, California March 22, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen LamMore By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber [UBER.UL] to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF [ZFF.UL] and Bosch [ROBG.UL]. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks." (In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000.)

Bryant Executive vice president and general manager of the Data Center Group for Intel Corporation. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + This article is part of New Europe’s: Our World in 2017 USA – SANTA CLARA –In 1965, Intel Corporation’s co-founder Gordon Moore famously predicted the rate of advancement of integrated circuits, noting that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit would double every year. A decade later, he revised his statement to doubling every two years and the concept is now known as Moore’s Law.  Moore’s Law translates to a doubling of a computer’s computational capability every two years and continues to serve as a guiding principle for the technology industry. These advances enabled by Moore’s Law now produce a new mechanism to derive value from computing. As we enter 2017, we are crossing the threshold of a new era for human innovation – one in which machines can analyze significantly more data and recognize difficult to find patterns in that information. With the increased ability and affordability of computing, machines are able to continuously analyze and learn from data and accurately predict outcomes; this is what we call Artificial Intelligence (AI). Researchers have been working on AI for more than 50 years. We are now starting to see the benefits of those decades of investment in capabilities such as machine learning and machine reasoning. These technologies exhibit tremendous potential to improve society in areas ranging from better healthcare and safer driving to more efficient agriculture and energy development. For example, AI used in cars is now capable of interacting with not only the static elements of the road – signage, painted lines, etc. – but also pedestrians and other cars on the road. AI-enabled (also called automated driving) vehicles are currently being tested on roads worldwide and have the ability to assist drivers, optimize traffic flow, and reduce collisions resulting in saved lives.  Of course, AI has applications beyond vehicles that will impact the future. AI will benefit the industrial and agriculture sectors through the rise of smart factories and cities, precision agriculture and power management. The healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors are incorporating AI to assist with early diagnosis, precision medicine delivery and drug discovery. The financial sector is benefitting from fraud detection, risk assessment and asset management. Cybersecurity firms are using AI to predict threats of network intrusion, thereby, using data to protect data. Even the sports industry is incorporating AI for performance optimization, injury protection and fitness management. To keep up with the potential of AI innovation and the benefit it can bring society, the world will need laws and regulations that embrace these innovations while protecting people from unintended consequences.   Governmental regulation will need to keep up with the pace of AI advancements to protect the public and invest in long-term sustainable policy approaches. To ensure the benefits of the burgeoning AI field are made available to the greatest number of people possible, we must do three things: 1) Drive; 2) Democratize, and 3) Guide.  First, we need to “drive” AI by building the technology, optimizing its performance for AI applications, and advancing public policy to keep pace with AI development. At Intel, we are actively working with a wide range of industries to accelerate AI development. To do that, Intel and many of our technology partners are also maintaining an open dialogue with national governments and international regulatory bodies to identify and implement long-term and sustainable policy approaches.  By building and maintaining strong partnerships as these emerging technologies blossom, the computing industry and its regulators can work together to mitigate risk, drive accountability and reap incredible benefit. Second, we need to “democratize” AI by working with developers, academia, government, industry, and civil society to promote open access to the data and tools that will fuel broad development of AI.  This means engaging with the developers of tomorrow today. Isolated data stores, complex tools and a small talent pool currently limit access to AI. Government and industry both have roles to play to democratize AI.  Government can play an important role to encourage the creation of an AI workforce, including supporting graduate students and funding research.  Intel has committed to democratize AI innovation, leading the charge for open data exchanges and initiatives. One example is the Intel Nervana AI Academy created to increase accessibility to data, tools, training and intelligent machines for a broad community of developers, academics and startups. Democratization will improve overall access to the technology and allow societies to reap the benefit from AI. Democratization also requires global data flows that protect privacy and the reliability, integrity, and security of the data. Restricting data within national boundaries may inhibit AI from taking advantage of greater data diversity that comes from study across different geographies and cultures. Third, we must “guide” AI into the future to ensure it is used for the collective good and to solve critical problems previously believed unsolvable.  Guiding AI will require that we grapple with complex questions of ethics, privacy, discrimination, employment and even human autonomy.  Public discussion and debate must happen early and often as we advance AI to experience a safer and more productive world. While these will not be easy conversations, they will enable the successful and beneficial use of these promising technologies. In 2020 we will look back on the capstone decade of artificial intelligence.  That is to say, the time where years of research combined with the computing power made possible by Moore’s Law translated into bold applications.  This is an exciting moment to be building the brains of the platforms that will fundamentally change the way people engage with the world.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage | LAS VEGAS LAS VEGAS Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber [UBER.UL] to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF [ZFF.UL] and Bosch [ROBG.UL]. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks." (In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000.)

When we tried the first-generation prototype, though, it was in a very early state. Well, Intel is back with a new demo, and we’re still in the early days — but that’s still pretty exciting. Intel says the Alloy headset at CES is its third generation, and it’s supposed to feature improved tracking, among other incremental upgrades. However, it still hasn’t made the changes that Intel mentioned last year: a chip from recently acquired computer vision company Movidius; the transition from two RealSense cameras to a single, wide-angle RealSense 400 series one; and a seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor. It looks very similar to the previous design, which means it’s big, clunky, and not particularly comfortable. But it’s still very impressive to walk around with no wires or external trackers, something I’ve only done in a handful of headsets. My demo was short, and it didn’t include the complex real-world interactions Intel showcased last year. (My colleague Lauren Goode also tried the first generation instead of me, so I can’t comment on any improved performance.) Instead, it mostly focused on Alloy’s inside-out tracking, and its ability to map virtual environments that reflected real obstacles. In this case, the Alloy team had pre-scanned a room full of furniture with a separate RealSense camera, although it’s also possible to do this with the headset. Once I put the headset on, a small, fenced-in metal platform appeared around me, with props strategically placed where I might bump into things — a coffee table, for example, became a round, screen-equipped... sci-fi coffee table, effectively. Coffee table, meet sci-fi coffee table It was less outright merged reality than virtual reality informed by spatial awareness, but again, that’s impressive. The relatively simple graphics were rendered crisply and smoothly, although the headset was so heavy I had to hold it up to get the best angle. Project Alloy’s inside-out VR tracking is the second-best I’ve seen, after Oculus’ Santa Cruz prototype. There’s only a little of the “swimminess” I’ve experienced in some other headsets at CES — the unreal feeling you get when the tracking camera doesn’t quite pick up small motions like leaning. But unlike Santa Cruz, where it’s almost impossible to tell you’re not using traditional trackers, the experience is distinctly worse than current tethered headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. It doesn’t help that the controller Intel brought to CES, which simulates a virtual gun, doesn’t have full motion tracking. It only translates rotation, and for me, the gun never felt oriented in quite the same direction as my real hand. As small flying robots began to appear and I had to shoot them, this stopped me from getting completely immersed in the experience, even though the weapon was responsive and easy to aim. Intel says that full tracking is possible, but here, the lack of it is distracting. Intel isn’t directly bringing Project Alloy to market, but it says at least one unnamed partner will be releasing a finished version later this year. If what we’re seeing at CES is any indication, there’s still a lot to fix before then, but also a lot of promise.

Optane, which Intel claims will replace today's SSDs and DRAM, is exciting for many reasons. Game play, PC booting, and productivity applications will be much faster with the new class of storage and memory. Intel has said Optane could be up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, but real-world tests on the storage have yet to be done. The first Optane storage was announced at CES, but it's only in the form of low-capacity 16GB and 32GB units to be used as cache and not as primary storage. The initial Optanes will not have a meaty capacity, but it will be a good start to test and play with the storage, said Pat Kannar, marketing director for Precision desktops at Dell. "You are going to see it roll in higher densities and capacities over the next few years, and different form factors too," Kannar said. Optane still remains a bit of a mystery, but here's what we know based on data gathered from Intel and PC makers. What is Optane? Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, in which memory cells sit in a three-dimensional mesh. Intel and Micron -- which share many memory manufacturing resources -- cooperated on the development of the technology. The first 16GB and 32GB storage will work only on PCs with Kaby Lake chips. It won't work on PCs with older Intel chips like Skylake or Broadwell or on PCs with AMD chips. While the new Optanes are exclusive to Kaby Lake, that could change in the future.  Ultimately, Intel will ship large-capacity Optane SSDs, which will replace conventional SSDs. Intel will also ship the versatile Optane as a DRAM replacement that could plug into DIMM slots. The Optane memory will be denser and retain data, unlike DRAM, which deletes data once a PC is turned off. When will Optane ship? Intel says the low-capacity Optane storage will ship in the second quarter of this year, and PC makers indicated it could be a while before large-capacity Optane SSDs are available. The large-capacity Optane SSDs will likely be installed in servers before coming to PCs. Facebook and IBM are already testing large-capacity SSDs in servers. Like any new storage technology, Optane won't be cheap. Optane technology is still being produced in limited quantities in a factory in Dalian, China. The production will ramp up over time, reducing the cost of making Optane. Intel is projecting a quick switch to mass production, when prices will start dropping. What systems will Optane be used in? Many PCs that will get the 16GB or 32GB Optane storage installed were announced at CES this week. The storage initially will go into sockets on motherboards. Ultimately, you'll be able to plug in large-capacity Optane storage into m.2 or 2.5-inch slots. The first laptop announced was Lenovo's ThinkPad T570, with a price starting at US $909. It'll have an optional 16GB Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3, but the laptop's price will shoot up if you select that storage option. The laptop will ship in March, though the Optane option may be available later. HP's revamped Envy Curved All-in-One 34 with Kaby Lake will get Optane during the spring update to the product, said Mike Nash, vice president of product management for consumer PC and solutions at the company. Nash declined to provide a specific timeline, but it is in line with Intel's planned second-quarter release of Optane. Dell plans to install Optane in some of its Precision laptops and OptiPlex desktops around June. Intel's new "tall" NUC systems -- the NUC7i3BNH with 7th Generation Core i3, NUC7i5BNH with Core i5, and the NUC7i7BNH with Core i7 — will support Optane. Supermicro also announced new SuperO motherboards for gaming and business PCs with support for Optane. Optane could make hard drives relevant again For Dell's Kannar, Optane will make it feasible to put traditional hard drives into laptops or desktops, especially if you are on a budget. A PC with a hard drive as primary storage and an Optane cache could load the OS and applications faster than an all-SSD system, Kannar said. The trick is that Optane -- which is closer to the CPU -- would need to hold images of the OS and key applications. "It's cheaper to do that in some cases than having an all-SSD system," Kannar said.  But, of course, having Optane alongside SSD as primary storage will be much faster, but more expensive. Optane is plug and play for Windows There are also questions of how Optane will work with various OSes. Intel has said software will need to be adjusted to effectively work with Optane. PC makers said its likely Windows 10 will be aware of Optane, thanks to Intel drivers and technologies like the chipmaker's RST (Rapid Storage Technology), which will harness the speed of Optane. Questions still remain on whether Linux and MacOS will have similar plug-and-play capabilities. Linux is notorious for being late on adding support for new technologies.

Xeon HD Graphics P530 With OpenGL & Vulkan On Mesa 13.1-dev + Linux 4.10 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 8 January 2017 at 09:18 AM EST. 2 Comments On Saturday I published Intel IvyBridge / Haswell /Broadwell / Skylake OpenGL and Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1 using various Core CPUs. But for some fun benchmarks this Sunday morning are GL/VLK results when using a Xeon E3 v5 Skylake CPU with HD Graphics P530. It's been quite a number of months since last trying out the HD Graphics P530 and thus while having a Xeon E3-1245 v5 running Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 for some fresh benchmarks after changing out the motherboard, I figured I would see how the graphics performance for this Xeon CPU compares to the Core IVB / HSW / BDW / SKL results from yesterday. Like the other systems, this Intel Xeon E3-1245 v5 + MSI C236A WORKSTATION + 32GB DDR4 system was running Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 with Linux 4.10 and Mesa 13.1-dev from the Padoka PPA. Basically with this Xeon E3-1245 v5 CPU with HD Graphics P530 you get around the speed of the Core i5 6500, to not much surprise. The P530 graphics have a maximum dynamic frequency of 1.15GHz while the CPU is quad-core + HT and has a 3.5GHz base frequency with 3.9GHz turbo. The i5-6500 is just a quad-core part with 3.2GHz base and 3.6GHz turbo while its HD Graphics 530 top out at 1.05GHz. Thus in the heavier tests it sides with the E3-1245 v5 over the i5-6500 due to the higher clock frequencies. Find more of these OpenGL results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. The Vulkan results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. Now to see how the Kaby Lake Core i5/i7 socketed HD Graphics 630 performance compares under Linux in just a day or two. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) 67 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE LAS VEGAS—CES teaches hard lessons about preserving a phone, tablet or laptop’s battery life and connectivity, starting with this: If you value those things, don’t go to CES. Having 175,000-plus people swarm around the city while constantly on e-mail, the Web, navigation apps and social networks will crumple wireless networks and leave batteries in the red. Getting through all this takes advance preparation—the kind that can also help you get through lesser battery and bandwidth challenges. • Cables and chargers: The first rule of CES is ABC: Always Be Charging. If you’re standing still or sitting down and you see an outlet, plug in your devices. But chaining yourself to an outlet is no way to cover the Consumer Technology Association’sconvention, so external phone battery packs are standard accessory here. Your phone’s charger and battery pack should also support high-speed charging. Finally, when you’re next shopping for a phone, tablet or laptop, note that devices that charge over USB-C cables free you from having to remember to pack proprietary cables. In some cases, these allow you to not just charge a phone from a laptop or (non-Apple) tablet, but vice versa. • Police your phone’s power usage: Both Android and iOS will show you which apps use the most power, in each case by opening the Settings app and then touching “Battery.” You probably won’t see any outliers there, but if you do then you should think about uninstalling them. You may get more benefit from regulating the entire phone’s appetite for data. Disabling wireless data—in Android’s Settings app, tap “Data usage”; in iOS’s Settings, tap “Cellular”—will stretch the device’s battery life if you can get by with calls and texts. If your connection gets unusably slow, putting the phone in airplane mode will spare you the frustration of getting nowhere online but stop your phone from burning through its battery by trying to connect to the network over and over.

Some prepaid services don’t, and the “unlimited” T-Mobile One plan that the carrier introduced last year and updated at CES limits tethering to 3G speeds, which will leave your laptop or tablet sputtering along at a few megabits per second instead of the 15 Mbps or more that LTE usually delivers. Note that using your phone as a hotspot not only chews through your plan’s data allotment but will also hurt its battery life more than almost anything else you can do with it. If you have cable Internet at home, you can also use free “Cable WiFi” hotspots at some half a million locations across the U.S. by signing in with your cable account’s user name and password. • Use apps that let you switch between mobile devices: Having only one device get any connectivity happens too often at CES, making it important to use cloud-hosted apps that let me move between devices. For example, by taking notes in Evernote I can switch between my phone and my laptop (provided each device has enough bandwidth to synchronize my changes). But if I start a story in Apple’s TextEdit app on my MacBook Air, I can’t do anything with it on my Android phone—or my iPad, if I were to carry it. Google Docs doesn’t have that hangup and even allows offline editing—but I had to start writing this column in TextEdit anyway, because the press-room WiFi was out at the time.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Market News | Sun Jan 8, 2017 | 1:48pm EST CORRECTED-RPT-Automakers, suppliers team up to share costs of self-driving cars (In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi turn-key system to $5,000 from $8,000) By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage LAS VEGAS Jan 8 Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop self-driving car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

Under Armour Founder and CEO Kevin Plank took the keynote stage Friday afternoon and emphasized the importance of branding saying that “the key to any brand is to have personality and point of view.” Under Armour is innovating by putting technology front and center, investing $1 billion in health and fitness tech. Plank unveiled three new models of the company’s Record Equipped shoes, which give performance feedback based on workouts. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all-time, joined Plank onstage to demo the shoes and talk about UA Healthbox, powered by UA Record, the world’s first connected fitness system. The keynote wrapped with the unveiling of a new line of sleep apparel, dubbed Rest Win Repeat, in collaboration with Patriot’s quarterback Tom Brady, designed to rebuild the body while it rests through infrared technology. Top industry executives and influencers joined global government officials at the annual Leaders in Technology Dinner on Friday evening. Ford President and CEO Mark Fields shared the company's vision for how the future of mobility will be transformed by connectivity. "Imagine what could happen when the way you get around looks completely different. Cities will change. The way we work and play and socialize will transform. And it will all be enabled by connectivity," said Fields. He announced that Ford Sync is expanding to deliver cloud-based services and that soon all Ford vehicles will be controlled remotely with the FordPass app. He also recapped Ford's recent partnership with Toyota to form the SmartDeviceLink Consortium to establish industry-driven standards for in-vehicle apps. Conferences Day two and three of CES 2017 featured SuperSessions and conference tracks focused on technology trends and policy issues, as well as C Space Storytellers and the Sports Business Innovation Track. Friday’s SuperSession Powering the Sharing Economy to Transform Lives featured panelists from Grab, the Prime Minister’s Office of Singapore and Lyft. Panelists discussed the potential of the sharing economy to democratize transportation and make travel an enjoyment, not a burden. Annabel Chang, director of public policy, Lyft, explained that among her company’s customer base, “Most people do not live within a quarter mile of a transit stop. A significant percentage of our riders take Lyft to a transportation hub, then take public transportation on their final leg.” The Self-Driving Cars: New Rules of the Road SuperSession moderated by USA Today’s tech reporter, Mike Snider, discussed with top executives from Blackberry, Intel and Mobileye how a collaborative approach between automakers, hardware and software developers is driving the rapid pace of self-driving innovations. The panelists agreed that in order to reach the expected goal of having self-driving cars on the road by 2020, the industry needs to fully solve the convergence of IoT and artificial intelligence. Friday’s SuperSession The Power of Hidden Figures, sponsored by IBM, focused on illuminating the story of women and minorities in traditionally non-cinematic roles: advancing the math and science fields. Moderated by journalist Soledad O'Brien, panelists included actress Octavia Spencer and representatives from IBM, New York City Department of Education, 20th Century Fox and Girls Who Code. IBM highlighted its organic commitment to diversity and inclusion over the past century. The Opportunities for the Global Innovation Economy SuperSession, moderated by Time Inc.’s Alan Murray, examined with CEOs from Flex, Ford and Intel how consumer technology companies are leveraging their power to build global brands and advance innovation in a rapidly changing world. The panelists - Mark Fields, president and CEO, Ford Motor Company; Brian Krzanich, CEO, Intel Corp and Mike McNamara, CEO, Flex – discussed how globalization and digitalization have been the two great trends in innovation over the last 50 years and what we can expect moving forward. C Space Storytellers During the Turner session, Otto Bell, vice president and group creative director of Courageous, Turner’s first-ever brand studio, announced the beginning of the “Post-Text Era” where images and video do all the talking. Courageous is developing new ways to utilize technology to reach viewers from 360 cameras to VR. At the Facebook session, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, VP of ads & business platforms, Facebook sat down for a fireside chat with Sony’s Josh Greenstein, president of worldwide marketing & distribution. Bosworth and Greenstein discussed how mobile and social media platforms are shaping Sony’s marketing campaigns to reach targeted audiences. Bosworth noted Facebook provides a myriad of platforms for marketing customization and distribution to targeted audiences. Executive producer of BBC Earth Productions, Charlotte Jones, provided a deep dive into the opportunities of storytelling through VR and AR during BBC’s Storytellers session on Friday. Collaborating with Oculus VR, BBC Earth Productions is creating interactive movies and games to be experienced by consumers using Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. Twitter CMO Leslie Berland opened the company’s Storytellers session Friday afternoon with a look back on 2016 using Tweets. Twitter has positioned itself as more than a social media platform. By changing the rules of storytelling, Twitter is able to capture news and real-time moments through its users. Sports Business Innovation Technology spans all industries including sports. The Sports Business Innovation track, presented by Turner Sports ran a series of jam-packed sessions that featured Gary Bettman, Commissioner NHL, Don Garber, Commissioner, Major League Soccer, Scott Blackmun, CEO, U.S. Olympic Committee, Brian France, Chairman and CEO, Nascar, Dan Gilbert, Majority Owner, Cleveland Cavaliers and Alejandro Agag, CEO, Formula E. These big names from professional sports leagues and partners took a deep-dive into the future of sports tech. The series focused on topics including: how to extend the fan experience, what the future of arena technology looks like and how virtual and augmented reality can become part of the experience, generational differences in content consumption and viewing patterns, and how data analytics effect personnel management and player performance. Innovation Policy Track Friday’s panel The Trolls and Tech: How to Fix Patents was moderated by CTA’s Michael Patrick Hayes and featured Tyler Grimm, legislature director for Rep. Darrell Issa; Athenahealth’s Colin Anawaty; Tech:NYC’s Julie Samuels and InterDigital’s Rob Stein. The panelists discussed the harm and damage patent trolls can do to businesses, as well as how Congress can find a reasonable solution for patent reform. US Patent and Trade Office director Michelle Lee gave the panel's opening statement surrounding the agency's recent efforts, reform and projects to combat the problem. US Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) made a surprise appearance, delivering closing comments and explaining how patent trolls can devastate small companies. Saturday’s panel New President, New Congress? What’s Next included Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH); Rep. Eric Swalwell, (D-CA); Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX), with moderator Tiffany M. Moore, VP, congressional affairs, CTA. The session showed bipartisan agreement about many policies needed to promote innovation and support technological leadership, including high skilled immigration reform, endorsing strong encryption, flexibility for emerging sharing economy business models and making more spectrum available for commercial and public use. Attending his 35th CES, Rep. Issa emphasized that high skilled immigration reform would be one of his priorities, saying, “We need to make sure the companies who want to expand get the resources they need, including talent.” Friday also featured the Stars of CES Awards, presented by What Hi-Fi recognizing the top 10 audio and video products launched at this year's show. The complete list of winners can be found at WhatHiFi.com. Saturday’s always popular Last Gadget Standing, presented by Living in Digital Times, featured the top products unveiled at CES 2017. Hosted by David Pogue from Yahoo! Tech, the innovations showcased included cutting-edge wearables, smart home technologies and connected networks. The Matrix Powerwatch, which never needs charging or battery replacement and displays how much electric power your body is generating and accurately measures calories burned was crowned the winner.

Who walked away with a year of bragging rights?  MATRIX PowerWatch, a body heat powered smartwatch, won in Last Gadget Standing, now in its 16 [th] year, while LinksysVelop, a Wi-Fi mesh router, captured the online vote. For the 7 [th] Annual Mobile Apps Showdown, MyScript Nebo, a handwriting recognition app, took home the coveted prize as both the best app at the live event and the favorite of online voters. Back for a second year, tech guru and founder of Yahoo! Tech, David Pogue held court as host.  All morning the audience was entertained with another year of creative and funny presentations from a body heat competition to a craft beer tasting and a live DJ set! There was even an appearance from a local Las Vegas news anchor.  Attendees were challenged to answer David's trivia questions to win great prizes, from fitness trackers and headphones to smart toothbrushes and drones.  Lenovo's ongoing sponsorship and commitment to innovation is appreciated. "I can't think of a more entertaining, more creative way to showcase some of the most innovative tech at CES, than by pitting products against one another for laughs and applause," said Robin Raskin, founder a and president of Living in Digital Times. "It's exciting to see the crowds turn up year after year to have their say in Last Gadget Standing and Mobile Apps Showdown." "After three days of exhaustion on the CES show floor, you'd think there would be nothing left to amaze us. But every year, the candidates for Last Gadget Standing and Mobile Apps Showdown blow my mind," said David Pogue, founder, Yahoo! Tech. "Every one of these inventions deserves an award for ingenuity and brilliance!" Last Gadget Standing 2017 Finalists BLOCKS Canary Flex Coros LINX Hubblo VR KUBO Robot Linksys Velop MATRIX PowerWatch PicoBrew Pico Portal Home Wi-Fi System Qkey Torch Pro Mobile Apps Showdown 2017 Finalists HomeAdvisor MyScript Nebo NewsON Notion Sesame True Key by Intel Security Each finalist was selected by a panel of judges, including journalists, engineers, designers and developers.  After passionate debate and discussion, the judges decided on the Top 11 gadgets as well as the Top 6 mobile apps to compete in a live competition and online vote to prove their staying power at CES 2017. Winners of online voting were determined by popular vote. In person, an applause-o-meter measured audience enthusiasm to determine the winner. Mobile Apps Showdown started with a special ceremony honoring four students who were named 2017 Young Innovators to Watch. Through the generosity of the Kay Family Foundation, Lenovo and Samsung, The Young Innovators program offers scholarship awards to high school and college students developing new technology products and experiences.  They are: Sara Du, Irvine, CA, developed Bluejay, an app to assist emergency responders. The app connects through Bluetooth to an Intel Edison (or Arduino or Raspberry Pi) that is attached to a drone. Emergency responders can then fly the drone over areas that have been impacted by natural disaster and collect data, such as GPS location, from those who are stranded. Shalin Shah, Las Flores, CA, developed Lumos, an app that can aid early detection of glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness worldwide.  The app connects to a low-cost lens attachment that allows non-specialists to photograph the retina, and an algorithm that analyzes the retinal image for patterns of glaucoma and identifies risk. Utkarsh Tandon, Cupertino, CA, developed OneRing, a wearable ring that analyzes movement patterns to diagnose and assess Parkinson's disease. It provides high precision monitoring at every hour of the day to the fingertips of patients to track disease progression and analyze the impact of treatments. Emily Post, New York, NY created Finding Clover, a geo-location mobile game that supports the movement to reduce and ultimately eliminate dangerous toxins. Kids look for clover and accumulate points while they learn how they can play a part in the movement. "All of the students that entered clearly have both technical acumen and a love of helping people and the planet. We hope scholarships and recognitions like this one help to raise a generation of innovators and problem solvers," said Robin Raskin, founder and president of Living in Digital Times. Scholarship winners received up to $2,000 (plus hi-tech gear), a free trip to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, international recognition, and the opportunity to meet technology industry professionals, journalists and influencers at a highly publicized awards ceremony.

That's what makes iBuyPower's Snowblind PC so jaw-dropping. This one-of-a-kind desktop packs a translucent monitor right into its case, which can display cool color patterns, pertinent system information or whatever else you want to show off while you game. Key Specs and Features Snowblind's see-through LCD side panel essentially operates as its own monitor, allowing you to play videos and display widgets right on the case itself. The demo unit I saw displayed some mesmerizing color effects, as well as rotating Intel and iBuyPower logos as well as widgets that displayed the time and the system's CPU usage. Plenty of potential here, practical or otherwise. The unit I saw featured fully custom parts in an alluring frosty white finish, including a 7th-gen Intel Core i7 processor and an Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics card. Snowblind is very easy to pop open, should you need to replace any components. The top of the machine features plenty of ports for plug-and-play gaming, including four USB 3.0 inputs as well as headphone and mic jacks. Why You Should Care While Snowblind seems aimed at folks who want a gaming PC that demands the attention of anyone in the room, it also offers up plenty of practical potential. For example, pro gamers can proudly display their team's logo while at a tournament, while folks without a spare monitor can use the LCD screen to keep track of their Twitch chat or system performance without having to close their game. And if you mainly just want a PC that oozes style, there's nothing that looks (or works) quite like the Snowblind. MORE: Sexiest and Wildest Gaming PCs Pricing and Availability Snowblind is set to launch in February. The model we saw would run you $1,800, largely due to the custom high-end parts inside, though iBuyPower is working to come up with more wallet-friendly configurations. We look forward to spending more time with Snowblind and putting as much crazy content as possible on its translucent display, so stay tuned for our full review.  See Also : CES 2017 Day 3: Tech You Missed The Best Gaming PCs The Ultimate Guide to Twitch Streaming Gaming Desktop Buying Guide: 7 Things You Need to Know About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

Sponsored by The GeekWire team is covering CES 2017 live from Las Vegas, featuring the latest in consumer electronics, cars, sports tech and more. Alan Murray of Time Inc. interviews Ford CEO Mark Fields, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Flex CEO Mike McNamara at CES today. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) LAS VEGAS — Ford was the latest company to find itself in the spotlight over issues of jobs and globalization this week, as the automaker canceled plans for a Mexican factory that would have employed nearly 3,000 people. President-elect Donald Trump is getting the blame, but Ford CEO Mark Fields, speaking today the Consumer Electronics Show, insisted that the company made the decision for its own reasons. Ford CEO Mark Fields at CES in Las Vegas today. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) “In our case, obviously with the plant in Mexico, we did what was right for our business, not because the President-elect said … ” Fields said in response to a question about the issue during a panel at CES today with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Flex CEO Mike McNamara. “But Trump had some effect on the decision,” countered moderator Alan Murray of Time Inc. Fields said, “Well, you know, bottom line is we didn’t need the capacity anymore. We were going to build our Focus there, small cars are decreasing here, demand. So we just didn’t need it.” That was the prelude to a larger discussion about globalization and automation among the CEOs, three high-profile figures in the worlds of automobiles, technology and manufacturing. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at CES today. (GeekWire Photo / Todd Bishop) Fields continued, “When you look at a lot of the trends around globalization, particularly around information and the Internet, all information is now global, and you really have to step back and understand, why are people questioning globalization. I think part of it is because the benefits that were sold to voters, particularly in more affluent countries, haven’t materialized.” He added, “For globalization to regain its mojo, so to speak, the folks in some of these affluent countries are going to need to see the benefits, and as we’ve seen over time, it ebbs and flows.” Flex CEO Mike McNamara Addressing the issue from the perspective of technology manufacturer Flex, McNamara said “globalization continues to be a powerful force … We’re going to end up building closer and closer to the end markets that we actually serve. It’s more efficient, it’s more productive. … I don’t think it’s going to stop.” The bigger impact on jobs could come from technology and automation, and Intel’s Krzanich took on that topic in response to a subsequent question. “I have this belief that technology drives transformation — it actually creates jobs,” Krzanich said, referring to overall net employment gains and losses. “It rarely ever eliminates jobs.” However, Fields added, “There’s going to be a lag effect here.” He referred to the scenario of autonomous trucking displacing human truck drivers. “They could be trained for lots of different things, but are they going to be trained as data analysts, things of that nature?” Fields said. “I agree with Brian — ultimately it creates more jobs, but as you go through that transition, there are going to be displaced, and they’re going to be vocal about it, and I think we as a society are going to deal with that, because the last thing is the society to turn against technological innovation. That would be disastrous.” More Special Coverage: CES 2017 Sponsor Post Explore Northeastern University in the Pacific Northwest Be a part of Seattle’s tech boom!  Northeastern University – the global, experiential, research university – is right in our backyard!  The Seattle campus is Washington State’s first private research university and its portfolio of online and hybrid graduate degree and certificate programs include computer science, bioinformatics, global studies, and project management. Learn more about their graduate degrees, tech boot camps and one-of-a-kind ALIGN program for those with a non-science background.

Scott Applewhite Politics 20:02 07.01.2017(updated 03:40 08.01.2017) Get short URL 304082793 The United States intelligence community made unfounded allegations of Russia-sponsored hacker attacks, in favor of the outgoing US presidential administration. As a result, it made a fool of itself, according to Franz Klintsevich, the first deputy chairman of the Defense and Security Committee of the Russian parliament's upper house. © REUTERS/ Carlo Allegri/File Photo Trump Says US Intel Has 'Absolutely No Evidence' Alleged Hacking Affected ElectionEarlier this week, US intelligence command, US Cyber Force command and the Pentagon issued a joint statement labelling Russia as a serious cyber-threat to the US. In addition, the US intelligence community once again accused Moscow of hacker attacks, in an attempt to interfere with the US electoral process. On Thursday, President Obama received an intelligence report on the issue. "Frankly speaking, we’ve had enough of this. It’s time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. It would be childish to deny that Russia and of course the US are very concerned about possible cyber-threats. But as for cyber weapons, there is still no equivalent to the nuclear bomb," the senator told RIA Novosti. © REUTERS/ Yuri Gripas Different Hacks for Different Folks: White House Can’t Explain Why China Left Unpunished for 2014 AdventureAccording to Klintsevish, Moscow should not repeat that the allegations are unfounded. "What is more, they simply make no sense. The main reason is that no one can interfere with the electoral process in such country as the United States," he pointed out. "Acting in favor of the outgoing presidential administration, the US intelligence community laid itself open to ridicule," Klintsevich added. In October 2016, US intelligence officials claimed that "Russian hackers" were behind a series of cyber-attacks on the country’s electoral system. However, no evidence to the allegations has been provided by the American side. © REUTERS/ Brian Snyder US Intel Report Confirms WikiLeaks Data on DNC, Clinton Contain No ForgeriesRussian authorities have repeatedly denied the US allegations calling them absurd and characterizing them as an attempt to divert public opinion from revelations of corruption as well as other pressing domestic issues. In December, media reported that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suspects that Russia had interfered in the course of US presidential election, hacking mail servers of US citizens and organizations, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The agency claimed that Moscow had targeted the presidential campaign of  Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, because it wanted Trump to win. At the same time, the FBI reportedly reached opposite conclusions from the same raw intelligence. © Sputnik/ Pavel Lisitsyn US Intel Says 'Russian Hacking' Retaliation for Panama Papers, Doping ScandalsCommenting on the allegations, Russian President Vladimir Putin underscored that Russia was not interested in the contents of the leaked Democrat emails. He also noted that hysteria over alleged "Russian hacker attacks" was aimed at distracting public attention from the contents of the leaks. US President-elect Donald Trump believes that the allegations against Russia are unfounded. "Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!" Trump said via Twitter on Saturday. Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 7 января 2017 г. ​The US president-elect also stated on Saturday that he believes that the issue of the alleged hack of the DNC is being discussed only because the Democratic Party is "totally embarrassed" because of US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's loss in the election. "Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!" Trump wrote on Twitter. ...

Trump is immaterial in the overall picture and truthfully I think Russia has more important things to do than get involved with the US's lunacy. Reply Adrienne Adonis 21:24 07.01.2017 | 5 | Edit | Delete Trump is correct ! The Dems are beside themselves. They can not understand how they lost. They had the media and Hollywood and the support of major corporations backing them up. They had polls in their favor as well. Which we know were fraudulent to begin with. The odds were stacked up against Trump from the beginning. They mocked him and belittled him for over a year. What these socialists did not realize was how sick and tired and disgusted the American people throughout the United States were ! The American people that voted were not the white trash people Hillary said but it was an accumulation of Americans from all walks of life who all agreed that Hillary was corrupt , her Clinton Foundation was a slush fund for bribery and political favors and the trump voters wanted no more of the Obama twisted agenda. Hillary sucked as a candidate and was strictly catering to Wall Street and corporations and did not give a crap about the American tax payers. She also catered to the freeloaders of the American society as well. The Democrats are crying foul because wiki leaks proved how corrupt the DNC and its minions truly are. So to sum it all up the Dems are pissed off that they their corruption was exposed to the American public. This is a demonic entity that exposed itself.

Reply bertramc 23:18 07.01.2017 | 1 | Edit | Delete Not to worry -- In the US, the self-annointed "main-stream" media has maybe a 7% credibility. They started trafficking in fake news years and years ago. At this point, in the US, we consider "MSM news" (i.e. CIA propaganda) to be Ludicrous News. There are many sides to this story. For starters, if the release of Potesta's emails on Hillary's favorite practice is considered interference with a free election, it was not. In that case, if it happened, it was interference with the CIA's attemp to interfere with US elections, which has been going on already since the assassination by JFK in the 1960s. Podesta's emails show that Hillary and her team were involved in eating babies, and drinking their blood, in Satanic ceremonies, for youth and power. The so-called "Pentagon," which is really a Pentagon-Hollywood-MSM amalgam, that is financed by global heroin and cocaine trafficking operations, and its three cutout operations, namely NATO, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are doing global regime change operations, not for democracy, or for war-machine profits. They are doing it for global establishment of its religion, which is ritual child sacrifice, and ritual baby eating (literally!). Pentagon regime change operations are real;ly religion.change operations. They start with flooding an area with heroin and cocaine, progress through a period of "escalating tensions" along psychological fault lines to special operations "terrorism" to destroy local economic infrastructure, to civil war and total social breakdown. In this form of "democracy" the populations are all to willing to "cut a deal" with the baby eaters. If the Russians are to be blamed for attempting to right the Pentagon-MSM-CIA's effort to steal the election from the American people, and push Hillary into power, are they also to be blamed for attempting to defend themselves. The Russian people have a right to defend themselves. From what? bombs? yes-ok. But bombs and war do not frighten the Russians, or the Persians. What they want to defend themselves, and their futurity from is ... the Pentagon's religious practice of baby eating. In that case, if it was "Russia" (who dat?) that released Podesta's emails, then "Russia" was not only helping Americans, but it was also taking whatever MINIMUM steps it could take to DEFEND itself, and it future generations. The top brass at the US Pentagon (really, the CIA-MSM-Hollywood-Banking complex) are really sick people. Schreeching bedwetters, habitual liars, drugs traffickers, baby eaters, ... really scum. NATO, Israel and Saudi Arabia are merely high-paid crisis actors. They do nothing without direction from Pentagon brass. The CIA itself, is also a cutout. "Gen." Clapper is 100% a joke.

Not so funny, were the actual casualties, including that old man with only a slight resemblance to OBL, and multiple members of the supposedly responsible Seal Team in an engineered helicopter crash, which left no one alive who could testify to the fraud.

Reyes, contributor - 01/07/17 11:00 AM EST 142   © Getty Images A former Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump’s healthcare plan will offer ‘insurance for everybody’: report Trump on outgoing CIA director: ‘Was this the leaker of Fake News?’ What Obama will do after his presidency? Sleep. MORE critic has gone from adversary to adviser. Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC), has signed on as a member of President-elect Trump's national diversity coalition. "Our association is going to respect the process and respect the will of the people. We're going to do everything we can to help the new administration move this country forward," Palomarez told BuzzFeed News. "I'm very enthused and encouraged by the progress thus far." As a headline in Latina magazine put it, reporting on this development: Que?! Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Palomarez rightfully called out Trump's anti-Latino, anti-immigrant rhetoric. He criticized the president-elect in unusually personal terms. Nothing we've seen in the meantime indicates that Trump has changed, yet Palomarez is surrendering his dignity and signing on with him. The USHCC describes itself as "America's largest Hispanic business organization," representing over 4.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses.  ADVERTISEMENT As head of the USHCC, Palomarez made it clear how he felt about Trump. In September, he told two MSNBC hosts that Trump was a "payaso, a complete clown" and that his "movement of hatred" wouldn't solve any real problems. When the USHCC made its first-ever presidential endorsement for Democratic nominee Clinton, Palomarez told Reuters that Trump was "dangerous" and "a buffoon." He noted that Trump's campaign had "devolved into something that is frankly scary." He called Trump's deportation plan "the argument of a child and fear-mongering at its worst." That was then. Now Palomarez is apparently eager to work with Trump and members of his team like white nationalist champion Steve Bannon. The president-elect's attorney and adviser, Michael Cohen, explained to BuzzFeed that the diversity coalition was put together "to dispel the notion that Mr. Trump is one of the many things that the liberal mainstream media tried to label him as — that he is anti-Hispanic." But it was not the liberal mainstream media that forced Trump to label Mexican immigrants "criminals, drug dealers, rapists" or to defame a distinguished federal judge because of his Mexican-American heritage. Of all people, Palomarez knows this — he has spoken out against Trump's hate speech in the past — which is why his joining Trump's coalition is so disappointing. Palomarez's new alignment with Trump is also unfortunate given Trump's well-documented history of not paying small-business owners who worked for him. Is there a place for Latinos in a Trump administration? Absolutely. A Latino Cabinet member could give 55 million Hispanics, literally, a voice at the table when critical national decisions are made. Palomarez would have been an outstanding choice to head the Small Business Administration, a spot that went to World Wrestling Entertainment co-founder Linda McMahon. Being part of a diversity coalition, in contrast, means that Palomarez will likely serve as window-dressing, designed to give Trump cover from charges of racism and bigotry. And how much impact will a "diversity coalition" have, anyway, in an administration that does not value diversity? Now more than ever, Latinos are taking stock of who our allies are, and Palomarez seems to be putting his personal ambition above all else. That's a shame, because Palomarez has been a thoughtful advocate for Latinos in general and Latino small-business owners in particular. Since taking over the USHCC, he helped turn the organization around. While he has stated that he still disagrees with Trump on key issues, his opinions will probably be muted now that he is linked to the administration. Like most Trump associates and advisers, Palomarez can look forward to a future of explaining, clarifying and walking back The Donald's indiscreet, erratic comments. What a sad waste of Palomarez's expertise, experience and abilities. Palomarez's decision appears at best misguided and at worst opportunistic. His joining the Donald Trump diversity coalition means the loss of an influential, once-credible voice for the Latino community. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and columnist in New York City.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)   Ian King Bloomberg     Intel Corp., trying to convert its dominance of computers into a stake in the growing market for chips used in cars, is offering automakers new products aimed at making its technology crucial to the effort to develop self-driving vehicles. 'Intel Go' will feature processors ranging from its smallest Atom chips all the way up to its most powerful Xeon product packaged with other components and software. It will be available in the first half of 2017, the company said Wednesday. The world's largest chipmaker is seeking to gain a greater piece of what the industry is targeting as its next big market. As cars make the move from primarily mechanical devices to become increasingly dependent on electronics, Intel, Nvidia Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are tuning their digital products to provide more intelligence in vehicles. Intel processors are a good fit for autos because the same type of chips are used to develop software on personal computers and process information in data centers, said Doug Davis, the head of Intel's car unit. The company also announced Wednesday that it will offer the first version of a new modem to connect to forthcoming 5G cellular networks. That part will be available to test in the second half of 2017. Intel's chips are already designed into 30 vehicle models that are on the road and are being used in hundreds of autonomous test vehicles, the company said. It doesn't break out how much revenue is generated by that market. Nvidia automotive chip sales rose to $320 million in its 2016 fiscal year from $183 million in the preceding period. Neither Intel nor Nvidia made it into the Top 10 chip providers to the automotive market in 2015, according to IDC Corp. One chipmaker that did, NXP Semiconductor NV, last year bought another on the list, Freescale Semiconductor. Now that combined company is being acquired by Qualcomm.

PC-on-a-stick devices like Intel’s Compute Stick and the sea of me-too devices that followed seemingly vanished overnight. Similarly, modular smartphone concepts like Project Ara never made it off the ground while companies like LG that did make it to market with modular products no doubt regret the decision. Nevertheless, the industry isn’t willing to give up on the idea just yet as Intel has demonstrated at CES with a new modular compute platform calling the Intel Compute Card. The idea is pretty straightforward. Intel’s Compute Card is essentially a full-blown computer with an Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity that fits on a card roughly as thick as a few credit cards. Said card then gets plugged into the Compute Card slot of devices like interactive refrigerators, security cameras or IoT gateways. The lure here is the ability to easily upgrade the performance of a connected device without having to replace it entirely. Intel said it is already working with several large partners on the endeavor including HP, Dell, Lenovo and Sharp as well as multiple regional partners. The Compute Card seems like a great idea in theory although I’m not certain it’ll take off. Samsung tried essentially this exact same thing – albeit on a much smaller scale – with its HDTVs a few years back through a product called the Smart Evolution upgrade kit. Samsung seemingly discontinued that product line in early 2016. Intel says its Compute Card will be available by mid-2017 in a range of processor options including seventh-gen Intel Core chips.

Read on to find more. Written by Anuj Bhatia | Las Vegas | Updated: January 7, 2017 9:47 pm CES 2017 runs January 5-8 in Las Vegas. CES is the world’s biggest tech trade show and it takes place every year in the city of Las Vegas. Manufacturers from around the world show off their latest gadgets at Vegas, and this year was no different. From television sets to drones to smartphones to smart glasses, there were tons of new gadgets showcased for the first time at CES 2017. Here are the seven coolest gadgets from the show. Razer Project Valerie This is the world’s first laptop with three-built in monitors. It basically combines three 4K displays into a single 17.3-inch notebook. The three screens will have a total of resolution of 11520 x 2160 pixels. That’s enough to give gamers a true immersive experience. The Project Valerie notebook is powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card and a top-end Intel processor. The Project Valerie notebook is powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card and a top-end Intel processor. Project Valerie looks straight out of a sci-fi movie, but we never know whether Razer will bring its concept laptop to the market. Asus ZenFone AR ZenFone AR is the world’s first smartphone to support both Google’s Tango augmented reality technology and Daydream VR. It is also the first smartphone with 8GB RAM. The phone comes with three camera modules: a 23-MP main camera, a motion-tracking camera and a depth-sensing camera.

On the hardware side, the phone features a Snapdragon 821 processor, a 5.7-inch QHD screen and a 3,300mAh battery. Asus says the ZenFone AR will hit the market in the Q2 2017. Xiaomi Mi Mix Mi Mix brings Xiaomi back into the forefront of the smartphone innovation. Known for its affordable Android smartphones, the Mi Mix is a high-end device which has been made out of ceramics and boasts a 6.4-inch bezel-less display. Mi Mix is a high-end device which has been made out of ceramics and boasts a 6.4-inch bezel-less display. From an engineering perspective, Xiaomi Mi Mix is a step ahead of the rival smartphones and that’s the reality. While the Mi Mix has been made available in China since October last year, there’s no information whether the device will see a global release date. At CES 2017, we saw the white variant of the phone making its debut. Sony XBR-A1E Bravia 4K OLED TV It was rumoured to make its debut at CES 2017 and Sony just did that. President and CEO Kazuo Hirai announced the company’s first ever OLED TV with 4K UHD resolution. The A1 BRAVIA OLED series makes the screen the speaker, making it the world’s first acoustic surface sound system. The A1 BRAVIA OLED series makes the screen the speaker. In addition, the A1 Series also boasts 4K resolution and HDR compatibility. To be available in 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch sizes and will be available later this year as prices are yet to be announced. Honor Magic The star of the show was not the 6X, but the Honor Magic. Originally announced in China last month, Honor Magic made its international debut at CES 2017. It packs a 5-inch QHD screen, a Kirin 950 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of storage, and dual 12-megapixel cameras. Huawei has also added the “AI” features and hence the name “Magic”. But the phone is not about the spec sheet alone. The front glass and the rear both curve on all four edges. Huawei has also added the “AI” features and hence the name “Magic”. The Honor Magic appears to be another winner from Huawei. Unfortunately, the company has no plans to bring the smartphone to India anytime soon. Mangoslab Nemonic This printer lets you print sticky notes using a companion app on a smartphone. Choose photos or notes and print black-and-white photos in seconds. Nemonic uses Thermal printing technique, which means it requires a special paper that changes colour when exposed to heat. This printer lets you print sticky notes using a companion app on a smartphone. Unfortunately, you cannot print coloured photographs. The printer itself costs $120 and will hit the US market in April. Meanwhile, the cost to print one photo will cost $4. Petcube Play The Petcube Play is a unique device that lets you keep a tab on your cat when out of the home. So basically, Petcube Play is a Wi-Fi-enabled camera that captures HD video and can be accessed using an app on your smartphone. You can record videos or take pictures of your cat. Petcube Play is a Wi-Fi-enabled camera that captures HD video and can be accessed using an app on your smartphone. Interestingly, the camera comes with a built-in microphone and speaker so that you can hear and speak to your cat. We still don’t know how many people in India would be interested getting a Wi-Fi-based pet camera, but again it seems to be interesting device.

Beijing’s goal to achieve a leadership position in semiconductor design and manufacturing, in part by spending US$150 billion over a 10-year period, requires an effective response to maintain US competitiveness in the industry, according to the report released on Friday. “We found that Chinese policies are distorting markets in ways that undermine innovation, subtract from US market share, and put US national security at risk,” the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology said in the report. Obama blocks Chinese takeover of German semiconductor company The warnings about China could give ammunition to President-elect Donald Trump two weeks ahead of his swearing in. Since winning the election, Trump has backed up fiery campaign rhetoric toward China with a series of pronouncements on Twitter and the appointment of China hawks to key roles. The real answer is not a trade war, it’s not restrictions, it’s really about making the US more competitive Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp Trump’s attacks have stoked fears of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. Beijing is prepared to step up its scrutiny of US companies in the event Trump takes punitive measures against Chinese goods, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. The options include subjecting well-known US companies or ones that have large Chinese operations to tax or antitrust inquiries, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter was not public. Other possible measures include the launch of anti-dumping investigations and scaling back government purchases of American products, according to the people. “China has gained from global openness, but has been less committed to sustaining it – and, in some cases, has worked against it,” the White House report said. “Now, globally, more countries are questioning the benefits of economic openness – a trend that will shape, and be shaped by, how the United States responds to challenges in the semiconductor arena.” US industry leaders do not want Trump to engage in a standoff with China. Giving corporate tax breaks to US companies was the way Trump advocated bringing back jobs to this country, according to Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp. China’s semiconductor ambitions get a reality check as Stats ChipPac deal sees poor returns “The real answer is not a trade war, it’s not restrictions, it’s really about making the US more competitive,” Krzanich said on CNBC on Friday.  “Lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here, that’s what will bring manufacturing back to the US.” Krzanich attended the recent meeting between Trump and leaders of technology companies. The Council of Advisers on Science and Technology’s semiconductor working group includes several industry executives such as Paul Otellini, the former chief executive of Intel, and Paul Jacobs, the chairman of Qualcomm. Foreign acquisitions of US businesses are routinely reviewed for national security risks by a panel of officials led by the Treasury Department. That panel – the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) in the US – has frustrated some Chinese investment in the US semiconductor industry. In December, US President Barack Obama blocked a Chinese company from buying the US business of Germany’s Aixtron, a semiconductor-equipment supplier. The White House report recommends a strategy for US policy makers that includes countering “innovation-inhibiting” Chinese industrial policy and improving the business environment for US chip makers. It suggests broadening what is considered a national security risk as part of CFIUS reviews in certain circumstances, while also cautioning against blanket opposition to China’s advancement in the industry. US officials should also work with allies to strengthen global export controls, according to the report. China’s tech sector blasted for ‘innovation mercantilism’ and other protectionist policies aimed at giving it an unfair advantage The US has led the semiconductor industry since it took off in the 1960s. Companies such as Intel and Qualcomm have pushed the technical bounds of innovation in the US$300 billion market. In 2015, China did not have one company among the top 10 industry suppliers. China, the world’s most populous country, is nonetheless the biggest buyer of the electronic components. The main rivals to the US’ dominance are in South Korea and Taiwan, where companies such as Samsung Electronics, the second-largest chip maker by revenue behind Intel, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have gained ground over the last decade. To strengthen its position in chip manufacturing, China relies on subsidies for domestic suppliers, according to the White House report. That could harm US firms by allowing Chinese companies to sell below cost and reduce US market share, the report said. China also encouraged domestic customers to buy only from Chinese suppliers and required technology transfer to China in exchange for access to its market, the White House said. A representative of the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment about the report. Underlining some of the difficulties that US chip makers have faced gaining unfettered access to their largest market, in February 2015, Qualcomm announced it had paid US$975 million to settle a case brought by China’s National Development and Reform Commission accusing the company of abusing its dominant position in the chip market for mobile phones. Under the settlement, Qualcomm agreed to lower its licensing fees for phones sold in China to rates that are lower than it charges in other countries, but it is still striving to get Chinese handset makers to pay up.

New Windows 10 Device Features Surface-like Specs (Probably) at Half the Price GO Chuwi launches Windows 10 tablet with detachable keyboard Jan 7, 2017 07:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Chuwi is one of the Chinese companies that are trying to wrestle with the big guys, and as we’ve told you in our own reviews, the firm has surprisingly good products that really offer excellent value for the money. Their latest device is a 2-in-1 similar in specs with Microsoft’s own Surface Book, and Chuwi says that the display is even identical to what the Redmond-based software giant is offering on its laptop. Called the Hi13, Chuwi’s new tablet features a 13.5.-inch display with a resolution of 3000x2000 pixels and 3:2 screen ratio, and is powered by an Intel Apollo Lake Celeron N3450 CPU coupled with 4GB DDr3 RAM. Additionally, it boasts a 9th generation Intel integrated graphics card, as well as 64GB eMM storage, Wi-Fi, a USB Type-C port, and Windows 10. And last but not least, the Hi13 adopts the approach invented by Microsoft with the Surface, so it also sports a detachable keyboard and pen support. Same display as the Surface Book Now, for the comparison between the Hi13 and the Surface Book, Chuwi says the display is identical, as they are both 13.5 inches in size, have a 3000x2000 pixel resolution with 267 PPI and 3:2 aspect ratio. Furthermore, the two displays support 10 point multi-touch, 100 percent sRGB, and feature 400 Nits brightness and 1700:1 contrast ratio. It goes without saying that you shouldn’t expect this device to be as powerful as the Surface Book, and the difference is made by the other specs. The top-of-the-range Surface Book comes with an Intel i7 processor and a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card, but the Hi13 should still be good enough for typical activities like browsing and working with documents. As far as pricing is concerned, Chuwi is yet to disclose such details, but more information will probably be unveiled soon when the device goes on sale. What’s important to note, however, is that Chuwi, as the majority of Chinese manufacturers, targets a price that’s as low as possible, so there’s a good chance the Hi13 will be insanely cheap. And it goes without saying that it’ll be a lot more affordable than the Surface Book.

Russia’s objectives were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate former Secretary of State Clinton, make it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, an unclassified report released by the top U.S. intelligence agency said. “We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,” the report said. “We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.” The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U.S. government’s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U.S. Congress on Friday certified Trump’s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The report’s conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U.S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly two-hour briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed “the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election” nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. Russia denies the U.S. government’s allegations of hacking during the election campaign. RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY The report said U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian military intelligence, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks.com and the Guccifer 2.0 “persona” to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and top Democrats as part of the effort. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNC’s chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian AssangeWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U.S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Also on Friday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. “When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,” it said. “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. The report suggested Putin was motivated in part by personal animus toward Clinton. “Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,” it said. ‘TROUBLING CHAPTER IN ONGOING STORY’ In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agencies’ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: “Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations” including the DNC. “There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,” Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence “relayed” the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trump’s comments. “The President-Elect’s statement that the Russian hacking had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election’ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,” Schiff said. “It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying – which is true – it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to … Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,” he said. “The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile “facts surrounding Russia’s active measures,” adding: “This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.” Print Friendly Next article Vast iceberg poised to crack off Antarctica - scientists Previous article Five-star City demolish woeful West Ham News timeline Jan 15th 8:38 PM Football United’s Ibrahimovic rescues draw against Liverpool Jan 15th 8:07 PM Football Man City’s title hopes hit by Lukaku and Everton teens Jan 15th 6:57 PM Americas Top Republicans disappointed with questioning legitimacy of Trump’s win Jan 15th 6:09 PM Middle East Israel says Kerry sought to reassure Netanyahu over Paris conference Jan 15th 5:35 PM Middle East Iran says it will not renegotiate nuclear deal Jan 15th 5:09 PM Cyprus Nine Turkish colonels arrested in the north for Gulen links Jan 15th 5:00 PM Cyprus MPs fail to ease confusion and anger over fuel prices Jan 15th 4:54 PM Europe Fierce Merkel critic resigns from conservative party Jan 15th 4:48 PM Europe Serbia says Kosovo wants war as neighbours row over Serb nationalist train Jan 15th 4:06 PM Europe Bodies of five migrants found off Spain’s southern coast Broadcaster Rosie Charalambous takes a weekly look at the stories and cultural events making the news.

Here are some of the newest health and fitness wearables, announced at CES, that could be making their way into your workouts this year. Bodytrak Picture 2 of 18 There are plenty of wireless headphones, but Bodytrak stands out for an obvious reason. While users listen to music, the “hearables” can track a variety of vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, cadence, and VO2. (The ear is close to major blood vessels that connect to the brain, so it’s a good place to get accurate readings of vital signs.) The earbuds sync with an analytics app that will help users monitor their performance with an eye toward preventing injuries. London-based Bodytrak is being tested by English Premier League teams and rugby clubs -- and the company says the earbuds could be useful for workers in the defense, energy, and healthcare industries who need both hands free while on the job. Bodytrak will be available to consumers and sports teams this summer. Pricing has not been announced, but the company says it will be comparable to devices that range from $249 to $299. Casio WSD-F20 Picture 3 of 18 Casio unveiled its first smartwatch at CES 2016, and what the device lacked in style it made up for in substance—it was the only Android Wear watch to come with a built-in GPS, barometer, altimeter, and compass. It was a niche watch, made specifically to withstand the rigors of outdoor use. This year’s watch, the WSD-F20 ($500), is even more rugged, complete with button guards and a protective bezel surrounding the entire display. Mapping features have been updated as well; through a partnership with Mapbox, users can download full-color maps and view them while offline in the wilderness. Users can also write notes and place markers on a map. In another upgrade, the WSD-F20 also adds a low-power GPS mode. Built on the new Android Wear 2.0 platform, the WSD-F20 will be available April 21. Casio also announced that the WSD-F10 will be upgraded to Android Wear 2.0 at the same time. Digitsole Picture 4 of 18 This maker of heated, connected, and activity-tracking shoe inserts has taken the next step and unveiled a prototype of a “smart shoe.” The Active Cushioning Run Profiler promises shock detection and can shift support (making the insole softer or harder) over the course of a run based on data collected from sensors at five pressure points along the foot. The shoe also tracks activity and connects to a mobile app using Bluetooth; the company says the app can help runners figure out if they are fatigued. The app also comes with an audio coaching feature that provides workout tips, much like fitness headphones. A hiking version of the shoes is heated, too. Digitsole’s shoe will be available later this year. Pricing has not been announced, but a company spokesperson estimated that they would cost around $250. Garmin fenix 5 Picture 5 of 18 Garmin skipped v4 of its fenix watch line and went straight to the fenix 5. The watches come with many of the same features of the fenix 3 line, and the features you now come to expect from rugged GPS watches—activity tracking, water resistance to 100m, optical heart rate monitor, barometric altimeter, compass, and so on. The biggest difference is the size. The fenix 5S ($599) has a diameter of 42mm, and the fenix 5 ($599) is 47mm. Both are more compact that the watches in the fenix 3 line, which are about 51mm. This mean the fenix 5 watches should appeal to users with smaller wrists, as well as anyone looking for a watch to wear continuously. The smaller size does impact the 5S’s battery life, though 13 hours in continuous GPS mode is still pretty good. Both the 5S and 5 are available in stainless steel, WiFi-enabled Sapphire models for $100 more. The third watch in the fenix 5 line, the 51mm 5X, also checks in at $699. This watch also includes preloaded topographic maps and an Around Me feature that shows nearby points of interest. All fenix 5 watches will be available this spring. InBody WATCH Picture 6 of 18 The new InBody WATCH aims to be more than just an activity tracker. Using embedded PPG and ECG sensors, the watch can track heart rate as well as Pulse Wave Velocity, which measures how well blood pumps through the body’s arteries and is a potential predictor of cardiovascular disease. Data from the watch can also be used to perform InBody’s body composition analysis, which calculates metrics such as water weight, muscle mass, and BMI. The watch includes the same fitness-tracking features available in the company’s InBody BAND -- step counting, distance traveled, calories burned, sleep tracking, and activity tracking. An updated version of the band will be available this summer; the watch will be available this fall. LINX Smart Helmet Picture 7 of 18 The LINX Smart Helmet ($200) from Coros appears at CES2017 after a Kickstarter campaign that raised more than $300,000. The helmet lets riders listen to music, as well as hear mid-ride data or turn-by-turn directions, using bone-conduction technology. Two speakers are positioned over the cheekbone so that a rider’s ear canals remain open to listen for pedestrians, cars, or other hazards. A built-in microphone also allows for ear-free phone calls. In addition, the helmet comes with a remote that attaches to the handlebars and sync with an Android or iOS app. The app syncs to Strava and MapMyRide and also lets users create, save, and share routes. The routes support waypoint, which can be helpful when mountain biking or riding in remote areas. Mio Slice Picture 8 of 18 Nearly all fitness trackers measure steps taken, calories burned, and minutes of exercise. The Mio Slice ($129), a wristband from Mio Global, focuses on a different metric: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI). The device uses a series of optical heart rate sensors to measure and display a user’s PAI. The higher the number, the better. Mio says the algorithms that calculate PAI are based on the results of a 25-year study that showed a correlation among low PAI, high resting heart rate, and increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease—which is the leading cause of death in the world but is highly preventable. Along with PAI, the face of the Mio Slice displays the user’s heart rate, activity, and sleep data. The device can also receive phone call and text message notifications. Misfit Vapor Picture 9 of 18 With the Vapor ($199), Misfit has branched out from activity trackers to smartwatches. The Vapor comes with the usual fitness-tracking features -- accelerometer, altimeter, gyroscope, an optical heart rate monitor and built-in GPS. The watch also offers 4GB of storage, so users who work out with music will be able to leave their smartphones at home. The Vapor is the first Misfit watch with a touchscreen. The 44mm display encased in stainless steel, and there are interchangeable wristbands, so the Vapor may appeal to athletes who want a watch that doesn’t look out of place with dress clothes. However, the battery only lasts 2 days on a single charge, and Misfit is developing its own operating system, which may limit the number of third-party apps made for the Vapor. Misfit hasn’t announced a release date for the Vapor, so interested buyers will have to wait a while. In the meantime, check out our hands-on with the Misfit Vapor. Motiv Ring Picture 10 of 18 In an increasingly crowded market for fitness trackers that are worn on the wrist, the Motiv “smart ring” ($199) stands out by fitting on a single finger. Motiv can track steps, distance traveled, calories burned, and sleep. It also includes an optical heart rate monitor to track active and resting heart rate. There’s obviously no display on the ring, but users can view activity and heart rate data in an iOS app. The limited features won’t appeal to hardcore athletes, but Motiv might interest anyone who wants to track activity but doesn’t want a wristband or clip-on device. The Motiv's lithium ion battery will last up to five days on a single charge, depending on use, and recharges using a USB stick. Available this spring, the ring comes in two colors (slate gray or rose gold) and seven sizes.   New Balance RunIQ Picture 11 of 18 At last year’s CES, New Balance and chipmaker Intel announced that they were collaborating on an Android Wear smartwatch. This year, the RunIQ ($299) made its debut. Available Feb. 1, RunIQ delivers the functionality runners have come to expect: GPS tracker, heart rate monitor, smartphone notifications, and a lap button. The battery will last 5 hours in GPS mode, which is only has as long as comparably priced watches such as the Garmin Forerunner 235 and TomTom Spark 3. The RunIQ features on their own aren’t all that impressive, especially when compared to other Android Wear devices. However, two things do set the watch apart. One, it integrates with Strava for tracking run data instead of sending users to yet another proprietary app. Two, it connects to the New Balance Run Club, which offers virtual training runs and in-person events at New Balance stores. PIQ Robot Blue Everlast Picture 12 of 18 Pugilists finally have their own wearable with PIQ’s Robot Blue, which takes the company’s sensor for tracking tennis, golf, and skiing activity and puts it into a wrist strap that slides over hand wraps or boxing gloves. Accelerometers and a gyroscope within the PIQ device measure a boxer’s punch speed, impact, intensity and total time. The device syncs with an artificial intelligence system known as GAIA, which compares a user’s stats against professionals. (The company has partnered with Everlast to get this data.) Based on the data, the system can recommend which punches would work best for a particular boxer. The sensor-wrist strap combination is $99—you’ll need one for each hand—and will be available in March.  PKVitality K’Track Sensors Picture 13 of 18 The K’Track sensors from PKVitality also strive to provide more than the usual activity data. Two devices—K’Track Athlete ($200) and K’Track Glucose ($150)—gather readings from a from a biosensor, known as a K’Apsul, which uses needles 0.5mm long to analyze the interstitial fluid just below the surface of the skin that absorbs chemicals such as glucose and lactic acid. Worn on the arm, K’Track Athlete measures lactic acid, heart rate, and VO2 levels in real-time during exercise. This eliminates the need for post-workout blood draws to calculate an athlete’s lactate threshold. Worn on the wrist, K’Track Glucose can provide glucose readings in one minute and displays the rest of the day’s measurements as well. Users can also set reminders for their next glucose reading, and the device tracks steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned. Both devices sync with an Android or iOS app. Capsules last 30 days and cost $99 for Glusose and $149 for Athlete. The devices are due for release in 2018 following regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Polar Team Pro Shirt Picture 14 of 18 The industry leader in chest-strap heart rate monitor technology has entered the “smart fabric” market. The sleeveless Polar Team Pro Shirt (available in March) uses two fabric sensors to measure a user’s heart rate. This eliminates the need to wear a chest strap, which can get uncomfortable during long workouts. There’s also a pouch on the back of the shirt collar where users can tuck in a small device that measures speed, distance, and acceleration. As the name implies, the Polar Team Pro Shirt is designed for the company’s Team Pro coaching software, which is used by major professional and college teams. For weekend warriors, the company says the shirt will also integrate with the Polar Flow app and other Polar Pro brand wearables, including the M600. Sensoria Sock 2.0 Picture 15 of 18 Version 2.0 of Sensoria's “smart sock” ($199, available later this year) are not only lighter than before, but are better protected from sweat and water, which improves accuracy. Three pressure sensors, embedded under the planar area of the foot, connect to the Sensoria Core, a half-ounce, square-inch component that measures the typical running stats (pace, speed, GPS tracking) as well as cadence and foot landing technique. Core will also connect to the company’s new Vivobarefoot shoe, which will be launched later this year. The socks stream data to an iOS app, Sensoria Run 2.0, and also store data for a month, so users can run smartphone-free. The new app also offers advice from a virtual running coach called Mara and can let users know when it’s time to get a new pair of running shoes. Sensoria also announced a monthly subscription service; Users can receive a delivery of fresh smart socks as well as access custom training plans through Sensoria Run 2.0. Under Armour Record Equipped Sneakers Picture 16 of 18 Introduced in 2015, Under Armour is doubling down on its lineup of shoes that can track how far and how fast you run. This year, UA is adding a new feature, called Jump Around, that measures how high you can jump to determine your overall muscle fatigue, and then tailors a workout to your ability. The Record Equipped line now boasts three models: The Gemini 3 RE ($159) is the original, neutral running shoe; the Europa 3 RE ($159) is a stability shoe; and the Velociti 3 RE ($139) is a minimalist shoe. All are available for preorder now, and ship in February. While we were a bit tepid in our review of the Speedform Gemini 2, the embedded technology in the Record Equipped shoes is intriguing. Link AKC Picture 17 of 18 Humans aren’t the only ones who can benefit from activity tracking. Beyond location tracking, the Link AKC ($149) dog collar uses an accelerometer to measure moderate and intense activity. The connected app then analyzes the data to provide activity recommendations depending on a dog’s age, breed, behavior, and size. Link AKC will also measure the air temperature and alert an owner if it’s too hot or cold for a dog to be outside. (This data transmission requires a monthly or yearly service plan, which also includes access to a pet poison hotline.) Along with activity and data tracking, the collar comes with a small speaker, which owners can use for sound training, and an LED light for nighttime visibility. The app tracks activities in a scrapbook that displays the date, distance, and any photos of Fido taking along the way.

Finance Search Virtual reality seeks momentum at CES gadget galaBy Glenn CHAPMAN | AFP – Sat, Jan 7, 2017 3:22 AM AEDT Related Content View Photo A man wearing a VR headset experiments with a merged reality experience using Project Alloy at the Intel exhibit during the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas Virtual reality sought its stride Friday at the Consumer Electronics Show, where despite being a hot topic there was little sign it is racing into mainstream culture. Show floor space devoted to virtual reality abounded with companies diving into the market with headsets, content, or tools for better creating or delivering immersive experiences. Last year at CES, virtual reality was an eye-grabbing sensation. This time around there was a focus on what it is going to take to get it into the hands of the masses. Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at the Consumer Technology Association behind the annual show, was confident that sales of mixed reality gear would grow, and the range of uses expand far beyond video games. "There is a lot of investment going into content," DuBravac said. "Sales will eventually come." - Scratching the surface - Taiwan-based HTC used CES to announce initiatives aimed at getting developers to create more VR experiences and revealed plans for arcades in public venues so more people could give it a try. HTC had a 'great' year with its Vive VR head wear and Steam online game venue but was "really just scratching the surface," said Vive general manager Daniel O'Brien. "Our goal is to build the largest VR platform in the world," O'Brien said. "2016 was a coming out party for VR; 2017 is developing it in the marketplace and continuing to evolve the product." Vive is up against PlayStation VR and Facebook-owned Oculus Rift. Each company has been wooing software developers and refining its hardware to better entice users. HTC said that later this year it will release a Vive Tracker device that lets digital versions of real-world objects easily be put into fantasy worlds. O'Brien also said that HTC is working on a wireless version of its headset, to sate a strong desire to be able to move around untethered to computers while using Vive. Rikard Steiber, head of Viveport virtual reality app shop, said that more than 3,000 titles for the Vive platform would be available by the end of this year. The vision is to have Viveport serve all VR platforms, including those of Oculus and Sony, according to Steiber. - VR arcades - HTC said it will launch what it billed as the world's first virtual reality app subscription service, likened to "Netflix for VR." The goal is to help developers reach audiences and make money, ideally inspiring the creation of more VR content, according to HTC executives. HTC also planned to bring VR to the masses in arcades in shopping malls, downtowns or other public locations. The company envisioned thousands of Viveport Arcades in operation by the end of this year. Sony Corporation chief executive Kazuo Hirai revealed at CES that the Japanese consumer electronics company had sold more than 53.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles, which can power it virtual reality head gear. He said that Sony aimed to continue the console momentum with more services and content, including VR games. Sony Pictures was among more than two dozen companies that used CES to announce the creation of a Virtual Reality Industry Forum. The Forum said its goal is to "further the widespread availability of high-quality audiovisual VR experiences." The group wants standards and formats that allow rich VR content to be equally accessible from the array of devices, avoiding "fragmentation" that has plagued audio-visual media in the past, according to a release. "We believe this is crucial for the market to take off," Sky broadcast strategy chief engineer Chris Johns said in the release. "We all expect that 2017 will be the year when intense consumer interest in VR spurs a quantum leap in the user experience." CES featured the largest collection of VR technology ever at a trade show, according to Gartner analyst Brian Blau. "There is a bit of the cart being before the horse," Blau said. "A lot of people have learned about it, but people aren't really buying it." He described the VR scene at CES as the first incarnation of an ecosystem of devices, applications and services in what was a big step for the technology. "There is nothing like putting it on and experiencing it," Blau said of VR. "The disappointing part is that it is quite expensive. VR will be held back a bit until quality goes up and price goes down."

Close share panel Image copyright Symantec Image caption The futuristic looking Core is controlled via a smartphone app Security firms have launched routers at CES that can stop smart household gadgets being hijacked by hackers. Symantec, BitDefender and Intel unveiled devices that scrutinise data as it flows across home networks. The companies say routers with built-in defences will be essential as homes are filled with net-connected gadgets. The routers also come with parental control features that help manage how much time children spend online and what they see. Home invasion "You will have to buy a security solution for your internet-of-things," said Alex Balan, chief security researcher at BitDefender. The "internet of things" refers to the growing collection of smart gadgets that can be controlled via the net. "Pretty soon everything will be connected one way or another and managed by a smartphone app," said Mr Balan. "You won't be able to avoid it." But that interconnectivity and ease of use comes at a cost, he said, adding that the end of 2016 had seen a surge in attacks that compromised net-connected CCTV cameras, televisions and media servers. Image copyright Bitdefender/Arris Image caption BitDefender unveiled a new version of its Box router while Arris revealed that it was adding Intel's security software to its devices The poor security on these gadgets led to them being enrolled in massive networks by hackers who use them to carry out overwhelming attacks. One network, called Mirai, staged some of the biggest net attacks ever seen. The problem has got so serious that the US Federal Trade Commission has kicked off a competition to create tools that consumers can add to their home network that can protect IoT devices from attack. Cash rewards of $25,000 (£20,000) will be given to the best entrants. "Security for these devices has to start at the network level," said Gareth Lockwood from Symantec. "There's no other way to do it." As the entry and exit point for home networks, routers were the best place to put a security system that can watch for malicious traffic coming in and cut off hackers trying to access insecure kit. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The show floors of the CES tech expo are packed with new internet-connected products for the home While current home routers do have security systems, most are pretty basic, said Mr Lockwood, and none is ready for the explosion of smart devices predicted to be in use soon. "If we look forward four to five years from now we expect to see between 20 to 30 billion devices in homes," he said. "There'll be tens of devices per household."

Symantec launched the Norton Core that is intended to replace the router supplied by an ISP. In the US, the Core will cost $279 BitDefender unveiled the Box which sits alongside a home router and polices traffic as it flows across a network. The Box currently costs $129 Intel Security has signed a deal with hardware firm Arris to include its security software in a specially-made line of home protection routers. Intel has yet to release prices for these products All three will face competition from established devices such as the Cujo smart firewall and the Home Halo and Eero products as well as from Asus which has teamed up with Trend Micro to put security software on its routers. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Net-connected cameras are helping attackers in large-scale attacks The devices launched at CES will only initially be available in the US but will reach other regions later in 2017. Typically, buying one of the secure routers includes a subscription to a firm's standard security software that runs on desktops, laptops and tablets. All three also include net access control systems that let parents decide for how long different gadgets can be used and which sites youngsters can visit. Some, such as the Norton Core, have an internet pause button that cuts off access for everyone in a household.

Ockel crams Windows 10 into a pocket-sized touchscreen PC The Ockel Sirius A is an Intel-powered miniature PC with a 6-inch touch screen. Jared Newman (PC World (US online)) on 07 January, 2017 11:15 0 - - - - print email A little-known company called Ockel wants to put a touchscreen Windows 10 PC in your pocket. At CES 2017, Ockel was showing off an extremely rough prototype of its Sirius A mini-PC, which was funded on Indiegogo late last year with more than $443,000 raised. The device is small enough to fit in a pocket or purse, and will pack a 6-inch 1080p multitouch display. Other specs for the $699 version include a quad-core Intel Atom x7-Z8750 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a 5-megapixel front camera, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB-C port, full-sized HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and a headphone jack. For an extra $100, the RAM and storage double to 8GB and 128 GB, respectively. Jared Newman Why would anyone want a touchscreen mini-PC? Aside from having the full power of Windows in your pocket, you could theoretically plug it into any monitor or TV, and use the second screen as a keyboard and trackpad, saving the hassle of carrying even more hardware. There’s just one problem: The unit on display at CES was not exactly working. The touchscreen was non-responsive, and some of the input/output ports didn’t work. Still, it was displaying the Windows 10 home screen, so at least it wasn’t a total brick. Ockel also has one Indiegogo success under its belt already with the Sirius B, a mini-PC without the built-in screen. Assuming Ockel can whip the Sirius A into working order, the plan is to start shipping it to Indiegogo backers in May.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

View Latest Posts >>> Propaganda intended to incite Americans: John McAfee on ‘Russian hacking’ claims By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on January 6, 2017 … from Russia Today,  Moscow We have all been here before [ Editor’s Note: John McAfee is certainly having a good time. The election is over and he is still getting lots of airtime for his debunking of the claimed Democratic party hack. The Intel agency briefing that Trump got today was a Shakespearean event, “Much ado about nothing”. The community seems to have an addiction to circumstantial evidence, with the biggest thing reported being that high-level Russian officials were happy that Trump had won. Well, hello! Trump had already said he was going to rebuild better relations with Russia, so of course they are happy he won. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence report had SEVEN pages on RT alone, kind of an indication they were scraping the barrel to fill the report with something. With the major anti-Russian sanction shift we are seeing in the EU, the sanctions appear to be on the way out in 2017; and so may be Angela Merkel for the role she played in the ill-conceived effort, plus opening Germany to a wave of Muslim extremist terrorism and violence that could last for decades. One of these days, a foreign Intel agency or “contractor” is going to slip a mini-nuke into some dumb suicide jihadi’s car bomb, and we are going to have another 9-11 style terror event, because the lack of public discussion on the proliferation of the small nukes is the biggest security risk we all face. With all the stories that VT has run on mini-nukes, we have not had a single call from anyone of standing wanting to learn more. It is the classic ostrich head in the sand response, and it includes government, media, security and academia. Their demonstrated interest is zero. What McAfee is doing with his banging the drum, we should have been seeing some of the security, defense and academic trade organizations doing. They are AWOL, and we need a hell of a lot more public pressure to point that out to them… Jim W. Dean ] ___________ “Here’s lookin at ya” – First published  …  January 06, 2017 – Who is going to press the common sense button on this hacking story circus? The sloppiness of the alleged DNC hack by itself proves it was not organized by a nation state, and the “utter nonsense” presented as proof of Moscow’s involvement is rather evidence of intelligence agencies being “ignorant and naïve,” John McAfee told RT. Cybersecurity legend McAfee is one of the modern computer tech pioneers and the developer of the first commercial antivirus program, who has been in the business for the past 50 years. He is also the CEO of MGT Capital Investments, and a former presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party. The so-called evidence of the Russian involvement in the hacks not only looks like “the most deceptive propaganda was perpetrated on the American public” but actually proves quite the opposite, McAfee believes. “In there are four facts which they claim prove that Russia did this hack. It was utter nonsense. The information was number one – Russian language was found in the malware. Number two – a Cyrillic keyboard was used. The forensic science can now tell what type of keyboard was used to develop a piece of a malware,” McAfee told RT. “Number three – the compiler, the piece of software that compiles the code so that it can execute, always dated time stamps. The time stamps were in a time zone for the business hours of Moscow and St. Petersburg and other places in Russia and the number four that the IP address pointed to a Russian address.” To make it simple for the American audience, McAfee metaphorically explained the situation: “Seriously, if Russia declared war on us because we hacked Russia and the head of the CIA and the intelligence committee came to the Congress and they ask him ‘What happened?’ – ‘Oh, well you know we didn’t have time to remove English language, we didn’t have time to move the date stamp, the guy could not use a Chinese keyboard, so we gave him our regular keyboard. And also there was my wife’s birthday so I could not remove the IP address.’” “Please, that person would be scheduled for a suicide,” McAfee concluded. Thus, McAfee believes, the whole “Russian hacking” narrative is either “propaganda intended to incite the American people, to anger toward Russia for some reason, or our intelligence community is so ignorant and naïve that they should all be replaced.” The Cybersecurity specialist believes that based on the presented evidence the hack “cannot possibly be an organized nation-state.” “The hack on the DNC used a piece of malware a year and a half old and there have been many updates since then, McAfee said. “This was done by an independent one person kid that downloaded the software. Please, this is not an organized hack and certainly not a nation-state that did this.” ____________ Related Posts: Jill Stein files for recount in Michigan, Does Russia Regret “Hacking for Trump?” Trump reveals details on his Russia policy Russian Hacking – No Big Deal Trump might roll back Russia sanctions: Conway You can’t make this stuff up: Trump win proves Russia hacked the DNC!

As I had seen the interview earlier in the day I thought it was odd for Jim Dean. For some of the other VT Writers their lack of even handed reporting on the Rep & Dem Candidates has been a problem for me, and I suspect a number of others. Glad I was wrong on this one. Regardless, it worrying that the current Admin runs such a potentially provocative agenda. As a World, as appose to, a US Citizen, I can only hope that there is nothing more incendiary before 20th January! Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  January 8, 2017 at 5:26 am The back story here, on McAee, and which I chose to cover this, is once again we see none of the industry experts challenging him, or us either. They just go “quiet” with no response, betting on the age old bet that a week from now most of the public will not ever remember. That is why none of the fake news people worry about getting caught. It is just a temporary problem. The only bright light we have on this now as the term fake news have become part of the lexicon now, when VT has been featuring the problem constantly, and like McAfee, no one with standing, meaning a reputation to lose officially has wanted to debate us. Well Aware  January 7, 2017 at 10:53 am It’s looking like the phony Russian hack is failing, so they have to escalate it to the point of saying Putin himself did it, lmfao The gigantic mass deception needed a boost of panic, and it looks like the Ft Lauderdale scam was brought in to scare the public. It’s looking really infantile. Once all news helicopters were in place, came the second “scare”, the rumors that there was another shooter in the parking garage. That’s the panic that helps propel the hot air ballon of lies and deception, people running and freaking out- Log in to Reply joetv  January 7, 2017 at 6:26 am What? Are you starting rumors here. This is totally an opinion piece. I value the opinion. But it wasn’t 1 kid. It was the professor, in the library, with a book. Truthfully. I ain’t got a clue. We’re on a runaway train. There is so much bs in the air confusion is confused. What if…..!? Log in to Reply JohnZ  January 7, 2017 at 4:02 am Over at Jonas Alexis’ page he swears the Russians did it! Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  January 8, 2017 at 5:35 am Yes, but there are multiple parts to this. The part about the self-erasing code, the existence of which has been around for a long time, you will notice does not get a word of coverage in the mainstream press, not even the Intel report mentioned it. That reason could be because we are using the same tactic and don’t want to publicize it. What is failing on the hack is the Intel folks so far have not put anything solid on the table, and even go so far as to say the vote was not compromised anywhere despite some counties recording more votes in a precinct than it had registered voters, and the same numbers after the recount, which boggles the mind. But that anomaly got almost zero coverage which is not unusual in these complex multilayered stories. kaho  January 7, 2017 at 1:52 am Helpingmind : I think there is a BS quota that needs to be filled each month … or else… People like McAfee, who know what they are talking about, easily look through the hype.

We've seen this with the HoloLens tests Microsoft set up in partnership with NASA -- one in space, one under the sea -- with the idea that explorers could wear the headsets and get on-the-go training or troubleshooting from mission control. We've seen this with the HoloLens demonstrations at Ignite 2016, where the virtual reality headset was used to help design a kitchen without any of the professionals actually stepping into the space they were redoing. But for me, the reality of how VR will change the nontechnical job market really sank in during the Intel press event. On Wednesday, we Intel press event attendees put on our Oculus headsets for four discrete demonstrations: a zombie shoot-em-up game called Arizona Sunshine, a trip to the Ban Gioc waterfall, a college basketball game, and a live flying drone inspection of a solar panel array at a facility in Nevada. This last demonstration -- just minutes of panning over shiny, dark panel after shiny, dark panel, all of them gleaming under a cloudless desert sky -- was when I realized what jobs had just been created. Let me backtrack for a moment. I spent a decade working as a lifeguard, at everywhere from hotel pools to water parks, and while the swimming and lifesaving skills were the specialized requirements for the job, what I was really being paid to do was pay attention to my environment and prevent serious incidents before they happened. Being paid to pay attention to something used to require being on site. Consider the forest fire lookouts employed through the American west. At one point, there were 10,000 people paid to simply sit and watch the land around them, looking for signs of fire. Now, there are a few hundred -- some states have already moved to aerial surveillance using cameras and aircraft. At the same time, fire risk in the American west keeps climbing: decades of fire suppression, rising temperatures and years of drought have led to longer "fire seasons." So imagine state and federal land management agencies deciding to bring back fire lookouts -- only these people don't have to traipse to an isolated tower in the middle of nowhere. They can work from anywhere, in shifts, and their job will be to put on a headset, watch drone footage as the drones run prescribed routes, or direct the drone to inspect a smudge on the horizon. And if these VR fire inspectors see anything amiss, they can sound an alarm to contact on-the-ground firefighters. The point is: VR will create a class of jobs where people will be paid to pay attention. And, unlike my lifeguarding job, they won't have to be onsite to combine their observation with their skilled training. Imagine security services for apartment complexes, gated communities, office parks, big-box stores, or public parks. Imagine warehouse facilities inspectors and power station inspectors. Imagine insurance companies doing preliminary surveys of houses after a hurricane's come through. Imagine media companies hiring stringers to keep watch on specific areas for stories. Imagine fisheries inspectors, agricultural inspectors.  Imagine ranch owners who want to keep tabs on their herds without having to go out in terrible weather. The cowboy who rides through the cold could be replaced by a console jockey who works on their lanai in Florida. Granted, the drone technology needs to become tougher -- drones will have to be able to go for hours in all weather and be fairly low-maintenance. There are social and legal issues to work out regarding the propagation of drones in public and private spaces. But the combination of VR plus drone could do for observe-and-report jobs what call center technology did for customer support jobs: remove the location dependencies from certain types of jobs. (And the only people left working on site or in a specific geographic location are the ones whose specialized training and skills are necessary to respond to the emergency someone else observed.) Remote work will soon be more than telework. Across the country, people might be able to get paid to pay attention. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The Consumer Electronics Show has set the tech industry to a great start in 2017, following a week of amazing presentations and product unveilings that end this Sunday. While many of the exhibitions were flashy and made headlines around the world, other significant developments flew under the radar, and they deserve some love. Such is the case of 3D NAND technology. With demands for larger memory capacity and enhanced performance on the rise, 3D NAND standards seem to be the answer. The architecture has existed for some time, but 2017 could be the year it sees a wider adoption in the mainstream market. Companies such as Intel have introduced over the years brand series of 3D NAND-based SSDs for consumers, businesses, and data centers. Soon, we could see this technology making its way into our smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets. What is an SSD? Kingstone 480gb solid state drive. Image: Kingstone. A solid-state drive or SSD is a storage unit for computers that offers several advantages over traditional industry standards such as hard disk drives or HDDs. Opposite to HDDs or optical disk units, SSDs are not mechanical. That means they have no moving components, which in turn makes them faster options when it comes to reading and writing information. SSDs and HDDs differ little from each other regarding design, but mechanical units tend to hold more storage capacity due to its inner build. In contrast, solid drives can operate faster more silently, with less power, and in a more reliable manner. What is NAND? NAND is a flash memory architecture present in storage devices like SSDs, which arranges multiple storage cells across a single circuit board. The fundamentals of NAND memory made it so the technology would, eventually, reach a limit for how small the storage cells can be and how many can fit on a  motherboard. Manufacturers around the world have managed to squeeze out as much as possible from the NAND standard, managing to produce SSD units capable of storing terabytes of data in the same form factor as an HDD, although at higher prices. What is 3D NAND? 3D NAND takes a new approach to traditional NAND memory by adding a new dimension to storage cell design. This architecture not only lays out cells across the board but also stacks layers on top of each other like the floors in a building. As many can infer, 3D NAND not only increases capacity but also all the other aspects that make it the industry choice for SSD memory in laptops and other devices nowadays. However, the concept of 3D NAND opens the possibility to new form factors that had not been considered previously due to the inherent limitations of NAND. As such, mobile devices like tablets and smartphones could start adopting new memories with much higher capacity, faster performance, and lower costs soon. Desktops and data centers that demand even higher performance standards also benefit from 3D NAND, but companies like Intel and other tech leaders are already developing cost-effective solutions like 3D XPoint for these machines.

Targeting enterprise-level applications, virtualised environments and more, its innovative compute, storage and I/O 'books' allow it to be easily upgraded to keep up with demand. Supporting Intel's E7-4800 and E7-8800 v4 Xeons, the x3850 X6 employs up to four compute books each with their own CPU socket and DIMM slots. You can start easy with two and upgrade as the workload increases simply by slotting more books in. The server can also be performance-upgraded in situ by swapping the compute books out for new ones. Existing systems with older v2 or v3 variants of these CPUs can be boosted to the latest v4 models in minutes. This design does away with the maintenance blues as the entire chassis stays put in the rack. Everything can be accessed from the front or the rear so there's no need to pull the system out. Lenovo’s compute books hold one E7 Xeon CPU and 24 DIMM slots and can be field upgraded Lenovo's library Our review system had four compute books each with a 2.2GHz E7-8860 v4 Xeon and four 32GB TruDDR4 memory modules. Each book offers 24 DIMM slots so memory can be boosted to an impressive 6TB using 64GB LRDIMMs. Each compute book has dual dedicated fan modules in front and once they are unclipped, a lever can be flipped down and used to remove the book. The CPU nestles at the rear complete with a full height heat-sink and the 24 DIMM slots are evenly distributed on each side of the daughterboard. The books have inspection panels on each side and pressing their light path button shows which component has failed, making problem diagnostics a cinch. In fact, the server uses light paths throughout so you can see at a glance whether other components such as CPUs, hard disks, fans or PSUs have failed. Storage surprises The x3850 X6 may only have a single storage book but it is very versatile. Our system had eight hot-swap SFF drive bays, but you can start with four and add a second cage later. Storage books are available for eight or 16 1.8in SSDs and you can mix them with standard SFF drives. There's more, as the storage book supports up to four PCIe NVMe SSDs and dropping to two of these leaves enough space for eight 1.8in. SSDs or four SFF drives as well. The storage book is easily removed and we were impressed with its innards - it offers two PCI-e slots supporting a choice selection of RAID controllers. Our system had a Lenovo ServeRAID M5210 SAS3 card which had the RAID5 upgrade along with 2GB of battery protected cache. Adding a second RAID controller allows you to split the storage bay between both cards and there's a spare clip in the base for another cache protection module. You can manage and monitor your entire Lenovo infrastructure with xClarity Administrator I/O galore Expansion is massive as the chassis supports up to three I/O books and a wide variety of slot configurations. Base systems start with a primary I/O book, which provides three PCI-e slots plus Lenovo's mezzanine LOM (LAN on motherboard) slot. This book has two hot-plug cooling fan modules that look after the storage book in front. Beneath these are USB, serial and VGA ports plus a Gigabit port for the on-board IMM2 module. The other two bays accommodate optional I/O books, each with three PCI-e slots. Go for the full-length I/O books if you want GPU or accelerator cards, as these provide auxiliary power sockets that allow them to support 300W double-wide adapter cards. Power is plentiful as below the I/O books are four PSU bays. The price for our system includes a quartet of 900W hot-plug PSUs and Lenovo also offers 750W or 1400W modules, with the latter required for SAP HANA configurations. xClarity Administrator can be used to simultaneously deploy an OS to multiple servers  IMM2 and xClarity The IMM2 module provides remote management and is the only area we can criticise the server on. The web interface offers basic levels of information about server operations, but stacking it up against HPE's slick iLO4 shows how unsophisticated it is. We recommend Lenovo's xClarity Administrator as this links up with the IMM2 and delivers a wealth of agentless monitoring and management features for all Lenovo business systems. We tested the Hyper-V version and used it to inventory the server, view critical components, monitor power consumption and fire up remote control sessions. It also provides an image library for centralised OS deployment while patterns can be used to set up or repurpose multiple servers. We also tested the iOS app on our iPad and were able to remotely monitor the server's vitals. The IMM2 management module provides a comparatively basic web interface Conclusion Mission-critical servers represent a significant spend and the unique design of the System x3850 X6 means it can stay the course and protect your investment. The compute, storage and I/O books allow you to upgrade performance and capacity on-demand, making it much more affordable in the long term. Build quality is superb here, with the system offering a huge expansion potential plus extensive storage options. If you're using E7-8800 CPUs and want to migrate to eight-way processing, Lenovo's RPQ (request price quotation) process offers an on-site upgrade to a System x3950 X6 8U chassis, where all your books will be transferred across by a field engineer.

Here’s what they can expect. That means it’s more important than ever to get autonomous systems right. by Johana Bhuiyan@JMBooyah Jan 8, 2017, 1:05pm EST tweet share Linkedin Nvidia’s test car driving itself. Johana Bhuiyan Everyone — from auto executives to regulators — has said that transportation will change more in the next five years than it has in the last 50. So what will 2017 bring? There will be more self-driving tests in more cities, according to experts I interviewed at CES. That also means more consumers will be experiencing self-driving technology for the first time this year. That makes it a crucial period for auto and tech companies attempting to develop and deploy self-driving cars. There is still a chance that a lack of consumer trust can stall the progress of the technology, so there’s a ton of pressure on companies to quickly create a vehicle with a high level of autonomy that drives smoothly and is safe. During the onstage interview I moderated, panelist Jeff Owens, CTO at the auto supplier Delphi, told me “safety sells” when it comes to autonomous technology. More and more consumers are seeking vehicles that use the technology for use cases like emergency braking or driver-assist systems, according to him. Right now, companies are racing to get the best autonomous system on the road that offers the smoothest experience, so it’s not surprising there was no shortage of opportunities to test self-driving cars at CES. I personally rode in Hyundai’s autonomous Ionic as well as BMW’s autonomous 5 series and chipmaker Nvidia’s fully autonomous test car. Here are my impressions. Riding with Hyundai The semi-autonomous Hyundai navigated on local streets around the Las Vegas Convention Center alongside other vehicles. Some of the road markings were rather faded, but the vehicle was able to stay within the winding lanes thanks to a combination of its computer vision tech and 3-D maps. The car smoothly — albeit slowly — merged into the right lane as it prepared to turn. I was surprised that the engineer sitting in the driver's seat didn't have to take control. It wasn't exactly the speed a human might drive, but I was comfortable in the back seat as it navigated the busy Las Vegas streets. Little peek at my test drive of the autonomous Hyundai Ionic. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/ysnz6ghoES— Johana Bhuiyan (@JMBooyah) January 3, 2017 Back seat with BMW The BMW test drive was a little different. For one, we manually drove to the highway and only turned on semi-autonomous mode once we merged to the left-most lane. Once on the highway, it drove as well as Tesla’s autopilot. But just like with Tesla’s, I had trouble feeling comfortable enough to take in the scenery as BMW’s staffers, who came along for the ride, suggested. The technology worked and maintained a safe distance behind the car in front of it, but I still felt unsure. BMW plans to roll out 40 self-driving cars in partnership with Mobileye and Intel by the second half of this year. At CES, the automaker showed off the car’s connected platform, which integrates with Amazon’s one-hour-delivery service and Prime Video offering as well as the driver’s calendar. From behind the driver’s seat on the highway, I was able to make a dinner reservation on the center console by using a few hand gestures to scroll through my onscreen preferences. The platform had already detected that I had a dinner appointment with a friend and prompted me to choose a restaurant for that time, offering a number of restaurant choices with openings for my scheduled appointment. It was, again, fairly difficult to peel my eyes off the front of the road at first. But once I was able to, I got a glimpse of Red Rock Canyon as we drove by. My test drive of the Nvidia-powered sedan. The bottom line is that the difference between how the two cars drove themselves was negligible. While Hyundai wanted to show off the technological capabilities of the vehicle, BMW focused on the things you’re free to do while the car drives itself. Luxury carmakers have an impetus to pitch more than safety, and in this case BMW is selling time as a luxury. As we enter higher levels of autonomy, getting consumers on board becomes more difficult. For one, fewer people will be exposed to fully self-driving cars. Both Uber’s and nuTonomy’s commercial fleet of cars are semi-autonomous. Then there's the hurdle of convincing a person to relinquish complete control of the vehicle. Nvidia goes full auto Chipmaker Nvidia, which typically works behind the scenes when powering consumer technology, also offered test drives during CES that forced me to do just that. Now more than ever, how autonomous systems work will be a key differentiator among carmakers. That’s why Nvidia was showing off how its AI processor worked and even introduced a new feature called co-pilot that detects what’s going on in and around a car and warns drivers when they need to react to something or take control of the car. The chipmaker — which also announced it was working with Audi to get self-driving cars on the road by 2020 — offered a demo that was vastly different from BMW and Hyundai. Not only did I sit alone in the fully autonomous Nvidia-powered vehicle, I was in the back seat. Aside from a big red button that said “STOP,” there was no real way for me to take control of the car. That’s why the company operated its test drives around a small track and also had staffers on hand with a remote control just in case they needed to step in. The car smoothly drove around in circles, over rocks and sand as well as plain road set up for the purpose of the demonstration, twice. Without stopping, the car began driving a third time around the track. About 10 seconds past the original starting point, I heard a loud beeping and was thrown slightly forward as the car stopped abruptly. The staffer operating the remote came to the car to restart the system. He had remotely disengaged the car because it was getting too close to the wall. I wasn’t in danger, but he was being careful. As a frequent rider in self-driving cars, I wasn’t entirely fazed by the situation. But I’m on record saying I'm more comfortable in fully autonomous vehicles than semi-autonomous, because I'm hyper-aware of the limitations of the latter. This ride was a little bit of a reality check. Had it been a first-time rider in the car, the experience could make or break trust in the technology. Though the technology is progressing faster than many expected, as Nvidia’s senior director of automotive Danny Shapiro told me, it'll be a long time before consumers can simply take a car driving itself for granted.

(Photo: Waymo) SAN FRANCISCO — Google's fleet of 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids is finally ready to hit the road. The white minivans, unmistakable with their bulbous rooflines and protruding fenders, will later this month start adding to the 2.5-million miles of road testing that Google has racked up, beginning first in California and Arizona. The high-tech cars are the result of a partnership between Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that was formed last spring. Search giant Google has spent the past seven years testing a variety of self-driving vehicles on roads near its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., as well as in Austin, Phoenix and Kirkland, Wash. John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, the newly renamed autonomous car division of Google, told attendees at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit Sunday that the fleet packs an array of new sensors that were developed in-house, a critical step towards making a self-driving future an economic reality. USA TODAY At CES 2017, the frenzy over self-driving cars is palpable USA TODAY Bentley reveals its 209-mph, 'most powerful' car ever Krafcik cited a famous quote from computer scientist Alan Kay that insists tech companies with grand software ambitions must ultimately make their own hardware. "Well, we’re serious about creating fully self-driving cars that can help millions of people, and to do that we have to oversee both the self-driving software and the self-driving hardware," Krafcik said at the show's Automobili-D conference. That engineers can make a car drive itself is no longer in question, especially given the myriad programs underway at tech companies (from rumored Apple to Uber), automakers (from Audi to Volvo) and an array of parts suppliers (Nvidia, Intel and others took the spotlight at the recently concluded 2017 CES show in Las Vegas). The bigger issues include not just regulatory and insurance concerns surrounding self-driving cars, but developing affordable sensor technology that can make fleets of autonomous cars a fiscal reality. Google entered into a partnership with FCA last spring, the result of which is this fleet of 100 Pacifica Hybrids packed with self-driving tech.  (Photo: Waymo) The most prominent example of technology bringing cost breakthroughs involves the sci-fi eye that sits atop autonomous vehicles, a Lidar, or laser radar, device that scans that environment in all directions looking for obstacles. Krafcik, an auto world veteran formerly with Hyundai, said that when Google first started on its moonshot project, a good roof-top Lidar system cost $75,000. " Today, we’ve brought down that cost by 90 percent," he said. "That’s nine, zero. This is a big step in making this technology affordable and more accessible to millions of people." The other benefits of both bringing autonomous car tech in-house and the growing collaboration between Waymo and Fiat Chrysler engineers include more seamless integration of car sensors, quicker development cycles and, most recently, the development of a all-new Lidar system, Krafcik said. While self-driving cars currently have medium-range Lidar systems engaged to tell them about what is happening in their immediate vicinity, Waymo's new short- and long-range Lidar sensors are designed to provide the car's computer brain with more information about what is far down the road as well as very near its bumpers. "The detail we capture is so high that not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they’re facing," said Krafcik. "This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next." Waymo's self-driving minivan packs a complex Lidar system on its roof, a system that now features both short and long-range sensors in addition to standard medium.  (Photo: Waymo) Waymo executives say that adding FCA's 100 Pacificas to a self-driving fleet that already includes dozens of Lexus SUV and a homegrown two-person prototype dubbed Firefly will help the company speed up the pace of its testing, which ultimately should hasten the arrival of what most experts assume will be self-driving fleets of cars designed for ride-hailing purposes. While it took Google engineers about six year to drive its first million autonomous-car miles and 16 months to add another million, the three-milion-mark will be reached in only eight months. Krafcik also noted that the accuracy and efficiency of its autonomous systems is improving. In 2015, Waymo test drivers had to take over from the computer due to an unexpected issue at a rate of 0.8 times per thousands miles. "Today, that number is 0.2 disengages per thousand," he said. Waymo's California tests are done with the approval of the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, which requires companies to report all accidents that occur during testing. To date, most of the incidents involving Waymo cars have been the fault of other drivers that often rear-end the self-driving cars because they aren't driving as most human might anticipate. Uber, which is testing autonomous cars in Pittsburgh, recently announced it would begin testing its fleet of self-driving Volvo SUVs in San Francisco. But the ride-hailing company did not apply for a DMV permit, and the agency quickly denied its vehicles permission to drive in the state. Uber announced it would be moving its cars to Arizona, where the DMV stipulation currently does not exist.

Every year the industry's biggest names gather in Las Vegas to show us a glimpse of the devices and innovations that will define the months to come in consumer technology. With so many announcements hitting the wires at the same time, we've already brought you the top stories and highlights, especially those concerning personal and computer technology. Now, realizing not every product we've seen at CES will necessarily get a release date, the fun is in watching the announcements and recognizing the trends and hints of what's to come. In no particular order, here's our selection of the 10 most promising or downright cool products we found at CES 2017. LG Signature W7 OLED TV CES is often used to showcase the next generation of display technology. 2017 was no exception, and we were impressed by more than one company's efforts. However, LG is in for a repeat with their Signature W7 OLED TV, also known as the "Wallpaper TV." Touted as the thinnest TV in the world, the Signature W7 comes in 77- and 65-inch versions. At an incredible 2.5 mm thick, it's so thin it's best seen when attached directly to a wall, where it can hang as a painting would. To make this analogy closer to reality, the LG W7 is mounted to the wall using magnetic brackets, to keep the intended appearance that the company calls "picture-on-wall." The W OLED TV is webOS powered, sports a 4K resolution with active HDR (HDR10, Dolby Vision and more) putting out gorgeous images with near-perfect blacks and wide viewing angles. Of course, you won’t find any ports or inputs in the wafer-thin panel. It has a proprietary cable that connects to a companion sound bar where all wired connections are managed. The sound bar houses Dolby Atmos certified audio and connectivity includes 4 HDMI ports (HDCP 2.2), 3 USB ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and a Toslink connection for optical audio. Razer Project Valerie Think about this: three 17.3-inch 4k IGZO displays equipped with Nvidia G-Sync. In a laptop. Granted, at 12 pounds and 1.5-inches thick it's not the most practical machine to carry around, but never before you could cram so much hardware (including a powerful processor and GTX 1080 graphics) let alone three high resolution displays in a portable PC. In case you were wondering, Project Valerie's chassis is directly inherited from the current top of the line Blade Pro. To make this setup practical, there is supposed to be an automatic deployment mechanism that slides out the side of the main screen and adjusts the two additional screens into place, however Razer's working demo machines that we were able to touch and play with were using a less sophisticated mechanism. Properly driving AAA games at this resolution will prove challenging even for a GTX 1080, so that's something to consider. But in the few days since Project Valerie was shown we've read enthusiastic comments from people who would buy this for productivity instead of gaming, or maybe even completely forgoing a battery in this "laptop," so there's more space for proper cooling and more hardware. Project Valerie looks like someone photoshopped two more displays onto a gaming laptop, but Razer believes this will be a real product they'll offer in the future. But for now, more exploratory than true product, Razer was looking to create buzz and we won't argue with their intentions. A honorary mention goes to a second project Razer showed at this year's CES. Project Ariana is similar to Microsoft's IllumiRoom concept (2013) that uses a projector to show ambient lighting and video effects surrounding your main play screen and room. It was always meant to be a niche, but very neat project that maybe will come to fruition in Razer's hands. Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Dell’s XPS 13 has been consistently named one of the best Windows laptops in the past couple of years, receiving praise for its near bezel-free display and solid construction. Now the company is taking its winning formula to a convertible 2-in-1 design that’s a little bit thinner and lighter, too. The XPS 13 2-in-1 shares most of its looks with its laptop counterpart but adds a flexible hinge that allows the system to fold back into a tent orientation or all the way back into tablet mode. Just like the regular XPS 13, the 2-in-1 version uses an InfinityEdge display with a 5.2mm border, but there are also a few changes under the hood. For one thing, the XPS 13 2-in-1 uses a fanless design. The system is based on an Intel Y Series (formerly known as Core M) Core i5 or i7 processor from the Kaby Lake family, instead of the typically more robust U Series, so there’s a performance tradeoff here. Also, you won't find a full-size USB port, but you do get a couple of USB Type-C ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, microSD card reader, DisplayPort, and headphone jack. The Dell XPS 2-in-1 is available in 1080p and Quad HD+ versions, with the base model starting at $999 and upgrades available to a Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD. The 46WHr battery is supposedly good for up to 10 hours in the QHD+ model, or up to 15 hours in the full HD version which sounds a bit generous but we'll likely find out soon since the 2-in-1 is shipping as soon as this week. HP Envy 34 All-in-One HP went back to the drawing board for this year’s refresh of the Envy 34 All-in-One and the result is both functional and stunningly beautiful. While most AIO designs these days squeeze every component into the back of the display, HP has opted to move the whole PC into a wide, blocky yet low profile base. This allows for a thin, elegantly curved display and skinny bezels, prevents cables from visibly dangling off the back, and keeps important IO connectivity within easy reach. Four Bang & Olufsen speakers with dual passive arrays are hidden behind a mesh on the front of the base. There's a touch-sensitive dial embedded on the right side of the base for controlling volume and playback, and an optional Qi wireless charging pad on the left side. The 3440x1440 IPS display looks bright and crisp and tucked inside along the top is a built-in pop-up camera that you can easily hide when not in use for some privacy peace of mind (the mic also turns off). You can tell HP has really thought this design through and it was by far the most beautiful AIO design of this year's show. HP hasn’t yet shared detailed configuration options, but 7th-gen Core i5 or i7 processors are a given, along with up to 256GB SSD and 2TB HDD and discrete Nvidia graphics. It’s not designed as a gaming powerhouse — all-in-ones rarely are — but it should otherwise be more than capable enough to handle pretty much any computing task you throw at it. It's expected to go on sale on HP's website on January 11 and at select retailers on February 26, 2017. Monitor Display Tech: 8K, HDR + Sync A few years ago it appeared like monitor display technology was stuck. Smartphones were getting really great and pixel dense displays with notable improvements arriving every 12 month cycle, and TV tech was not lagging either. But monitors were still shooting for the cheap stuff. Nvidia and AMD were trying to push sync technology for gamers, but few seemed to be interested in pushing the envelope, and 4K monitors were expensive and hard to set up and thus recommend. Much has happened in the last couple of years, but it was loud and clear during CES 2017 that companies are now truly invested in innovating on PC-class displays and creating great products. Case in point these three highlight products and underlying technologies: Dell UltraSharp UP3218K 8K monitor A drool-worthy 32-inch monitor with an insanely high resolution of 7,680 x 4,320 at 60Hz. The UP3218K offers 1.07 billion colors and packs in more than 33 million pixels – that’s four times as many as a 4K display and 16 times more than Full HD. That translates to a PPI rating of 280 which is very high for a desktop screen. At $4,999 it's expensive, but it also means it's not vaporware. Dell will start selling the UltraSharp 8K in late March. Asus PG27UQ gaming monitor The 27-inch PG27UQ is the first monitor to support 4K at 144 Hz. Even more impressive is the fact that this display uses IPS technology. Asus plans to take full advantage of Nvidia's G-Sync HDR tech (read more about it below) for HDR10 compatibility, with a prospective Q3/2017 release date and rumored $1,500 price point. Acer Predator Z301CT gaming monitor The Predator Z301CT is a 30-inch display with an 1800R curve and a modest resolution of 2560 x 1080, but the star of the show here is a refresh rate that can go as high as 200 Hz with 4ms response times. There are a number of gamer-friendly features, including Tobii eye tracking and G-Sync. The Z301CT comes with HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2a inputs as well as a USB 3.0 hub. Interested gamers will be able to purchase this display in February for $899. AMD FreeSync 2 technology The next big thing that's set to hit PC displays in the coming year is HDR, or High Dynamic Range. Already seen in a range of TVs, HDR technology increases the color depth and dynamic range of imagery, creating greater contrast between bright and dark areas that leads to more detail and a more realistic image. The key aspect to FreeSync 2 is it eliminates display-side tone mapping when displaying a HDR image. It does this by giving game engines the exact characteristics of the attached display – data such as color gamut, supported dynamic range, brightness, etc. – so that the game itself can tone map directly to the display. AMD will also be certifying all FreeSync 2 displays so that gamers are guaranteed to receive a quality HDR experience when they buy a display branded with the FreeSync 2 logo. FreeSync 2 displays will also support all the features of the original FreeSync, chiefly variable refresh rates for stutter- and tear-free gaming. Low frame rate compensation will be a mandatory feature of FreeSync 2, as will low input lag in the "few milliseconds" range. Nvidia G-Sync HDR technology The idea behind G-Sync HDR is similar to AMD's FreeSync 2 technology: it provides gamers with a zero input lag HDR gaming experience on a new collection of top-end monitors. These monitors have been created in partnership with AU Optronics, who have created a brand new panel that will be seen in a range of displays, including the Asus PG27UQ. Like FreeSync 2, it appears as though PC games will need to integrate specific support for G-Sync HDR if they want to utilize the full capabilities of G-Sync HDR monitors. Mass Effect: Andromeda and Shadow Warrior 2 are two games set to support G-Sync HDR at its launch, and we can expect more titles to support HDR on PC in the future. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC Set to become the SoC of choice among the smartphone elite in 2017, the Snapdragon 835 is Qualcomm's first 10nm SoC built on Samsung's FinFET process – in fact it's one of the first 10nm chips of its kind on the market, beating traditional leader Intel to the punch – and this helps the chip achieve new levels of performance and efficiency. The Snapdragon 835 is 30% smaller than the Snapdragon 820 it replaces, while packing up to 27% better performance and a 40% power consumption reduction. An impressive chip already, the latest Snapdragon carries the usual number of processing and graphics cores, wireless modem (Gigabit LTE!), and a series of specialized hardware to support a phone's GPS, camera and image processing, among others like VR-specific features. The first devices to use the Snapdragon 835 will be released in the first half of 2017, we'd assume mostly high-end smartphones, but as Qualcomm chips have become more powerful, the convergence of traditional PCs and handheld systems is inching closer ever more so. The Snapdragon 835 will run full Windows 10 and so this may finally be the year where ARM meets Windows in a truly convincing fashion. Mohu AirWave Mohu, best known by cord cutters for its Leaf over-the-air (OTA) antenna, has been working on combining OTA with over-the-top (OTT) streaming content. The Mohu AirWave is a wireless antenna that receives free over the air signals and can stream them over your network via the Mohu TV app on a compatible media streaming device — this will include the entire Roku lineup, the current generation Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, and Chromecast. Users will be able to browse program descriptions and up to 14 days of upcoming content in a cable-like program guide within the Mohu TV app. You can also select favorite channels, and Mohu claims its ClearPix technology will reduce pixelation for the best image quality possible of OTA broadcasts. The idea of mixing OTA content with OTT streams is similar to what Dish's upcoming AirTV Player does, except instead of requiring a new streaming box and supplying your own wired OTA antenna, Mohu’s AirWave’s approach is to bring live broadcasts to streaming boxes you already own through an app. The Mohu AirWave wireless antenna goes on sale this spring exclusively at Best Buy priced at $149.99. AirBar Neonode was just in time for CES showing a new working prototype of the AirBar. In its most basic form, the AirBar is a sleek, metal bar that attaches to the bottom of your laptop's display and connects to a USB port. The AirBar emits an invisible light field over the screen to recognize the touch of your fingers or a stylus when it makes contact with your non-touch display, then translate that into clicks. During our brief testing session we felt the AirBar was pretty accurate, maybe not like a real touchscreen, but for an affordable add-on ($69) it wasn't bad at all. Pinch-to-zoom and scrolling gestures are not yet enabled but we are told they should be working soon. AirBar for Windows is supposed to be ready now, while the MacBook Air version that was shown at CES is shipping in March. The difference has to do with size, with AirBars being offered at typical laptop widescreen sizes of 15.6 inches, 14, and 13.3 inches. The technology appears to be inexpensive and practical. Not everyone needs or wants a touchscreen, however in certain scenarios we see how older laptops and monitors could use touch and AirBar's tech could become the standard add-on for that purpose. Navdy Navdy is an aftermarket head-up display for your car that connects to your phone via Bluetooth and sits on the top of your dashboard. The small device projects a full color image that adapts to any light condition to a transparent display in your line of sight allowing you to keep your focus on the road. The device has built-in sensors monitoring for hand gestures above the steering wheel, so you can manage calls, messages, GPS and your car information with the wave of your hand, Tony Stark style. There's also a dial that can be attached in the steering wheel or gearshift that can be used for navigation or to access Siri / Google Now. It's a cool device, it's already available (since last quarter), and it's not cheap at $799, but from our brief time testing it we thought it was polished enough to make it a worthwhile investment for many, with the added plus that it can be adapted to your current car for an effective upgrade to your current dash info system. Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 2017 The core design of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon remains largely the same but sticking with a winning formula while refreshing components and squeezing a bit more performance and battery life has paid off for Lenovo. The X1 Carbon is a gorgeous if utilitarian-looking machine. As before, it's a professional-oriented laptop and still one of the most portable you will find at 2.5 pounds. The display is available in 1080p or 1440p IPS LCD variants, and Lenovo has crammed these 14-inch panels into the area normally occupied by a 13-inch display taking a cue from Dell's XPS, the screen bezels are much thinner now. The move from an Intel Skylake to Intel Kaby Lake CPU has resulted in an extra four hours of battery life; Lenovo now claims the Carbon is good for 15.5 hours of usage. Other improvements include the addition of two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, and the ability to pack both WiGig and Qualcomm's X7 LTE modem in the one unit. An IR camera with support for Windows Hello facial recognition is included alongside a fingerprint reader. Lenovo's signature ThinkPad keyboard and trackpad are still as good as ever here. You can kit out the X1 Carbon with up to 1 TB of PCIe SSD storage and 16 GB of RAM. The new X1 Carbon will be available in February starting at $1,349. 6 comments 148 interactions Back to TechSpot Gaming The 10 Most Anticipated PC Games of 2017 Software 10 Tech Predictions for 2017 Must Reads Biggest Rivalries in Computing History Buying Guides TechSpot PC Buying Guide Hardware DDR4 Memory at 4000 MT/s, Does It Make a Difference?

One day that division of labor might not be so stark. A team at Hewlett Packard Labs, in Palo Alto, Calif., has built a demonstration chip that could help push some particularly thorny computations into the realm of light, potentially boosting speed and saving energy in the process. Silicon integrated circuits containing parts that can manipulate light are not new. But this chip, which integrates 1,052 optical components, is the biggest and most complex in which all the photonic components work together to perform a computation... IEEE Spectrum Op-ed: The desktop CPU isn't dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Our review of Intel's new flagship consumer desktop CPU, the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7700K, was less-than-favorable. Out of the box, the chip runs faster than the i7-6700K that preceded it, but that's just because it ships at a higher default clock speed. When running at the same clock speed -- something easily achievable because these chips are specifically intended for overclocking -- CPU and GPU performance is identical. Ars Technica EFF's 2017 wishlist For the last five years, EFF has greeted the holiday season by publishing a list of things we'd like to see happen in the coming year. Sometimes these are actions we'd like to see taken by companies, and sometimes our wishes are aimed at governments, but we also include actions everyday people can take to advance our digital civil liberties. This year has seen a few victories, including the fact that more and more websites are using HTTPS by default and using Let's Encrypt... EFF 'Copyright trolls' hit with class action lawsuit for theft by deception In recent years so-called copyright trolls have been accused of various dubious schemes and actions, including intimidation and extortion. Last month it became apparent that these concerns are not just one-sided complaints, when the U.S. Government launched a criminal case against two of Prenda Law's principals. This week, copyright trolling allegations are once again brought to the forefront. TorrentFreak Lessons learned from a composer turned game developer In a recent story from The Verge, Chris Tilton explained how he went from composing music for games like Assassin’s Creed Unity and SimCity to going hands-on with game development to create the upcoming isometric adventure game Divide. While the story contains some insightful lessons learned by the composer turned game developer, his take on how hands-on experience with a game changed his composition process is especially interesting. Gamasutra Inside the development of gaming's biggest mystery, 'Frog Fractions 2' "I'm trying to ship a game," remarked an exhausted-sounding Frog Fractions designer James Crawford during a Skype conversation recently. I joked that I didn't believe him, but after players used a mysterious key found at the end of an escape room on an equally mysterious box labeled "launch FF2," Frog Fractions 2 exists. Waypoint.Vice Researchers design one of the strongest, lightest materials known A team of researchers at MIT has designed one of the strongest lightweight materials known, by compressing and fusing flakes of graphene, a two-dimensional form of carbon. The new material, a sponge-like configuration with a density of just 5 percent, can have a strength 10 times that of steel. In its two-dimensional form, graphene is thought to be the strongest of all known materials. MIT Amazon's robot army grows by 50 percent The world's largest e-commerce retailer said it employed 45,000 robots in some 20 fulfillment centers. That's a cool 50 percent increase from last year's holiday season, when the company had some 30,000 robots working alongside 230,000 humans. The Seattle Times (also, Japanese white-collar workers are already being replaced by artificial intelligence) The making of Sapienza, Hitman's best level Sapienza, the second level of Hitman, began as two words: Coastal Town. "This was the only direction we got," says Torbjørn Christensen, lead level designer. "So we really had a lot of freedom to be creative." That coastal town would become the game’s standout level, against which subsequent Hitman episodes are compared. PC Gamer 2016 sees Internet Explorer usage collapse, Chrome surge At the start of 2016, Microsoft's Internet Explorer was still the most commonly used browser on the Web; it finished 2015 being used by about 46 percent of Web users, with 32 percent preferring Chrome, and 12 percent using Firefox. But Explorer's days have been numbered ever since Microsoft essentially ended its development. Ars Technica Android was 2016's most vulnerable product With 2016 officially over, we can crown Android as 2016's product with most vulnerabilities, and Oracle as the vendor with the most security bugs. This statistic is based on the number of vulnerabilities reported by security researchers in the past year, bugs which have received a CVE identifier.

ZScaler Apple's 2016 in review This has been the winter of our discontent. 2016 was the year the tone changed.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  CyberPowerPC Hyper Liquid Series Prostreamer II Displayed at CES 2017 CyberPowerPC Hyper Liquid Series Prostreamer II Displayed at CES 2017 Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Sun, Jan 08, 2017 - 2:22 PM If you are aspiring to be a professional streamer or already one you should take a closer look at the CyberpowerPC’s updated version of its Prostreamer dual-system gaming and streaming PC that debuted last year. The new Prostreamer II is part of the Hyper Liquid series now and has been completely redesigned and features Intel’s latest 7th Gen Core Kaby Lake processors. This system has two computers inside one massive and impressive Enthoo Elite Ultra full-tower case by Phanteks. Most everything on this system can be customized as it starts at around $2,999 and at that price you get what you want. You can work with CyberPowerPC to use your favorite brands hardware and customize it they way you want with a crazy open-loop liquid cooler or RGB lighting. The price tag on the Hyper Liquid Series Prostreamer II starts out higher than last years model that was $2,365, but that is mostly due to the Phanteks Enthoo Elite Ultra PC Case as that alone costs $979 (based off £799 pre-order listing at OCUK). The Prostreamer II on display at CES 2017 runs around $6,000 and was loaded an impressive amount of hardware. The primary ATX gaming system featured an ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 (Intel X99) motherboard powered by an Intel Core i7 6950X 10-core processor, two MSI Geforce GTX 1080 Gaming X 8GB graphics cards running NVIDIA SLI, 64GB of DDR 3200MHz memory, Samsung SSD 960 Pro PCIe NVMe 512GB drive, and a Corsair AX1500i power supply. The smaller streaming system used the mini-ITX form factor board by MSI (Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon AC Mini-ITX) and an unlocked Intel Core i3-7350K dual-core 4.2 GHz processor, 16GB of DDR4 3200MHz memory, Avermedia Live Gamer HD 1080p capture card along with the Coolermaster G650M power supply. CyberPower PC said that this system can stream at ultra high bitrates (6800+) with zero lag on the main gaming system as the media center or streaming system is doing all the work. Think about that for a second… 1,500 Watt PSU on the main system and 650 Watts on the secondary, so you could easily run 2,150 Watts of PC components on this beast. A typical home in North America is wired with 120-volt service on a 15-amp circuit that only can handle approximately 1,800 Watts of power before becoming overloaded.  For long-term loads, including anything that draws current for more than three hours, the maximum wattage recommended is 20 percent lower than the tripping power, so 1440 watts. The good thing is that this build went a little crazy on the power supplies, but if you wanted to custom order one that draws that much power for real you might as well upgrade your homes wiring to thicker 20-amp wiring and a circuit breaker! The inside of the CyberPowerPC Pro Streamer 2 is simply beautiful and was our favorite custom built PC at CES 2017 that you’ll be able to order soon for yourself. This is the ultimate streaming PC and should be affordable for pro-streamers that are looking for the very best performance.

What if I told you that same initiative could also change the trajectory of a young person's life and strengthen our ­community? And that it's already being successfully implemented in businesses across the United States and here in Minnesota. It's mentoring. January is National Mentoring Month, and it provides an opportune time to spotlight the ways youth mentoring meets business goals and community needs. Good for youth, business It's well-established that mentoring benefits children. For centuries, young people learned as apprentices and from extended family and their community. More recently, mentoring has become one of the most tested and proven youth ­programs. Studies show that young people with mentors are more likely to be successful in school, to be leaders in their community, to volunteer, and to pursue postsecondary education. But what about business? What effect does mentoring — specifically youth mentoring — have on the bottom line? I'm not talking about a corporate mentoring model where experienced employees mentor new hires. Those programs are vital and serve their purpose well. I'm talking about mentoring youth as a focused community partnership. Last year Ernst & Young LLP and the National Mentoring Partnership, or MENTOR, conducted a qualitative research study of 18 organizations with workplace mentoring programs. Researchers looked at a wide range of companies, including American Express, Citi, GE, Intel, 3M and Viacom. The benefits they reported were strikingly similar. The study found that mentoring is good for youth and good for business. Companies actively engaged in youth mentoring reported: • Improved retention of high-quality employees. • Employees who are more invested in their work and happier working for their ­company. • A talent pipeline of well-qualified candidates who are ready for the workforce. • Strong communities where employees live and work and where business can thrive. • And, every company reported that mentoring helped attract well-qualified job candidates. Many noted that millennials and new college graduates seek out employers with volunteering and community engagement programs. Business supports mentoring Awareness is growing among Minnesota business leaders that mentoring hits the intersection of business strategy, employee skills and ­passion, and the needs of young people in our ­community. Back in 2009, Comcast piloted a new type of business-based youth mentoring that incorporated mentoring directly into the workday. Since then, that program has provided one-to-one mentoring to nearly 100 St. Paul Public Schools students, and in doing so, established a template for other business-based mentoring programs. Here's another example: Federated Insurance, headquartered in Owatonna, Minn., believes that mentoring's return on investment is so powerful that since 2004, it has dedicated 100 percent of the money received through the Federated Challenge for Kids of Minnesota — that's nearly $25 million — to Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies in Minnesota. Federated Chairman, President and Chief Executive Jeff Fetters says that "mentoring is deeply ingrained in our business culture. It pays off in many ways. Our employees are more fulfilled and engaged, we're investing in the next generation, and we're contributing to a more vibrant community in which we do business." Fetters and his wife, Marty, count themselves among the dozens of Federated employees who are "Bigs." At Cargill, a cohort of employees are volunteer mentors to young scholars from Harvest Network of schools in north Minneapolis. These "Littles" board a school bus and visit their "Bigs" at work twice a month for facilitated group activities ranging from community service and career exploration to chess games and craft projects. First year results at Cargill were impressive, with 90 percent of participants maintaining or improving their scholastic competence. These Littles, all of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds, are beating the odds with the help of mentoring. Tone at the top is key Across the board, companies with successful mentoring programs note that a strong commitment from leadership, along with a culture that supports mentoring, are both essential to a program's success. "We make a point to tell our employees that their time spent mentoring is important and valued," said Mike ­LeSage, president of Cargill's Risk Management business and a volunteer Big Brother. "We know it's good for employees, good for the community and good for the company. We reinforce that message at all levels of the organization; companywide support helps keep the program going strong." Employee volunteers want to give back in ways that are meaningful and authentic. The best mentoring models provide training, tools and ongoing support. A good partnership involves mutual respect, clear communication and regular feedback — and ultimately makes launching and sustaining the program more manageable and rewarding. An invitation January is a month of new beginnings. A new year brings resolutions to eat healthier, to be more organized, to get to the gym each morning. We focus on small steps to improve ourselves and our lives. This year, I invite you to make a business New Year's resolution, and one that's a little more ambitious. Look beyond the walls of your organization and out into the ­community. Make a positive impact on a child and your business' ­bottom line with mentoring. Michael Goar is chief executive of Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Greater Twin Cities.

The company first showed off the original verison at Computex in 2015. The original black-and-red color scheme had given way to a more HTPC-ready all-black look by the time it showed up in the TR labs last summer. The Bulldog 2.0 kit still includes a unique angular Mini ITX case, a Hydro Series H6 SF all-in-one liquid CPU cooler, and an SF600 600W power supply. The original Z170 motherboard has given way for a Kaby Lake-ready Z270 model with built-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a USB 3.1 Type-C port. Buyers will need to hit their favorite PC parts vendor for an Intel LGA 1151 Skylake or Kaby Lake CPU. Corsair hopes shoppers will peruse its own offerings for the desktop DDR4 memory modules and storage needed to make a complete system. All Intel LGA 1151 CPUs have IGPs, and the Bulldog's motherboard has an HDMI jack and a DisplayPort output, but a discrete graphics card makes things a lot more fun. For example, a Seahawk liquid-cooled GTX 1080 made by MSI with a hand from Corsair would certainly be a good fit for the Bulldog 2.0.

Sleep. MORE is undermining his own presidency by refusing to accept the conclusion of the U.S. intelligence community’s reports on Russia's meddling in the United States election. “There is no one who is more undermining the legitimacy of the Trump presidency than Donald Trump himself,” Schiff said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Schiff, who serves as a ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump’s statement following Friday’s intelligence report shows his “continued refusal to accept the obvious.”  ADVERTISEMENT "It’s still more denial about what took place,” Schiff said of Trump’s refusal to “accept the core conclusions of the intelligence community that this was Russia.” On Friday, the intelligence community issued a declassified report that concluded Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in an effort to help Trump win the White House.

Scott Gilbertson - Jan 8, 2017 2:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Behold, Dell's seventh edition of the XPS 13 DE. Scott Gilbertson reader comments 123 Share this story Over the course of its four-year lifespan, Dell's extremely popular XPS 13 Developer Edition line has become known for one thing—bringing a "just works" Linux experience to the company's Ultrabooks. Of course, today Dell is just one of many manufacturers producing great Linux machines. System76 makes the Oryx Pro (still my top pick for anyone who needs massive power), and companies like Purism and ZaReason produce solid offerings that also work with Linux out of the box. Even hardware not explicitly made for Linux tends to work out of the box these days. I recently installed Fedora on a Sony Vaio and was shocked that the only problem I encountered was that the default trackpad configuration was terribly slow. Further ReadingThe XPS 13 DE: Dell continues to build a reliable Linux lineage Admittedly, the Vaio is a few years old, which means there has been time for hardware issues to be addressed. Getting Linux to run on bleeding edge hardware in 2017 remains tricky—or it requires running a bleeding edge distro like Arch. That's where efforts like Dell's Project Sputnik, led by developer Barton George, come in handy. With the XPS 13 Developers Edition, the hardware is already vetted. Drivers are pre-installed and configured for a great out-of-the-box experience. The latest Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, released in late 2016 and tested in the home office last month, is an exceptionally well-built, great-looking piece of hardware. Yet again, if you want your Linux rig to "just work," this is for you. But if you also want a powerful, svelte package that weighs under 3lbs, this is the XPS 13 you've been waiting for. Dell's most recent Linux laptop even features Intel's new Kaby Lake chip, which bumps the clock speed by about 10 percent. The more impressive side of the chipset upgrade is the graphics architecture, which is supposed to improve performance in 3D graphics and 4K video. Playback, especially 4K video, is incredibly smooth and not nearly as battery-draining as previous models. The specs Outwardly there's nothing new to see here. The 7th generation Dell XPS 13 DE uses the same wonderful InfinityEdge display that manages to pack a 13-inch screen into a body that looks and feels like an 11-inch laptop. The model I tested came with the 3200x1800 IPS touch panel. There's also a version with a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel, but I think the higher res display is worth the extra money. The new XPS 13 has simply the best-looking display I've seen in a laptop. Naturally the HiDPI model suffers a little in battery life compared to the lower res model. I've never used the lower res version, so I can't compare battery life times, but more pixels always takes more power. If battery life is your top priority, don't go with the HiDPI model. That said, I find the brightest setting (400 nit brightness) to be a bit much indoors. It's great for working outside and goes a long way to compensate for the inevitable glare on glossy screens. But I rarely push the brightness past 60 percent when I'm inside, which improves battery life considerably. The model Dell sent me featured an i7-7500U Kaby Lake chip with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid state drive. As configured, the whole enchilada would set you back $1,799. The lowest model—which has the 1920x1080 display, an i5 chip, 128GB SSD, and only 8GB of RAM—can be had for $975. For an extra $375, you can step up to the higher res screen and a 256GB SSD. There's also a new option for what Dell calls a "Rose Gold" exterior. The laptop I tested had the same full aluminum exterior as previous models. Underneath it is an aluminum frame, which makes the XPS line feel solid even at its minimal weight. As has been my experience with most Dell machines, the construction is excellent. I used the previous model for over six months, shoving it in and out of my bag several times a day, every day. It doesn't have a scratch on it. I can see no reason to think the latest model would be any different. The ports remain unchanged on this version of the XPS 13 DE... You'll get: 2 x USB 3.0 (one with PowerShare), one Thunderbolt port that supports charging, 3-in-1 Card Reader, Native DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. Sold separately: Ethernet and USB-A via the Dell Adapter. Also unchanged in this release are the ports and layout. There are still two USB 3.0 ports, one with PowerShare for charging your devices (note that USB charging generally requires a trip into the BIOS settings to enable; see Dell's support site for more info). There's also a Thunderbolt port that supports charging, a 3-in-1 card reader, DisplayPort 1.2 video output, VGA, and HDMI. As with any laptop this thin, Ethernet requires an adapter (sold separately). The 720p webcam is the same one that has been in the last couple of models, and it's still at the bottom of the lid. Yes, it still sucks that it's down there, although in fairness to Dell, there is nowhere else to put it. The InfinityEdge display comes within 1/8-inch of the edge of the lid. Nevertheless, like fellow Ars reviewer Peter Bright, I find this decision irritating. Why not just move the display panel down an 1/8 inch and put the camera at the top so it's usable? Or, why not stop pretending that the bottom camera is useful and just ditch the camera altogether? The palm rests are made of a carbon fiber composite that I found very comfortable. The keyboard also appears to be the same as previous models. It's a very thin chiclet-style keyboard that works just fine, although coming from the ThinkPad world I still find these keyboards disappointing. What's more disappointing for some Linux fans is the fact Dell still uses the Windows logo on the super key. The touchpad is reportedly the same, although using the testing model next to the previous edition I felt a noticeable difference with the newer model being somewhat "stickier." That doesn't sound good, but I found my movements were actually more precise with the new trackpad. This was particularly noticeable in Darktable, a photo editing app with some of the tiniest imaginable control elements. Usually that can be a real pain to adjust, especially on such a HiDPI screen like the one the XPS 13 uses. The problem I experienced previously, where the trackpad would unaccountably freeze at times, appears to have been related to something in Ubuntu 14.04, because the new XPS, which comes with Ubuntu 16.04, did nothing of the sort. Another common complaint about the XPS 13 is a high-pitched coil whine that plagues some models, according to some Reddit threads. In the three models I've used, I've never encountered this issue. It's possible that the whine comes from something related to Windows drivers (some people report fixing the problem by reinstalling drivers), although I have seen reports of the whine being present on the Ubuntu-based models as well.

With 16GB (8GBx2) and 32GB (8GBx4) kits becoming the mainstream memory capacities in PC systems, 8GB-based kits are in greater demand for higher performance than ever. Upon the launch of Intel’s latest Kaby Lake platform, G.SKILL bumps up the maximum frequency speeds to a blistering DDR4-4266MHz at CL19-19-19-39 for 16GB (8GBx2) kits and DDR4-4133MHz CL19-21-21-41 for 32GB (8GBx4) kits. The Fastest 16GB (8GBx2) Kit - DDR4-4266 CL19-19-19-39 Extremely high frequency memory kits often are achieved at the sacrifice of unsightly CL timings. Not anymore! With a more streamlined and efficient CL19-19-19-39 timing memory kit at 4266MHz, the limits have been increased under the latest 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processor.  The Fastest 32GB (8GBx4) Kit - DDR4-4133 CL19-21-21-41 Those familiar with overclocking and high performance memory kits know that increased memory capacity also makes it difficult to raise the frequency speed. Built on decades of experience, G.SKILL is raising the limits of 8GBx4 kits to an unprecedented DDR4-4133MHz. Kaby Lake Platform Launch Records: 8 World Records & 21 Global First Places Upon the launch of the Kaby Lake platform are new overclocking and benchmark records, including a total of 8 world records and 21 global first place records achieved with the DDR4 Trident Z series memory and 7th Gen Intel® Core™ processors!  Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

Share story By Matt Day Seattle Times technology reporter LAS VEGAS — Wares from RCA, formerly the Radio Corporation of America, have been at CES since the technology show was born 50 years ago. For much of that time, though, RCA technically hasn’t existed as an independent business. Since the late 1980s, RCA has been a rented brand name slapped on products made under contract by companies from Toronto to the Philippines and China. CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show, showcases products made by some of the biggest manufacturing giants in the world, including Samsung, Toyota and Intel. It’s also a locus of the strange relationships wrought by capitalism. CES’ halls these days are filled with dozens of component manufacturers, many based in Asia, vying for business from companies with name recognition among consumers. That means the name on a finished television or smartphone often has little to do with what’s inside, or the people who made it.

Branding matters in technology. Many consumers don’t take the time to find out what makes gadgets tick. Marketing and the value that people assign to it help explain why Apple and Samsung products command a higher price than devices built by other companies. Hisense, a Chinese company best known in the U.S. for selling discount TVs at Wal-Mart, two years ago bought rights to sell Sharp-branded TVs in the U.S. The company’s gargantuan booth here mixes Hisense-branded TVs with those labeled with the name of the Japanese electronics firm from which it bought a brand. Across the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Kodak. Or, rather, two Kodaks. One is the successor to the legendary New York photo company that went bankrupt in 2012. The other, Kodak Pixpro, was created in 2013 when old Kodak was restructuring its debt pile. The company licensed the rights to sell Kodak-branded cameras to JK Imaging, a little-known outfit led by an executive at a Florida electronics distributor. Kodak Pixpro employs about 30 people between a Los Angeles office and a few sales and marketing hands in Europe. They were at CES primarily to showcase a line of cameras aimed at capturing video for virtual reality. “People see the Kodak name, and say, ‘Hey, can you sponsor this, invest in that?’” said Tracy Christall, JK Imaging’s marketing director. She often has to say no, telling people the company isn’t related to the other Kodak. Natalie Mizik, who studies marketing at the University of Washington Foster School of Business, says the value that consumers attach to brand names can last longer in high-tech businesses than other industries.   Pam Kunick-Cohen is trying to extend the life span of RCA. She works at Technicolor, the French conglomerate that owns the rights to RCA. The name traces its roots to 1919, when the U.S. government ended a wartime monopoly on radio technology. RCA grew into a giant, founding what became NBC and acquiring interests ranging from record players to rental cars. Research conducted by the company’s laboratories helped bring about color television, liquid crystal displays, and VCRs. The company was acquired by General Electric in 1986 and sold for parts. Now, RCA-branded products are built by contract manufacturers with a mandate to try to keep up with new technologies while making reasonably priced products. “We’re not going to be out there trying to out-innovate Samsung or LG,” Kunick-Cohen said.

Scott Applewhite US 15:54 08.01.2017(updated 17:25 08.01.2017) Get short URL 6760121 The declassified report released by the US intelligence community on Friday accusing Russia of meddling in the 2016 presidential race, while failing to produce any single evidence of Moscow’s wrongdoing, looks like a bad joke indeed. Instead of promised answers, all one gets sifting through the 25-page report, jointly prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, are phrases like “we assess with high confidence,” “this is likely,” etc. What one does not get, however, is any hard evidence of President Putin personally authorizing a campaign of cyberattacks aimed at influencing the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the United States. © Photo: Pixabay CIA Chief: US Intel Report on Cyberattacks Focusing on Alleged Russian HackingThe only “proof” of Putin’s interference the report’s authors manage to produce is that the Russian president used to heap praise on Trump and stopped doing this in June 2016 in order not to undermine Americans’ growing support for the billionaire businessman, RIA Novosti commentator Andrei Smirnov wrote. The report also mentions Guccifer 2.0, a Romanian hacker or group of hackers who the authors claim also worked for the Kremlin. “Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election,” the report reads. “Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists,” the report adds. This is about all its authors managed to dig up. Their main focus, however, is on the Kremlin’s alleged use of “state-sponsored” media companies and publications like RT and Sputnik that target overseas audiences to discredit Hillary Clinton and aid Donald Trump’s campaign. Eight of the report’s 25 pages are about RT, which the authors call Russia’s number one propaganda tool. However, most of this coverage happens to come from a 2012 CIA report, which is exactly when Barack Obama was reelected for a second term in the White House. Does it mean that Putin had a hand in this too? The report claims that RT threw its weight behind Trump in March 2016, while any Google user can see that in September 2016, shortly before the Americans went to the polling stations to elect their new president, RT published on its website materials about Donald Trump having used $258,000 of his charity's money to settle legal disputes. RT ran hundreds of other reports about Trump and Clinton, but the only thing that grabbed the authors of the report’s attention was the channel’s coverage of Clinton’s emails, physical and mental health and her links to Islamic extremists. The impression is that the intelligence experts who prepared this document completely missed out on numerous US media reports about Clinton blacking out right in the middle of a campaign speech and her subsequent pneumonia diagnosis. Neither could RT have ignored the front-page US media coverage of the Clinton Foundation’s links to financiers of terrorism, especially after Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton “the co-founder” of Daesh. RT has not been entirely pro-Trump either. In an October 2016 interview with RT’s Ed Schultz, Clinton's primary Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, spoke at length why he thought Hillary Clinton was best suited to become America’s next president. © Sputnik/ 'Dear CIA!': RT Editor-in-Chief Mocks Accusations of 'Kremlin Propaganda'The report’s authors were particularly unhappy about RT’s active cooperation with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. To an extent that they called Assange’s chat with Dartmouth Films reporter John Pilger “an exclusive interview for RT.” As a result of all these foul ups, the report failed to gain traction even in the United States itself. After reviewing it a visibly disappointed The Daily Beast came up with an article titled “U.S. Spy Report Blames Putin for Hacks, But Doesn’t Back It Up.” “[The report] contains some outdated information that seems slapdash considering the attention focused on it. Errors in the report were almost inevitable, because of the haste in which it was prepared, said one US official briefed on the report,” the American news reporting and opinion website wrote. The Washington Post earlier quoted US officials who had read the report before it came out as saying that even its classified part offered no sensations at all. The New York Times disagreed, though, describing the report as “damning and surprisingly detailed.” “We must be reading different reports," Shaun Walker, the Moscow correspondent of The Guardian, observed.

There was little difference from the MSM. That can be easily checked. It was the same at Sputnik. But that could have been allowed for a reason. It's easy enough to find the anti-Trump articles and the complaints in the comments section. Reply jas 17:59 08.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete It's a curiosity that Clinton was such a poor candidate that she had EVERYTHING rigged in her favor and still lost. And the DNC is going to lose the mayorship of New York if they are foolish enough to try and give it to Clinton. She's too mean, too old, too dishonest, too arrogant, too ignorant and too sick.

According to the document, Moscow used various tools, including cyberattacks and media activities, to influence the results of the election. Highlights of the Report © AFP 2016/ THOMAS SAMSON 'Embarrassment': How Foreign Journalists Reacted to Report on 'Russian Hacking'The document was prepared by analysts of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Agency (NSA). According to the author, the report covers "the motivation and scope of Moscow’s intentions regarding US elections and Moscow’s use of cyber tools and media campaigns to influence US public opinion." The report read that "Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards." However, according to the report, the targeted or compromised systems were not involved in vote tallying. As for the recent presidential campaign, the authors of the report concluded that the campaign was intended to "undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency." © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite US Intelligence 'Laid Itself Open to Ridicule' by Accusing Russia of Hacker AttacksThe document also read the "influence campaign" was ordered personally by Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to US intelligence, President Putin and his entourage were interested in boosting Republican candidate Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election. "Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations – such as cyber activity – with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls,'" the report read. The document does not contain the names of hackers or hacker groups allegedly involved in the cyber activities. However, previously issued US intelligence reports linked such hacker groups as Fancy Bear (APT 28) and Cozy Bear (APT 29) to Russian intelligence. In particular, according to US intelligence analysts, Cozy Bear were one of the hacker groups behind the of Democratic National Committee (DNC) email hack. © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes WikiLeaks: US Intel Report on Russia Hacking 'Has Poor Sourcing and No Evidence'In July, whistleblowing website WikiLeaks published almost 20,000 pages of hacked emails that revealed top DNC officials deliberately worked to obstruct Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders' campaign in order to boost his then-rival Hillary Clinton's chances of becoming the party's presidential nominee. After the emails were leaked, Clinton said that Russia was responsible for the hack as well as the publication of some unspecified DNC documents. On Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump said that the DNC were negligent in securing their private information. "Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place. The Republican National Committee had strong defense!" Trump wrote on Twitter. Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 7 января 2017 г. ​Mysterious Hacker © Photo: Pixabay Hacker Guccifer Calls US Allegations Against Russia 'Fake Cyber War'The authors of the report assessed that the Russian military intelligence (GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to publish all the information they obtained. In early-summer, Guccifer 2.0 wrote in his blog that he obtained access to the DNC email leaks and then handed over the leak to WikiLeaks. The hacker illustrated his post with a report on Donald Trump, which was allegedly prepared by Hillary Clinton’s electoral office. The pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 refers to Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar, known as Guccifer, who obtained access to Hillary Clinton’s personal emails in 2013. © Flickr/ Dennis Skley Anti-Russian Campaign in Mainstream Media Fueled by 'Russian Hackers' HoaxSpeaking from prison in a Wednesday interview with Fox News, Lazar stressed that the allegations of Russia’s attempts to interfere with the US electoral system are "a fake cyber war" and that there is "hysteria" in the US regarding Russia stemming from the Cold War era. Nevertheless, US intelligence analysts assess that there is a group of people linked to the Russian government behind the Guccifer 2.0 persona. Previously, the same assumption was made by cybersecurity specialists from ThreatConnect and CrowdStrike. "Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election. Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists," according to the report. At the same time, Guccifer 2.0 has made repeated statements that he did not like Moscow’s foreign policy. The hacker has also repeatedly denied media allegations of his links to Russia. "I read several reports, some experts found out that my proxy IP is hosted at a service that’s somehow connected with Russia and has a version in Russian as well as in English," Guccifer 2.0 wrote. "This is their strong evidence," he ironically added, as cited by The Wall Street Journal. WikiLeaks and Russian Media The US intelligence report also touched upon alleged links between the Russian government and the whistleblowing project WikiLeaks founded by Julian Assange. © REUTERS/ Brian Snyder US Intel Report Confirms WikiLeaks Data on DNC, Clinton Contain No ForgeriesAccording to the authors, Moscow "most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its self-proclaimed reputation for authenticity." "Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries," the US intelligence assessed. As a piece of evidence, the report cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comment that it was important the DNC data was exposed to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks commented on the report: "US government's declassified 'Russian hacking' report has the curious disclaimer that it is based on watching TV and reading Tweets."

WikiLeaks has repeatedly denied such allegations. "Nothing in today's declassified ODNI report alters our conclusion that WikiLeaks' US election related sources are not state parties," WikiLeaks said in Twitter. © Sputnik/ Mikhail Voskresenskiy US Intel Report: 'RT & Sputnik Are Being Accused of Doing Journalism'Another piece of evidence, according to the document, is the alleged collaboration between the Russian broadcaster RT and Assange. Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, visited Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013. "RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States," the authors concluded. The report described RT’s activities as a "broader and long-standing anti-US messaging" campaign. On Thursday, Director of the US National Intelligence James Clapper said at a US Senate hearing on cybersecurity that RT had been "disparaging" of the US political system and was active in promoting its views on US hypocrisy regarding human rights and generally seeking out fissures in US society. Clapper also accused RT of spreading fake news stories. In response, Simonyan said that the broadcaster only reports on real events happening in the US. "The national intelligence head says that RT undermines the American system merely by reporting on what is happening in his country," Simonyan said. ...

The bottom line, in a courtroom, is that if the evidence does not make sense, it is because there is no truth in it, and you have to press for a summary judgement. Not being privy to all the information may make a case for the "intelligence community", but leaving me without a workable outline to present a case for them. with a preponderance of evidence, makes them look shit faced. And, knowing that this is a government conclusion, where money and imagination is always a premium, I am sticking with a Jason Bourne conclusion; "What do you want from me?" These are threads that go nowhere with anyone that is far more discerning than the man on the street. We are conditioned to being lied to, and have been, for years by our own government.

No official allegiance or party affiliation was required. For those of us that were dedicated to debunking the warmongers to help bring peace this was a big opportunity to do so in a very small window at a unique point in time. There was no pay day or payment of any kind not a cent I personally posted some 3500 posts which has been my retirement hours spent in the most noble of pursuits. Did we have a impact I dear say we did, we did it for peace and humanity with a determination to end wars designed to prolificate profit on the backs of death and destruction. I can also understand the bewilderment of some in the proficiency obtained in what I call my 'Masters degree in geopolitics' obtained in little over 12 months by a huge amount of hard work to unravel the deliberately confused trail portrayed in the mainstream of media. Sputnik amongs't others brought us piece by piece the parts to a 50,000 piece puzzle. In my opinion Sputnik was never a propaganda machine in fact at times I thought they were quite insipid for what ever reason. For me I feel a great sense of achievement to having completed the Masters degree by proxy and how paradoxical that might be. To reiterate not a cent was earn't or paid nor am I affiliated to any party or organisation. I can only offer my early experience at age 9 when I started to read 'The Industrial Revolution' by Karl Marx. To understand what a revolution it started in my mind to explore the truth,one would need to read the book there is no other like it! especially as a young mind.

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia . Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

This is by making a Zen-based processor unlocked, which means soon to be owners can overclock Ryzen processors out of the box! AMD Ryzen Processor Features In efforts to attract more people, AMD finally heeded to the calls of gamers and PC communities to release a powerful processor which can be overclocked. AMD, like rival Intel, has been fighting this process in order to prevent any untold incident on processors while overclocking. As posted on WCCFTech.com, here are the things PC communities are waiting for: - All Ryzen CPUs will be multiplier unlocked and ready for overclocking right out of the box. There will be no locked Ryzen CPUs; - AM4 X370, X300 and B350 chipsets all support overclocking; - Ryzen CPUs will come in different configurations with varying core counts. The highest core count parts will have eight cores and support sixteen threads; -Ryzen will launch closer to the middle of Q1 or early Q1 rather than the end of Q1.

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers – as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are. "What's going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs - and the music is still playing," said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. "Everyone is changing partners." Several suppliers - notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive - are among the more popular technology partners in the self-driving race, with multiple alliances around the globe. "If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player," said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an Israeli-based supplier of mapping and vision-based sensing systems. "The technological challenges are immense," Shashua told Reuters. "I would compare it to sending a man to the moon." Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems - the building blocks for self-driving cars - to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Tesla's Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphi's chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $8,000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMW's senior vice president for automated driving. "We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021," Frickenstein said. "That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption." Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer self-driving hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a non-exclusive basis to companies ranging from Uber to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMW's joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG's Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch. "We're not looking to develop a proprietary system," said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Bosch's board of management who oversees autonomous driving. "We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for self-driving systems, especially around data and mapping." While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. "There's not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution - no one who knows everything, every part of what's needed to make an autonomous car," said Alejandro Vukotich, Audi's head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of self-driving systems - cybersecurity, for instance - should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific self-driving technologies, he said. "There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said. "Those are big blocks."

Radio Sputnik talked to political commentator and the host of the daily radio newscast "CPR news" Don DeBar. “The interesting thing about this report is that it is only conclusions, not evidence or even a statement of a case. The very beginning of the report says ‘sorry, we can’t show you any of the evidence.’ The case that they make, the conclusions they arrive at are that Sputnik and RT provide platforms for voices other than that coming out of the mainstream media, that they view the mainstream media’s treatment of Trump as biased, that they published materials that created unfavorable feelings towards Clinton, such as the WikiLeaks releases,” Don DeBar said. “What Sputnik and the RT are really accused of is doing journalism, muckraking, taking materials for the public to make up their own minds about.” When asked why it seems that nobody cared about the actual content of the emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager John Podesta, which contain self-confessions of criminal activity, about the Democratic National Committee (DNC) suppressing Bernie Sanders’ campaign, and many other things besides, Don DeBar said that nobody actually denied that these things had happened. © Photo: Pixabay CIA Chief: US Intel Report on Cyberattacks Focusing on Alleged Russian Hacking“That is not part of the discussion. The main argument here is that the source of this [information] was a foreign government and that the purpose was to influence the US election. We call this whistleblowing in the US. We know how the Obama administration treats that, prosecuting more people on the Espionage Act than all of the prior presidents of the past 100 years,” DeBar noted. “But those of us who were raised here with the belief that a free press is essential to the functioning of a democracy look favorably as hell on it when someone says something we didn’t know about people running for office,” he added. Some of the Podesta emails shed light on Hillary Clinton’s improper use of the charitable foundation, her paid speeches at Goldman Sachs where she was less critical of Wall Street banks than she had been on the campaign trail. Other emails showed Clinton criticizing environmental activists and supporting hydraulic fracturing, which is a method of gas mining fraught with danger to the environment. The Democrats described the hacks as an attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign and boost support for Donald Trump. © Sputnik/ Evgeny Biyatov RT Besieged by DDoS Attacks Days After US Think Tank Called for Cyber TerrorismDon DeBar also said that the password John Podesta used — “p@ssw0rd” — was so simple that “even some kid in his mummy’s basement” could crack it. “It’s a real possibility that they (the DNC) had absolutely no security, so I think that [all the talk about the alleged Russian meddling in the US election] is just a distraction from the fact that these are authentic emails that show criminal activity by the campaign of a presidential candidate, by the Democratic National Committee, by a whole host of players that are either government officials or would-be government officials, and that the press is no part of this criminal activity at all,” Don DeBar said. The declassified report released by US intelligence community on Friday accuses the Russian media of influencing the American public during the 2016 presidential race. However, it appears that material that was thought to provide evidence was compiled in December 2012, right after the reelection of Barack Obama. Notably, the report focuses on television shows and interviews that took place four years before Trump was elected, and well before he was even a politician. WikiLeaks derided the report in a tweet by saying that the document, "had the curious disclaimer that it was based on watching TV and reading Tweets." Have you heard the news?

RT and Sput are typically a couple days behind the real journalists of Breitbart. In fact, I believe this is where they get half of their material.

Not only this is not done, but when others do it, they are accused of «meddling» ! However, when Barack Hussein Obama told the British people how to vote, was this not meddling ?!

That's more than they usually admit since EVERYTHING they print is propaganda sourced by the CIA. Reply terryjohnodgers 03:54 09.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete Would anyone go to war based on a lie?

While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop self-driving technology in collaboration with suppliers - as many other features such as anti-lock brakes or radar-enabled cruise control already are.

Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop self-driving systems: With German automaker BMW and U.S. chipmaker Intel , and with longtime supplier Delphi. The Delphi-Mobileye alliance involves a turn-key system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own.

Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in self-driving technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF and Bosch.

"There will be a mix because it's quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, man-machine interface and so on," Devauchelle said.

Unlike most automated vehicles, which are programmed to deal with the situations they may encounter, these cars will have taught themselves, in simulation, how to handle tricky scenarios safely. The cars will learn to navigate busy intersections, crowded highways, and packed rotaries using reinforcement learning, an approach inspired by the way animals learn to associate a reward with the behavior that led to it. Mobileye, an Israeli company that provides vehicle safety systems to many carmakers, announced at CES in Las Vegas last week that it will test the approach on the road, in collaboration with the German automaker BMW and the chip company Intel, in the second half of this year. Recommended for You Mathematical Model Reveals the Patterns of How Innovations Arise Questionable “Young Blood” Transfusions Offered in U.S. as Anti-Aging Remedy A 100-Drone Swarm, Dropped from Jets, Plans Its Own Moves Poker Is the Latest Game to Fold Against Artificial Intelligence Neuroscience Can’t Explain How an Atari Works In reinforcement learning, a computer is not hand-coded, or given specific examples to learn from; instead, it experiments, altering its own programming in light of the behavior that most reliably leads to a certain result. In the case of automated driving, the goal might be entering a rotary or merging into traffic safely and smoothly. The technique has proved an effective way of training computers to do things that are hard to capture with code, such as learning how to achieve superhuman skill at Atari video games and the board game Go. James Maddox, director of the American Center for Mobility, a nonprofit that works with companies to develop and establish standards for connected and automated technologies, says interacting with human drivers will be a key challenge for self-driving cars. Such systems “need to learn not just from a vehicle’s experience but from other drivers as well,” he says. Mobileye is also developing a platform that would let different carmakers share the data collected by their automated cars. Ready access to that information may prove important for the technology’s progress, Maddox says. Automated driving technology was the focus of a flurry of announcements and demonstrations at this year’s CES. Toyota showed off a self-driving concept car featuring a virtual assistant. The chipmaker Nvidia presented a powerful new system on a chip that it created for automated driving. The automotive parts maker Delphi demonstrated a self-driving Audi that it developed in collaboration with Mobileye. Mobileye has been working on its learning system for some time. Speaking in December at an AI conference held in Barcelona, Spain, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, vice president of technology at the company, explained that reinforcement learning offers a way to equip self-driving vehicles with a range of subtler driving skills. He showed a demonstration of one situation that his company is tackling using the technique. In a simulation, at the point where two virtual highways intersect, a handful of cars simultaneously merged in opposite directions. “We need to balance between defensive and aggressive behavior,” Shalev-Shwartz said. “If we are too defensive, we will not make progress; if we are too aggressive, we might hit other cars. We need to negotiate with other drivers. We cannot [just] follow the rules—we need to know the rules of breaking the rules.” Gain the insight you need on digital technologies at EmTech Digital.

The line-up includes the heavy-duty Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, the convertible ThinkPad Yoga 2-in-1 and the ThinkPad X1 Tablet, all of which are now thinner, lighter and smaller overall than their previous iterations. To further sweeten the deal, the new ThinkPad X1 devices can also last far longer on a single charge. Most of the improvements are due to Intel’s 7th Generation Core processors dubbed Kaby Lake, with faster integrated GPUs that allow for 4K video processing support. Moreover, Lenovo is also offering Qualcomm LTE-Advanced modems as an option for the new ThinkPad X1 line-up of devices. These Qualcomm models are usually found in smartphones, but Lenovo thinks that as devices get increasingly thinner and lighter, cellular connectivity is becoming more important and LTE can be of great help in certain circumstances or areas where Wi-Fi is not available. The new ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the star of the upgraded line-up, sporting a substantially smaller design that crams a full HD IPS display with a diagonal of 14 inches into a 13-inch carbon fibre body. The smaller design is partially due to the thinner borders of the new display, which helped shrink the laptop’s overall size.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) Every major global automakers along with a number of technology companies share a similar goal: Be among the leaders of the self-driving car revolution. But the path that each automaker is taking is often very different. Some automakers are developing self-driving software in-house while others are leaning more on partners. Others are investing in start-ups or leaning on partnerships with global technology companies. Meanwhile, some technology companies that started with aspirations of becoming automotive manufacturers are rethinking that mission, opting instead to partner with automakers and provide services, sensors or both. "There are some serious differences abut there are a lot of similarities, too," said Glenn Stevens, vice president of automotive mobility initiatives for MICHauto and the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce. "I don’t think you can always tell who is ahead. You can see where the investments are being made, but they are all pursuing different strategies." Automakers and technology companies tend to be secretive about their progress. That makes it hard for analysts to figure out who is really ahead and who is just thumping their chest loudly. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Why we aren't ready for self-driving cars - yet DETROIT FREE PRESS New mobility is challenging automakers' assumptions "That makes it hard to say who is really in the lead," said Karl Brauer, senior director of Cox Automotive. "I have a sense of who is pushing really hard, and who is trying the hardest...because like most technology endeavors, you don’t want to tell everyone where you are." Companies that emerge as leaders will be those that work well with partners whose cultures are different from their own, predicts Chris Thomas, a founder and partner in Fontinalis, a Detroit-based venture capital firm. "Autonomous vehicle technology is a new and different technology unto itself," Thomas said. "And then, that new technology must work with other new technology," such as cyber-security technology, artificial intelligence software and the car's electrical infrastructure. "Anyone who tells themselves they are going to do this themselves, they are leaving a lot of opportunity and talent on the table." Suppliers including Bosch, Delphi, Magna, Nvidia, Intel and ZF Group also have embraced self-driving cars and are providing both hardware and software necessary for self-driving vehicles. Here is quick look at the different paths that automakers and major tech companies are pursuing: Apple's 'Project Titan' Apple is among the most secretive and, for years, was viewed as the company that might be able to figure out the entire self-driving car landscape on its own. But this past summer the company reduced staffing for what had been called Project Titan. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Why you should care about this 'new mobility'? DETROIT FREE PRESS Auto show to spotlight mobility tech Little is known about Apple’s progress and plans. Apple has never acknowledged that it is working on a car.  In September Apple laid off dozens of employees previously assigned to Project Titan. Apple may still be working development of an autonomous driving system, but it's not interested in manufacturing anything that could be called a car. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Ford CEO Mark Fields shows off the new Velodyne Puck sensor at a press conference on CES Press Day, January 5, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The new Velodyne models will be fitted into the side view mirrors of Ford's Fusion Hybrid self-driving cars.  (Photo: ROBYN BECK, AFP/Getty Images) Ford's city services strategy Ford CEO Mark Fields says the Dearborn automaker can make money providing transportation services to cities. "The cities have this issue of congestion. It's not only a quality-of-life issue, it's an economic issue," Fields said. "Because if you can’t get around, you have businesses that can’t deliver goods and people who can't get to where they want to go." Fields said he believes that Ford can make money if it gets involved in shuttle services, bike-sharing services and other forms of mobility. "We already have some services businesses where the margins are much healthier," than the traditional automotive industry, Fields said. Another strategy that makes Ford different from some automakers is its commitment to leap over semi-autonomous vehicles and go directly to selling a fully-autonomous vehicle by 2021. "They don’t plan on selling any cars to consumers that are not fully capable of full self-driving 100% of the time," Brauer said.

BROWN, AFP/Getty Images) Fiat Chrysler Automobiles working with Google's Waymo  The Auburn Hills automaker has been the quietest of the Detroit Three when it comes to self-driving cars but made a big move in May when it announced an agreement to provide 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Google's self-driving project, which is now called Waymo. FCA developed those minivans and delivered them in December. Waymo plans to showcase one of those minivans at the Detroit auto show on Sunday. FCA also unveiled a self-driving concept vehicle called Chrysler Portal at CES on Tuesday that the automaker says illustrates what family transportation could evolve into in the near future. The automaker worked with Samsung Electronics as its provider of 360-degree cameras and other sensors and Panasonic Automotive as its supplier for infotainment, wireless connectivity and audio systems. Read more: DETROIT FREE PRESS Self-driving fleets to give consumers more options DETROIT FREE PRESS The days of self-driving cars are closer than you think FCA's partnerships with Waymo, Panasonic and Samsung are an indication that the automaker sees deep partnerships with large tech companies as a way it can keep up with automakers that have larger research and development budgets for self-driving vehicles. General Motors Chairman and CEO Mary Barra speaks next to a autonomous Chevrolet Bolt electric car Thursday, Dec. 15, 2016, in Detroit. General Motors has started testing fully autonomous vehicles on public roads around its technical center in suburban Detroit.  (Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) General Motors bets big with Bolt, Cruise Automation, Lyft and Maven and acquisitions GM said last month it will begin producing and testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolts in Michigan immediately. GM CEO Mary Barra said in December it plans to immediately begin testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt electric on public roads in Michigan and is buidling a fleet of autonomous Bolts at its Orion Assembly Plant. "We expect to be the first high-volume auto manufacturer to build fully autonomous vehicles in a mass-production assembly plant," Barra said in a blog post on LinkedIn. GM also spent big bucks in 2016 to dramatically accelerate its development of self-driving vehicles when it spent $500 million for 9% of ride-sharing company Lyft, and $581 million for San Francisco autonomous vehicle software developer Cruise Automation. A Nissan Leaf is displayed at CES 2017 at the Las Vegas Convention Center on January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada. To accelerate the time it will take for autonomous vehicles to get on the road safely, Carlos Ghosn announced a breakthrough technology called "Seamless Autonomous Mobility," or SAM. Developed from NASA technology, SAM partners in-vehicle artificial intelligence (AI) with human support to help autonomous vehicles make decisions in unpredictable situations and build the knowledge of in-vehicle AI. This technology could potentially enable millions of driverless cars to co-exist with human drivers in an accelerated timeline. It is part of Nissan Intelligent Integration.  (Photo: David Becker, Getty Images) Toyota Research Institute connects three leading universities. The Toyota Research Institute is a network of robotics experts who teach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford and the University of Michigan. Together these experts and some of Toyota's own people are working on solutions for difficult driving scenarios (snow, ice and heavy rain), and building artificial intelligence systems that learn from, and evolve to predict, such scenarios. TRI also will apply AI to the challenge of home robotics. Focusing on needs of our aging society and the remarkable progress in electronics and computer science, Toyota seeks to develop machines, including home robots may become even more personally prized in our future than cars have been in our past. Toyota also has made an unspecified investment in Uber. But the Japanese automaker has taken a cautious approach to bringing fully autonomous cars to public roads. This past week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, TRI CEO Gill Pratt said the company is “nowhere near close” to a level of full autonomous driving, labeled as Level 5 by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Pratt's comments Thursday came as Toyota unveiled the Concept-i car at CES. “Historically human beings have shown zero tolerance for injury or death caused by flaws in a machine,” Pratt said. Nissan, Carlos Ghosn Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said last week the Japanese automaker plans to launch a new “Seamless Autonomous Mobility,” or “SAM,” system that combines artificial intelligence with human support to help self-driving vehicles make decisions in difficult situations. Ghosn, in contrast to Ford, believes automakers should phase in self-driving vehicles. "Even fully autonomous vehicles will not be able to handle every possible situation they encounter. The world is too simply too complex," Ghosn said. Nissan and Renault plan to launch at least 10 vehicles with "significant autonomous drive functionality" by 2020. Tesla Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is letting 1,000 customers try out the latest version of the brand's Autopilot system, another step forward on the way to fully self-driving cars. The new system being activated on the limited basis is dubbed Autopilot HW2, or Hardware 2, a reference to the Tesla electric vehicles built after October that are loaded with advanced radar, cameras and ultrasonic sensors. The limited distribution of the Autopilot software upgrade is meant to ensure that any glitches are debugged before a broader rollout. After initiating the Version 8.1 software update over the Dec. 31-Jan. 1 weekend, Musk tweeted that Tesla would then "hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week." Tesla was in the spotlight throughout 2016 because of a handful of crashes both in the U.S. and abroad that may have been related to either improper use or compromised operation of Autopilot software. The most publicized incident occurred last May, when an Ohio man, Joshua Brown, died after his Model S sedan plowed into a truck crossing its path. The Autopilot system didn't see the truck's white side as an object and failed to apply the brakes. Federal regulators are investigating. Tesla aims to begin producing its entry-level electric sedan, the $35,000 and up Model 3, later this year. Musk has pinned high hopes on Model 3, specifically a brisk production target that will see Tesla's total vehicle output jump from 50,000 to 500,000 units a year. Uber hopes to replace employees For Uber, a self-driving car would eliminate the cost of paying drivers to take customers to their destination. Drivers are the most expensive part of its business model. That's why the ride-hailing pioneer, which built its company on providing quick transportation through a mobile phone application, has begun testing a self-driving car in Pittsburgh, home of the company's Advanced Technologies Center. The car, a Ford Fusion Hybrid with a roof-full of radar, lasers and cameras, will be collecting road-mapping data as well as testing its real-world traffic reactions. Volkswagen Group Last April, an Audi SQ5 outfitted with Delphi technology drove itself 3,000 miles across the U.S., doing 99% of the driving by itself. In January 2016, Delphi showed off a new autonomous driving concept at CES. Waymo and FCA announced that production of 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans uniquely built to enable fully self-driving operations has been completed. The vehicles are currently being outfitted with Waymo's fully self-driving technology, including a purpose-built computer and a suite of sensors, telematics and other systems.  (Photo: FCA US) Volvo For Volvo, autonomous vehicles are about both cars and trucks. Volvo, which also makes trucks of all sizes, is exploring self-driving vehicles that are able to navigate construction sites, mines, quarries and public roads. In Sweden, Volvo is testing self-driving cars on public Swedish roads, and by 2017, real-world customers will be using 100 self-driving Volvos. The test program is a partnership between Volvo, the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish Transport Agency, Lindholmen Science Park and the City of Gothenburg, and is endorsed by the Swedish Government. Volkswagen Group Waymo operated for eight years as Google's self-driving project until it renamed itself last month. Waymo initially was developing cars without steering wheels and pedals but realized many customers are unlikely to accept those vehicles and still want the option to drive. Now, Waymo is transforming itself from a research project into business enterprise that must make a profit. It's the mission is to bring the company's technology to market and monetize it via a partnership with an automotive company. "They understand now they can’t go straight there now," to a fully autonomous vehicle without driver controls, Brauer said. "They also are very clearly going to be a provider of services to existing automaker, verses building their own car." Last spring, Google inked a deal with Fiat Chrysler to outfit 100 Pacifica minivans with Google's radar, lasers and cameras. Google had said the deal was made to quickly add to its fleet in order to further test its systems and ready them for commercial use. Waymo CEO John Krafcik will be in Detroit today and plans to unveil the self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. Contact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

In every other respect, this is a great-looking all-in-one PC with some neat features. Obviously the huge 34-inch ultra-wide screen is biggest feature of all. It has a 3,440 x 1,440 resolution and an anti-glare finish, a nice tonic to the often annoyingly glossy screens of all-in-one PCs. It's sharp, bright and colourful. In fact, the screen covers 99% of the sRGB colour space, which means it can display all the colours used on websites and most online videos. Related: CES 2017 News and Highlights A curved screen is also a great choice for an all-in-one PC. Unlike a TV, where you don't get the benefits when sitting far away, the curve is a natural fit when sat up close. Being ultra-wide, you can easily fit two documents side-by-side, while films and games will be all the more immersive. Unlike an iMac, for example, the computer components aren't behind the screen, but in the base. Inside you'll get a choice of Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors and a 4GB AMD Radeon RX 460 graphics card. Reportedly there will be an Nvidia graphics option as well, but there are no details on that yet. The RX 460 is hardly the fastest dedicated graphics option and will be limited to playing a few lighter games at lower resolutions than the screen's capable of. Another benefit of the base design is it has the speakers built in. HP's previous curved all-in-one had the speakers built into the screen, which made it look rather chunky. This way you get, in all probability, better speakers and the benefit of a nice, slim bezel for the screen. I didn't get a chance to listen to the speakers properly, but with four drivers and two passive radiators, I'd wager the sound should be impressive. B&O had some involvement in tuning them, too, which is a good sign. But what I like most about the HP are all the nice design flourishes. A neat touch-sensitive ring gives you volume and playback controls, while the built-in webcam pops out from the top of the screen when you need it and hides inside when you don't. It's also great to see an HDMI input on the back, so you could connect a games console and use the Curved AIO as a monitor. There's an HDMI output as well in case you need one. Unsurprisingly, none of this comes cheap. We don't have a UK or EU price yet, but prices start at $1,729 USD when the HP goes on sale in February. First impressions There's an undeniable wow factor to the HP Envy Curved AIO 34. It's a luxury, but the sleek design and spectacular screen justify the premium.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows CES The 10 best laptops, drones, and other gadgets from CES 2017 By Brooke Crothers Published January 06, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   Here are 10 of the biggest standouts at CES 2017, from a $9,000 curved screen gaming laptop to an underwater drone for “immersive” fishing. Acer Predator 21 X giant gaming laptop: This massive gaming laptop with a 21-inch display packs all of the fastest Intel and Nvidia silicon you can shake a joystick at into a luggable design. It uses eye-tracking technology to, for example, allow gamers to identify enemies and “take cover simply by gazing at objects on the screen.” The Predator 21 X will be available in North America in February with prices starting at $8,999. Triple-display gaming laptop: But wait—  Razer is upping the ante with the “world’s first” automated triple display laptop. The luggable laptop from Razer (known for thin and light gaming laptops) manages to fit three 17.3-inch 4K screens into one integrated piece of hardware. The graphics are powered by an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. Pricing has not been announced. Underwater drone: Get a drone assist for fishing – an underwater drone in this case. The PowerRay robot can dive as deep as 98 feet underwater, and images and data can be sent up to 262 feet. It even includes an internal fish-luring light. Using an app, you can view real-time photos or video. Preorders start on February 27, 2017.  No pricing yet. HOTTEST NEW CES 2017 TECH: HOME ROBOTS How thin can a TV get? LG's new 77-inch OLED TV is preposterously thin at 3.85mm, including wall mount (the panel itself is 2.57mm thick). But it’s not just the thinness that will grab you. It comes with “Active HDR” – which analyzes and optimizes content scene-by-scene for the best image possible – and 4K resolution. The W7 will ship this March, with preorders starting soon. No pricing yet, but you can bet it’s going to be expensive. (Note that Sony also showed off an OLED TV this week with audio that is delivered via vibrations in the display itself.) Dell’s first 8K display: With four times the pixels of 4K, it’s Dell’s first 8K monitor. That matters because Dell is one of the top computer display brands on the planet. The pricing for the Dell UltraSharp 32 (32-inch) Ultra HD 8K Monitor starts at $4,999 and it will be available March 23 on Dell.com. CES: HIGH-TECH DISPLAY AIMS TO MAKE DRIVING SAFER A modular drone that can become whatever you want. With the tagline “Build it. Code it. Fly it.” the Airblock drone is made of magnetic, modular parts for easy assembly and disassembly. “It does stunts through drag-and-drop programming,” according to Makeblock, the Chinese startup behind the kickstarter project. Newest Windows 10 virtual reality (VR) headsets from HP, Dell, Acer: Microsoft gave conference-goers a glance at upcoming Windows VR headsets from HP, Dell and Acer at CES this week. Details are scant right now, but look for the cheapest priced at around $300, according to Engadget. First Google Tango-enabled Augmented-reality smartphone: Asus' ZenFone AR is the world’s first 5.7-inch smartphone with Tango and Daydream by Google. Tango's AR lets you see virtual objects and information on top of your surroundings. And Daydream is Google’s virtual reality technology. No pricing yet. WHAT ARE THE TOP TECH TRENDS FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR? Super sleek Polaroid instant digital camera: the Polaroid Pop instant digital camera sports a slim, eminently portable design that produces classic Polaroid-sized 3- by 4-inch prints. (Polaroid is celebrating its 80th anniversary in 2017.) But you’ll have to wait, as the camera isn’t due until late this year. First 10-nanometer processor from Qualcomm: Qualcomm is the leading supplier of processors for phone makers worldwide, and the 10-nanometer Snapdragon 835 processor will allow thinner phones with equal or better battery life than phones today.

Video Review 7 Pictures Best Deals Best Deals for Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming Key Features Quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 H-series chips Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti graphics 8GB DDR4 RAM 2.62kg 3x USB 3.0, SD card slot, gigabit Ethernet, 3.5mm headset jack Manufacturer: Dell Review Price: £899.00 Hands-on at CES: The Inspiron 15 Gaming is an old-school powerhouse Dell’s Inspiron 15 Gaming takes me back to the old days of laptops. It’s a mid-range multimedia and gaming laptop, but instead of trying to make it thin and light, Dell has instead decided to let the components breathe a little and jacked up the weight and thickness. The result is a laptop that’ll satiate the needs of anybody looking for a gaming laptop for under £1,000, as long as they aren’t planning on carrying it around too much. Video: Hands-on with the Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming Weighing in at over 2.6kg, it’s almost laughably heavy for a non-hardcore gaming machine. It’s an inch thick as well. Baggable this laptop ain’t. But what you get inside more than makes up for it. There’s a choice of quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 H-series chips from the Kaby Lake generation. These are 45-watt chips with excellent processing performance that’s more than capable of editing video and photos very quickly indeed. Dell’s also stuffed two speakers and a subwoofer inside for better audio performance. The pricing I have for the UK says it will start at £899, and while I don’t have the exact specifications for this model, the $899 model in the US comes with an up-to 3.5GHz, quad-core Core i5-7300HQ, 8GB of RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics. There’ll be a choice of hard disk and SSD combinations. There’s a cheaper, $799 model that comes with the same processor but downgrades the graphics to GTX 1050 hardware instead but I don’t yet know if it’s coming to the UK. The GTX 1050 model will be great for Full HD eSports-style games such as Overwatch and DOTA 2 at high settings. The Ti model will net you extra performance in AAA titles, and I was able to play Forza Horizons on my demonstration machine in Full HD and High settings at pretty smooth frame rates. You get either Full HD or Ultra HD IPS displays. The Full HD model comes in either anti-glare non-touch or glossy touch configurations. I wasn’t blown away by the colour and vibrancy of the Full HD touch panel, but it’s an area of compromise most people probably won’t mind too much. Cooling takes place around the back, with hot air being ejected at speed with a fair amount of fanfare (no pun intended). It was very hot back there when playing Forza, so if you like to game in bed you should make sure you have enough clearance to let the fans do their job. A little noisy they may be, but they do a good job of keeping the keyboard area relatively cool. The keyboard was fine with no nasty surprises, while the touchpad was nice and sensitive. I’d be happy to use it for non-gaming purposes without a USB mouse. The 72watt-hour battery is large, but with beefy components on board I wouldn’t get too optimistic about gaming away from a wall socket, even if it does have more power-efficient Intel Kaby Lake and Nvidia Pascal tech on board. The bold styling might not be to everybody’s taste – I happen to quite like the red grilles and highlights – but I hope Dell considers making alternative models with different colour options. Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming: First impressions Dell could be onto a winner here, targeting gamers with a sub-£1,000 budget can be a tough nut to crack but with high-end processor and mid-range graphics kit on board along with proper speakers could make this a dream machine for many. The latest Inspiron 15 Gaming isn’t available on Dell’s UK site just yet, but it should be very soon.

What you get is a beautifully crafted Chromebook for the next generation. The next generation Chromebook from tow of the world’s biggest tech companies is here—the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro. Both products are designed to present consumers with the best Chrome operating system experience ever. Flexibility is a common feature of both products; the Chromebook Plus and Pro are designed to be flexible—to allow you transform the “Chromebook on demand.” Built with a 360-degree rotating touchscreen performing both as a notebook, and an ultra-mobile premium tablet; consumers are in for one of the most advanced laptops that can be found anywhere. The Chromebook Plus is the cheaper of the two products, and uses an ARM processor. The Chromebook Pro on the other hand, features an Intel Core MR processor; and are both very fast. Both laptops share a lot of similarities; having 12.3-inch displays with 2,400 x 1,600 screen resolution. Memory shouldn’t be much of a problem because four gigs of RAM and 32GB of internal storage is something to give you some cheer. The battery life too isn’t something to worry about; at eight hours rating, you can relax and do a lot of things comfortably. Both the Chromebook Plus and the Chromebook Pro come with a built-in pen, which is embedded on the side of the device for secure storage and easy access. This built-in pen offers a lot of comfort and flexibility; including ability to easily take notes and capture on-screen content. According to Samsung; “the pen is ready to use out of the box with pre-installed Google Keep for notetaking and Samsung ArtCanvas for drawing. The newly developed pen has a 0.7mm pen tip and pressure sensitivity for precise screen capturing.” The new Chromebook is more than just a laptop; it offers you an unforgettable experience anytime you are using it. It connects you to a world of rich experience including apps, games and media; all accessible via the Google Play Store. With a stunning Quad HD 2400×1600 resolution display made of durable Gorilla Glass 3, with a 3:2 aspect ratio, you can do a lot of things including work, game or binge-watch. For enhanced connectivity, the Chromebook has now been upgraded with two USB-C ports. This is great for 4K video streaming; enabling it to produce high quality video and gaming from the laptop’s connected 4k displays. Chromebooks are very easy to handle; explaining the reason why they are so popular and the second most popular PC operating system in the US and in Q1 of 2016, topped Macs in overall shipments. It has virus protection and automatic updates are built-in, so you don’t have to manage your computer. Starting at $449, the Chromebook will be available at major retailers in February 2017.

Our journey begins this week in the world of healthcare, as researchers have developed a new computer algorithm that can help to diagnose conditions such as ADHD and autism. Meanwhile, over in the UK, the National Health Service is testing an app powered by artificial intelligence that can offer medical advice to patients based on the symptoms they describe. Almost four months after its release, Apple revealed that iOS 10 is now installed on 76% of active iOS devices. The first iOS 10.3 beta is expected to arrive next week, with a mysterious new ‘Theatre Mode’. A video published on Friday gave us our first look at an early prototype of an iPod-based operating system developed by Apple for its original iPhone, including a virtual touchscreen scroll wheel. Frankly, it looks pretty awful, so it’s a huge relief that they ended up chucking it in the bin. Intel formally launched its new 7th-generation Core vPro processors, which it says will offer greatly improved security features and… “50% increased productivity over a 5-year-old PC”. Wow? The company also touted the prowess of its consumer-class 7th-gen (Kaby Lake) Core processors, and outlined its hopes for the virtual reality market, saying that it expects 2017 to be a big year for VR. Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon 835 chipset, which features new optimizations for virtual and augmented reality scenarios. The powerful new SoC will launch on flagship-class devices in the next few months, promising 25% less power consumption, Quick Charge 4 support, and more. Nvidia officially announced its anticipated GTX 1050 and 1050Ti graphics cards for laptops, promising powerful performance for budget-conscious buyers. Nvidia also revealed a new Shield TV streaming device with 4K and HDR support. The device includes voice control features and support for Google Assistant. Google revealed that it’s bringing its digital Assistant to Android TV devices running both 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat. Google said it received a massive one billion takedown requests for its search engine in 2016 – twice the amount it got the year before. It looks like Google may finally be preparing to bring its YouTube Red subscription service to European markets this year. And at long last, it seems Google is getting ready to roll out Android 7.1.1 Nougat to the Nexus 6, over a month after its release for other devices. The company also released its January security updates for Android this week. Samsung began rolling out Android 7.0 to a very limited number of its Galaxy S7 handsets on Wednesday. And with just a few hours of 2016 remaining, OnePlus made good on its promise to release its Android 7.0 upgrade to its 3 and 3T flagships before the end of the year. OnePlus delivering an update on time… is that a first? Following the recent collapse of Cyanogen, British device manufacturer Wileyfox said that it will replace Cyanogen OS on its handsets with a ‘pure’ Android experience. A photo showing a slide presented at a Nokia event revealed the company’s plans to launch as many as seven Android smartphones by the end of 2017. The slide proudly declared “The Empire Strikes Back”... consequently reminding everyone that Nokia’s empire, and its share price, have crumbled over the last decade. On Saturday, a leaked image purportedly revealed key specs of the 'Nokia 6', one of the first Android smartphones on the way. BlackBerry is another fallen mobile empire that’s trying to rise again by licensing its brand to another company to build Android devices. This week, TCL showed off its new BlackBerry phone with a QWERTY keyboard – and then said it wouldn’t talk about it until February, by which time everyone will have completely lost interest. Great strategy. LG revealed a change of strategy for its new G6 flagship phone, confirming that it’s ditching the modular design of its current G5, which has been a sales flop. Xiaomi unveiled a white version of its Mi MIX ‘concept’ device… …while Huawei’s Honor brand showed off its new Magic concept device in the flesh – and we managed to get our hands on it. Honor also announced the launch of its ‘mid-range flagship’, the 6X, in the US and Europe. Huawei brought its Mate 9 flagship to the US too, priced at $599, and revealed that it will add support for Amazon’s Alexa digital assistant later this year. ZTE revealed its new upper-mid-range handset, the Blade V8 Pro, with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 3GB RAM, 32GB storage, 13MP camera, USB Type-C port, and more. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the device here. Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy A series handsets – and as rumored, they all include IP68 dust- and water-resistance. That’s a very nice addition to the mid-range devices. After the disastrous launch, and subsequent global recall, of its Galaxy Note7 flagship, Samsung said that it will reveal the findings of its investigation into the battery fires that plagued the device “later this month”. Image: All About Windows Phone But it looks like Samsung’s next flagship, the Galaxy S8, will include a rather intriguing feature. An image revealed the company’s plans to introduce a “desktop experience” to the new Android device with support for an external monitor, mouse and keyboard – which sounds rather a lot like the Continuum mode in Microsoft’s Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft was planning to release a new Fast ring preview of its Windows 10 Creators Update this week, but those plans were postponed while the company addresses some issues with the update process. However, Windows 10 Enterprise build 15002 – believed to be the same build that was due for release – leaked onto the web late on Friday night. However, Microsoft did officially roll out Windows 10 build 14393.594 (Anniversary Update) to PCs and phones in the Release Preview ring. Microsoft hasn’t officially provided a firm launch date for the Creators Update, saying only that it will be released in “early 2017”. But Dell let the cat out of the bag this week, confirming that the Creators Update is due to roll out in April. The Creators Update will include support for 802.11ad Wi-Fi, and wireless docking support for that protocol will be added in a future update. Image: MSPoweruser After the Creators Update, the Redstone 3 update is expected to arrive towards the end of the year. That update will include changes to the user interface, developed under the codename ‘Project Neon’ – and the first screenshots previewing Windows 10’s design refresh leaked on Thursday, showing a cleaner, less cluttered look with new blurring and transparency effects. Microsoft promised more transparency and new insights into its Windows 10 development process this year, as it launched a new blog focused on the Windows Insider community. Elsewhere, Microsoft hit back at inaccurate media reports (not from Neowin!), which claimed that it’s killing off its Command Prompt in the Windows 10 Creators Update. In fact, it’s prioritizing its more versatile PowerShell command line experience over the antiquated Command Prompt, but the latter will still remain in the OS. Data from NetMarketShare revealed that Windows 10 is now installed on almost a quarter of PCs, with Windows 7 approaching 50%, and macOS X 10.11 on 4.38%. On the Steam gaming platform, Windows 10 is now in use by more than half of all gamers, 17 months after its launch. Meanwhile, Microsoft appears to be working on a new cross-platform media-sharing service, currently known as ‘Belize’. Microsoft has been working with numerous automotive giants in recent months to establish its products at the heart of their connected car strategies. BMW, for example, unveiled its vision for self-driving cars with Cortana support, while Nissan is also among other major manufacturers to be working with Microsoft and its Connected Vehicle Platform. Audi has teamed up with Nvidia on its self-driving car program, in an effort to infuse more of its vehicles with autonomous control technologies powered by artificial intelligence. Mmm buzzwords. Casio was among the many companies attending CES this week, revealing a new $500 Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch. Take a look at our hands-on impressions of the rugged wearable device. But it was the giants of the tech industry that made some of the biggest announcements in the greatest numbers. Dell was among them, unveiling a series of new devices, including the Inspiron 7000 gaming laptops with Nvidia's latest GTX 1050 GPUs… …and the Latitude 5285 and Latitude 7285 – two new business-class Windows 10 2-in-1s, promising exceptional security and versatility. The latter device also offers wireless charging support. Dell also unveiled a new XPS 13 2-in-1, and the 27 Ultrathin Monitor… …as well as the stunning UltraSharp 8K Monitor – the first commercially available monitor with 8K resolution, and an unsurprisingly high price tag. But most excitingly, Dell also revealed the XPS 27 all-in-one PC, and the Canvas – an intriguing new competitor to Microsoft’s new Surface Studio. Stardock announced that it has been working with Dell on an exclusive version of its desktop organization suite, Fences, for the new Canvas PC. Don’t miss our hands-on first impressions of Dell’s new devices here! HP unveiled the second generation of its unusual Sprout Pro Windows 10 PC, which has an integrated projector and touch-mat, along with 2D and 3D scanning capabilities. Of course, we went hands-on to see what all the fuss was about – you can see it in action in our videos here. HP’s new ENVY Curve AIO 34 all-in-one PC also made its debut at CES, along with the OMEN X 35 curved monitor. And the 15.6-inch HP Spectre x360 and EliteBook x360 also made their first appearance at the show, both with 4K displays. We went hands-on with both devices here, so make sure you check that out! Lenovo also had plenty of announcements at CES, including that of its new Smart Assistant, an Amazon Echo-style speaker... powered by Amazon’s Alexa assistant. Lenovo unveiled three new ThinkPad X1 devices, and the Miix 720 – a high-end Surface Pro-style tablet, including an integrated rear kickstand. Check out our hands-on videos and photos of those new devices here, along with our impressions of the Smart Assistant. Two Lenovo gaming laptops were announced too, kicking off the company’s new line of Legion gaming PCs. Lenovo launched its new 500 Multimedia Controller, a $55 wireless keyboard for media PCs, on which the keys also double up as a capacitive touchpad with support for Windows 10 gestures. Last month, Microsoft revealed new information on its plans with hardware partners to launch more affordable virtual reality headsets powered by its Windows Holographic shell on Windows 10. Lenovo showed off its VR headset at CES, and said it will launch later this year for under $400. We also got a look at new Windows Holographic VR headsets from HP, Dell and others. CES played host to the rise of the machines, as many companies showed off home robots at the event. The cute new Kuri robotic companion is now available to pre-order for $699. LG also displayed a range of new robots, destined for both home and commercial use. LG announced its new family of thin and light Windows 10 notebooks, claiming that they offer up to 24 hours of battery life… but we’ll have to put that claim to the test in the real world before we can believe it. The LG Stylo 3 and 3 Plus made an appearance too. The two lower-mid-range handsets each have an integrated stylus and come with Android 7.0. Lots of manufacturers revealed new TVs at CES, and LG was no exception. Its range of 4K TVs come with ‘Nano Cell’ technology, said to offer superior color and clarity from any viewing angle. And like so many other devices at CES, LG’s new smart refrigerator includes Amazon Alexa voice support, along with a 29-inch touchscreen and internal camera. Samsung also introduced a new range of smart fridges, including models with a 21.5-inch touchscreen, and its new Family Hub 2.0 software. The Samsung Notebook Odyssey was revealed as the company’s first gaming laptop, featuring some rather meaty specs… and a rather ugly trackpad design. Bleugh. Pre-orders also opened for Samsung’s new Notebook 9, which it calls “the lightest notebook on the market”. Samsung believes its new ‘QLED TVs’ have what it takes to crush all of their rivals, thanks to their use of Quantum Dot technology. Image: Bloomberg Sony made quite an impression with its new ultra-thin BRAVIA OLED TV range, available in three sizes up to 77 inches. They won’t come cheap, so you’d better start saving and/or selling some body organs if you’re thinking of buying one. Xiaomi’s new TVs are also incredibly thin – but they’re rather interesting for another reason too. They have a modular design, which will allow owners to upgrade them in the future by adding new components. Asus revealed new displays designed for computing. It introduced a pro-grade 32-inch 4K monitor with HDR support, along with an enormous 37.5-inch curved ultra-wide monitor, featuring ‘frameless bezels’, and integrated Qi wireless charging plate. Asus also unveiled the ZenFone AR, the first phone in the world to support both Google’s Tango augmented reality suite, and the Daydream virtual reality platform. There’s no doubting the fact that it’s got some pretty decent specs – but it’s not exactly attractive. Miraxess is preparing to launch a new laptop-style phone dock for Android and Windows 10 Mobile devices, similar to the $599 HP Lap Dock for its flagship-class Elite x3 handset. However, the Mirabook will cost half that amount. Meanwhile, Brydge revealed its new laptop-style aluminum keyboard for Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 tablet. There seemed to be no end of PCs on display at CES this year, so it was certainly appropriate that Endless attended the event to unveil its simple, affordable mini-PCs, priced from $129. And after announcing the Sirius A in October, Ockel showed up at CES ready to show off the curious mini-PC in the flesh. The device has a 6-inch touchscreen, but runs the full version of Windows 10 Home, and has an integrated DisplayPort, full-size HDMI, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one USB 3.0 Type C port and a full-size Ethernet port too. More photos and details of the Sirius A and Ockel’s other mini-PCs can be found here. Toshiba turned up with a far more conventional Windows 10 device. Its new Portégé X20W notebook is a 2-in-1 that promises up to 16 hours of battery life. Acer showed off a range of new notebooks and desktops too – but the star of its show stand was the mighty Predator 21 X gaming notebook that it announced in August. The monstrous machine – which has a curved 21-inch display – finally got a price tag… and it’s enormous. Not to be outdone, Razer turned up to CES with an even crazier device. Project Valerie is a gloriously insane notebook with three (!!!) built-in displays, each with 4K resolution, powered by a desktop-class Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Mad. Quite mad. Razer also took things to a whole new level with the unveiling of its Project Ariana concept, a room-scale projector that aims to turn gaming into a truly immersive experience. Back on Planet Earth, Sony revealed that it has now sold an impressive 53.4 million PlayStation 4 consoles since its launch in 2013, including 6.2 million in just six weeks over the holiday season. Despite being outsold by the PS4, Microsoft nonetheless celebrated its Xbox achievements in 2016, and promised an even more exciting year ahead for its gaming platform. But this week’s odyssey around the tech world ends, appropriately, at CES, where the L’Oreal/Withings smart hairbrush won an innovation award. All hope is lost. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. I looked back on a remarkable year for Microsoft, in which it became one of the world's most exciting tech companies. I also took a look ahead to what's in store for Microsoft in 2017 - from gaming and new devices, to productivity and mixed reality, it's set to be a year of work, play, and creativity unleashed for the company. Vlad Dudau shared a mini-review of the MGCool Band 2, an ultra-affordable fitness tracker with some very nice features... but there's certainly room for improvement. And Christopher White published his detailed review of the Thecus W2810PRO, a NAS (network attached storage) device running Windows Storage Server 2012 R2 Essentials. Who comes up with these names? Anyway, the W2810PRO earned itself a very good score in the review, but there are still a few downsides to be aware of. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend and a very happy new year!

Follow 162K Hot Topics: BuzzFeed John Lewis Trump Transition Barack Obama NBC Gets Intel Report Before Trump By Jeffrey Lord | January 7, 2017 | 3:30 PM EST Share it Tweet it 0 shares Donald Trump asked the right question in this tweet: “How did NBC get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?" Who gave them this report and why? Politics!” Exactly. But buckle in. This is what the Trump White House - or any GOP White House that is elected to change the way government is run - will face. The formula works this way. The new President or someone in his administration - a senior staff member, a Cabinet officer - will privately discuss doing Change X. And in a heartbeat, someone somewhere in the bureaucracy, horrified that a proposed change to their world is being considered, will pick up the phone and make furtive contact with Reporter Y. Who will then promptly write up the story for Media Outlet Z in terms that will make Change X look like a cross between Armageddon and World War III. The goal is always the same: make the President look like an idiot if not the second coming of Hitler. Make no mistake, this NBC story is Exhibit A of just how this game is played. Here, at the NBC website, is the headline:  Top Russians Celebrated When Trump Won, Intel Report Says: Source The story begins thusly: A senior U.S. intelligence official with direct knowledge confirmed to NBC News that the report on Russian hacking delivered to President Obama Thursday says that U.S. intelligence picked up senior Russian officials celebrating Donald Trump's win. The source described the intelligence about the celebration, first reported by the Washington Post, as a minor part of the overall intelligence report, which makes the case that Russia intervened in the election. ‘Highly classified intercepts illustrate Russian government planning and direction of a multifaceted campaign by Moscow to undermine the integrity of the American political system,’ said the official. And there you have the problem in a nutshell. The President of the United States is handed a report from U.S. intelligence  and in a nano second there are the contents of the report on NBC News. Before the President-elect of the United States has even sat down with intelligence officials. This is a disgrace. The effort should be made right now to find out who leaked this and they should be fired pronto. <<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>> DONATE   On Thursday evening I raised just this point in a discussion with former Clinton Secretary of Labor Robert Reich on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360. Our chat was picked up by the far left site Raw Story which ran it here with this headline: Robert Reich has WTF moment after Jeffrey Lord suggests the intelligence community is ‘attacking’ Trump Now mind you, this chat with Secretary Reich occurred the night before NBC revealed that they had access to the report that had been delivered to President Obama. Catch this from the Raw Story account of what Reich and I said in our back and forth: Lord continued that when they disagree with Trump and attack him. ‘They’re going to attack him anonymously in the press. They’ll attack through their allies on Capitol Hill,”’Lord predicted. Reich was shocked. ‘The CIA and NSA are going to attack Donald Trump? Is that what you’re alleging?’ Lord alleged that all of the anonymous stories being leaked citing intelligence officials are exactly what he’s predicting. ‘Wait a minute, wait a minute,’ Reich stopped. ‘I want to understand something. You’re saying that there is a conspiracy of some sort, that you have all the intelligence agencies conspiring and they’ll try to bring Donald Trump down? Is this the assumption here?’ Lord said that leaks happen in Washington and it’s amateurish to claim otherwise. This exchange took place at approximately 9:30pm on Thursday night. And by 9:02 am Friday morning - barely 12 hours later - there was a leak from an intelligence community source to NBC News writ large on the NBC website attacking Trump based on a supposedly top secret intelligence report that was written for President Obama and had yet to be shared with President-elect Trump. What is vividly on display here is the degree of coordination between liberal bureaucrats and their liberal allies in the media. This current example may involve the “intelligence community” but rest assured as the Trump era moves forward we will see this same drama play out in one government agency after another.                  In this corner the most likely bets are the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department, both areas seen by liberals not as government agencies responsive to the elected President but as their private political preserve where the Liberal Way Of Doing Things is held sacred and must never - ever! - be disturbed. Speaking of the Justice Department, with confirmation hearings set for next week on the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General the liberal media machine is already in motion. Examples? Here at the Huffington Post is the breathless news that - shocker! - liberals disguised as law professors are set to oppose the entry of a conservative into the liberal lala land that is the Justice Department. The headline: More Than 1,300 Law Professors Oppose Jeff Sessions For AG His civil rights record is awful and he was rejected as a federal judge for being too racist, they write to senators. Oh noooooo! The horror! Writes the HuffPo: In an open letter to leaders of the committee, which will hold confirmation hearings for Sessions next week, professors from 178 law schools raise concerns about the Alabama senator’s ability to treat black people fairly given what happened during his 1986 bid to be a federal judge. His nomination was rejected, in a bipartisan vote, over allegations he called a black attorney “boy” and suggested a white lawyer working for black clients was a race traitor, among other issues. “Nothing in Senator Sessions’ public life since 1986 has convinced us that he is a different man than the 39-year-old attorney who was deemed too racially insensitive to be a federal district court judge,” reads the letter. Nowhere is there mention that the borking of judicial nominee Sessions helped, ironically, elect him to the very Senate that had refused to confirm him. A Senate where, after long since working elbow to elbow with him, many regret their appalling treatment of the man. Indeed, the late Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter confessed of Sessions before his own death that "My vote against candidate Sessions for the federal court was a mistake because I have since found that Sen. Sessions is egalitarian.” Well exactly. But this will not stop the liberal media smear machine from doing its thing.  So as the Senate gears up for confirmation hearings, and the President-elect finally gets a sit down with intelligence officials who, at a minimum, have somewhere a “trusted” employee (if not themselves) who leaked their confidential report to NBC before the President-elect of the United States could see it, America is getting a really good look at exactly the kind of disgraceful behavior that has brought Washington into such miserable disrepute with so many. The kind of behavior - no small accident - that played a role in making Donald Trump president in the first place. Stay tuned. There will be more of this kind of thing to come from the anti-Trump liberal bureaucracy/media axis. Count on it.

Sarah Tew/CNET Laptops by Dan Ackerman January 7, 2017 11:57 AM PST @danackerman Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Gaming laptops were once the Rodney Dangerfield of computers -- they got no respect. Many were much more expensive than comparable desktop gaming rigs, despite having worse performance and less flexibility. Worse, many were laptops in name only, with back-breakingly big bodies, and some of the worst design elements ever pulled from the adolescent sci-fi fantasy look book. Over the past few years, we've seen a steady march of improvement, to the point where serious gamers no longer look down on laptops as automatically second-class gaming machines. This year, at CES 2017, we've seen the next step in the evolution, with a lot of that progress towards thinner, nicer-looking gaming laptops with better performance trickling down to some systems at pretty amazing prices. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET One of Nvidia's big announcements at CES 2017 was the latest addition to the GeForce graphics card line, with the mainstream GeForce 1050 and 1050Ti GPUs. Of course, the 1050 has been spoken about pretty freely for months, so it's far from the first time we've been hearing about these, but now we have the first official lineup of GeForce 1050 laptops. 58 Gaming laptops at CES 2017 earn points for novelty Dell leads the way, in my early impression, with the Inspiron 15 7000. It's got a little more design edge than standard Inspiron laptops, plus new seventh-gen Intel CPUs and the new Nvidia GeForce 1050 GPU, all for just $799 (£645 or AU$1,100 converted). I hear a version with the better GeForce 1050Ti GPU will only run $100 more. The Samsung Odyssey.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Acer has a very similar config, the Predator VX 15, for the same $799, and the Lenovo Legion Y520 and Samsung Odyssey 15 will be in roughly the same price and performance zones. These are generally just shy of the specs needed for VR, but upgraded systems with the GeForce 1050Ti may work for some VR games and apps. If some of those brand names sound new, that's because they are. This year, Lenovo introduced the new Legion gaming brand -- yes, named after ancient Roman Legions -- and Samung named its first-ever dedicated gaming line Odyssey. With HP's Omen line and Acer's Predator line, you've got quite a collection of epic-sounding gaming machines to choose from. The Lenovo Legion.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Of course, you can't keep all the PC gaming talk at CES restricted to under-$1,000 systems. Prototypes and moonshots are what make the show fun to cover. This year, we finally got hands on with the Acer Predator 21X, a massive $9,000 gaming laptop with a 21:9 aspect ratio curved display. Just as impractical, but still fun, is the Project Valerie prototype from Razer, which has two extra 17-inch displays hidden behind its main screen, making for the world's first triple-screen gaming laptop. The Razer Project Valerie prototype.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET And finally, if either one giant wide screen or a triple-screen combo isn't enough for you, one other cool concept piece we saw was also from Razer. Project Ariana is an immersive wide-angle second-screen projector, which throws gaming content on the very walls around you, from an expanded view to weather effects to color-coordinated lights, all while the game is still running on your main display.

Theo Douglas/Government Technology LAS VEGAS — Agencies wanting to exploit the Internet of Things face many of the same issues they confront in creating open data portals, dashboards and visualizations, industry members said Thursday during a 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) panel discussion on “Delivering the Internet of Everything.” The problem, said Jason Collins, vice president of IoT marketing at Nokia, is that even in business, IoT projects — like data streams — can be unconnected or siloed. “There needs to be a standard around data sharing. We’re sort of building the equivalent of the Internet in 1995 and what we need is the Web,” said Collins, who has worked with cities including Austin on making open data available. RELATEDTips from the Experts: CES Spreads Awareness of Smart Device SafetyCES 2017: Sensors, Innovators Key in Furthering Smart CitiesCES 2017: Officials Talk FirstNet, Public Safety Technology Nokia, he pointed out after the CES discussion, is a member of the ng Connect Program, a collaboration community to pioneer broadband infrastructure, devices, applications and content. Other members of the program include the city of Fresno, Calif. Panelist Bridget Karlin, managing director of IoT strategy and integrated products for Intel, noted that by 2020, people are projected to generate 1.5 gigabytes of data per day — and cars are projected to generate 4 gigabytes of data. “There’s no shortage of data,” Karlin said, emphasizing data sources must be trustworthy. Alon Segal, chief technology officer (CTO) of Telit Communications, said the problem is working with the data. “The data is out there. We don’t know how to consume the data. We don’t lack data, we lack the means to monetize it, to make something valuable out of it,” Segal said. Moderator Stacey Higginbotham, host of the IoT podcast and a technology and finance writer, said she felt like people are still very app- and cell phone-dependent when it comes to IoT. What is IoT, exactly? Panelists had varying assessments. Collins portrayed it as a huge network of things, powered by increasingly low-cost sensors. Already today, big data is becoming the new normal, and artificial intelligence and machine learning are “the new rocket science,” said Curtis Sasaki, vice president of ecosystems and IoT general manager for Samsung’s Strategy and Innovation Center. “I think what I hope to happen with technology is, we actually help solve some of the hard global problems,” Sasaki said, mentioning a new connected stethoscope that can live-stream health data. Karlin highlighted obstacles to IoT, including security, interoperability and manageability. “We lack standards and it’s slowing us down," she said. "We have to pay attention to that and move along so we can get to scale.” But, Higginbotham said, maybe it’s that "the businesses aren’t ready for the tsunami of change that’s going to affect them with respect to IoT." Collins told Government Technology he thinks the key issue is the same that agency officials face in open data: the human factor. “I think what you’re seeing is, the technology makes things possible — but we need to figure out how to make the human organizations adapt so they can have the best use out of the technology,” Collins said. As for what 2017 will hold for IoT? Sasaki said he’s looking forward to seeing companies innovate on Samsung platforms, while Collins said he hopes to see privacy issues begin to be solved, and for more data brokerages. Augmented and virtual reality excite Intel, Karlin said. “I think AI is what’s going to help us move beyond just reacting to things.” But to achieve these goals, panelists agreed that collaboration and security will be paramount. “This is about re-creating the Web in a physical world," Segal said. "It just needs the ‘oomph’ behind it to take off.” Theo Douglas Staff Writer Theo Douglas is a staff writer for Government Technology.

Acer Predator 21 X might set the standard for today's powerful laptop. Check out the pros and cons here. (Photo : Jonathan Morrison/YouTube) The Acer Predator 21 X is a 19.4 pound "laptop" with all the bells and whistles every computer enthusiast could possibly dream of. It even has a 21-inch curved screen, with a 21:9 ratio. The fun part is,the Acer Predator 21 X price is at $8,999. This massive gaming laptop was last spotted at IFA this summer and during the recent CES 2017, everyone had another chance to take a closer look at and observe its monstrosity. If someone has personally experienced the Acer Predator 21 X, it's a safe bet he or she can say that it simply is ridiculous and at the same time awesome. Acer Predator 21 X Specs Inside the Acer Predator 21 X is an Intel Core i7-7820HK. Its graphics is powered by an Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 packed with 16GB of GDDR5X Video Ram. Its RAM is composed of 64GB DDR4. The hard drive might be a bit little as it only is 1 TB by default but it has four extra slots for solid-state drives. These alone should give anyone all the power they could possibly need for about anything they'd want to do on a PC. The monstrous laptop has a 21-inch, ultra-wide, 21:9 display that can support up to 1080p. It has a 120Hz refresh rate that can cater higher frames per second requirements. Though the screen is humungous, it will still look sharp when taken a look at personally. The Acer Predator 21 X's curved screen serves as an added bonus as it captivates the user's field of vision, perfect for FPS gaming. With regards to audio, the Acer Predator 21 X is packed with a six-speaker system. It has four speakers and a couple of loud-ass subwoofers powered by Dolby premium. The Acer Predator 21 X can also take awesome images via its 720p HD webcam. On top of that, it has a built in eye tracking system called Tobii EyeX. The Acer gaming laptop is also equipped with a mechanical keyboard which is a fad today. Acer Predator 21 X Review: Cons As observed, there are no 'pros' heading on this article as the previous paragraphs already are good points for the Acer Predator 21 X. One of the cons is that it has an 88 watt-hour battery, quite smaller than what is currently being spotted on newer gaming laptops. With that said, everyone will expect that this monster needs to be plugged in most of the time when used. Another con is the size itself. When bringing along the Acer Predator 21 X in public, it would seem that the owner is planning to launch a nuclear striker. The keyboard only occupies half the chassis so based on that, the reader should be able to gauge how big the gaming laptop is. The weight would be another issue as it would be a hindrance to the fact that it is built to be portable. 19.5 pounds is a lot of weight to carry around so if one plans to get an Acer Predator 21 X, it is expected that mobility is not really good with this gaming laptop. A practical use would be to transfer the laptop within a planned schedule rather than the usual pickup-and-go style of today's laptops. Lastly, the first thing to be considered before getting an Acer Predator 21X is the price. It costs $9,000 and with today's fast-growing technology, something better is bound to happen sooner or later. With that said, if one has a spare change of nine grand, then it's completely fine to get one. More Acer Predator 21 X information can be found here. © 2017 Auto World News, All rights reserved.

Related Technology that talks Consumer Electronics Show: From the must-have to the don’t-need Internet of Things may present opportunity for cyber criminals, experts say The long read: could a robot take your job? The Internet of Things is one of the gadget industry’s brightest hopes in a world that is saturated with smartphones. Sensors are cheap and digital firms, such as Amazon and Google, are pushing their voice-command technology. The resulting hype, however, spawns inventions that should only exist in the corny worlds of science fiction. At this point, the IoT market is not well-quantified. Intel claims there were 15 billion connected IoT devices in the world in 2015 – a number the chipmaker predicts will increase to 200 billion by 2020. Gartner, the tech consultancy, counted fewer than 5 billion devices in 2015 and predicted fewer than 21 billion by 2020. There is a good reason for the gap: no one can predict which objects consumers and businesses will want to connect to the internet. So businesses are trying nearly everything, and showing it off this week at The Consumer Electronics Show in Nevada. That means 10 more apps for objects you never imagined could – or indeed should – be connected to the internet. These things are supposed to improve how you brush your hair and shop for groceries. But aren’t these solemn chores what helps keep us human? Besides, will your cat’s welcome be as warm after it realises a robot – not you – feeds her three times a day? Will you miss your child’s call in the middle of the night when she opts for a plastic gadget to read her a fairy tale? This is how capitalism works, of course. People will offer things for sale in the hope other people will buy them, and if there’s no market, these objects will just disappear. On the other hand, as major companies adopt some of these offerings, they will soon become mainstream just because they will be pushed on consumers with the help of billion-dollar marketing budgets. Then, expect botnets of smart fridges and hacked smart showers that scald you just for fun. One of the devices presented at CES this year is a router that monitors the security of every connected device in the home, which seems wise after a hack brought the internet to a standstill for millions in October. It is only a matter of time before these gadgets must also defend against waves of "targeted" ads based on your ketchup consumption and the little one’s zeal for Maurice Sendak. That will be a dystopian world. I, for one, will steer clear of all these "smart" objects while "dumb" ones are still sold. An internet-connected device that solves a real problem is the rarest of rarities at this point. But I won’t deny that it’s also heartwarming that people are designing some of these things, and adventurous consumers are trying them out. That’s mostly because of the voice features, based in many cases on Amazon’s Alexa. Amazon has put the voice assistant in the cloud, allowing manufacturers to keep devices simple and cheap – all they need to do is record voice commands, send them off, and receive responses. The more Alexa is used in the weirdest contexts, the better it recognises complex or badly formulated commands and the more it learns of the endless diversity of human life. It’s good for the technology – which has many legitimate uses, from making driving safer to increasing the accessibility of services to disabled people – that some of us are willing to have regular conversations about with their fridge. * Bloomberg Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Driving schools embrace convenience of e-learning Eight universities sign link with UAE Space Agency Nuclear energy key to confronting climate change, Abu Dhabi forum hears MOST VIEWED Uae | All UAE weather: 2.2°C recorded in Ras Al Khaimah UAE leaders continue to offer condolences to families of those killed in Kandahar bombing Bahrain executes three convicted of killing Emirati policeman Abu Dhabi Municipality removes 626 illegal billboards Some flavours of e-cigarette liquid affect male sperm count, UK study finds Calls to preserve UAE’s modern architectural heritage New services allows Dubai commuters to rent cars on mobile apps Be careful when driving close to roadworks, UAE safety experts say Fire breaks out at Ruwais refinery in Western Region Hundreds turn out for funerals of Emiratis killed in Afghanistan terror attack - in pictures More Most Viewed Emirates passengers given option to pay for access to premium lounges Friction deepens among Al Qaeda factions in Syria Kim Kardashian hits new Givenchy shop at Mall of the Emirates – in pictures Jose Mourinho tells Sir Alex Ferguson he is welcome to be on Manchester United’s team bus any time Top restaurants to grab a bite from on your way to Dubai Opera Are tourists or visitors allowed to drive Dubai-registered cars?

These themes will shape tech to come in 2017. For tech lovers, CES is the biggest and best event of the year. Not only does it introduce us to a bunch of cool new products, it also helps to establish and define the trends we'll be seeing throughout the year ahead. Some of them are more obvious than others, which is why we like to take a moment after the show to step back and digest everything. Many of the trends we saw last year still hold true for 2017, but technology is ever-evolving. If you're into voice assistants or virtual reality, this is definitely your year, but there is still plenty more to get excited about. So without further ado, here are the top trends we spotted at CES this year. For more, check out The Best of CES 2017. All Alexa, All the Time 2017 may be the year we all start talking to inanimate objects. It seems like just about every new phone, TV, car, and refrigerator announced this year uses Amazon's voice assistant. Huawei's Mate 9 phone has Alexa, as do TVs from Westinghouse, Element, and Seiki, along with an OS that resembles Fire TV and an included remote that supports voice commands. Even Ford is putting Alexa in cars, integrating the voice assistant for owners of the Focus Electric, Fusion Energi, and C-Max Energi, with more to come. But perhaps nothing can top Alexa in LG's Smart InstaView Refrigerator, finally allowing your fridge give its own answer to the age-old question of whether it's running. Mixed Reality VR exploded in 2016 and shows no sign of slowing down this year, with new accessories and technologies to make it better and more functional than ever before. Intel's Project Alloy seeks to cut the cord entirely, with untethered headsets by year's end. We also saw an example of this in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 headset. And don't forget about AR. This year saw a variety of AR glasses like the Lenovo New Glass C200, the ODG consumer-focused R-8, and the enterprise-focused R-9. On the handset side of things, the Asus ZenFone AR offers a more reasonably-sized alternative to Lenovo's gigantic Phab 2 Pro. It runs both Google's Project Tango and the Daydream VR platform. And that's just the start of it. Expect a lot more in this space in the near future. Internet of (Every)Things This year, manufacturers are keen on connecting even the most seemingly mundane objects to the Internet. Withings, Kerastase, and L'Oreal, for instance, teamed up to create the world's first Bluetooth-connected smart hairbrush, the Kerastase Hair Coach. It includes a microphone, three-axis load cells, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and conductivity sensors to identify brushing strength and hair quality. For those with less hair, Griffin introduced a host of smart products, including a Connected Coffee Maker and Connected Mirror that display time, weather, status, and companion apps. Meanwhile, the company's PowerBlock and PowerJolt Beacon are smart chargers that remind you to plug your device in to charge it. Yes, that means you need to charge your charger so it can remind you to charge your phone. What a time to be alive. Surprisingly Good Gaming This is a good year to be a PC gamer. In addition to some top-of-the-line Dell and Alienware gaming laptops, Samsung got in on the action with the Notebook Odyssey, the company's first-ever gaming laptop built specifically with upgradability in mind. AMD announced its next-generation Vega GPU; the chipset is a jack-of-all trades, equally capable in processing data for machine learning as well as powering VR headsets and 4K gaming rigs. Nvidia didn't announce any new chipsets, but it is bringing gaming to the masses with GeForce Now, a service that lets basic Windows and Mac computers connect to powerful gaming machines in the cloud. And we were absolutely blown away by Razer's experimental Project Valerie laptop (video below). It boasts three 4K, 17.3-inch IGZO panels powered by a Nvidia GeForce 1080 GPU. It reuses components from the Razer Blade Pro, has an aluminum casing, and a mechanical keyboard. Razer's Ariana, meanwhile, takes gaming outside the screen by using a projector to expand the picture from a TV to fill the entire wall and make gaming more immersive. Sadly, these two products are just concepts right now. Drones Come Back to Earth Although we did go to our first drone rodeo this year, the drone trend back on the show floor was decidedly less airborne. The Hover Camera Passport is a selfie drone, hovering around and snapping pictures of you doing anything from the awesome to the mundane. But what really got our attention was the PowerVision PowerRay, an underwater drone that uses sonar and LED lures to hunt (and film) fish like some kind of robotic manta ray. Cars Get Smarter Who doesn't want a sleek, autonomous electric car that doesn't guzzle fossil fuels and also cuts down on accidents? True to its name, the Faraday Future FF91 is a futuristic-looking Tesla competitor with a cool design, fast speed, and the ability to park itself without your help. Chrysler also showed off its Portal concept, a self-driving electric minivan for millennials. Equally futuristic, Honda's NeuV is a two-seater meant to act as a ride-sharing vehicle and includes a slew of emotion-sensing features. Nvidia, meanwhile, has partnered with Audi to put AI-powered cars on the road starting in 2020, a tad earlier than BMW iNext. Bye Bye Smartwatches? Smartwatches may not have done too well last year (see Pebble for an example), and we didn't see many exciting new examples at the show. Fitness trackers, on the other hand, are looking better than ever. The Misfit Vapor, for instance, is the company's first wearable with a full touch-screen display. And the Motiv Ring packs all the functionality of a wrist-based fitness tracker into a tiny, stylish design you can slip on your finger. Thin(ner) Is In for TVs This year Sony revealed the OLED Bravia 4K TV, which was just one of several super-slim OLEDs that debuted at the show. We were most impressed by the LG Signature W, which is so thin it practically looks like a poster. LG accomplished this by offloading all the power, connectivity, and processing functions to a combined soundbar and control unit that connects to the TV with a ribbon cable. It's capable of HDR video, and like the Bravia is compatible with Dolby Vision, which all combines to make it one of the most striking TVs we've ever seen. Affordable Phones Galore 2016 saw the rise of flagship-level phones at midrange prices, and that trend looks to continue this year. At the head of the lineup is the Huawei Honor 6X, a metal unibody phone with solid performance and a unique dual-lens camera for a bokeh effect. There's also the Coolpad Conjur, a 5-inch, 720p phone with specs that fall closer to the entry-level—but it also costs less than $200. ZTE launched the Blade V8 Pro, an unlocked phone that works on GSM networks. And last, but not least, the Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom has a Snapdragon 625 processor, a gigantic 5,000mAh battery, and dual cameras for optical zoom. None of these phones are groundbreaking, but they all offer solid specs for affordable prices, which is a trend we'd like to see more of in every category.

Sleep. MORE’s vow to have Mexico pay for a wall on the southern border was a “gimmick.” “I never thought that would happen,” Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) told CNN. “I thought it was a gimmick.” Looking to make good on one of Trump’s highest-profile campaign promises, House Republicans are gunning to include funding for the border wall in a must-pass spending package that has to be approved by April 28 to avoid a government shutdown. ADVERTISEMENT The plan to include funding for the wall in the package is tied to a 2006 law signed by President George W. Bush calling for a physical barrier along the country’s southern border. That project was never completed. But the plan also suggests that Mexico would not be paying for the wall, as Trump has touted. Instead, the cost of building the wall, which some estimates place at $14 billion, would be paid by the U.S. The president-elect took to Twitter on Friday to deny that claim, saying that Mexico would reimburse the U.S. for any money spent building the wall. “The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!” Trump tweeted. The $14 billion pricetag doesn’t include the cost of maintenance or paying border patrol agents. Tags Donald Trump   View the discussion thread.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Packages Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Packages HP Refreshes its Laptop, AIO and Monitor Lineup for 2017 293Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 2 weeks ago HP is announcing a new fleet of laptops and AIOs at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017. The new portables include updates to the Spectre x360 and EliteBook x360, while the premium Envy AIO has been updated too.

This laptop comes in only the 13-inch flavour, with resolution options including both Full HD as well as 4K. CPU options go all the way up to an Intel Kaby Lake i7-7600U, RAM up to 16 GB and storage up to 512 GB SSD. Graphics needs are met by Intel HD Graphics 620. For connectivity, you get Type-C with Thunderbolt, 2 USB 3.1, HDMI 1.4, microSD, and microSIM. There’s a fingerprint scanner as well as an IR camera with Windows Hello support. Pricing starts at 1099 Euros. Envy 34” All-in-One The Envy line-up is also gaining a new gloriously large display. Coming with a 3440 x 1440 curved 34” display, the new AIO has a Kaby Lake processor, Radeon RX 460, 16 GB RAM and either a 1 TB HDD or 256 GB SSD. 4 USB 3.1, Thunderbolt 3 Type-C, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and SD card reader can be found. A Windows Hello compatible webcam is also included. Pricing starts at $1730. Omen X 35 Lastly, if it’s only a display you’re after, HP has got you covered with a 35” monitor with similar 3440 x 1440 resolution.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Front Page Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Front Page Sun, Jan 08, 2017 - Page 1　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp China semiconductor policy poses risk to US firms, White House report says Bloomberg China’s push to develop its domestic semiconductor technology threatens to harm US chipmakers and put the US’ national security at risk, US President Barack Obama’s administration said in a report that called for greater scrutiny of Chinese industrial policy. China’s goal to achieve a leadership position in semiconductor design and manufacturing, in part by spending US$150 billion over a 10-year period, requires an effective response to maintain US competitiveness in the industry, according to the report released on Friday. “We found that Chinese policies are distorting markets in ways that undermine innovation, subtract from US market share and put US national security at risk,” the US President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology said in the report. The warnings about China could give ammunition to US president-elect Donald Trump two weeks ahead of his swearing in. Since winning the election, Trump has backed up fiery campaign rhetoric toward China with a series of pronouncements on Twitter and the appointment of China hawks to key roles. “China has gained from global openness, but has been less committed to sustaining it — and, in some cases, has worked against it,” the White House report said. “Now, globally, more countries are questioning the benefits of economic openness — a trend that will shape, and be shaped by, how the United States responds to challenges in the semiconductor arena.” US industry leaders do not want Trump to engage in a standoff with China. Giving corporate tax breaks to US companies is the way Trump advocates bringing back jobs to the nation, according to Intel Corp chief executive officer Brian Krzanich. “The real answer is not a trade war, it’s not restrictions, it’s really about making the US more competitive,” Krzanich said on CNBC on Friday. “Lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here, that’s what will bring manufacturing back to the US,” he said. The council’s semiconductor working group includes several industry executives, such as former Intel chief executive officer Paul Otellini and Qualcomm Inc chairman Paul Jacobs. Foreign acquisitions of US businesses are routinely reviewed for national security risks by a panel of officials led by the US Department of the Treasury. That panel — the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US — has frustrated some Chinese investment in the US semiconductor industry. Last month, Obama blocked a Chinese company from buying the US business of Germany’s Aixtron SE, a semiconductor-equipment supplier. The White House report recommends a strategy for US policymakers that includes countering “innovation-inhibiting” Chinese industrial policy and improving the business environment for US chipmakers. It suggests broadening what is considered a national security risk as part of CFIUS reviews in certain circumstances, while also cautioning against blanket opposition to China’s advancement in the industry. US officials should also work with allies to strengthen global export controls, according to the report. The US has led the semiconductor industry since it took off in the 1960s. Companies such as Intel and Qualcomm have pushed the technical bounds of innovation in the US$300 billion market. In 2015, China did not have one company among the top 10 industry suppliers. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 4489 times. Comments will be moderated.

Amazon says it has given away more than a million bananas. (Greg Gilbert/The Seattle Times) At the big CES trade show, Consumer Technology Association chief Gary Shapiro says the industry isn’t at odds with the president-elect on everything, though most in Silicon Valley didn’t vote for him. Also: Amazon puts up some big numbers in the banana giveaway business. Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff The exhibit space at CES was filled this past week with the products of globalization. Televisions and computers, many produced cheaply on factory floors in East Asia, are on sale for a fraction of the price that caliber of technology would have cost decades ago. Conglomerates with global brand names detached from their country of origin dominate the show. Samsung. Lenovo. LG. Intel. Their supply chains, from Hanoi to Taipei to California, are designed for a world in which free trade is paramount, and goods and people cross borders with few hurdles. Yet the United States has elected a potential challenger to the order of things here: Donald Trump, who as a candidate criticized unfettered free trade and had some harsh words for China, the largest maker of consumer electronics. Most Read Stories Michael Bennett explodes at reporter following Seahawks-Falcons game Anti-Trumper John Kasich to doubters: I'm no lame duck Can’t make it to D.C.? Seattle will have own women’s march Man arrested after Bellevue mosque damaged in suspected arson  VIEW Seattle’s Mayor Murray kills city-run bike-share programUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Gary Shapiro, one of the chief lobbyists for the U.S. technology industry, isn’t worried. The president of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that puts on CES, said in an interview before the show that he’s upbeat about the prospects for his industry under the new administration. “The truth is Trump needs tech, and tech needs Trump,” he said. “There’s more of a parallel agenda than you would imagine.” Shapiro said he was heartened by the president-elect’s meeting with top U.S. technology executives last month, and particularly with Trump’s public embrace of innovation, among industry’s favorite buzzwords. Shapiro acknowledges that his optimistic tone runs contrary to the opinion of many of the rank-and-file within the U.S. technology industry, generally a socially liberal group. “It’s no secret that tech didn’t go overwhelmingly for Trump,” Shapiro said. “Some of that is social issues. Some of that is Clinton came out with a tech agenda, Trump didn’t.” Shapiro highlighted a few of his hopes for policies from the new administration. Lower taxes: Technology giants are the largest holders of cash abroad to avoid paying the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is among the highest in the world. Business lobbyists are hoping for a lower tax rate, or a window in which companies could repatriate cash held abroad at a special lower rate. Immigration reform: The technology industry relies on foreign guest workers, many of whom are in the country on H-1B visas. They’ve long lobbied for an increase in the cap on the number of people in that program, and Trump, Shapiro says, seems responsive to a bill that would do that. The Obama Administration had tied potential tweaks to guest worker visas to a broader overhaul of the U.S. immigration system. Less regulation: Executives at CTA member companies have told the lobbying group their No. 1 issue in Washington, D.C., is too much government regulation, Shapiro says. He attributes that to the requirements of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, as well as a Labor Department push to cover more workers with provisions like overtime pay and paid benefits. That, Shapiro says, runs counter to the wishes of the leaders of tech startups, which often feature irregular hours and don’t have much cash to work with. Meanwhile, larger companies, from on-demand ride-hailing service Uber to Microsoft, have structured their business in part on the use of contract workers rather than full time employees. As for the chance that a Trump-ignited trade war with China would undercut the model that put cheap television sets on the CES floor? Shapiro isn’t worried. “Obviously that’s not something that we would support,” he said. “Certainly we’re interested in having good trade deals. In terms of proposals to add import fees and things like that? I do think that what Trump is saying, is this is a tool we can use as a last resort, a bit of a penalty if they’re not playing by the rules.” — Matt Day: mday@seattletimes.com Yes, Amazon has bananas Like many Amazon.com ventures, the e-commerce behemoth’s attempt to keep Seattle pedestrians well supplied with free bananas came out of CEO Jeff Bezos’ imagination. And like book sales or the Prime loyalty program, the banana enterprise, too, has seen momentous growth since it launched in December 2015. Last November, Amazon’s “banistas” — as the people who staff the so-called “Community Banana Stand” program are known — handed out their one-millionth banana. Business certainly has ramped up. An initial run rate of 1,200 bananas a day from a single stand in South Lake Union has blossomed into an average of 4,500 bananas a day distributed at that stand and at an additional location next to Amazon’s new towers in the Denny Regrade. That’s 1.17 million bananas a year — or about 39 per Amazon employee, if one were to estimate that there are 30,000 Amazonians in the area. Of course, anyone can go there for a free banana, so that means about 2 bananas, per annum, for every Seattleite. Like many of Amazon’s famously-guarded metrics, the numbers generated by the banana stand remain somewhat shrouded in mystery. A video posted by Amazon l Thursday claims the banana stand “was originally conceived by Jeff Bezos.” But it didn’t say much else. When prompted for more details — why bananas, as opposed to any other fruit, for instance — Amazon simply responded: “Why not? Bananas are healthy and come with their own protective, easy to remove, compostable packaging.” They’re also popular: Consider that they’re the most popular item sold at Amazon archrival Wal-Mart, which moves 1 billion pounds per year. But not free. Amazon says its stands are open Monday through Friday, and staff will give free bananas to everyone. “Anyone can come off the street. employees, nonemployees, children, dogs,” a “banista” said in the Amazon video. — Ángel González, agonzalez@seattletimes.com Seattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

The Standard HOME NEWS OPINION BUSINESS SPORTS SHOWBITZ LIFESTYLE TOPICAL Other Sections The Standard Poll Motoring Real Estate Tech Visionaries Holiday Specials Quick Links Mobile Online Reader Supplements The Standard About Advertise Contact Subscribe Advertisement Home   /   OPINION   /   Columns The Bright Side of Smart-Home Silly Season posted January 08, 2017 at 12:01 am by  Bloomberg By Leonid Bershidsky THE Internet of Things is one of the gadget industry’s brightest hopes in a world that’s saturated with smartphones. Sensors are cheap, and digital giants such as Amazon and Google are aggressively pushing their voice-command technology. The resulting hype, however, spawns inventions that should only exist in the corny worlds of science fiction. At this point, the IoT market isn’t well-quantified. Intel says there were 15 billion connected IoT devices in the world in 2015—a number the chipmaker predicts will increase to 200 billion by 2020. Gartner, the tech consultancy, counted fewer than 5 billion devices in 2015 and predicted fewer than 21 billion by 2020. There’s a good reason for the gap: No one can predict which objects consumers and businesses will want to connect to the internet. So businesses are trying nearly everything, and showing it off this week at The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: •     GeniCan: scans empty cereal boxes, reorders them through an app. •     FridgeCam: sends photos to your phone, helps write grocery lists. •     Catspad: dispenses food and water for a full month through an app, tracks kitty caloric intake. •     Sleep Number 360: a bed that tracks your sleep and, of course, sends the data to an app. •     U: a shower that, you guessed it, is controlled with an app. •     A line of “smart” home appliances from Samsung, including a touchscreen fridge that responds to voice commands and app-governed cooktops, washer-dryers and vacuum cleaners. •     A connected lawnmower (the app is for maintenance purposes and for ordering parts) and a tool chest you can lock and unlock with an app. •     A hairbrush from L’Oreal that measures “hair health” and reports it to an app that will recommend treatments. •     A kind of Amazon Echo for kids, from toymaker Mattel, that can read your kid bedtime stories. That’s 10 new apps for your smartphone right there, for objects you never imagined could—or indeed should—be connected to the internet. These things are supposed to improve how you brush your hair and shop for groceries. But aren’t these solemn chores what helps keep us human? Besides: will your cat’s welcome be as warm after it realizes a robot—not you—feeds it three times a day? Will you miss your child’s call in the middle of the night when she opts for a plastic gadget to read her a fairy tale? This is how capitalism works, of course. People will offer things for sale in the hope other people will buy them, and if there’s no market, these objects will just disappear. On the other hand, as major companies adopt some of these offerings, they will soon become mainstream just because they will be pushed on consumers with the help of billion-dollar marketing budgets. Then, expect botnets of smart fridges and hacked smart showers that scald you just for fun. One of the devices presented at CES this year is a special router that monitors the security of every connected device in the home, which seems wise after a hack brought the internet to a standstill for millions in October. It is only a matter of time before these gadgets must also defend against waves of “targeted” ads based on your ketchup consumption and the little one’s zeal for Maurice Sendak. That will be a dystopian world. I, for one, will steer clear of all these “smart” objects while “dumb” ones are still sold. An internet-connected device that solves a real problem is the rarest of rarities at this point. But I won’t deny that it’s also heartwarming that people are designing some of these things, and adventurous consumers are trying them out. That’s mostly because of the voice features, based in many cases on Amazon’s Alexa. Amazon has put the voice assistant in the cloud, allowing manufacturers to keep devices simple and cheap: all they need to do is record voice commands, send them off, and receive responses. The more Alexa is used in the weirdest contexts, the better it recognizes complex or badly formulated commands and the more it learns of the endless diversity of human life.  It’s good for the technology—which has many legitimate uses, from making driving safer to increasing the accessibility of services to disabled people—that some of us are willing to have regular conversations about with their fridge.

Sleep. MORE’s skepticism of the Intelligence Community’s findings on Russian election interference has raised fears among experts that Trump will bypass intel analysts and demand that his personal team conduct its own analyses of raw data.    Tossing aside career analysts can create false conclusions, critics warn — like the George W. Bush administration’s incorrect assessment that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).    “The risk is that you request raw data to support a conclusion and you avoid seeing anything that contradicts it,” Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffWasserman Schultz confronted Comey about Russian hacking Trump’s CIA pick enters the fray Dem rep rips Trump: ‘Isn’t this how book burning begins?’ MORE (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told The Hill. “We can already see we have a president-elect who has difficulty with facts that are at odds with the narrative that he wants to tell or diminish his achievements.”   ADVERTISEMENT Presidents receive so-called “raw intelligence” all the time — recordings, satellite images and other data that hasn’t been evaluated and contextualized by career analysts. But there is also plenty of precedent for a president who wants to cherry-pick information to advance his own policies.    Onlookers doubt that the firebrand president-elect is likely to sift through data himself, but they are worried he will send a team of loyalists to go through the information and brief him themselves.    In a Trump White House, that could be anyone from retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s pick for national security advisor, to Steve Bannon, the incoming White House chief strategist.    The problem with sending political appointees in to do the job of career analysts, intelligence experts say, is that they won’t know what information is significant and what should be discarded.    “Bannon is certainly the kind of person who would want to do that but that would be a disaster,” said Mieke Eoyang, a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who is now vice president of Third Way’s national security program.   “He has no idea how to weight the credibility of sources or understand them in the context of what’s likely or not likely in a geopolitical sense,” she said. “He would just be grasping at straws.”   Critics also see Flynn as a dangerous conduit. The former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) head has famously pushed conspiracy theories on Twitter, and was known at the agency for making dubious assertions with little basis in documented fact.   Subordinates at the DIA reportedly compiled a list of what they called “Flynn facts” — nuggets of false information that Flynn would present as true.   Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied that either official would conduct an independent review of the current IC’s assessment of Russian hacking during the election.   "Not true — and frankly wouldn’t make sense — he just named Tom Bossert who this would fall under,” Spicer said in an email to The Hill.    Spicer did not reply when asked whether Bossert — who will be assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism — might do so.    The dynamic described by Schiff and others would not be new. Critics accused the Bush administration of manipulating intelligence to support the war in Iraq, which is now widely condemned.   Senior Bush officials famously embraced raw intelligence derived from a low-level Iraqi defector known as “Curveball” who became the key source underpinning their assessment that Iraq had WMDs — ultimately the basis on which the U.S. went to war.    But intelligence officials reportedly had concerns from the beginning that Curveball was not reliable, and his intel was ultimately widely discredited.   “Let's keep in mind the fact that this war's going to happen regardless of what Curveball said or didn't say, and that the Powers That Be probably aren't terribly interested in whether Curveball knows what he's talking about,” the deputy chief of the CIA’s Iraqi Task Force wrote to a Defense Department agent who wanted to warn then-Secretary of State Colin Powell about relying on Curveball.    Bush also created a Defense Department office called the Office of Strategic Influence — now disbanded — to influence policy-makers by feeding hand-picked information to foreign news agencies.    A 2007 report from the Pentagon’s inspector general found that the office “developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaeda relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.”   There are also parallels to the clandestine Iran-Contra affair under Ronald Reagan’s administration, although the comparison is not perfect. In that case, experts say, the White House attempted to take control of an intelligence operation, not information.   “The prospect of cherry-picking your facts is one that ought to concern people,” Schiff said.    Eoyang went a step further.    “Americans lose their lives fighting for something that’s a lie. And that is the danger of cherry-picking,” she said.    Other former IC officials are more circumspect.    Every president has a different way of absorbing intelligence and there is always an adjustment period after Jan. 20, many say.    If Trump wants to receive raw intelligence directly, former CIA officer Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) said, “That is not a problem.”    “That is a sign that the principal is willing to engage in the process and not just get glossed-over assessments,” he noted. “I recognize people have some concerns, but you gotta wait to see when it actually happens.”   And healthy skepticism of intelligence assessments is a critical component to a functioning White House-IC relationship, career professionals argue.    But, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told lawmakers on Thursday, “there’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement.”    Trump has been outspoken in criticizing the IC’s findings in its probe into Russian interference in the election, tweeting that “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.”   He called the controversy surrounding the hacks a “witch hunt” carried out by defeated Democrats in an interview with The New York Times on Friday morning.    After receiving a classified briefing on the matter by senior officials Friday afternoon, Trump issued a statement saying he has “tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of [the IC],” but declined to say he believed their assessment regarding Russia.    Trump transition team vice chair Rudy Giuliani last week called President Obama’s intelligence on Russian hacking “politicized” and suggested that Trump, “when he becomes President Trump, have his own intelligence people do their own report.”   “It is totally okay for presidents to receive and to ask for raw intelligence reports,” former CIA director Michael Morrell told The Hill in an email, noting that he gave a lot of raw intelligence to Bush when he briefed him.   But, he says, “The issue is not whether POTUS receives raw intelligence. The issue is whether that becomes a substitute for the analysis. That is what would be bad.”   Right now, according to Spicer, the president is receiving both raw data and analysis from his national security team.    “There are two types of briefings — the PBD [Presidential Daily Briefing] is raw data, which the president elect receives three times a week. He receives every day a security update [from his national security team] that is more an analysis of that data, and recommendations of policies or actions he may or may not want to take when he assumes office,” Spicer said this week on the transition call.   But Spicer’s description is unclear. The PBD is normally an analyzed summary of high-level intelligence, not just raw data.    “It sounds like when Spicer says ‘raw data,’ he means ‘intelligence,’ and when he says ‘security update,’ he means the policy/current events/political implications briefing that should come from agencies that have responsibility for doing things (State, Defense, CIA, DHS),” Eoyang said in an email.    “That Spicer mangles the difference is a problem,” she notes.    If Trump does try to circumvent career intelligence professionals, Schiff says, “There’s not much that you can do.”   “The commander in chief gets to choose how he wants intelligence conveyed to him.” Tags Donald Trump, Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

In the Google realm, that means we’ve seen plenty of new Android phones, Chromebooks, wearables, and more. But CES is always a matter of finding the diamonds in the rough. There are always some impressive announcements, but the vast majority of things we’ve seen this week have been either mundane or old news. That’s why we’ve done the work for you. Follow after the break to get a peek at our picks for the best Android, Chrome and Google-related products that debuted at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show… Best Android Wear watch: New Balance RunIQ Our first award is for the best Android Wear watch of the show, and we were actually surprised to find that there were a couple new watches announced this week. The new Casio watch (which is definitely the runner-up in this category) builds on what that company launched last year, but our pick for the best Android Wear device of the show goes to the new New Balance RunIQ. It’s the first Android Wear watch made specifically for running, and it’s only the third or fourth Android Wear watch made for fitness (succeeding the Moto 360 Sport, the Sony SmartWatch 3, and the more recent Polar M600). As we mentioned in our hands-on, there’s nothing too special about the watch, but it does run Android Wear 2.0 and does just about everything that a fitness smartwatch should — it tracks heart rate, steps, speed, calories, distance, and more. It was definitely a close fight with Casio for this watch, but we were won over by the New Balance’s availability timeline (it’s going to hit store shelves early next month), value (it’s more affordable at $300), its running-specific features (never seen that in an Android Wear watch before!) and its generally refined take on what a fitness smartwatch powered by Android Wear should be. The demo at the Intel booth showing just how accurately the watch tracked fitness stats was also impressive. Best Android smartphone: ZenFone AR CES is always home to the launch of many an Android phone, and this year we saw a few notable launches. ZTE and LG hit the show floor with some budget options, Huawei launched the Mate 9 in the United States with Amazon Alexa, and Xiaomi showed off the white version of the Mi Mix made for outside the US. The one standout of the show for us, however, was the ASUS ZenFone AR. And ASUS’ other new phone, the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom, was also a top contender. ASUS has made the Zenfone AR the first Android smartphone to hit the United States with an option for 8GB of RAM, and the phone packs the powerful Snapdragon 821, which isn’t the latest Qualcomm chip but definitely a great one. But for us at 9to5Google, the ZenFone AR stands out for one reason: it’s made to work with Google’s Tango AR platform. That platform is definitely still growing for now, as we’ve noted, but it has a lot of potential. We saw the Lenovo PHAB2 Pro in the summer and fall of last year, but that device was just too big — and frankly its software too horrendous — for us to wholeheartedly recommend it as a consumer product. This phone is different. It does Tango, it has a much more reasonable physical size, and its software is definitely closer to being a polished user experience. Oh, and it supports Daydream. Really, the only downside for us at this year’s CES is that we weren’t actually able to see the Tango features in action quite yet. Be did, however, get some really nice photos and video — so check that out. Best Chromebook: Samsung Chromebook Pro/Plus Chromebooks have felt like they’ve been on the backburner for the last year, but thankfully CES 2017 brought a few new Chromebooks for us to get our grubby (literally, CES isn’t the cleanest place in the world) hands on. Of those, we saw the ASUS Chromebook Flip 2 (an honorable mention!), but the star of the show was a pair of new Chromebooks from Samsung. Somewhat confusingly called the Chromebook Pro and the Chromebook Plus, the two laptops are identical apart from their processors. We picked these Chromebooks because they are the Chromebooks we’ve always wanted. As we said, they breathe new life into Chrome OS. All products have compromises, but these two sleek laptops from Samsung have the least compromises of any Chromebook ever. They have a solid build, the Pro has a very powerful processor (for a Chromebook), they touch screens that flip around to be used like a tablet, they sport USB-C ports (welcome to 2017!), they rock Android apps without a hitch, and they even have styluses. Really, the only compromise is probably going to be their price tags (the Plus is starting at $449, and the higher-end Pro is TBD), but I think we can forgive that for the purpose of this award — prices will surely fall over the coming year. Best Android TV: Nvidia Shield TV and Spot Android TV is another platform that was been largely ignored in 2016, so it’s good to see it get a little attention at CES this year. The OEM that gave it that attention was Nvidia, a company that is becoming known for more and more products that aren’t desktop graphics cards. And the product that this company launched this year is the latest Nvidia Shield TV, a little (seriously, it’s unexpectedly tiny) Android TV set-top box that can do a lot more than just play little games from the Play Store and Netflix. Here at 9to5Google we’re big fans of Google Assistant, so the Nvidia Shield TV being the first Android TV device to get Google’s new helper was a big reason we went with this device. For just $199 (pre-orders now open on Amazon!), the Shield supports streaming 4K HDR content from a variety of services like Amazon and Netflix, and there are even hundreds of console-quality games waiting for you on Shield store. Another big reason we went with this device, however, is the new $49 Shield Spot that launched alongside the Shield. It extends Google Assistant throughout your home with a tiny little device that you can just pop into an outlet.

It directly accuses RT and Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan of links to the Kremlin. Simonyan was quick to mock the report as “shallow,” failing to name the sources and based on dated and/or false intelligence. "Dear CIA! Nothing of what you wrote here holds any water. In 2001, I was 21 and was covering Crimean elections. Back in those days, pro-Russian sentiment there was as high as always. My two-week stint over, it didn’t go anywhere. Consider this. We have Sputnik branches working across the former Soviet Union. They are run by my deputy and onetime boyfriend Andrei Blagodyrenko. I offered him the job after we broke up. It was on his guard that Sputnik's popularity there went through the roof in fresh proof of the well-known fact that Russian propaganda is made in bed. Consider this. I’ve had several meetings with Julian Assange – a hard fact, CCTV cameras outside the Ecuadorean embassy in London can attest to. We met in London. Consider this. © Sputnik/ Evgeny Biyatov RT Simply Reports on Events in US - Editor-in-Chief on Clapper's ClaimsIn 2013, RT became the first news channel ever to get 1 billion views on YouTube. Looks like YouTube users worldwide already had their accounts all hacked by Russian net runners, because if they hadn’t then how come so many people are ready to buy what 'Russian propaganda' tells them? Consider this. [First Deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian Presidential Administration] Alexei Gromov is really my contact in the Kremlin. We often see each other, sometimes at a bar. I prefer German beer, he goes for Russian vodka. Consider this. Once he gave me a basket of mushrooms. Then a State Department staffer dropped by to enjoy a plateful of fried mushrooms, which I made him believe was a traditional Russian delicacy. Consider this. A year ago we showed that after they retired, Obama and Kerry would be watching RT at home and crying. This video is available online. Consider this. And last but not least, at the tender age of 15 I went to study in the US as part of a school exchange program paid for by US taxpayers. Donald Trump was a very big taxpayer then. Consider this too," Simonyan wrote in her livejournal. © AP Photo/ Andrew Harnik Obama Failed to Prove Alleged Russian Cyberattacks Impacted US ElectionThe report, jointly prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, also accused RT and Sputnik of “consistently casting President-elect Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets subservient to a corrupt political establishment.” “We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,” the CIA/FBI/NSA report claimed.

It is the majority of western media and the US government that have to look themselves in the mirror.

If this is illegal, then it is Russia itself that has a way stronger case against US interference and meddling in its affairs and elections. I suspect that the amount of such acts perpetrated by the US, and sheer volume of supporting data would be so huge, that Russia would probably need a new government agency staffed with thousands of workers working round-the-clock for years to compile it all.

Saying they would be "canned" simply means they would be fired. But, "caning" them, would imply beating them on the back of the legs with a cane, like what happens in Singapore for chewing gum on the subway.

Since you have a good handle on how the Washington political elites operate, may I be so honest as an American to let you know that a solid majority of our citizens know only one word for these people: 'assholes' ! BTW, the CIA Chief doesn't even know the history of an agency that he has worked in for 40 years. In particular one of the most devious assaults on the free press orchestrated by the OSS and the CIA was called 'Operation Mockingbird'. The elites want a 'dumbed down, numbed out' population.

Amazing and extremely competent woman! Moreover, with an incredible sense of (very good ) humor! Great response to the obvious bad guys in this "movie", I loved it! RT and Sputnik are my two main sources of information, because of their focus on facts and the truth. That is what we the readers/spectators, people in general, deserve, after all. That is what more and more people every single day on this planet are looking for, as the MSM lies and real propaganda are collapsing at a pace never before witnessed! I'd say at the same pace as the Western mainstream in general, from politics to science, and everything else, is collapsing. Too many lies, for far too long, that's what's causing their own collapse from the inside! No need for any external/foreigner influence, they are shooting themselves in their own shoes every single time they insist on the same biased, "matrix"-like kind of narrative. In the end I guess some of them even believe that parallel universe type of bubble where they seem to live. Anyway, thank you RT, thank you Sputnik, for a fantastic work you have been doing since you exist. A great help for many people that look for the real news about the real world where we live!

I think about what our world leaders do to represent their countrymen -so I ask "Who do these politician's answer to? They are allegedly appointed by the people to represent the people but what is the result? Our politicians protect corporations like Monsanto in our courts to continue poisoning the world, they cover up and refuse to prosecute the CDC for knowingly injecting millions of people with live cancer virus. Now lets compare and contrast -Look at Vladimir Putin, he has banned all Genetically Modified Foods in Russia and has already taken steps to becoming the world's largest supplier of organic food, apparently President Putin is a true representative of the Russian people, our country needs a real leader like him and the people have spoken. We will not bite George Soros's attempts to divide and conquer America via BLM, there will not be a gated community in the world in 5 years that will hide these people, we will not forget their atrocities to humanity. It is time we all confront these people, the following is a letter I wrote to President Obama a few days ago and a good idea is to 'CC' other world leaders in the email so these confrontations can be witnessed. I suggest other people follow on and do the same... So here is what I wrote; President Obama, Do you not feel stupid? You throw out all of our diplomatic relationships with Russia and what does the Russian President do in return? He treats you like a child that enters the room when adults are talking and ignores your baseless claims, and if you truly represent the American People Barry then you would show unwavering evidence of these claims to all of the American people. You have to actually coerce people that your agenda is the best thing going but now the progress of dumbing down the sheeple was not fast enough to usher in this agenda because Bush already blew the coup with "Weapons of Mass Destruction" We are evolving faster than the countermeasures to oppress, you can not run into a room full of light and turn on a darklight. ODNI, James Clapper, Michael Flynn, Gen Mattis basically any honorable Military man or Police officer does not believe this BS allegation that Russia has been interfering with our politics by hacking the elections. Hahaha the best CNN could come up with was hacking a VT power station, do not make me laugh the American people will not bite the rhetoric anymore. First of all -the job of every foreign intelligence agency is to collect data on its competitors, but you still can not link them to being involved in our democratic election process.

Scott Applewhite Politics 17:36 07.01.2017(updated 21:43 07.01.2017) Get short URL 324026543 On Thursday, US President Barack Obama received a report from the US Intelligence Community regarding purported evidence of Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere with the US election system. However, even before the report was submitted to the president, Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham proposed expanding anti-Russian sanctions. Just Business McCain and Graham have gained a reputation as hardline anti-Russian politicians in the US establishment. Their recent idea of new sanctions against Russia is logical part of their political course. Recently, they visited Ukraine and NATO, as part of a campaign to build bridges between those countries and the alliance. © AP Photo/ Matt Rourke Why Obama's Farewell Sanctions are Actually a 'New Year's Gift' to TrumpMcCain and Graham are representatives of "military clans" making good money on bills endorsed by the senators, according to Sergei Sudakov, a professor at the Academy of Military Sciences. The expert suggested that after Donald Trump inauguration as US president the US military lobby may change its leaders. McCain and Graham are now trying to secure leverage on the next US presidential administration. "In the US establishment, the two senators are known for their hardline anti-Russian stance. They have established relations with military clans and arms suppliers. As a result, if they want to establish a lobbyist group in Congress, then it would be very difficult to lift sanctions against Russia," Sudakov told RT. Experts also suggest that such measures are aimed at enabling bargaining with Trump on different issues of the military lobby. US-Russia Thaw Likely to Ruin the Plan © REUTERS/ James Lawler Duggan Kerry Hopes Trump Can Fix Relations With RussiaHowever, the duo is likely to face hurdles in promoting their initiatives in Congress and the House of Representatives. In order to achieve their goals, they will have to win support from the leadership of the Republican-dominated Congress. However, Congress is expected to cooperate with Donald Trump in the near future, said Vladimir Vasilyev, a senior analyst at the Institute for US and Canadian Studies. "If there is a considerable normalization between Washington and Moscow plans by McCain and Graham will not have a serious impact," he said in an interview with RT. According to the expert, the recent proposal by the two senators could even help Trump and boost his positions in talks with Russia. Hysteria Over 'Russian Hackers' © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes WikiLeaks: US Intel Report on Russia Hacking 'Has Poor Sourcing and No Evidence'On January 4, CIA chief John Brennan said that there is clear evidence to Russia’s alleged interference with the US election system. A joint statement made by US intelligence, the US Cyber Command and the Pentagon read that Russia is a serious cyber-threat to the US government, its military and diplomatic infrastructure. At the same time, even famous hackers describe the allegations against Russia as absurd. In particular, Romanian hacker Marcel Lehel Lazar, known as Guccifer, says the claims are a fake. © AP Photo/ Seth Perlman US Intel Report Says Hacked Election Systems Were Uninvolved in Vote TallySpeaking from prison in a Wednesday interview with Fox News, Lazar stressed that the allegations are "a fake cyber war" and that there is "hysteria" in the US regarding Russia stemming from the Cold War era. Experts suggest that not all the facts and details on the issue will be declassified. If the evidence base of the report was made public then Moscow would be able to provide its arguments to rebuff the allegations. But this is not what the US intelligence community wants. "If the report stays classified Russia can be blamed for everything," Sudakov noted. Obama’s Role © AFP 2016/ NICHOLAS KAMM Lame Duck's Last Steps: This is How Obama Wants to Complicate Life for TrumpOn Thursday, an intelligence report on the issue was submitted to President Obama. According to experts, before quitting politics Barack Obama wants to engage maximum efforts to complicate further dialogue between the Trump administration and the Kremlin. The allegations of "Russia-sponsored hacker attacks" on the US electoral system is big part of the plan, especially taking into account the fact that they relate directly to Trump and his victory in the election. Moreover, Obama still cannot put up with Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the election. "He should have accepted the fact. One should understand that politics is changing and the world is different today. In this context, claims about 'Russian hackers' are a way to ignore the fact that the world has changed and the US is changing," Sudakov pointed out. Transformation In his actions, Obama relies on the logic of politics. Trump is an advocate of the logic of economy. The president-elect is set to normalize ties with Russia, including lifting sanctions. At least, such an assumption can be taken from his statements. Sanctions are damaging to the US economy, and as a businessman, Trump can clearly see that. "The current economic situation is not good for the US. Sanctions are harmful for US business. They create additional opportunities for other countries, including China. The US business establishment has repeatedly doubted the efficiency of sanctions," Vasilyev said. Trump’s approach is shared by many Americans. According to Sudakov, over 90 percent of US decision makers are not interested in keeping sanctions against Russia in place. ...

It is the usual Crimean War scenario but with the added horror of American churches wishing to expand their real estate and "not-for-profit" hospital and nursing home charities into other countries which are, as usual, fronts for gunrunning and dopedealing and sex slave trading. Plus how can senators get kickbacks for facilitating huge arms maufacturing deals if there is no war? Senator McCrazy who views Americans as his personal slaves created for his own amusement may refer to US citizenry as Hobbits but to me he is what drops out of Smaug's butt every time the dragon eats something disagreeable with its digestion. If he wants a war, let him and his fellow fat, decrepit, noon-sleeping comrades in Congress suit up to fight that war personally.

They receive more money from AIPAC, The arms industry and Wall Street than the other senators and representatives in USA. That is why they are more vocal than the others in connection with Israel and war mongering. The process of corruption of senators and representatives in USA is as follows. The American working class pay taxes to the government. The Senators and Representatives vote money for Israel and lucrative contracts for the arm industry. To thank the Senators and the representatives who vote the money for them, Israel, through AIPAC, and the arms industry distribute money to the Senators and representatives. It is a win win situation for the Senators and representatives on one side and Israel and the arms industry on the other side. It does not matter who are voted senators and representatives, they all follow the same route. They all accept money from Israel and the arms industry and they all vote money for Israel and lucrative contracts for the arms industry. The losers in this corruption game are the American working class who pay the taxes. Reply Gospel 03:01 10.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete Russia China are emerging global powers: economically, militarily, technologically amongst many other critical things. USs share of global market will be reduced dramatically when these 2 giants mature not to mention India and a few others. That's why all these concerted and aggressive fabrications against Russia to contain that resurgence by demonization. China on the other hand is currently heavily tied to US and global economy, so they are not as aggressive towards her as yet. This US view is very exceptional as they believe only they have exclusivity over the entire world market in all its facets. Reply malcholmh 05:25 12.01.2017 | 0 | Edit | Delete Swamp creature. Some are democrats, some are republicans. Same old crap they always spew. People who spend their whole lives in washington are owned. Lock, stock and barrel.

For 60 years they have been doing, among other things, just what they are accusing Russia of doing and now that it is alleged that it is happening to them, the whole world is turned upside down to invoke empathy etc. Cry baby, Cry!
