Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Intel Intel’s insanely fast new Optane SSDs are finally shipping Mike Wehner @MikeWehner April 24th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet The biggest advancement in data storage technology to date has undoubtedly been the shift from disc-based hard drives to solid-state. SSDs are faster, with no moving parts, and generate less heat while also typically being considerably smaller than their platter-based counterparts. SSDs are already a step up in almost every way, but Intel decided it just wasn’t happy with the way solid state technology was headed, and somehow managed to one-up the rest of the industry with an SSD that is faster than pretty much anything else on the market, and now they’re shipping. Don't Miss: Apple’s actual iPhone 8 design may have just leaked for the first time The Intel Optane P4800X is the first product from the company to utilize the new 3D XPoint memory technology. It utilizes a PCIe slot, and has a capacity of 375GB, but other sizes ranging from 750GB to 1.5TB have already been confirmed by Intel as being in the pipeline for 2017 releases. It’s significantly faster than NAND-based flash storage with a small fraction of the latency, and while it’s slower than DRAM, it’s also ten times more dense. The new drive technology is also a whole lot more durable and, unlike flash data storage, 3D XPoint won’t physically degrade the storage media, allowing it to be written upon many more times than NAND-based drives without as much concern for overall drive health. So, Intel’s Optane drives are awesome and way faster, longer-lasting, and better than SSDs… but you knew there had to be a catch. All this cutting edge technology doesn’t come cheap, and if you were considering picking up a P4800X for your own rig you should know that it’s primarily designed for data center use and, due to its price, it’s pretty much only an option for enterprise applications, at least for now. The debut drive will set you back a cool $1,520, and for just 375GB of storage, that’s not exactly budge-friendly. Still, the technology is extremely promising and will surely find its way to home computers before too long.

While it’s limited to Kaby Lake processors and 200-series motherboards, this launch of a fundamentally new type of memory should offer significant performance improvements in at least some workloads. Early reviews, however, don’t entirely bear that out. Intel isn’t offering Optane as a full SSD option yet, but you can order 16GB or 32GB drives for $44 or $77 (MSRP). Intel supports these drives as cache options via Intel SRT (Smart Response Technology). This isn’t a new feature from Intel; SRT has been supported on small SSD cache drives for at least five years, and Intel’s Optane drives appear to offer commensurate benefits to an SSD cache drive when used in an equivalent configuration. Anandtech, Ars Technica, Hot Hardware, and Tech Report have all taken Optane out for a spin, with varying results. Most of the early reviews on Optane are, at best, cautiously optimistic. Anandtech’s sample failed too quickly for them to be comfortable giving a final verdict, though they do note impressive performance improvements for small transfer sizes and low queue depths. In multiple cases, workloads on a conventional HDD + Optane were accelerated to SSD-equivalent levels. Windows boot times also shrank dramatically, at least once cache training had been performed (Hot Hardware has benchmarks that address this acceleration, specifically, one of which is shown below). Data and graph by Hot Hardware This mirrors what we’ve seen from other types of caching in the past. Re-running a workload multiple times trains the cache solution to expect that workload in the future. Limited appeal One issue no one’s happy with is Intel’s decision to limit Optane to Kaby Lake CPUs in 200-series chipsets. SSD caches (and Optane caches) would be most effective if deployed as acceleration in lower-cost systems or older hardware. Intel’s decision to sandbox their platform to only the latest motherboards and CPUs means the computers that could benefit the most from Optane acceleration aren’t eligible to use it. It’s also telling the platforms Intel shipped for Optane testing literally preclude comparing it with its most logical competitor. As we’ve previously stated, Optane should be compared against SSD drive caching, but the B250 motherboards that Intel provided literally only support Optane caching. If you try to configure the software to cache via SSD instead, it refuses to do so. For that, you need a Z270 motherboard, and that’s one reason we don’t have Optane figures ourselves today. The appropriate configuration to test against is the configuration that should serve as Intel’s primary competitor. Optane is quite quick, in the right circumstances. Image and data by Tech Report But any comparison of SSD-versus-Optane pricing drives home that this isn’t 2012. Back then, it made sense to buy into SSD cache drives, particularly if you wanted to add SSD-like performance to an existing rig without giving up the much larger capacities of a hard drive. Today, SSD prices have fallen so much that you can buy a 256GB SSD for the same cost as a 32GB Optane cache (~$77). While we aren’t claiming that the performance benefits of an SSD cache are equivalent or exactly matched to those of an Optane cache, look through the slideshow from our 2012 review against any of the reviews above, and you’ll see many of the same performance improvements — with the aforementioned exception of Optane’s low queue depth performance, which really is exceptional compared with SSDs. SSD cache drives have found limited adoption in low-end desktops and laptops, but the higher power consumption of Optane when in standby (it consumes roughly 1W compared to ~.1W for SSDs) may make it a non-starter in the mobile market. SSD prices may rise this year, so Optane caches may become more compelling, but it’s unclear there’s a great consumer performance argument here just yet. Idle power consumption. Image and data by Anandtech In and of itself, this isn’t really a problem. It’s easy to forget now, but when the first consumer SSDs began to hit the market, they didn’t exactly cover themselves in glory, either. The earliest SSDs were ludicrously expensive, tiny, and couldn’t even match spinning magnetic media on certain workloads due to poor random read/write performance. Optane clearly has data center capabilities and superior consumer performance may arrive with future generations. But as of today, we agree with Ars Technica’s Peter Bright, who writes: Rather than showcasing the new capabilities that 3D XPoint brings to the table, it simply highlights how wretched Intel’s product segmentation is. It’s at best an incremental improvement over SRT, and for the money, most people are probably going to be better off with a plain flash SSD than a hybrid disk anyway. 3D XPoint may yet turn out to be something good, perhaps even something world-changing. But this ain’t it. Not everyone calls Optane out quite that harshly — Hot Hardware allows that the caching solution “may make sense” in certain configurations, but virtually all of the review coverage agrees that limited storage options and Intel’s segmentation decisions sharply limit Optane’s addressable market. Intel’s decision to ship a test platform that prohibited the most logical comparison point to make against its own hardware also doesn’t say much for the company’s confidence in its own performance.

When Microsoft discusses its Windows 10 operating system, it is usually talking about some cool feature it added that Xbox on Windows 10 gamers will love. HP, Lenovo and Dell are all still fighting for the top spot on PC sales charts. Their line-ups always include gaming laptops with processor upgrades and looks that are very different from the rest of what they sell. Gaming is more lifestyle than activity at this point. When you choose to play games on a PC, you’re choosing a very different hardware experience from what others have. Buyers of gaming laptops care about what ports are on their PC. They want to know that they’ll have the best visuals possible for their games. The best gaming laptops offer plenty of storage, RAM, a discrete GPU and great display.   Read: 6 Best Windows 10 Laptops in 2017 Of course, every piece of technology worth buying involves compromise. In exchange for better visuals, buyers of gaming laptops have to make do with things others wouldn’t stomach. Because graphics are a huge concern, laptop makers have to stuff additional hardware into a device that’s still portable. They also need to account for features that they wouldn’t otherwise have to. For example, backlit keyboards are inside expensive laptops meant for productivity too. Where portable gaming machines differ is color. Backlit gaming laptops have keys that offer more than one color. The software installed on them lets gamers change their hue. The best gaming laptops all struggle to balance high-performance hardware that allows you to play video games at any resolution, style and extra features that you’ll love. What Makes for the Best Gaming Laptops? All gaming PCs are a compromise. Because of this, it can be difficult to figure out which of them is the best for you. You’ll need to decide which features you want and which features you can live without. You’ll need to look at the extra features that each offers and how those features fit into your lifestyle. Read: 5 Best PC Gaming Keyboards What are Backlit Keys? Backlit keys are seriously popular with laptop users. They allow users to see what keys their fingers are on in the dark. The more sophisticated gaming laptops have lights under each key that can change color or be turned off. Basically, you use the system to get an at-a-glance look at where your fingers should be when playing your favorites. The software that controls backlit keys is installed at the factory. Every PC maker offers backlit keys with gaming customization. Expect these systems to cost more. What are the Best Processors for Gaming? Figuring out which processor is best for your gaming laptop is crucial. The most powerful processors that you can find will harm your battery life, but give you the horsepower that you need to play games that heavily depend on a CPU at higher settings. Intel Core i7 processors offer the best experience possible. The truth is that you don’t absolutely need an Intel Core i7 processor to get a great gaming experience. Intel Core i5 processors are great for gaming too. What’s more, you shouldn’t find yourself as constrained by battery life as you would with a Core i7. You don’t have to have an Intel processor at all, actually. You can save some money by going with an AMD processor instead of an Intel processor. The same games will work on either. Dell, for example, charges $150 less for its AMD gaming laptops than it does Intel models. What are the Best GPUs for Gaming? As for the best graphics processors for gaming, laptops are constrained. Stay away from any PC that has Intel HD or Intel IRIS graphics only. These are integrated GPUs, not discrete GPUs, which is what you need. Ideally, your graphics processor will have at least 4GB of dedicated RAM. The Best Gaming Features Backlit keyboards, GPUs and processors are important. There are other things to keep in mind though. Before deciding on a machine, look for details about how much it weighs. After all, you’re probably interested in gaming laptops because you want a portable setup. Make sure you are comfortable with the weight of your new machine. Second, pay close attention to the resolution of the display inside the laptop you buy. Gaming on an HD display requires less horsepower than gaming on a 4K display. As with any laptop, make sure you have all the right ports for connecting to your mouse, monitor, headset and other accessories. 5 Best Gaming Laptops in 2017 Razer Blade Lenovo Legion Y520 Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Razer Blade Stealth Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base New Razer Blade - $1,899   1 / 5 Made by the same company that produces the Razer gaming mice, keyboards and headset, the Razer Blade is an expensive top-of-the-line gaming laptop.

This programme allows Santa Clara residents and businesses to purchase 100% solar and wind energy from SVP. Through its 12,810MWh purchase of wind energy, Great America is now one of the largest purchases of renewable energy in the programme. This annual clean energy purchase is similar to the output of four large-scale wind turbines – reducing Great America’s carbon footprint from electricity use by over 7 million pounds of carbon dioxide each year. “We are thrilled about Great America’s participation in Santa Clara Green Power,” said Larry Owens, SVP Senior Division Manager of Customer Services. “Their renewable energy commitment will place them among the top echelon of Silicon Valley’s environmental leaders and make it the first Northern California amusement park of its kind to choose 100% renewable energy.” SunPower installs 21 solar systems at Macy’s locations A 2.25MW SunPower solar system on the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s Fulfillment Center in Joppa, Maryland. Source: PR Newswire 21 April: Several Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s retailers are now sporting SunPower solar systems to generate clean energy at their facilities. As part of a company-wide sustainability initiative, 21 high-efficiency SunPower solar systems were installed this past year at the retailers in seven states; totalling 15MW of solar. Nineteen of the 21 new systems feature the SunPower Helix Roof product, the world's first fully-integrated rooftop solar solution for commercial customers. Macy's financed the majority of the SunPower solar systems on its stores through PPAs, allowing it to buy power at competitive rates that act as a hedge against future utility rate increases with no upfront capital cost. Macy's does not own the renewable energy credits associated with most of the SunPower solar energy systems installed on its facilities. Electricity generated by the new solar power systems will ultimately be sold to others.    Intel unveils largest corporate solar carport array in Arizona Source; Solarchargeddriving.org 20 April: Santa Clara, California-headquartered technology giant Intel has installed Arizona’s largest solar carport array at its Ocotillio Campus carpark in Chandler. The 7.7MW array provides enough energy to power around 1,160 homes annually and will be used as part of Intel’s energy mix for its Ocotillo plant. The carports also provide shade over 3,200 parking spaces; which is ideal for the Arizonan heat. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the solar carport array is one of the largest of its kind in the entire country – second only to an 18MW installation at Freeport-McMoRan's Bagdad mine in Arizona Public Service territory. “Intel’s partnership and investment in Chandler supports infrastructure, community programs and sustainable uses of water and energy sources," Chandler Vice Mayor Kevin Hartke said in a statement. "I am excited to celebrate this latest innovation and example of Intel’s commitment to our community.” Museum of Ancient Life goes solar Source: Twitter 22 April: Utah’s Museum of Ancient Life at Thanksgiving Point will be installing a 1,500 solar panel array. The installation, to be done by local firm Legend Solar, will enable a US$1.5 million saving in energy costs during the lifetime of the array – which is an estimated 60% saving on the current power usage of the museum. In honour of the installation, the museum will now be called the Museum of Ancient Life in the Legend Solar Building. “This agreement with Legend Solar creates a wonderful relationship with Thanksgiving Point,” said Mike L. Washburn, CEO of Thanksgiving Point. “As we strive to better our property for guests, this relationship also allows us to soften our global footprint as well. We’re very excited to partner with Legend Solar.” Construction will begin in January 2018 and the museum will generate 450kW of solar power upon completion.  US Army’s 10MW Fort Rucker, Alabama solar facility now online Source: WTVY 22 April: A US$25 million solar project in Fort Rucker by Alabama Power is now producing electricity.

Laptop Power, Boot Times With Ubuntu 17.04 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 24 April 2017. Page 1 of 4. 4 Comments A Phoronix Premium reader recently requested some fresh boot time comparisons and power consumption numbers for Intel laptop hardware, so here are some numbers. I haven't posted any mobile/laptop Linux benchmarks recently since my newest laptop at the moment is still based on Broadwell with having no Kabylake laptop at the moment. But for those curious about any power/boot changes for mature Intel Broadwell hardware on Linux, hopefully you find these numbers today interesting. A Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon was used for testing with an Intel Core i7 5600U processor, 128GB Samsung SSD, 8GB DDR3 RAM, and HD Graphics 55000. For this comparison were clean installs tested of Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (16.04.2 was avoided due to its proximity in the hardware enablement stack to 16.10), Ubuntu 16.10 out-of-the-box, Ubuntu 16.10 with all available system updates, and then a clean install of Ubuntu 17.04. Various boot time and battery power consumption monitor tests were carried out using the Phoronix Test Suite automated benchmarking software.

Chipzilla’s standard desktop lineup has been rattled by AMD’s new chips, which offer higher core counts and better performance in many workloads for significantly less money. Intel, of course, was never going to take this lying down — and new rumors suggest the company will accelerate the launch of its Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs, pulling them forward to a June Computex unveiling as opposed to the original August timeline. Meanwhile, Intel will reportedly launch its Coffee Lake refresh in August of this year rather than waiting until January 2018. There’ve been a number of rumors about Intel’s shifting product timelines, but whether this reflects Intel’s own plans or ordinary rumormongering isn’t clear. Defining some terms may therefore be helpful. Skylake-X: Skylake-X is the ‘normal’ CPU update we’d expect Intel to launch as part of an HEDT (High End Desktop) refresh cycle. The current 6xxx HEDT chips are built on Broadwell and support the older X99 chipset, which first debuted in 2014. Skylake-X will supposedly be available in 6, 8, and 10-core flavors. Kaby Lake-X: Kaby Lake-X’s exact features and capabilities are somewhat unclear. Rumor suggests it’s a four-core CPU + integrated graphics capable of running on the X299 platform. While it’s normal for Intel to offer lower core counts as part of the HEDT product stack, this would be the first time Chipzilla has offered a quad-core with graphics and the first time it split the HEDT lineup with introductions based on two different cores. How the Kaby Lake-X would differentiate itself from the X270 variant is unknown, but rumors of a 112W TDP suggest higher CPU clock speeds at a minimum. Basin Falls: Basin Falls is (supposedly) the codename for the new X299 chipset and the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors based on it. The image below, originally by BenchLife, claims to show the standard platform — but the diagram makes the Kaby Lake-X look like a complete waste of a product, given that it’s limited to two channels of DDR4 and just 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0. Basin Falls. Image by BenchLife Coffee Lake: Coffee Lake is a refinement of Intel’s 14nm+ process (14nm++). It’s expected to deliver marginal performance improvements, possibly similar to the ones Intel gained from Kaby Lake. Practically, this would seem to point to a few percentage points more clock speed. This would likely be along the lines of a 4.4GHz base clock with a 4.6 – 4.7GHz Turbo, as opposed to a 4.2GHz base and 4.5GHz Turbo like the Core i7-7700K features. It’s also rumored Intel’s Coffee Lake chips will include more cores, giving the company a six-core ordinary desktop part for the first time ever. When you put all these rumors together, they suggest Intel will pull in its high-end launches, offer some new SKUs, and possibly push six-core chips into the desktop space. How it all fits together is something of a mystery, however — why would Intel launch six-core chips on X299, then on regular desktops two months later? Why buy a Kaby Lake-X at all? Is there some group of HEDT customers who are dying to buy Intel’s most expensive consumer platform, then equip it with a CPU with entry-level graphics and no ability to make any use of the X299’s major features over the X270 chipset? Maybe there are, or maybe these rumors are missing some details. Either way, we’ll know soon.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Intel's Optane Memory Makes Cheap Hard Drives as Fast as Expensive SSDs Alex CranzYesterday 12:00pm Filed to: Intel Optane Memory Review Reviews Intel Optane Memory 166 16 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo It isn’t only the junk processor that makes a really cheap computer slow. Or the memory or the video card (or lack of video card). The primary reason your cheap laptop loudly chugs along at glacial speeds is because of the hard drive. Cheap laptops use cheap hard disk drives, which are much slower than the solid state drives found in better computers. But Intel’s new Optane Memory changes that. This little $70 chip makes a cheap hard disk drive run as fast as a solid state drive. Advertisement It does all this by using a brand new type of memory. That sounds very boring, but memory might be one of the most important components in your computer. What the hell is memory? Memory is anything in a computer that reads and writes data. There’s memory in your processor, in your RAM, and all the way down to your USB drives. “It’s like a pyramid,” Greg Schulz, a storage analyst and operator of StorageIO told Gizmodo. “As you go down the pyramid the capacity is cheaper, but slower.” So the tip of the pyramid is the memory in your CPU, then comes DRAM, then NAND-based flash storage like SSDs, then hard disk drives. At the very bottom would be the oldest and cheapest kind of memory tape drives. Advertisement After you understand the pyramid there’s only one other thing you really need to understand: volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory tends to be faster—it’s DRAM or the stuff built into your CPU. It’s crazy speedy and writes at the smallest possible read/write level: the byte level. Yet volatile memory can’t actually remember anything when it loses power. So the minute you restart your computer, volatile memory forgets everything it’s learned. The first time you open a big program on a computer after a restart, it takes longer than usual. Why? Your computer’s DRAM has forgotten all the crucial info it needs to open the program quickly. Non-volatile memory doesn’t have that problem, but it’s also a lot slower, and can’t write at the byte level. So what is non-volatile memory? It’s the stuff that maintains all the data it learns even when it’s not receiving power. It’s persistent memory. As soon as something is classified as persistent memory it can take on another name: storage. Every hard drive, floppy, or thumb drive you use is persistent memory. Sponsored Intel Optane memory is cool because its uses an entirely new entry on the memory pyramid: 3D Xpoint memory. 3D Xpoint slots in right between DRAM and NAND. It’s as fast as the volatile stuff—capable of reading at that crucial byte level—but it’s also persistent. It’s the best of both worlds. What the is 3D Xpoint memory? “Since digital memory was created, there’s only been eight major memories, the most recent being 3D Xpoint,” Schulz said. The last big memory advancement before 3D Xpoint? That was NAND, which was introduced back in 1999. “These things only come around every couple of decades.” Advertisement 3D Xpoint was announced by Intel and Micron way back in 2015, sixteen years after the last big memory leap. At the time, the two companies promised that 3D Xpoint was a thousand times faster than NAND, but just as persistent. Which would mean a whole new ultrafast medium for storing data. Yet it’s taken nearly two years to go from announcing the memory to actually putting it in hardware you and I can buy. What is Intel Optane memory? Intel’s Optane memory is the first instance of 3D Xpoint being used in consumer-level products. There’s already a 3D Xpoint storage drive available, taking advantage of the technology’s incredible speed, but that drive is 375GB and retails for $1,500. Optane memory is Intel’s shot at giving consumers an affordable taste of 3D Xpoint’s incredible speed. It functions as a cache system for your primary storage drive, storing necessary data, sort of like RAM might, but holding onto that data in between restarts. The memory stick fits in the .M2 slot on Optane ready motherboards. Bring your own screw. If that concept sounds familiar that’s because manufacturers have been using faster non-volatile memory as a cache system for the slower stuff for a while now. Notably, Apple has its optional Fusion drive for iMacs. That one combines an SSD and HDD, with the SSD functioning as the cache system while the HDD handles storage. While it is definitely cheaper, and larger, than a solid state drive alone, the speeds don’t quite get to solid state levels. Advertisement Seagate also introduced such a drive, though it goes with by a more generic “hybrid” name. A 2TB hybrid drive with 8GB of onboard flash memory is $99, but Intel’s new Optane setup is similarly cheap. A 32GB Optane memory stick and 2TB hard disk drive costs just $140. The cost of a 2TB solid state drive? $550. So why spend $140 instead of $99? Because Intel Optane is really damn fast. Okay, how good is Intel Optane memory? I put Intel’s new hardware through a series of benchmarks to test just how much it could improve the performance of HDDs and SSDs. In the case of the former, it improves speeds so much that you’ll never, ever want to use a Optane-less HDD again. This was best exemplified with Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop. Both apps are notorious for taking forever to open. When I opened a project in Premiere on a regular HDD, it took 52 seconds. Opening a huge project in Photoshop took 37 seconds. Yet once I’d activated the 32GB Optane memory chip, those processes took 11 seconds and seven seconds respectively. Shockingly it actually made the HDD faster than a SSD too, and bizarrely, in the case of Premiere, the HDD with Optane was actually a full two seconds faster than the SSD with Optane. HDD with Optane inside is crazy fast, and the shorter the bar the better the performance. Opening projects in Adobe apps gave the Optane memory its most impressive results, but Optane dramatically improved the traditional rotating platter hard disk drive’s performance across the board. The HDD took 5.5 seconds to open Google Chrome, but the HDD with Optane took less than two seconds. Opening a 4K video in Windows’ native video player took six seconds with the HDD, but it took only 1.5 seconds to open it when the Optane memory was enabled. Again, shorter bars are better. The solid state drive combined with Optane memory didn’t see the same kind of insane performance improvement as the HDD. Indeed in the case of the above productivity tests, the SSD and SSD with Optane memory were neck and neck with no real noticeable difference in speed. Advertisement Advertisement But that changed when we tried loading games. The storage drive has to read a lot more data when opening a video game versus opening an app like Photoshop or Google Chrome, and it takes a lot more time to read that data. Consequently, the insane speed benefits of Optane memory are much more apparent. When opening Mass Effect Andromeda the Optane memory enabled storage drives were both twice as fast as the drives without Optane memory. Speed improvements were less dramatic in the case of loading levels. In both cases, Optane memory made the storage drive approximately 20 percent faster. The SSD with Optane loaded a Mass Effect level in 28 seconds while the SSD without loaded it in 34 seconds. The HDD with Optane loaded the level in 49 seconds while the one without did it in 61 seconds. Advertisement Overwatch, a game that takes up much less space on a storage device than Mass Effect, also saw exceptional improvements in loading times. Though the speed improvements weren’t consistent. While Overwatch loaded twice as fast on the HDD with Optane versus the HDD without, it only loaded a single second faster on the SDD with Optane versus the SSD without. I observed the same disparity when benchmarking the time it takes a computer to boot up. The HDD with Optane booted twice as fast as the HDD without, but the SSD with Optane only booted 2 seconds faster than the SSD without. If all your systems run on SSD there’s really no need to go out and drop money on an Optane memory stick. While it can, on occasion, improve the speeds of an SSD, it’s not nearly a big enough improvement to warrant spending $44 minimum on Optane memory. Yet if you have a computer where all the systems and apps are on a HDD? Optane memory will make your computing life better. Advertisement Advertisement Unfortunately, there are some pretty damn big caveats. Chief among them is that Optane memory only works with computers that have a seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processor inside—and Kaby Lake only started shipping very late last year. This means that the big old desktop gathering dust in your garage can’t benefit from Optane memory. In fact, few computers can because Optane memory currently only works with desktop CPUs and motherboards, and Optane compliant motherboards and CPUs only started shipping this year. So unless you’re a computer builder, the benefits of Optane memory are still outside your grasp. But Intel assured us that we’re going to start seeing a lot of Optane memory enabled desktops and laptops from computer makers later this year. So some day very soon, cheap is no longer going to mean slow. If you see a laptop with an Optane inside sticker slapped on the front—that’s a good thing. README Optane memory retails for $44 for a 16GB stick and $77 for a 32GB stick. Go ahead and spend the money on the 32GB version. It makes HDDs twice as fast as they normally are, but it doesn’t ax the annoying kathunk sound HDDs make. Benefits to SSDs are small now, but later generations of Optane memory could change that. A 32GB Optane memory stick ($77) and 2TB HDD ($70) costs less than a 500GB SSD. Even if storage isn’t crucial to your PC build, that’s a great deal.

In a memo obtained first by CNN, the White House highlights job creation efforts, regulation cuts and national security measures, among others. But not all the initiatives have been unqualified success — Trump’s travel ban, which is listed, is currently stalled in the court system. Further, the bulk of Trump’s accomplishments have been made through executive action or memorandum, something Republicans decried Obama for doing during his second term. There are 37 points in this list and 23 (62%) were accomplished by executive order or memorandum. 100 Days Of Accomplishments CUTTING REGULATIONS Energy Independence Executive Order Revocation Of Federal Contracting Executive Orders Reexamination Of CAFE Standards Review Of Waters Of The United States Rule Creation Of Regulatory Task Forces Eliminating Stream Protection Rule Eliminating Regulations On Extraction Companies One-In-Two-Out Regulation Reform Minimizing Affordable Care Act JOB CREATION Buy American, Hire American Pipeline Dakota Access Pipeline U.S. Material In Pipeline Construction Partnering With Private Sector TRADE Withdrawal From The Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Enforcement Comprehensive Reports On The Causes Of U.S. Trade Deficits ETHICS Federal Hiring Freeze New Ethics Commitments On Political Appointees NATIONAL SECURITY Strike On Syrian Airfield Travel Restrictions On Select Countries New Iran Sanctions Defense Spending In Budget F-35 Cost Savings IMMIGRATION Immigration Enforcement, Including Constructing A Wall Sanctuary Cities Funding New Hiring To Enforce Immigration Prioritizing Criminal Immigration Enforcement And Hiring More Immigration Judges PUBLIC SAFETY Commission On Opioid Crisis Protecting Law Enforcement Officers Crime Tackling International Cartels HELPING WOMEN AND MINORITIES HBCU Initiative Canada-United States Council For The Advancement Of Women Entrepreneurs Promoting Women In Entrepreneurship Act Women And Space Exploration SUPREME COURT Nominating And Confirming Gorsuch CUTTING REGULATIONS Energy Independence Executive Order: On March 28th 2017, The President Signed An Executive Order To Promote Energy Independence And Economic Growth, Which Suspended, Revised, Or Rescinded Four Obama Executive Actions That Stifled American Energy.

Intel Optane Memory Now Available Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 April 2017 at 12:21 PM EDT. 47 Comments After talking about it for a long time, Intel Optane Memory is now officially available. A 16GB module will cost just $44 USD or $77 for a 32GB capacity. Intel claims of Optane, "Intel Optane memory enables web browsers to launch up to 5x faster than a hard disk drive. Games and levels will load faster too – up to 67 percent faster game launch and up to 65 percent faster level load, keeping users in the game. Even everyday tasks, like launching productivity apps including email clients, launch nearly 5.8x faster. And, because it is smart and adaptable, Intel Optane memory adjusts to your computing habits with intelligent software that learns your computing behaviors, making everything you do faster, smoother, easier." Optane is the non-volatile memory technology known previously as 3D XPoint. More background information on Optane is available here. Intel's announcement of Optane shipping can be found here. There's many Windows figures available for Optane today, but to little surprise, no Linux data. There has been 3DXPoint/Optane work done already in the kernel space, but as of writing I haven't yet been able to confirm if it should all be in place yet and work fine as an NVMe SSD. When I can find an Optane 32GB module, hopefully when getting back next week, I'll pick one up for Linux testing. 47 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Optane Memory review: Why you may want Intel's futuristic cache in your PC This next-gen memory technology greatly increases responsiveness of PCs, but only for those who still want to use a hard drive. Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 25 April, 2017 02:00 0 - - - - print email IDG Intel’s Optane Memory gives mainstream users a rare first bite at the bleeding edge of technology. No matter how much hardcore PC enthusiasts yell, scream, and gnash their teeth, they're not going to be using this as standalone storage just yet. Instead, Optane Memory debuts as a caching drive that can—at times—make a hard drive competitive with even the fastest SSDs. If this seems too good for your dog-slow drive to be true, don't worry. We ran the benchmarks, and you can see the results for yourself. You can also see the caveats in the system requirements, which unfortunately bar the vast majority of PCs from this speedy upgrade.  Setting up Optane Intel’s Optane M.2 SSD You’ll need a mobo that supports Optane and a Core i3 Kaby Lake CPU to run Intel’s newest memory technology. Not everyone will be able to run Optane Memory. Essentially a 32GB or 16GB M.2 module that supports the fast NVMe data/communications interface, it requires a motherboard that has an M.2 module and BIOS support for Optane. You’ll also need a Kaby Lake Core i3 CPU or better. Intel doesn’t say why it won’t support Celeron or Pentium chips based on the Kaby Lake architecture, but we’d guess the company would rather sell expensive Core i3 and Core i5 CPUs than budget chips. Skylake users are also excluded, to reduce the qualification Intel would have to do, the company claimed. And remember, Kaby Lake is a Windows 10- (or Linux-) only CPU. To set up Optane, you simply drop it into the M.2 slot, install the drivers and application, then pair the drive with your primary boot drive. The Optane software moves some OS files to the Optane drive itself to aid in faster performance. If you decide to remove the Optane drive, you must unpair them so you don’t lose files. IDG You pair your Optane memory with your hard drive, which moves some OS files to the SSD. If you pull the drive without unpairing it, you’ll lose data. Once installed, the Optane memory drive will be invisible to the OS, and only your hard drive will appear in the File Manager. This is actually one key advantage that Intel touts for Optane, and I’d agree. While a more advanced user can manage having a small 240GB SSD with a 2TB hard drive, the typical person just wants to save files to the primary drive and call it a day. Optane Memory caching for, say, a 4TB drive would be a lot easier for those folks. Gordon Mah Ung We used a 32GB Optane memory module in an Asus B250 motherboard for our tests. How we tested To test Optane Memory we used an Intel-provided system with a quad-core Core i5-7500, 16GB of DDR4/2400, and an Asus B250 Prime motherboard using the Intel B250 chipset. Intel provided the system sans-GPU, so we dropped in a budget Radeon RX 480 for all of our testing. For storage, Intel provided a 1TB Western Digital Black 7,200rpm hard drive with Windows 10 installed, and a 32GB Optane memory module in the M.2 slot. To get a feel for how Optane Memory would do against the best, I installed a $629 Samsung 1TB 960 Pro NVME M.2 drive in a PCIe slot. Obviously, Optane is aimed at mainstream-level technology, so I also tested with what I’d consider the opposite of the 960 Pro. With its TLC NAND and limited cache The 960GB Toshiba Q300 SATA SSD is technically an SSD, but it posted disappointing results in our review, often performing like a hard drive. Although other TLC-based drives aren’t the dog the Toshiba Q300 is, budget SSDs may get worse as QuadLevel Cell NAND is introduced. Still, the question today is how an Optane Memory-accelerated hard drive will perform. IDG The Optane control panel is pretty bare-bones right now. CrystalDiskMark Performance Our first test is the synthetic CrystalDiskMark 5.2.1 benchmark that’s built on Microsoft’s DISKSPD server and cloud storage performance testing tool. I ran the test on the bare Western Digital hard drive, as well against the same hard drive with the Optane module for caching. I also ran it on the Optane drive itself configured as a standalone 32GB SSD, plus the Toshiba Q300 and Samsung 960 Pro SSDs. The first result you see here is a sequential read performance using 1MB block sizes and a queue depth of one. As far as workloads go, this would be like reading or copying a single file from your drive. As you can see, the pricey Samsung 960 Pro buzzes along with read speeds around 2.5GBps. The Toshiba Q300 is held back by the SATA 600 interface, with read speeds of about 546MBps. The Western Digital Black 7,200rpm hard drive plods along at 165MBs. Optane Memory, whether configured as a standalone non-caching SSD or used as a caching drive for the Western Digital Drive, turns in a consistent performance of 1.3GBps.  IDG The sequential read speed of the Optane memory either cached or standalone easily outstrips the Toshiba Q300 SSD but can’t touch Samsung’s 960 Pro. Although the read speed of the Optane memory is relatively healthy, write speeds are less impressive—closer to that of a low-end SSD, worse even than the Toshiba Q300. Synthetic benchmarks aren’t everything, though, and we’ll cover the weaknesses of budget SSDs vs. Optane in a few paragraphs. Either way, write performance on Optane memory is nothing to write home about. IDG In pure sequential writes using a single thread, Optane memory doesn’t wow us. The thing is, to wring the most out of an NVMe SSD with multiple channels, you really need high queue-depth workloads (high queue depths are basically multiple simultaneous requests of the drive).  Here’s the performance of our drives reading 128KB blocks with a queue depth of 32. The Samung 960 Pro is simply smoking, with read speeds of 3.3GBps. Intel’s Optane drive set up as a small SSD also gives up a decent, but certainly not as impressive score of 1.4GB. When configured as a cache drive it’s pretty much identical, with a score of 1.4GB. The Toshiba Q300’s performance is essentially constrained by the SATA interface with read speeds of 562MBps. And yeah, the hard drive gives up a “blazing” 169MB read speed. IDG The read performance, however, of the Optane drive as a cache and standalone is far better with a 1MB block-size load and queue depth of 1. One argument against using high queue depths as a measurement of SSD performance is that few consumer workloads ever actually match that. Intel says concentrating on high queue depths just isn’t realistic, and many reviewers would agree. This excellent Tom’s Hardware primer by Andrew Ku shows that loading and playing games, for example, are “almost completely at a queue depth of one.” Another argument Intel makes for Optane is its performance on small 4KB blocks. Configured as a standalone SSD, the Optane module offers substantially higher performance with small files with a single queue depth. In fact, even the mighty Samsung 960 Pro gets its lunch eaten here. Running the Optane module in its cached mode we also see a significant performance advantage. And yes, the plain Western Digital hard drive is basically moving as slow as a snail here, with a score of 0. IDG One of Intel’s arguments for Optane is off-the-hook latency when reading small files with very low queue depths. Optane as a cache for the hard drive also destroys both SSDs, including the mighty Samsung 960 Pro. Read on for how Optane memory does in more real-world tests.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

Those prices are hard to beat for those needing affordable storage space to house all the game titles and movies that you own. Alternatively, you could purchase an entry-level 240GB SATA SSD for $73, or move up to a 480GB model for $117. SSD prices have come down greatly over the years and they are faster than HDDs, but they are still too expensive for many that have large storage needs. This is where Intel Optane Memory Modules are expected to fit into the market as it combines Intel 3D XPoint Technology with the latest in SSD caching advancements. The idea for SSD caching is that the important recently accessed data (Windows OS files, application files, game data & more)  is placed onto really fast caching drive (Intel Optane Memory) and can be quickly accessed when needed by the system instead of having to pull the data from the slower hard drive. Intel Optane Memory is different from older SSD caching technologies like Intel Smart Response Technology as it utilizes faster and more durable 3D Xpoint memory instead of NAND Flash and the faster M.2 PCIe x4 inteface instead of the SATA III interface The only problem with SSD caching is that the first time you use a new application is that it needs to load from the hard drive and then depending on your usage patterns some data that was on the caching drive will be pushed off to free up space for newly cached data. This is one of the reasons that Intel Optane Memory is initially launching in 16GB and 32GB capacities for $45.00 and $77.00.  respectively. Intel Optane Memory requires an Intel 200-series chipset motherboard with an open M.2 slot that supports this new feature. Secondly, you must have an Intel 7th Gen Core i3 or better ‘Kaby Lake’ processor. That means the only people that can use Optane Memory right now are those that have basically a brand new system as those with older systems are out of luck. You then need to install Intel Rapid Storage Technology drivers (version 15.5.0.1051 or newer) for Intel Optane Memory and then enable the feature. Once the Intel Optane Memory Module is installed into an M.2 slot and the proper Intel RST driver is installed you just need to enable the drive, which i s a simple procedure that takes about five minutes and requires a system restart. The one oddity that we noticed is that when you setup the Intel Optane Memory Module is that all the data is erased on the drive, but when you disable the drive the data is not erased. We’ve pointed this out to Intel already and hopefully they will add a secure erase cycle to the removal proedure. Let’s take a look at our test system and then our results! Questions or Comments?

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Intel's Optane Memory Makes Cheap Hard Drives as Fast as Expensive SSDs Alex CranzYesterday 12:00pm Filed to: Intel Optane Memory Review Reviews Intel Optane Memory 166 16 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo It isn’t only the junk processor that makes a really cheap computer slow. Or the memory or the video card (or lack of video card). The primary reason your cheap laptop loudly chugs along at glacial speeds is because of the hard drive. Cheap laptops use cheap hard disk drives, which are much slower than the solid state drives found in better computers. But Intel’s new Optane Memory changes that. This little $70 chip makes a cheap hard disk drive run as fast as a solid state drive. Advertisement It does all this by using a brand new type of memory. That sounds very boring, but memory might be one of the most important components in your computer. What the hell is memory? Memory is anything in a computer that reads and writes data. There’s memory in your processor, in your RAM, and all the way down to your USB drives. “It’s like a pyramid,” Greg Schulz, a storage analyst and operator of StorageIO told Gizmodo. “As you go down the pyramid the capacity is cheaper, but slower.” So the tip of the pyramid is the memory in your CPU, then comes DRAM, then NAND-based flash storage like SSDs, then hard disk drives. At the very bottom would be the oldest and cheapest kind of memory tape drives. Advertisement After you understand the pyramid there’s only one other thing you really need to understand: volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory tends to be faster—it’s DRAM or the stuff built into your CPU. It’s crazy speedy and writes at the smallest possible read/write level: the byte level. Yet volatile memory can’t actually remember anything when it loses power. So the minute you restart your computer, volatile memory forgets everything it’s learned. The first time you open a big program on a computer after a restart, it takes longer than usual. Why? Your computer’s DRAM has forgotten all the crucial info it needs to open the program quickly. Non-volatile memory doesn’t have that problem, but it’s also a lot slower, and can’t write at the byte level. So what is non-volatile memory? It’s the stuff that maintains all the data it learns even when it’s not receiving power. It’s persistent memory. As soon as something is classified as persistent memory it can take on another name: storage. Every hard drive, floppy, or thumb drive you use is persistent memory. Sponsored Intel Optane memory is cool because its uses an entirely new entry on the memory pyramid: 3D Xpoint memory. 3D Xpoint slots in right between DRAM and NAND. It’s as fast as the volatile stuff—capable of reading at that crucial byte level—but it’s also persistent. It’s the best of both worlds. What the is 3D Xpoint memory? “Since digital memory was created, there’s only been eight major memories, the most recent being 3D Xpoint,” Schulz said. The last big memory advancement before 3D Xpoint? That was NAND, which was introduced back in 1999. “These things only come around every couple of decades.” Advertisement 3D Xpoint was announced by Intel and Micron way back in 2015, sixteen years after the last big memory leap. At the time, the two companies promised that 3D Xpoint was a thousand times faster than NAND, but just as persistent. Which would mean a whole new ultrafast medium for storing data. Yet it’s taken nearly two years to go from announcing the memory to actually putting it in hardware you and I can buy. What is Intel Optane memory? Intel’s Optane memory is the first instance of 3D Xpoint being used in consumer-level products. There’s already a 3D Xpoint storage drive available, taking advantage of the technology’s incredible speed, but that drive is 375GB and retails for $1,500. Optane memory is Intel’s shot at giving consumers an affordable taste of 3D Xpoint’s incredible speed. It functions as a cache system for your primary storage drive, storing necessary data, sort of like RAM might, but holding onto that data in between restarts. The memory stick fits in the .M2 slot on Optane ready motherboards. Bring your own screw. If that concept sounds familiar that’s because manufacturers have been using faster non-volatile memory as a cache system for the slower stuff for a while now. Notably, Apple has its optional Fusion drive for iMacs. That one combines an SSD and HDD, with the SSD functioning as the cache system while the HDD handles storage. While it is definitely cheaper, and larger, than a solid state drive alone, the speeds don’t quite get to solid state levels. Advertisement Seagate also introduced such a drive, though it goes with by a more generic “hybrid” name. A 2TB hybrid drive with 8GB of onboard flash memory is $99, but Intel’s new Optane setup is similarly cheap. A 32GB Optane memory stick and 2TB hard disk drive costs just $140. The cost of a 2TB solid state drive? $550. So why spend $140 instead of $99? Because Intel Optane is really damn fast. Okay, how good is Intel Optane memory? I put Intel’s new hardware through a series of benchmarks to test just how much it could improve the performance of HDDs and SSDs. In the case of the former, it improves speeds so much that you’ll never, ever want to use a Optane-less HDD again. This was best exemplified with Adobe Premiere and Adobe Photoshop. Both apps are notorious for taking forever to open. When I opened a project in Premiere on a regular HDD, it took 52 seconds. Opening a huge project in Photoshop took 37 seconds. Yet once I’d activated the 32GB Optane memory chip, those processes took 11 seconds and seven seconds respectively. Shockingly it actually made the HDD faster than a SSD too, and bizarrely, in the case of Premiere, the HDD with Optane was actually a full two seconds faster than the SSD with Optane. HDD with Optane inside is crazy fast, and the shorter the bar the better the performance. Opening projects in Adobe apps gave the Optane memory its most impressive results, but Optane dramatically improved the traditional rotating platter hard disk drive’s performance across the board. The HDD took 5.5 seconds to open Google Chrome, but the HDD with Optane took less than two seconds. Opening a 4K video in Windows’ native video player took six seconds with the HDD, but it took only 1.5 seconds to open it when the Optane memory was enabled. Again, shorter bars are better. The solid state drive combined with Optane memory didn’t see the same kind of insane performance improvement as the HDD. Indeed in the case of the above productivity tests, the SSD and SSD with Optane memory were neck and neck with no real noticeable difference in speed. Advertisement Advertisement But that changed when we tried loading games. The storage drive has to read a lot more data when opening a video game versus opening an app like Photoshop or Google Chrome, and it takes a lot more time to read that data. Consequently, the insane speed benefits of Optane memory are much more apparent. When opening Mass Effect Andromeda the Optane memory enabled storage drives were both twice as fast as the drives without Optane memory. Speed improvements were less dramatic in the case of loading levels. In both cases, Optane memory made the storage drive approximately 20 percent faster. The SSD with Optane loaded a Mass Effect level in 28 seconds while the SSD without loaded it in 34 seconds. The HDD with Optane loaded the level in 49 seconds while the one without did it in 61 seconds. Advertisement Overwatch, a game that takes up much less space on a storage device than Mass Effect, also saw exceptional improvements in loading times. Though the speed improvements weren’t consistent. While Overwatch loaded twice as fast on the HDD with Optane versus the HDD without, it only loaded a single second faster on the SDD with Optane versus the SSD without. I observed the same disparity when benchmarking the time it takes a computer to boot up. The HDD with Optane booted twice as fast as the HDD without, but the SSD with Optane only booted 2 seconds faster than the SSD without. If all your systems run on SSD there’s really no need to go out and drop money on an Optane memory stick. While it can, on occasion, improve the speeds of an SSD, it’s not nearly a big enough improvement to warrant spending $44 minimum on Optane memory. Yet if you have a computer where all the systems and apps are on a HDD? Optane memory will make your computing life better. Advertisement Advertisement Unfortunately, there are some pretty damn big caveats. Chief among them is that Optane memory only works with computers that have a seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake processor inside—and Kaby Lake only started shipping very late last year. This means that the big old desktop gathering dust in your garage can’t benefit from Optane memory. In fact, few computers can because Optane memory currently only works with desktop CPUs and motherboards, and Optane compliant motherboards and CPUs only started shipping this year. So unless you’re a computer builder, the benefits of Optane memory are still outside your grasp. But Intel assured us that we’re going to start seeing a lot of Optane memory enabled desktops and laptops from computer makers later this year. So some day very soon, cheap is no longer going to mean slow. If you see a laptop with an Optane inside sticker slapped on the front—that’s a good thing. README Optane memory retails for $44 for a 16GB stick and $77 for a 32GB stick. Go ahead and spend the money on the 32GB version. It makes HDDs twice as fast as they normally are, but it doesn’t ax the annoying kathunk sound HDDs make. Benefits to SSDs are small now, but later generations of Optane memory could change that. A 32GB Optane memory stick ($77) and 2TB HDD ($70) costs less than a 500GB SSD. Even if storage isn’t crucial to your PC build, that’s a great deal.

But not like this it won't. Peter Bright - Apr 24, 2017 4:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Intel Optane Memory. Engineering sample, but we hope it's the same as retail hardware. reader comments 109 Share this story 3D XPoint (pronounced "crosspoint," not "ex-point") is a promising form of non-volatile memory jointly developed by Intel and Micron. Intel claims that the memory, which it's branding Optane for commercial products, provides a compelling mix of properties putting it somewhere between DRAM and NAND flash. The first Optane products are almost here. For certain enterprise workloads, there's the Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X, a 375GB PCIe card that offers substantially lower latency than comparable flash drives and can boast high numbers of I/O operations per second (IOPS) over a much wider range of workloads than flash. Intel isn't letting reviewers actually use the P4800X, however; the first testing of the hardware, published earlier this week, was performed remotely using hardware on Intel's premises. For the consumer, there's Intel Optane Memory. It's an M.2 PCIe stick with a capacity of 16GB ($44) or 32GB ($77), and it should be on sale today. Unlike the P4800X, Intel is letting reviewers get hold of Optane Memory or at least something close to it: the part we received was branded "engineering sample," with no retail branding or packaging. The astute reader will note that 16 or 32GB isn't a whole lot of storage. Although the sticks can be used as conventional, if tiny, NVMe SSDs, Intel is positioning them as caches for spinning disks. Pair Optane Memory with a large cheap hard disk, and the promise is that you'll get SSD-like performance—some of the time, at least—with HDD-like capacity. Mysterious memory Detailed descriptions from Intel of how Optane works are still notable by their absence—the company seems to have said more about what Optane isn't than what it is—but a basic picture is slowly being built from what Intel and Micron have said about the technology. The memory has a kind of three-dimensional (hence "3D") lattice structure (hence "XPoint"). Stackable layers have wires arranged in either rows or columns, and at the intersection of each row and column is the actual storage element: an unspecified material that can change its resistance to different values. The details of how it does this are unclear; Intel has said it's not a phase-change material, and it's different from HP's memristor tech, but it hasn't said precisely what it is. Critically, the resistance change is persistent. Once a cell has had its value set, it'll continue to hold its value indefinitely, even if system power is removed. While we don't know how the resistance change works, one thing that we do know is that unlike DRAM, each data cell does not need any transistors, which gives rise to Optane's next important property: it's a lot denser than DRAM, with Intel and Micron variously claiming a density improvement of four to ten times. The value stored in each data cell can also be written and rewritten relatively easily. NAND flash requires a very high voltage to erase each cell, which allows a cell to be written only once (flipping its value from a 1 to a 0) before it needs to be erased again. 3D XPoint cells, by contrast, can have their resistance (and hence stored value) updated between 1 and 0 and back again without needing any erasure step. Enlarge / Optane and 3D XPoint memory are designed to blur the line between memory and storage. These new consumer drives are really only about storage, though. Intel To cope with the high voltages, which slowly damage NAND flash over time, and lack of rewritability, NAND is structured in a very particular way. It's organized into pages of up to 4,096 bytes, with pages then organized into blocks of up to 512 kilobytes. Reads and writes are performed a page at a time, with erases happening not at page but at block granularity. This creates issues such as "write amplification," where writing a single byte to a page could require an entire block to be erased and rewritten. Optane, however, can be read and written at (potentially) the granularity of a single bit. Eventually, Intel and Micron plan to offer DIMMs based on Optane to take advantage of this RAM-like granular access. Being storage-like, Optane Memory doesn't offer bit-level access—it is organized into 512 byte "sectors" instead—but it nonetheless avoids the extreme write amplification of flash, and Intel claims that it has write endurance that's perhaps ten times better than flash. Optane is also a lot cheaper than RAM. While $77 would be a lot to pay for 32GB of NAND flash, it's much less than you'd expect to pay for that amount of RAM. In its server board, Intel is using Optane to offer a performance profile that flash doesn't quite match. Flash SSDs can achieve very high numbers of IOPS, but to do this they tend to need large queue depths; that is to say, they need to have software that issues a whole lot of I/O operations concurrently, so the SSD can service them at least partially in parallel. Some drives need 32, 64, or even 128 I/O operations in flight at the same time to achieve their best numbers. The Optane P4800X can hit very high IOPS numbers without needing these deep queues, and its latency, the time taken to respond to each I/O operation, tends to be much lower than a comparable SSD. For certain kinds of server workload, this can be valuable, even in spite of the price premium that Optane commands over NAND flash. Hybrids have been done before In the consumer space, however, the Optane advantage is less obvious. The basic principle of hybrid drives is reasonable enough. Spinning magnetic disks have an enormous advantage in terms of absolute capacity and price per gigabyte, but we're all familiar with their downside: relatively low transfer speeds and access times that are, in computer terms, epochal. A spinning disk can take tens of milliseconds to perform an I/O operation, orders of magnitudes longer than SSDs can manage. Hybrid drives offer a kind of best of both worlds. The large spinning disk offers abundant capacity for rarely used and performance-insensitive data, and the small SSD acts as a cache, providing lightning fast access to the files that get regularly used. A number of manufacturers offer hard disks with flash embedded within them, offering an easy one-piece hybrid solution. Intel's storage controllers built into its motherboard chipsets have also long offered a hybrid disk system, called SRT ("Smart Response Technology"). First introduced with the Sandy Bridge Z68 chipset in 2011, SRT allows more or less arbitrary pairings of SSD and spinning disk to be combined into hybrid disks (Apple's "Fusion Drives" are conceptually similar but technologically unrelated). For reasons that aren't immediately obvious to me, Intel has always kept SRT gated. Naively, one would think that SRT's widest appeal would be to low- and mid-range systems, where cost constraints make it infeasible to offer large quantities of SSD storage. But Intel feels the opposite. At its debut, it was only offered in the high-end Z68 chipset. In the chipset generations that followed Sandy Bridge, Intel did expand SRT availability to certain lower-end chipsets, but even today, the feature is not universal across the Kaby Lake chipset lineup. The company has five Kaby Lake chipsets, from Z270 at the high end, through Q270, H270, Q250, and B250 at the low end. Only Z270 and Q270 support SRT; the other three chipsets do not. The Optane app is very basic indeed. It can enable and disable the hybrid disk, but that's about the extent of it. Even though I was indeed using a 32GB Optane stick, the statistics page remained stubbornly empty. Typically, these hybrids (whether integrated or using SRT) offer substantial boosts to things like starting Windows and applications, but if your workload is diverse enough, their caching ability is curtailed. SRT is limited to a maximum of 64GB and Optane (currently) to 32GB. If your set of hot, regularly used programs and data fits inside 64 or 32GB then it can all be expected to reside in the cache. But if you were to play a handful of large modern games, the performance will become much more hard disk-like. The cache simply isn't big enough to hold several 50GB games in their entirety, forcing the system to hit the spinning disk to load them. The hybrids also tend to do little to improve things like software installation time. Software installers won't be cached (because in general you only use them once) and so all the reading the installer does (and the subsequent writing of the installed programs back to the disk) operates at hard disk speeds. From a technical, functional perspective, Optane Memory hybrid drives appear to be substantially identical to SRT hybrid drives before them. There are some differences in the underlying algorithms. RST was built for SATA accelerators; Optane is built for NVMe. Optane is also apparently tuned differently. But in both cases, the fast cache (Optane or SSD) is used to cache individual blocks from the slow storage. The basic setup process is also the same: the Optane NVMe stick is paired with a spinning disk as an accelerator. With SRT, the SSD could be configured as either a write-back cache (wherein writes are written to the SSD and only lazily flushed to the HDD at the system's leisure) or a write-through cache (wherein writes are written to the SSD and HDD in parallel). Write-back mode offers acceleration of writes, as they can operate at near-full SSD speed, but comes with a risk: if the HDD and SSD are separated, the data on the HDD may be missing, stale, or corrupt, because the latest data to be written is found exclusively on the SSD. Write-through mode is slower, since writes can only happen at HDD speed, but means that the HDD always contains a complete, usable, up-to-date copy of all your information. Optane appears to only offer write-back mode. If you want to split the drives up, you'll first have to disable Optane through the system firmware or through Intel's management utility. This flushes the cached data to the spinning disk, bringing it up to date. If you disconnect the hard disk without going through this process, the Optane will be marked as offline. Intel's infamous arbitrary limitations But there is one difference between Optane and SRT that isn't technical, and that's compatibility. Unlike SRT, which is restricted only to high-end chipsets, Optane is available to every Intel chipset—just as long as it's a Kaby Lake 200-series chipset paired with a Kaby Lake (7th generation Core) processor. This means that a chipset such as the low-end B250 will let you create a hybrid out of Optane and a hard disk but won't let you create a damn-near identical hybrid out of a flash SSD and a hard disk. There appears to be no particularly good reason for this; it's simply that Intel was caught by conflicting demands. On the one hand it wants to keep SRT as a "high-end" feature (even though it's the low-end and mid-range audience that stands to yield the most benefit from SRT). On the other hand, it wants to maximize the potential demand for Optane. And on the gripping hand, it wants to create an extra incentive to upgrade to Kaby Lake, as it would otherwise be only a minor refresh to Skylake; tying a supposedly desirable feature to Kaby Lake (and, eventually, newer CPUs and chipsets) helps create that incentive. The review system Intel sent us to test Optane uses none other than the B250 chipset. Optane-enabled, certainly, but SRT-disabled. In its press presentation announcing Optane Memory, Intel made plenty of comparisons between an Optane hybrid and a plain HDD, and, naturally Optane looked good. But surely the more relevant, significant comparison would be between an Optane hybrid and a (much cheaper) NAND flash hybrid. Alas, it is not a comparison I can make; I don't have a Z270 or Q270 motherboard on hand. One might well wonder why, of all the possible motherboards it could include in its review systems, Intel opted to pick one that made the obvious direct comparison impossible. It performs like a hybrid disk The Optane in the review system is paired with a 1TB Western Digital Black drive, with a 7,200 rpm spindle speed. This is a mid-range disk with generally decent performance and, I'd argue, a little better than what one might expect to see used in a bargain-basement B250 system (the 5400RPM WD Blue drives are considerably cheaper). The Optane hybrid performed in much the way you'd expect of a hybrid disk. Because it's a cache, the first time you do pretty much anything takes place at hard disk speeds, but, after repeating a task a few times, things settle down to cached Optane speed. The easiest I/O intensive workload that most of us run into from time to time is rebooting Windows, and here the Optane was remarkable. Rebooting from the hard disk alone took an average of about 56 seconds from the moment I hit "reboot" to the moment the desktop appears. With Optane enabled, this eventually settled down at a hair under 20 seconds. That's a difference that's very noticeable and very welcome. Thing is, I'd expect a flash SSD-based hybrid using SRT to offer pretty much the same improvement. Flash SSDs were a lot slower back when Z68 hit the market, but even that first generation of SRT showed huge gains in boot time. I just can't make the direct comparison because of Intel's extreme product segmentation. On a couple of occasions while rebooting, a strange progress screen popped up, too. I don't know what provoked it exactly, and the picture I captured is not the best (it happened just after the firmware was finished, long before the print screen key does anything useful), but it looks as if something somehow upset the status of the hybrid, and it had to flush the cache or verify its integrity or something. Enlarge / On a couple of occasions, this message appeared when booting the system. I'm not entirely sure what it's doing, or what these phases are, or why the appearance seemed to be random. Using CrystalDiskMark (a convenient front-end for Microsoft's free and open source DiskSpd benchmarking tool) the peculiar performance profile of a hybrid disk became apparent: as the size of the test data grows larger and larger, performance becomes more and more hard disk-like. CrystalDiskMark tops out at 32GB of test data so is only barely enough to overwhelm the 32GB cache Intel supplied, but even this was enough to show how performance degrades when non-cached data is being used. Although the sequential performance remained admirably Optane-like, the random read and write performance fell off substantially. Moving from a 1GB data set (fully cache-able) to a 32GB dataset, random read performance fell from 200MB/s to 46MB/s, though writes held steady. What's more, after performing this large test in CrystalDiskMark, the reboot performance suffered—Windows itself was no longer cached so could no longer load quickly. A reboot fixed it, of course. Running CrystalDiskMark against the raw Optane (no hybrid) reinforced the findings of the P4800X reviews. In terms of sheer sequential read performance, it's a little behind the 1TB Samsung 960 EVO. In terms of sequential write performance, it's actually a long way behind the flash SSD (this could be because for some reason it prohibits Windows from enabling write caching; I'm not sure). But the Samsung needs high queue depths to really shine. With a queue depth of 32, the Samsung manages 630MB/s of random read performance. Cut the queue depth down to 1 and that drops to just 54MB/s. The Optane showed a similar 636MB/s with a queue depth of 32, but it only fell to 300MB/s with a queue depth of 1. Random reads with short queue depths—the perfect workload for a cache drive—are clearly a strength of Optane relative to flash. Narrow audiences So here's the thing. The 32GB Optane costs $77. The WD Black hard disk is $73 from Amazon right now. That's $150 in total. For $139, Amazon is selling a 250GB Samsung 960 EVO. Clearly, 250GB is not as big as 1TB. If you really need the space but you're really on a tight budget, maybe the hybrid is the way to go. But if 250GB is enough for your needs, the plain SSD is the better bet. While I can't use SRT in the B250 motherboard, I can use a regular NVMe SSD. I happen to have a 1TB 960 EVO on hand. The Windows reboot cycle takes about 20 seconds. Difference is, it always takes about 20 seconds. There's no need to reboot a couple of times to prime the cache. Every read and every write is fast, because there's no HDD at all, only the SSD. The 1TB model is a little quicker than its 250GB sibling, but the 250GB part isn't slow. And unlike a hybrid drive—any hybrid drive—the SSD is always fast. It's not that the Optane hybrid doesn't work; it does work. Of course it works. SRT is six years old now, integrated hybrid disks are available from many hard disk companies, and Optane Memory is basically the same thing. It works fine, and it works in the way I expected it to work. And I could see it making sense in situations where the cost differential is more significant. In fact, my own personal use case could fit; I have two 4TB spinning disks in a mirrored pair. I don't like messing about with partitions or having Windows on an SSD and other things on spinning rust, because life's too short to micromanage my storage in that way, and for the time being at least, 4TB of mirrored flash is out of my price range. So everything just goes onto the 4TB disks. Sticking a hybrid accelerator in front of that would make a lot more sense to me. But I think this is a pretty unusual use case. Most people don't have that much disk space and don't need that much disk space. The 250GB SSD is going to provide a better experience (because it's always fast, rather than only sometimes fast), and it's going to do it at a lower cost. And even if a hybrid is really the right option, is an Optane hybrid really going to offer any benefit over a flash SSD hybrid? I'd love if Intel had provided the equipment to answer this definitely, and I'm more than a little suspicious that it didn't. For $71 on Newegg, I can get a 128GB Intel NVMe SSD. Half of that would be wasted with SRT, because SRT is capped to 64GB of cache, but that's still twice the cache size for a little less than the $77 for 32GB of Optane. Its random read performance won't be as good as Optane, sure. Does it matter? Probably not, because it still beats the snot out of a spinning disk. Optane is certainly a good cache, and I can believe that maybe Optane is a little better as a cache than flash, but I'm not convinced that it's sufficiently better as to justify spending more money to get an Optane cache rather than an SRT cache, and I'm wholly unconvinced that caching is the right approach for most users. 3D XPoint is interesting technology. One way or another, byte addressable storage and non-volatile RAM are likely to become mainstream, widespread technologies. They may use 3D XPoint; they may use one of the other competing technologies offering comparable properties. They'll shake up operating system and software design when they do; we might have computers where RAM and the file system are one and the same thing, where even multiterabyte databases can be queried in "storage" rather than having to spool their data through RAM first. Our ultraportable laptops may start packing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of "RAM." The specifics are hard to predict, but 3D XPoint, or something like 3D XPoint, is sure to open up all sorts of novel computing possibilities. But Intel Optane Memory? It's the most uninspiring use of this tech. Rather than showcasing the new capabilities that 3D XPoint brings to the table, it simply highlights how wretched Intel's product segmentation is. It's at best an incremental improvement over SRT, and, for the money, most people are probably going to be better off with a plain flash SSD than a hybrid disk anyway. 3D XPoint may yet turn out to be something good, perhaps even something world-changing. But this ain't it. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars. He covers Microsoft, programming and software development, Web technology and browsers, and security. He is based in Brooklyn, NY.

Single page Print Intel's 32GB Optane Memory storage accelerator reviewed 3D Xpoint offers a helping hand to hard drives by Jeff Kampman  11:08 AM on April 24, 2017 Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X looks like a performance revolution for certain data-center workloads, but the company's Optane plans for plain old PCs are a bit more modest. A couple weeks ago, Intel let loose the details of its Optane Memory cache, a small slice of 3D Xpoint storage that sits on an M.2 gumstick. If you're not already familiar with Optane Memory, you should go read my introductory article now—I won't be rehashing much of that content here. As a brief refresher, Optane Memory is meant to give a shot of SSD-like speed to systems that rely on hard drives alone for storage when used with its companion software. The underlying 3D Xpoint tech seems ideally suited for that purpose, given its high performance and responsiveness at the low queue depths typical of desktop workloads. About 80% of desktop PCs will ship with nothing but a hard drive in 2017, at least if you believe Intel's numbers. At first glance, that would appear to give Optane Memory a broad potential market. However, Optane Memory's platform requirements and pricing seem to pose some hurdles for the product. The $44 16GB module and the $77 32GB module that will be available at launch only work with PCs with 200-series motherboards and Kaby Lake Core CPUs. Budget builders and system integrators who might have wanted to pair Optane Memory with Intel's Kaby Lake Pentiums are out of luck. That's a shame, because Optane Memory only seems to make sense for a narrow set of systems right now given those restrictions. To start off, I went looking for the price range one needs to pay a major system integrator to get a PC with a reasonably-sized SSD as a system drive. (128GB SSDs don't count these days.) I found that $1000 buys a Dell XPS Special Edition tower with a Radeon RX 480, a 256GB M.2 SSD, a 1TB hard drive, and a Windows 10 license. Pretty dear, all things considered, but it's what's on offer. The most expensive Dell desktop PC I could find without an SSD on board is a "New Inspiron Desktop" with a Core i5-7400, integrated graphics, and a 1TB hard drive inside for $630. Given that spec, I expect Optane Memory will probably show up most often in prebuilt PCs selling for $700 or less. Dell's cheapest seventh-gen Core system with a hard drive as its only storage device runs $429, so I'd guess $500 is about the price floor for an Optane Memory-equipped system. Potentially tight window of opportunity, like I said. PC DIYers face a different set of choices around Optane. Using our Budget Box as a starting point, one has to factor in at least an extra $27 or so for the Core i3-7100 CPU one will need at a minimum, $44 to $77 for the Optane Memory device itself, and at least $50 for the WD Blue 1TB 7200-RPM hard drive we like. If a builder were to spring for the $77 32GB Optane Memory module, that would take the total platform cost to about $150, or the same as a 480GB-class SSD these days. Even the 16GB module at $44 keeps the total platform cost tantalizingly close to that of a 480GB drive. As just one upgrade recipe for our Budget Box parts list, one could step down to a Pentium G4560 to save $27 over the Pentium G4620. Scratch the WD Blue 1TB off the parts list, add in the virtual $44 or $77 from the Optane Memory modules, and we end up close to getting a 480GB SSD for the same price as the Optane Memory upgrade would have cost, slightly lower CPU performance and lower total storage capacity aside. Point is, builders have choices in this market, and Optane will need to perform well to justify its platform price tag. Now that we have Optane Memory in the lab, I'm going to find out just what offers to a hard-drive-only system, and whether the performance it offers is worth the extra cost and strict platform requirements it brings with it. Given the cost breakdown I outlined above, I'll also be comparing Optane Memory's performance to that of a comparably-priced 480GB SSD. Let's dive in. The testbed and our testing methods To let me take Optane Memory for a test drive, Intel sent over not just an Optane Memory module, but an entire PC to go with it. The company put together a rough equivalent of the New Inspiron Desktop I just described for me to test with. Here are its full specs as it turned up in the TR labs: Processor Intel Core i5-7500 Motherboard Asus B250-Plus Chipset Intel B250 Memory size 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4-2400 Hard drive WD Black 1TB + Optane Memory 32GB OCZ Trion 150 480GB Power supply Cooler Master G550M OS Windows 10 Pro Our thanks to Intel for providing the PC to make this review possible. Here's a glimpse of this box and its innards: Being the gamer that I am, I couldn't rely on Intel's integrated graphics for my testing. To remedy this system's weak gaming performance, I installed EVGA's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Superclocked graphics card. This $140 card doesn't need external power to deliver high-quality gaming performance, so it was a natural fit for this PC. Our thanks to EVGA for letting us get our grubby paws on this budget-friendly pixel pusher. We also needed a budget-friendly SSD to represent the upgrade option in our tests. Say hello to OCZ's Trion 150 480GB SSD, a budget favorite of ours for some time. Our thanks to OCZ for this drive, as well. Here's a bonus image of the Optane Memory module itself, if you were curious. It looks like just about every other M.2 gumstick on the market. It's what's inside that counts, though. As always, we did our best to deliver clean benchmark numbers. Each test was run three times, and we took the median result of the three. We used Windows' Balanced power profile for our tests. To ensure similar test conditions at the start of each benchmarking run, we restarted the PC after every measurement. We connected the PC to a 3840x2160 monitor running at 60 Hz. With those introductions out of the way, let's get to testing.

Today Intel launches the first consumer product under the Optane brand: the Intel Optane Memory, a far smaller device with a price that is 20 times cheaper. Despite having "Memory" in its name, this consumer Optane Memory product is not a NVDIMM nor is it in any other way a replacement for DRAM (those products will be coming to the enterprise market next year, even though the obvious name is now taken). Optane Memory also not a suitable replacement for mainstream flash-based SSDs, because Optane Memory is only available in 16GB and 32GB capacities. Instead, Optane Memory is Intel's latest attempt at an old idea that is great in theory but has struggled to catch on in practice: SSD caching. Optane is Intel's brand name for products based on the 3D XPoint memory technology they co-developed with Micron. 3D XPoint is a new class of non-volatile memory that is not a variant of flash memory, the current mainstream technology for solid state drives. NAND flash memory—be it older planar NAND or newer 3D NAND flash—has fundamental limits to performance and write endurance, and many of the problems get worse as flash is shrunk to higher densities. 3D XPoint memory takes a radically different approach to non-volatile storage, and it makes different tradeoffs between density, performance, endurance and cost. Intel's initial announcement of 3D XPoint memory technology in 2015 came with general order of magnitude comparisons against existing memory technologies (DRAM and flash). Compared to NAND flash, 3D XPoint is supposed to be on the order of 1000x faster with 1000x higher write endurance. Compared to DRAM, 3D XPoint memory is supposed to be about 10x denser, which generally implies it'll be cheaper per GB by about the same amount. Those comparisons were about the raw memory itself and not about the performance of an entire SSD, and they were also projections based on memory that was still more than a year from hitting the market. 3D XPoint memory is not intended or expected to be a complete replacement for flash memory or DRAM in the foreseeable future. It offers substantially lower latency than flash memory but at a much higher price per GB. It still has finite endurance that makes it unsuitable as a drop-in replacement for DRAM without some form of wear-leveling. The natural role for 3D XPoint technology seems to be as a new tier in the memory hierarchy, slotting in between the smaller but faster DRAM and the larger but slower NAND flash. The Optane products released this month are using the first-generation 3D XPoint memory, along with first-generation controllers. Future generations should be able to offer substantial improvements to performance, endurance and capacity, but it's too soon to tell how those characteristics will scale. The Intel Optane Memory is a M.2 NVMe SSD using 3D XPoint memory instead of NAND flash memory. 3D XPoint allows the Optane Memory to deliver far higher throughput than any flash SSD of equivalent capacity, and lower read latency than a NAND flash SSD of any capacity. The Optane Memory is intended both for OEMs to integrate into new systems and as an aftermarket upgrade for "Optane Memory ready" systems: those that meet the system requirements for Intel's new Optane caching software and have motherboard firmware support for booting from a cached volume. However, the Optane Memory can also be treated as a small and fast NVMe SSD, because all of the work to enable its caching role is performed in software or by the PCH on the motherboard. 32GB is even (barely) enough to be used as a Windows boot drive, though doing so would not be useful for most consumers. Gallery: Intel Optane Memory M.2 32GB Intel Optane Memory uses a PCIe 3.0 x2 link, while most M.2 PCIe SSDs use the full 4 lanes the connector is capable of. The two-lane link allows the Optane Memory to use the same B and M connector key positions that are used by M.2 SATA SSDs, so there's no immediate visual giveaway that Optane Memory requires PCIe connectivity from the M.2 socket. The Optane Memory is a standard 22x80mm single-sided card but the components don't come close to using the full length. The controller chip is far smaller than a typical NVMe SSD controller, and the Optane Memory includes just one or two single-die packages of 3D XPoint memory. The Optane Memory module has labels on the front and back that contain a copper foil heatspreader layer, positioned to cool the memory rather than the controller. There is no DRAM visible on the drive. Intel Optane Memory Specifications Capacity 16 GB 32 GB Form Factor M.2 2280 B+M key Interface PCIe 3.0 x2 Protocol NVMe 1.1 Controller Intel Memory 128Gb 20nm Intel 3D XPoint Sequential Read 900 MB/s 1350 MB/s Sequential Write 145 MB/s 290 MB/s Random Read 190k IOPS 240k IOPS Random Write 35k IOPS 65k IOPS Read Latency 7µs 9 µs Write Latency 18µs 30 µs Active Power 3.5 W 3.5 W Idle Power 1 W 1 W Endurance 182.5 TB 182.5 TB Warranty 5 years MSRP $44 $77 The performance specifications of Intel Optane Memory have been revised slightly since the announcement last month, with Intel now providing separate performance specs for the two capacities. Given the PCIe x2 link it's no surprise to see that sequential read speeds are substantially lower than we see from other NVMe SSDs, with 900 MB/s for the 16GB model and 1350 MB/s for the 32GB model. Sequential writes of 145 MB/s and 290 MB/s are far slower than consumer SSDs are usually willing to advertise, but are typical of the actual sustained sequential write speed of a good TLC NAND SSD. Random read throughput of 190k and 240k IOPS is in the ballpark for other NVMe SSDs. Random write throughput of 35k and 65k IOPS are also below the peak speeds advertised my most consumer SSDs, but on par with mainstream TLC and MLC SSDs respectively for actual performance at low queue depths. Really it's the latency specifications where Optane Memory shines: the read latency of 7µs and 9µs for the 16GB and 32GB respectively are slightly better than even the enterprise Optane SSD DC P4800x, while write latency of 18µs and 30µs are just 2-3 times slower. The read latencies are completely untouchable for flash-based SSDs, but the write latencies can be matched by other NVMe controllers, but only because they cache write operations instead of performing them immediately. The power consumption and endurance specifications don't look as impressive. 3.5W active power is lower than many M.2 PCIe SSDs and low enough that thermal throttling is unlikely to be a problem. The 1W idle power is unappealing, if not a bit problematic. Many M.2 NVMe SSDs will idle at 1W or more if the system is not using PCIe Active State Power Management and NVMe Power States. The Optane Memory doesn't even support the latter and will apparently draw the full 1W even in a well-tuned laptop. Since these power consumption numbers are typically going to be in addition to the power consumption of a mechanical hard drive, an Optane caching configuration is not going to offer decent power efficiency. Meanwhile write endurance is rated at the same 100GB/day or 182.5 TB total for both capacities. Even though a stress test could burn through all of that in a week or two, 100GB/day is usually plenty for ordinary consumer use. However, a cache drive will likely experience a higher than normal write load as data and applications will tend to get evicted from the cache only to be pulled back in the next time they are loaded. More importantly, Intel promised that 3D XPoint would have on the order of 1000x the endurance of NAND flash, which should put these drives beyond the write endurance of any other consumer SSDs even after accounting for their small capacity.

Reply Sarah Terra - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link Funny yes, but teething issues aside the random write Performance is several orders of magnitude faster than all existing storage mediums, this is the number one metric I find that plays into system responsiveness, boot times, and overall performance and the most ignored metric by all Meg's to date. They all go for sequential numbers, which don't mean jack except when doing large file copies. Reply ddriver - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link So let's summarize: 1000 times faster than NAND - in reality only about 10x faster in hypetane's few strongest points, 2-6x better in most others, maximum thorough lower than consumer NVME SSDs, intel lied about speed about 200 times LOL. Also from Tom's review, it became apparent that until the cache of comparable enterprise SSDs fills up, they are just as fast as hypetane, which only further solidifes my claim that xpoint is NO BETTER THAN SLC, because that's what those drives use for cache. 1000 times the endurance of flash - in reality like 2-3x better than MLC. Probably on par with SLC at the same production node. Intel liked about 300-500 times. 10 times denser than flash - in reality it looks like density is actually way lower than. 400 gigs in what.. like 14 chips was it? Samsung has planar flash (no 3d) that has more capacity in a single chip. So now they step forward to offer this "flash killer" as a puny 32 gb "accelerator" which makes barely any to none improvement whatsoever and cannot even make it through one day of testing. That's quite exciting. I am actually surprised they brought the lowest capacity 960 evo rather than the p600. Consumer grade software already sees no improvement whatsoever from going sata to nvme. It won't be any different for hypetane. Latency are low queue depth access is good, but that's mostly the controller here, in this aspect NAND SSDs have a tremendous headroom for improvement. Which is what we are most likely going to see in the next generation from enterprise products, obviously it makes zero sense for consumers, regardless of how "excited" them fanboys are to load their gaming machines with terabytes of hypetane. Last but not least - being exclusive to intel's latest chips is another huge MEH. Hypetane's value is already low enough at the current price and limited capacity, the last thing that will help adoption is having to buy a low value intel platform for it, when ryzen is available and offers double the value of intel offerings. Reply Drumsticks - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link Your bias is showing. 1000x -> Harp on it all you want, but that number was for the architecture not the first generation end product. It represents where we can go, not where we are. I'll also note that Toms gave it their editor approved award - "As tested today with mainstream settings, Optane Memory performed as advertised. We observed increased performance with both a hard disk drive and an entry-level NVMe SSD. The value proposition for a hard drive paired with Optane Memory is undeniable. The combination is very powerful, and for many users, a better solution than a larger SSD." "1000 times the endurance of flash -> You can concede that 3D XPoint density isn't as good as they originally envisioned, but it's still impressive, gen1, and has nowhere to go but up. It's not really worse than other competing drives per drive capacity - this cache supports like 3 DWPD basically. The MX300 750GB only supports like .3 DWPD. 10x better is still good. 10 times denser than flash -> DRAM, not Flash. And it's going to be much denser than DRAM. Barely any to no improvement -> LOL, did you look at the graphs? Those lines at the bottom and on the left were 500GB and 250GB Sata and NVMe drives getting killed by Optane in a 32GB configuration. 3D XPoint was designed for low queue depth and random performance - i.e. things that actually matter, where it kills its competition. Even sequential throughput, which is far from its design intention, generally outperforms consumer drives. So, Optane costs, in an enterprise SSD, 2-3x more than other enterprise drives, for record breaking low queue depth throughput that far surpasses its extra cost, while providing 10-80x less latency. In a consumer drive, Optane regularly approaches an order of magnitude faster than consumer drives in only a 32GB configuration. If Optane is only as fast as SLC, I'd love to understand why the P4800X broke records as pretty much the fastest drive in the world, barring unrealistically high queue depths. This 32GB cache might be a stopgap, and less compelling of a product in general because of its capacity, but that you could deny the potential that 3D XPoint holds is absolutely laughable. The random performance and low queue depth performance is undeniably better than NAND, and that's where consumer performance matters. Reply ddriver - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link "I'd love to understand why the P4800X broke records" Because nobody bothered to make a SLC drive for many many years. The last time there were purely SLC drives on the market it was years ago, with controllers completely outdated compared to contemporary standards. SLC is so good that today they only use it for cache in MLC and TLC drives. Kinda like what intel is trying to push hypetane as. Which is why you can see SSDs hitting hypetane IOPs with inferior controllers, until they run out of SLC cache space and performance plummets due to direct MLC/TLC access. I bet my right testicle that with a comparable controller, SLC can do as well and even better than hypetane. SLC PE latencies are in the low hundreds of NANOseconds, which is substantially lower than what we see from hypetane. Endurance at 40 nm is rated at 100k PE cycles, which is 3 times more than what hypetane has to offer. It will probably drop as process node shrinks but still. "10x better is still good" Yet the difference between 10x and 1000x is 100x. Like imagine your employer tells you he's gonna pay you 100k a year, and ends up paying you a 1000 bucks instead. Surely not something anyone would object to LOL. I am not having problems with "10x better". I am having problems with the fact it is 100x less than what they claimed. Did they fail to meet their expectations, or did they simply lie? I am not denying hypetane's "potential". I merely make note that it is nothing radically better than nand flash that has not been compromised for the sake of profit. xpoint is no better than SLC nand. With the right controller, good old, even ancient and almost forgotten SLC is just as good as intel and micron's overhyped love child. Which is kinda like reinventing the wheel a few thousand years later, just to sell it at a few times what its actually worth. My bias is showing? Nope, your "intel inside" underpants are ;) Reply Reflex - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link SLC has severe limits on density and cost. It's not used because of that. Even at the same capacity as these initial Optane drives it would likely cost considerably more, and as Optane's density increases there is no ability to mitigate that cost with SLC, it would grow linearly with the amount of flash. The primary mitigations already exists: MLC and TLC. Of course those reduce the performance profile far below Optane and decrease it's ability to handle wear. Technically SLC could go with a stacked die approach, as MLC/TLC are doing, however nothing really stops Optane from doing the same making that at best a neutral comparison. Reply ddriver - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link SLC is half the density of MLC. Samsung has 2 TB of MLC worth in 4 flash chips. Gotta love 3D stacking. Now employ epic math skills and multiply 4 by 0.5, and you get a full TB of SLC goodness, perfectly doable via 3D stacked nand. And even if you put 3D stacking aside, which if I am not mistaken the sm961 uses planar MLC, 2 chips on each side for a full 1 TB. Cut that in half, you'd get 512 GB of planar SLC in 4 modules. Now, I don't claim to be that good in math, but if you can have 512 GB of SLC nand in 4 chips, and it takes 14 for a 400 GB of xpoint, that would make planar SLC OVER 4 times denser than xpoint. Thus if at planar dies SLC is over 4 times better, stacked xpoint could not possibly not possibly be better than stacked SLC. Severe limits my ass. The only factor at play here is that SSDs are already faster than needed in 99% of the applications. Thus the industry would rather churn MLC and TLC to maximize the profit per grain of sand being used. The moment hypetane begins to take market share, which is not likely, they can immediately launch SLC enterprise products. Also, it should be noted that there is still ZERO information about what the xpoint medium actually is. For all we know, it may well be SLC, now wouldn't that be a blast. Intel has made a bunch of claims about it, none of which seemed plausible, and most of which have already turned out to be a lie. Reply ddriver - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link *multiply 2 by 0.5 Reply Reflex - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link You can 3D stack Optane as well. That's a wash. You seem very obsessed with being right, and not with understanding the technology.

Intel and partner Micron Technology, have been working on a new kind of computer memory for the past several years. Their goal? A chip that’s many, many times faster than any SSD. That might not sound impressive, but if it works as advertised, it could be game-changing. For some time now, computers have basically had main types of storage: volatile (short-term) and non-volatile (long-term). Hard drives, blu-rays, etc. are the long-term kind, and your computer’s RAM is the short-term. While it’d be nice only to have to use one type, computers need both. Without a hard drive or SSD, when your PC shuts down, you’d lose all your data. And without the RAM, your computer would run thousands of times slower — hard-drives just can’t keep up. Intel’s new tech, dubbed 3D XPoint (pronounced cross-point), bridges that gap. The Intel Optane SSD DC P4800X is the first commercially available product in that line. It’s ludicrously expensive right now (over $1500 for 375GB), but it’s still worth it for some. Intel’s Optane line can be installed and used as either RAM or a standard storage drive. It’s not quite as fast as modern RAM, but it’s close enough that PCs can use either. That might not mean much to you, but that’s an excellent quality to have for server storage. Servers often have to handle many, many requests at once. For each one, the server has to process the query and then find the data the client is asking for. Having a drive that can pull up the data you need and can do that millions of times with almost no delay is huge — and that alone can make it worth it to shell out $1500 for a chip. As technology always does, 3D XPoint/Optane will get faster and cheaper every year. With any luck, it won’t be too much longer until massive, cheap, hyper-fast drives make everything we do on computers a bit faster.

The new MacBook Pro 2016 updates include more than just differences in screen size. Yes, picking the best new MacBook Pro for your needs will include the screen size, but there are some options only available on the more expensive 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 like more powerful quad-core processors, better graphics and 2TB Storage. The screen size also dictates the portability of the 2016 MacBook Pro. Apple reduced the overall size of the 15-inch and 13-inch models, but there is still a decent size difference between the two. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air, which really ups the ease of taking this notebook with you. How the 2016 MacBook Pro 13-inch vs 15-inch models compare. While there are only two screen sizes, there are three specific MacBook Pro models to choose from if you want the newest models, but only two of them come with the Touch Bar and Touch ID. Here’s how the 2016 MacBook Pro 13 vs MacBook Pro 15 specs and features compare. 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Specs 13-inch MacBook Pro 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar & Touch ID 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar & Touch ID Display 13.3-inch Retina Display 13.3-inch Retina Display 15.4-inch Retina Display Resolution 2,560 x 1,600 2,560 x 1,600 2,880 x 1,800 Dimensions 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 inches 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 inches 13.75 x 9.48 x 0.61 inches Weight 3.02 pounds 3.02 pounds 4.02 pounds Keyboard Full Size, Backlit Full Size, Backlit with TouchBar & Touch ID Full Size, Backlit with TouchBar & Touch ID Storage 256GB/512GB/1TB 256GB/512GB/1TB 256GB/512GB/1TB,/2TB Processor 2.0GHz/2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor 2.9GHz/3.1GHz/3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor 2.6GHz, 2.7GHz, 2.9Ghz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor RAM 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB Graphics Intel Iris 540 GPU Intel Iris 550 GPU AMD Radeon Pro 450 2GB/Radeon Pro 455 2GB, Radeon Pro 460 4GB Networking 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 Webcam 720P FaceTime HD 720P FaceTime HD 720P FaceTime HD Ports 2 Thunderbolt 3 (USB C Ports), Headphone jack 4 Thunderbolt 3 (USB C Ports), Headphone Jack 4 Thunderbolt 3 (USB C Ports), Headphone Jack Battery Life Up to 10 Hours Up to 10 Hours Up to 10 Hours Price $1,499 and up $1,799 and up $2,399 and up Availability Order at Apple Now Pre-Order Now Pre-Order Now 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Screens You need to decide if you want a lighter and more portable 13-inch MacBook Pro or a more powerful 15-inch MacBook Pro with a larger screen. The smallest MacBook Pro includes a 13.3-inch screen and the larger offers a 15.4-inch display. The 13-inch MacBook delivers a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution while the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers a 2,880 x 1,800. You can change the resolution to fit more apps on-screen at once as well. These are the same resolutions as the 2015 models, but the screens aren’t the same as your old one. Both of the new models include a brighter screen with more colors. Both of the new MacBook Pro sizes offer a brighter display, 25% more colors and a 67% higher contrast ratio than the older models. Thankfully all the new MacBook Pro models include this upgraded display so size and resolution are your main factors. We use the 1,440 x 900 resolution on the older 13-inch MacBook Pro to allow for more space to use apps on the smaller screen. You can change the resolution on both to fit more apps on the screen. The biggest deciding factor for many uses is the screen size, but there is more to it than just a larger screen. The 15-inch MacBook Pro includes more powerful processors and graphics as well as larger storage options. 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Performance Apple packs more power into the 2016 MacBook Pro 15 than in the MacBook Pro 13. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts with an Intel Core i7 Quad-Core processor and a dedicated AMD Radeon GPU and 16GB RAM. On the smaller 13-inch MacBook Pro users start with an Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, integrated Intel Graphics and 8GB of RAM. You can upgrade the 13-inch MacBook Pro to a faster processor and 16GB of RAM, but you will still be using a dual-core processor and integrated graphics. While they use the same ports, you can only connect two 5K displays to the 15-inch MacBook Pro at the same time. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is capable of powering one 5K display or two 4K displays. We’re waiting for specific 2016 MacBook Pro benchmarks to compare the integrated Iris graphics to the dedicated AMD Radeon Pro graphics, but we already know that the dedicated 15-inch MacBook Pro will be more powerful. Even with the difference in performance, the 2016 MacBook Pro battery life is the same 10 hours of web browsing across both of the models. 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Size and Weight The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller than 13-inch MacBook Air and it is just as light, which makes it a very tempting choice for users who want portability. With a 15-inch MacBook Pro there is a larger footprint, but it is still smaller than the model it replaces. It’s not as small as the older 13-inch MacBook Pro, it takes up less space and weighs half a pound less than the one it replaces. How the 13-inch MAcBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro sizes compare. Head to head the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a pound lighter and 0.6 mm thinner than the 15-inch model. If portability trumps power, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is the one you need to look into. All of the new models include a larger touchpad that is 2X as large as the one on the 2015 MacBook Pro. 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Price You’ll need to spend $900 more to get the 15-inch MacBook Pro when you compare it to the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar. 13-inch MacBook Pro – $1,499 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar – $1,799 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar – $2,399 You can customize the MacBook Pro models with many options including more RAM, more storage and by the time you add in everything you need and the dongles, the new MacBook Pro is more expensive than you think. You can get a student discount on the new MacBook Pro to save $50 to $200 and you can also check out how to get Apple financing to afford the new MacBook Pro. New MacBook Pro: 6 Reasons to Buy, 4 Reasons Not To Buy for a Smaller Design & Touch Bar   1 / 10 One of the biggest reasons to buy the 2016 MacBook Pro is the new design. The new MacBook Pro is thinner, lighter and smaller than the one it replaces.  Apple shaves half a pound of each of the models, shrinks the overall; size by 20 to 23% and makes them thinner without cutting battery life, performance or the screen size.  The new models include a Touch Bar above the display on the $1,799 and up models. This allows you to touch the small display to control applications and system functions.  When you use Apple applications and soon other applications, the Touch Bar will change so you can use it to quickly access what you want. We know you can use it for Emoji, for app functions, for quick replies and much more.  In addition to the Touch Bar, you also get a new Force Touch trackpad that is twice as big as the trackpad on the 2015 MacBook Pro.    1 / 10 6 Responses 10/29/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply No updates for the iMac, Mac Pro or Mac mini…..

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel Coffee Lake S 6 Core Desktop Processor Leaked, Core i5 Without Hyper Threading – Coffee Lake 4 Core, 8 Thread Embedded CPU Detailed Too By Hassan Mujtaba Apr 24, 2017 573Shares Share Tweet Submit First listings of Intel’s upcoming Coffee Lake 6 core and 4 core processors have been sighted. The new processors were spotted in Sisoftware database and are part of the desktop and embedded platforms. Intel Coffee Lake Desktop 6 Core and Embedded 4 Core Processors Detailed With Intel pushing ahead the the launch of their next generation processor families in response to AMD’s Ryzen processors, we are finally starting to get new info on Intel’s mainstream and high-end desktop CPU platforms. The new processor platforms are scheduled to launch sometime in mid of 2017. First up will be the high-end Skylake X and Kaby Lake X CPU families which will range from 4, 6, 8 , 10 and 12 core SKUs. The more mainstream desktop oriented family will arrive after that in the form of Coffee Lake S. This line up will feature Intel’s first 6 core mainstream processor. Related The Official WCCF Hardware Polls 2017 Intel Coffee Lake chips were previously going to launch in January 2018 (CES). But recent AMD launches have pushed Intel to shake up their launch roadmap. The recent reports have suggested that Coffee Lake chips can launch as early as August, at GamesCom 2017. The new Coffee Lake chips will launch alongside the Z370 chipset based motherboards and would be followed by the H370 and B360/H310 chipsets at the end of 2017 or early 2018. Intel Coffee Lake S 6 Core Part Could be a Core i5 Processors – Features No Hyper Threading, Up To 3.50 GHz Clock Speed on Engineering Sample The first processor I think most users would be interested to learn about is the Coffee Lake S 6 core part. This is Intel’s first 6 core, mainstream and consumer oriented processor. The processor carries some very interesting specifications. First of all, it’s a 6 core part that features no hyper-threading. It comes with 3.5 GHz base clock and no turbo boost speed is mentioned. My guess is that we are looking at a engineering sample and final chip will ship with higher clock speeds. Related AMD Radeon RX 580, Radeon RX 570 and Radeon RX 550 Polaris Graphics Cards Performance Benchmarks Leaked – 3DMark Fire Strike Extreme and Ultra Results Spotted The chip features 1.5 MB of L2 cache (6 x 256 KB) and 9 MB of L3 cache. Now the first thing someone will say is that how do we know this is an actual Coffee Lake processor? Well, it’s quite easy to tell. First, the chip we are looking at was running on a Kaby Lake-S client platform. Kaby Lake-S is the mainstream line which currently supports Skylake and Kaby Lake consumer processors. This is not the HEDT line which should have the Kaby Lake-X codename. Also, the high-end 6 core Broadwell-E parts feature up to 20 MB of L3 cache whereas this processor has less than halve of it. Advertisement The cache also tells us a lot about this processor. We know from previous Intel architectures that each core has 2 MB of L3 cache and the entire cache is shared across all cores. A 4 core, 8 thread Kaby Lake chip featured 8 MB of L3 cache. So this chip should have theoretically featured 12 MB of L3 cache that would be shared across all cores. But since this is a disabled chip since it doesn’t feature hyper-thread, the conclusion is that we are looking at a Core i5 series 6 core chip. Intel isn’t making big changes with Coffee Lake and since the design heirarchy is mostly similar to Kaby Lake, a Core i5 chip with disabled design should feature 9 MB of L3 cache. A disable Kaby Lake Core i5-7600K chip also featured less cache of 6 MB compared to 8 MB L3 cache on the Core i7-7700K chip. Intel Coffee Lake S 6 Core Processors Specs (Preliminary): CPU Name Intel Core i5-7600K Intel Core i5-8*** Intel Core i7-7700K Intel Core i7-8*** CPU Family Kaby Lake-S Coffee Lake-S Kaby Lake-S Coffee Lake-S CPU Process 14nm 14nm 14nm 14nm CPU Cores 4 6 4 6 CPU Threads 4 6 8 12 Base Clock 3.80 GHz 3.50 GHz (ES) 4.20 GHz TBD Boost Clock 4.20 GHz 3.50 GHz (ES) 4.50 GHz TBD L2 Cache 1 MB (256 KB per Core) 1.5 MB (256 KB per Core) 1 MB (256 KB per Core) 1.5 MB (256 KB per Core) L3 Cache 6 MB 9 MB 8 MB 12 MB Unlocked Design Yes Yes Yes Yes Socket Support LGA 1151 LGA 1151? LGA 1151 LGA 1151? PCH 200-Series 300-Series 200-Series 300-Series TDP 91W TBD 91W TBD Are Intel Coffee Lake Processors Compatible With LGA 1151 Socket and 200-Series PCH? This also brings us to the next interesting detail we are getting from this listing. The specific 6 core Coffee Lake part was tested on the Kaby Lake-S client system. Kaby Lake-S platform means that the chip was ran off a 200-series PCH based motherboard. If true, Coffee Lake would retain compatibility not only with the LGA 1151 socket but also currently available motherboards. As with the previous generation, Skylake and Kaby Lake processors are compatible with both 100 and 200 series motherboards. While AIB partners of Intel will refresh their product stack with the new 300-series chipset, it is highly possible that they will still offer BIOS updates allowing compatibility of Coffee Lake chips on 200-series motherboards. This would allow users a very easy and affordable upgrade path to newer 6 core chips. Intel Coffee Lake R (Embedded) Core i7 Processor Features 4 Cores and 8 Threads Finally, we have an embedded chip based on the Coffee Lake architecture. This chip features 4 cores, 8 threads and a clock speed up to 2.11 GHz (base clock is 1.90 GHz). This chip comes with 8 MB L3 cache and was tested on a Kaby Lake R client system which refers to the embedded platform. The specifications listed for this chip confirm that it is a new processor which will be branded under the Core i7 family and come with a new 8th generation naming scheme. These listings more or less confirm the rumors that Intel have pushed ahead the launch of their processor lineups. We can see Coffee Lake chips on consumer platforms as early as August 2017 with engineering samples of the new 300-series chipset based motherboards being shown off at Computex in June 2017.

Join For Free This is another article about the NXP MCUXpresso IDE (see MCUXPresso IDE: Unified Eclipse IDE for NXPs ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers), this time it is about Post-build steps. Post-build steps are custom actions that can be executed after the build (or link phase), and are typically used to generate S-Record, Binary or Intel Hex files (see S-Record, Intel Hex, and Binary Files). Post Build Steps Details This article is part of a series to get up to speed using the new NXP MCUXpresso IDE. Published so far are: MCUXpresso IDE: Unified Eclipse IDE for NXPs ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers MCUXpresso IDE: Adding the Eclipse Marketplace Client MCUXpresso IDE: Importing Kinetis Design Studio Projects MCUXpresso IDE: Installing Processor Expert into Eclipse Neon Outline Post build steps are part of the Eclipse CDT build tool's integration. If using the GNU ARM Eclipse plugins as in Kinetis Design Studio, then it offers check boxes to run pre-configured post build steps, e.g. for creating flash image files or printing the code size. This post shows how to do the same in the MCUXpresso IDE, either using post build steps or using a context menu on the executable file. The post build steps can be found under the C/C++ Build project settings, under the ‘Build Steps’ tab. Post build steps Pressing the ‘Edit’ button opens a dialog where I can edit the actions: Post Build Steps Details The default probably shows the following: arm-none-eabi-size "${BuildArtifactFileName}"
# arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "${BuildArtifactFileName}" "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin"
# checksum -p ${TargetChip} -d "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" The first command (arm-none-eabi-size) prints code size information (see text, data, and bss: Code and Data Size Explained), with an output something like this in the console view:    text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename
 540764        344      37032     578140      8d25c    MK64FN1M0xxx12_Project_Demo.axf If there is a line starting with ‘#’, then everything following that will be ignored: That line plus all the lines which follow. Remove the ‘#’ to have the command executed. To generate a binary file, use arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O binary "${BuildArtifactFileName}" "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin" To generate a S19/Motorola S-Record (see “xxx”), use the following: arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O srec "${BuildArtifactFileName}" "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.s19" To generate Intel Hex, use the following: arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O ihex "${BuildArtifactFileName}" "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.hex" A description of all options for the GNU objcopy program can be found in https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/objcopy.html To change the length of S19 lines, the option... --srec-len <length> ... is useful, e.g. –srec-len 128. See S-Record Manipulation with GNU objcopy and Burner Utility. I can use multiple commands, such as the example below, which will produce S19, Intel Hex, and Binary files: Generating binary, s-record and Intel hex files The command execution can be checked in the console view: Output to Console The files get generated into the build output folder: Output Folder Other than that, have a look at the (excellent) electronic documentation, using the menu Help > MCUXpresso IDE User Guide: MCUXpresso User Guide Then you search for what you are looking for: Help about post build steps Binary Utilities If I only need a binary or Intel Hex file right away without using a post build step, I can use the ‘Binary Utilities’ menu. It does not have the ability to generate S19 files, but is otherwise very useful: Binary Utilities  Make sure you select a binary (ELF/Dwarf .afx) file, otherwise the menu does not show up. The interesting thing is that these menus are configurable, under the menu Window > Preferences > MCUXpresso IDE > Utilities: Utility Menu Settings I cannot add more menu entries, and I cannot change the menu name. But I can change the menu action. So if I would like to create the S19 file instead of the intel hex, I can change that entry. Or I can execute multiple commands separated by a semicolon: arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O ihex "${FileName}" "${FileBaseName}.hex"; arm-none-eabi-objcopy -v -O srec "${BuildArtifactFileName}" "${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.s19"  Make sure to use a semicolon *plus a space* as separator. A semicolon alone will give an error message. Creating both Hex and S19 Files  The settings are part of the workspace settings, so if you want this for multiple workspaces, you have to export/import the settings or do it in each workspace. The MCUXpresso IDE has a versatile way to generate binary, S19, or Intel Hex files using post-build steps. For creating hex and binary files ‘ad-hoc’, I can use the Binary context menu on the ELF/Dwarf executable file. As a bonus feature, I can change the Binary Utilities commands. And if you want to generate more advanced files or generating complex checksums, have a look at the ‘SRecord’ tool described in my other article: CRC Checksum Generation with ‘SRecord’ Tools for GNU and Eclipse. Happy Hexing!

For techies watching out for memory breakthroughs, this is seen as significant. One would have a difficult time finding any article about something called the Optane SSD DC P4800X, the new storage drive (a 375GB PCIe based SSD) that did not use superlatives. Ali Raza, TechJuice, said Friday that Intel launched the fastest SSD storage. Raza said, "It reads and writes information on the storage faster than the NAND technology employed in current SSDs." Other writers called it insanely fast. TechSpot called the 3-D XPoint SSD the "new king of enterprise SSDs." Paul Alcorn, contributing editor, Tom's Hardware: "Optane is Intel's all-encompassing brand name for the collection of technologies, including 3-D XPoint media, memory, storage controller, interconnects, and drivers, that power the DC P4800X." Katherine Bourzac, IEEE Spectrum, said Optane drives "are nonvolatile, like flash memory, which means that they should use relatively little standby power and that they're fast, like DRAM." Intel's Enterprise 3-D XPoint technology plays its part in this news. The 3-D XPoint technology which Intel is using here was developed in partnership with Micron technology, said Digit. Bourzac called 3-D XPoint the "mystery technology inside Optane." 3-D XPoint is designed to bridge the gap between NAND and DRAM, said Tom's Hardware. AnandTech said that "the use of 3-D XPoint memory instead of NAND flash memory allows it to deliver great throughput and much lower access latency than any other NVMe SSD." With 3-D XPoint's persistence and high performance, it can serve in both memory and storage roles, slotting into the new "storage-class memory" category," said Alcorn in Tom's Hardware. "In 3-D XPoint storage, each data cell does not need a transistor so the storage density can be up to 4 times that of standard DRAM. It offers the incredibly fast speeds and access times of DRAM, but has the capacity of traditional flash storage," said William Gayde in TechSpot. Bourzac discussed the XPoint term: "While flash memory elements must be read and written in groups, XPoint elements—situated at the crossing point of interconnects—can be addressed individually." She said that according to James Myers, who works on nonvolatile memory architecture at Intel, this architecture, and something inherent to the storage materials themselves, makes 3-D XPoint faster than flash memory. So who is getting these first shipments? Billy Tallis in AnandTech: "So far, Intel has only started shipping the 375GB Optane SSD DC P4800X to select customers, and they have not released detailed specifications for the larger capacities that will ship later this year." Alcorn, Tom's Hardware, said Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X was destined for the data center, "where it'll introduce game-changing (I don't use those words lightly) performance." According to IEEE Spectrum, Myers said this first product will enable data centers to do more with a smaller number of servers. The new 3-D XPoint drives " are the best drive available for heavy enterprise level I/O operations," said TechSpot. Wccf remarked that "Intel's 3-D XPoint based DC P4800X SSD blows away the competition with sustained performance under heavy loads." The MSRP for the 375GB P4800X is $1520. Usman Pirzada, senior editor, hardware, Wccf: "While it is bleeding edge tech at the moment, the price will eventually come down to more palatable levels and I have no doubt it will be able to disrupt the NAND industry then." Raza in TechJuice predicted that "this new technology will eventually edge out the conventional flash storage the same way flash storage is edging out traditional hard drives." "The potential significance of 3-D XPoint memory is immense," said Tallis in AnandTech. Tallis said that it is "the first new truly mass market, high-density solid state storage medium to hit the market since NAND flash itself. It comes at a time where the NAND market is booming like never before, but also at a time when we know that there is a definite end of the line for NAND." Tallis explained further. "Once NAND can no longer scale in density and cost-per-bit, it will fall to paradigm changes and next-generation memory technologies (one of which will be 3-D XPoint) to continue to carry the industry forward."         LATEST STORIES (8) Iraqi Army Captures Al-Tanak District in Western Mosul Terrorists Suffer More Casualties in Syrian Army Attack in Northern Hama More Gunmen, Their Families Leave al-Wa'er in Homs for Northern Syria Syrian Army Soldiers Gain More Ground in Northern Hama Syrian Army Wards off ISIL Attack on Deir Ezzur's Military Airport Syrian Army Captures More Territories in Northern Hama Iraqi Federal Police Forces in Clashes with ISIL in Western Mosul Protesters Clash with Police in France over Election Results Self-Defeating Shell Game: The Trump Doctrine Kills Civilians, Protects Terrorists Iranian Speaker Condemns Terrorist Attacks in Afghanistan Iranian Leader Pardons Hundreds of Prisoners Tens of Gunmen, Family Members Leave al-Wa'er in Homs for Northern Syria Battle for Mosul Day 188: Children Held by ISIL in Western Mosul Freed Syrian Army Preempts Terrorists' Attack in Hama Syria: Al-Nusra Continues Vast Withdrawal of Forces from Northern Hama Iraqi Army Captures Al-Tanak District in Western Mosul TEHRAN (FNA)- The Iraqi Army imposed control over the Al-Tanak district in Western Mosul after fierce clashes with ISIL that lasted for a week.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 24, 2017 02:02 PM It is quite obvious that Microsoft has been lacking when it comes to tablet offerings lately. For more than a year, the Redmond company has not released an update for its Surface Pro line of tablets. This delay only makes Surface Pro fans more impatient. In fact, many now have reasons to believe that the Surface Pro 5 might not happen at all. However, recent events suggest that Microsoft maybe planning something of a surprise for the Surface Pro 5. By now, anyone would know that Microsoft has been working closely with Qualcomm. Qualcomm has provided Microsoft with a Snapdragon 820-based engineering device it can use to port the Windows 10. Only recently, it was reported that, coming from Qualcomm, a Snapdragon-based Windows 10 device will be released later this year. This news now begs to answer the question, “is Microsoft releasing a Snapdragon-powered Surface Pro 5?” Unfortunately, nobody can answer that now apart from Microsoft. ARM-powered Surface Pro 5 This idea actually makes sense. Every year, more and more mobile devices with Snapdragon chips are released in the market. Also, year after year, these Snapdragon chips are getting better in terms of performance and efficiency. Some of these newer Snapdragon chips can even go head to head with an Intel mobile processor like the m3 and m5 series. This is why, one can say that an ARM-based Surface Pro 5 is a possibility. Granted, an ARM SoC will never be as powerful as a full-blown desktop processor, at least for now. Over the years, the performance of ARM chips have been increasing steadily. And while desktop processors are the same, the disparity between an ARM and a desktop processor has already started to blur. Perhaps Microsoft can still offer the Surface Pro 5 with entry level specs. But instead of using an Intel M series processor, it might equip the tablet with a Snapdragon 835 instead. Kaby Lake-based Surface Pro 5 There is no denying that the main reason why Surface Pro fans are waiting for the update is the new Kaby Lake processor from Intel. It has long been rumored that the upcoming tablet will sport the seventh generation processors from Intel. However, due to delays in both the chips and the Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft did not release the Surface Pro 5 last year. The Kaby Lake series processors are undoubtedly far more superior in terms of performance and efficiency than the Skylake processor. This is due to the fact that the former is made with the 14nm process technology instead of 28nm. That means, the overall chip area has been reduced by as much as 50 percent. The new processor family also boasts native support for 4K video playback and processing. This is why many tablet enthusiasts are quite excited about the Surface Pro 5. The prospect of being able to consume 4K videos on a tablet with ease is a big plus for them. Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) What to expect from the Surface Pro 5? Right now, the release date of Microsoft’s next generation Surface Pro tablet is still uncertain. The Redmond giant has done well in keeping the lid shut when it comes to news about the tablet. However, a recent Twitter post from Paul Thurott claims that nothing new will come with the Surface Pro 5 apart from the Kaby Lake processor. He also said that Microsoft is keeping the Surface Connector and will not upgrade it to a Thunderbolt 3 or USB type-C. While this news may seem upsetting to some, the Kaby Lake processors will surely introduce new battery saving features to the upcoming Surface Pro tablet. This has been one of the major concerns of Surface Pro users ever since the third generation. Perhaps this time around, Microsoft will be able to prolong the battery life of the Surface Pro like it promises on its marketing materials.

Image Credit: MSI I’ve said before that gaming laptops are starting to make a lot of sense once again, but that’s only if the companies that manufacturer these products take advantage of breakthrough technologies from partners like AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. That brings us to the $1,800 MSI GT62VR, which straddles some of the lines that separate old gaming laptops from the new crop, but the end result is still a machine that never struggles to play modern games and should easily last for the next four to five years. What you’ll like It’s a multitasking beast MSI has packed in the latest chips from Intel and Nvidia into this laptop, and that makes it smart enough to handle all kinds of tools at once. Here’s a look at the specs of the system I used: Intel Core i7-7700HQ @ 2.8GHz 15.6-inch IPS display 1080p (it also comes in 2160p) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB GDDR5 memory 16GB of RAM 1TB HDD storage 264GB SSD storage SteelSeries backlit keyboard 2 Dynadio speakers and 1 subwoofer Above: It’s a blazing machine for gaming and work. Image Credit: MSI As an example of an extreme situation where the laptop excels, I run a weekly podcast that I livestream and record simultaneously. To do this, I need to have Chrome and Xsplit open simultaneously, and I have both programs slam the CPU and GPU with requests for video rendering, Google docs, and a million tabs. It’s often too much for the old 4th-generation i5 and the new GTX 1080 Ti that I have in my desktop right now. As a work machine, this notebook is clearly capable of handling just about anything you’ll throw at it. And if you’re doing any video, photography, or audio processing, that seventh-gen Kaby Lake processor is nearly a must-have for anyone who does their work on the go or someone who wants desktop power in a form factor that can easily leave the desk. It’s a VR and gaming powerhouse At the same time, this is clearly a gaming laptop first. And where some of the GeForce GTX 1060-based notebooks were mostly hitting 60 frames per second at Ultra settings and a 1080p resolution, the 1070 is enough to get you over the hump for games like Watch Dogs 2. Here’s a test I run to see whether or not the system can handle some of the more demanding games at 1080P60, and it easily surpassed that marker: And here’s how the GT62VR compares to the MSI GS43VR, which illustrates how much more performance you get from the 1070 and the Kaby Lake processor: I tested the 1080p variation of the GT62VR, but you can get it with a 2160p display or plug it into a 1440p monitor if you like. It can handle some games at those higher resolutions. At 4K with Ultra settings, you’ll still do fine in some of the multiplayer games like Rocket League and Overwatch, but this is where The Division and Watch Dogs 2 will start to fall off sharply. But I never like to hold that against a laptop because they’re mostly built as enclosed gaming systems dedicated to doing 1080p60 — especially when it comes to a 15-inch screen. Instead of trying to position this generation of gaming laptops as 4K machines, companies like MSI are instead leaning much more heavily into virtual reality. And it’s there that this laptop excels. I had some trouble getting the machine working with VR due to a troublesome Windows 10 update, but once I got over that, I was getting smooth experiences in every game I tried. Again, thanks to that Kaby Lake i7, I was also able to get away with having apps like Chrome open in the background at the same time without having to worry about taking a performance hit. At this point, even if you don’t care about the technology, it’s difficult to avoid getting a decent gaming laptop without also coming away with an excellent VR machine. And MSI’s device is one of the better laptops for powering your head-mounted displays. Nice screen, keyboard, and I/O options Beyond the internals, the laptop has a crisp display and a responsive SteelSeries keyboard. These are crucial aspects for a gaming machine, and they deliver a strong enough experience to support the idea of making this your primary machine for games like World of Warcraft, The Witcher 3, or Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds. The IPS monitor does lose a lot of clarity at sharp angles, but that never turned into a problem during typical use. Instead, using this on my lap, desk, or table, I was impressed with the bright images that relatively accurate color reproduction. The GT62VR also has enough USB ports and video outputs to support peripherals like an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. It has 3 USB 3.0 ports on the right, 1 USB 2.0 on the left, and even a USB-C option on the back. You can also output to a monitor using the HDMI option or the Mini-DisplayPort. What you won’t like Trackpad still requires fiddling The sad state of Windows trackpads continues. Out of the box, the GT62VR’s trackpad was a miserable thing to use. What’s especially frustrating is that the hardware is not actually the culprit — instead, it’s something to do with the drivers because installing the default Microsoft software fixes everything. Two-finger scrolls, something that would almost never work before some tinkering, now works perfectly for me. But I shouldn’t have to dive into Device Manager to fix this junk. Above: It looks slimmer in pictures than it really is. Image Credit: MSI Bulk might not be worth the extra power over the 1060 models I doesn’t follow in the footsteps of what MSI has done with its gaming laptops that use the GeForce GTX 1060 cards. The GS43VR, for example, is compact and sleek whereas this model is much bigger and bulkier. Sure, that’s to fit in the 1070 card, but it’s still disappointing that the GT62VR looks more like an older gaming laptop than something new and modern. Personally, if I were traveling a lot, I’d probably go with the smaller, less powerful option because I’m not sure the power justifies the size and weight. Conclusion While the GT62VR features the latest tech from MSI, Intel, and Nvidia, it still feels a bit stuck in the past in terms of design. But if you’re OK with lugging around a larger laptop, this device will deliver flawless 1080p60 gaming in a machine that can also easily handle VR. At $1,800, that’s not a lot of portable power for a rather reasonable price. MSI lent the laptop to GamesBeat for the purposes of this review.

Liliputing How cybercrooks put the beatdown on my beats Last month Yours Truly got snookered by a too-good-to-be-true online scam in which some dirtball hijacked an Amazon merchant’s account and used it to pimp steeply discounted electronics that he never intended to sell. Amazon refunded my money, and the legitimate seller never did figure out how his account was hacked.

GamesIndustry.biz How much do video game companies make off DLC and add-ons? Around $5B a year The typical price tag for a full-fledged console or PC video game is around $60, but rare is the game that doesn’t also include an array of add-ons — everything from additional game content to new characters to outfits to in-game currency.

(AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like AAPL's platform is called the Apple Automated System, and it has been outed by a training manual By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 24, 2017, 11:38 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Intel Corporation (INTC) Reportedly Rushing New Chips Because of AMD’s Ryzen Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Apple Inc. (AAPL) Rumor Points to Multi-User Support for iOS 11 Recent Posts: What Apple Inc. (AAPL) Self-Driving Car Technology Looks Like Intel Corporation (INTC) Reportedly Rushing New Chips Because of AMD’s Ryzen Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones View All Posts The rumors have been flying for several years that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is secretly working on autonomous driving technology. We even had the code name for the effort: Project Titan. However, the cat was officially out of the bag two weeks ago when AAPL received a permit to test an autonomous car in California. Source: Apple Now, thanks to official training documents obtained by Business Insider, we know what Apple’s self-driving car technology looks like. Why Apple Is Interested in Autonomous Car Technology The closest Apple has ever come to releasing a product for automobiles is its CarPlay standard for integrating an iPhone into a car’s entertainment system. So why the apparent fascination with futuristic auto technology like an autonomous car? The company has exploded in value and influence over the past decade because of the iPhone, but it’s looking for the next big hit. With the success Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had, and the publicity Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has reaped from it’s self-driving car program, Apple clearly saw an opportunity. Over 88 million cars and light duty trucks were sold in 2016 and the revenue for automotive suppliers alone surpassed $670 billion in 2015. Even carving out a small slice of this market would be huge for AAPL stock holders. We started to hear about Apple’s Project Titan in 2015. At first, it was thought to be an electric car to compete with Tesla. Even Tesla’s Elon Musk seemed convinced Apple was preparing to directly take on his company. However, last fall there was an apparent shake-up in Project Titan. It was believed that Apple was pivoting from developing its own electric Apple car to instead developing an autonomous car software platform it could sell to automakers. Two weeks ago, Apple officially tipped its hand. The company received a permit to drive three Lexus vehicles equipped with autonomous car technology on California roads. Apple’s Self-Driving Car Technology Outed by Training Manual Business Insider got the scoop on what AAPL is up to by obtaining a copy of a training manual and official government documentation filed by the company. Called the Apple Automated System, AAPL’s self-driving car platform uses a combination of hardware and software. Apple says its system is “capable of sending electronic commands for steering, accelerating, and decelerating and may carry out portions of the dynamic driving task.” The documentation describes the testing Apple drivers must undergo on a private course before being allowed to take the Lexus autonomous car onto public roads. It also includes photographs of the cockpit of the cars and even details the modifications made to the vehicles. AAPL has equipped its test cars with a steering wheel and pedals made by Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) –the manufacturer of video game peripherals. The human “driver” can instantly take over control of the self-driving car by touching the brakes or grabbing the steering wheel. Where Does the Apple Automated System Go From Here? The end game for the Apple Automated System is clearly not to power an Apple car. At least not yet. Instead, AAPL will take aim at the traditional auto makers, hoping to convince them to license its system in their vehicles instead of spending the time and money to develop their own in-house technology. Even though it’s now public knowledge, expect AAPL to remain tight-lipped on its autonomous car project. The Apple Lexus test vehicles will be spotted on California roads, but with so much at stake — Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) recently dropped $15 billion on Mobileye to develop its own autonomous vehicle platform — Apple is likely to keep its cards close until it’s ready for the big reveal. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Microsoft Inc. reports third-quarter earnings Thursday after the market closes on a tech-heavy day. Amazon Inc. AMZN, +0.99% Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +2.32% GOOGL, +2.33%  and Intel Corp. INTC, +1.18% are expected to report at the same time. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect Microsoft MSFT, +1.70%   to report earnings per share of 70 cents, up from the 62 cents per share it reported in the year-earlier period. The Estimize consensus, made up of estimates from analysts, academics and others, is for earnings per share of 72 cents. Microsoft beat earnings expectations the past three quarters, but missed expectations for its last third-quarter earnings report. Revenue: FactSet analysts expect Microsoft to report revenue of $23.6 billion, up from $22.1 billion in the year-earlier period. The Estimize consensus is for revenue of $23.3 billion. Of the 36 ratings on FactSet, the average rating is overweight with a mean price target of $70.13. Stock reaction: Shares of Microsoft have gained 6% in the past three months, compared to the S&P 500’s SPX, +1.08%   gain of 4%. In the past month, Microsoft shares have risen 4%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 1%. What else to look for: Microsoft’s productivity and business processes segment is expected to carry the company’s results to at least meet, if not beat, earnings expectations. That segment includes Microsoft’s Office 365, which MKM Partners analysts says is building momentum with its commercial offering. LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired in a $26 billion transaction that closed in December, is expected to contribute $950 million to that segment for the quarter, according to MKM Partners. This is the first full quarter that LinkedIn has been a part of Microsoft, but the company has previously said that it expected the acquisition to be 1% dilutive to its earnings per share segment in 2017 and 2018. Stifel analysts also expect better-than-expected server transactional revenue for the quarter, thanks to Microsoft’s releases of Windows and SQL Server products. They see the intelligent cloud segment growing 8% on the strength of Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. The device side, which includes Microsoft’s Surface laptop, may have some tougher comparisons on the consumer side, but analysts see upside from the commercial device segment. There are also rumors that Microsoft could be introducing new products at a hardware event in May. While all of these should be positives for the stock, MKM Partners says “two wild cards” could affect the stock after earnings: fiscal 2018 guidance for 606, a new revenue rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that makes revenue hard to compare to previous quarters, and guidance for gross margins, which could be weighed down by the company’s legacy businesses. Microsoft has consistently been returning capital to its shareholders, and analysts expect that to continue, which could help boost the stock.

By CaitlinHuston Reporter Microsoft Inc. reports third-quarter earnings Thursday after the market closes on a tech-heavy day. Amazon Inc. AMZN, +0.99% Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +2.32% GOOGL, +2.33%  and Intel Corp. INTC, +1.18% are expected to report at the same time. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Analysts expect Microsoft MSFT, +1.70%   to report earnings per share of 70 cents, up from the 62 cents per share it reported in the year-earlier period. The Estimize consensus, made up of estimates from analysts, academics and others, is for earnings per share of 72 cents. Microsoft beat earnings expectations the past three quarters, but missed expectations for its last third-quarter earnings report. Revenue: FactSet analysts expect Microsoft to report revenue of $23.6 billion, up from $22.1 billion in the year-earlier period. The Estimize consensus is for revenue of $23.3 billion. Of the 36 ratings on FactSet, the average rating is overweight with a mean price target of $70.13. Stock reaction: Shares of Microsoft have gained 6% in the past three months, compared to the S&P 500’s SPX, +1.08%   gain of 4%. In the past month, Microsoft shares have risen 4%, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 1%. What else to look for: Microsoft’s productivity and business processes segment is expected to carry the company’s results to at least meet, if not beat, earnings expectations. That segment includes Microsoft’s Office 365, which MKM Partners analysts says is building momentum with its commercial offering. LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired in a $26 billion transaction that closed in December, is expected to contribute $950 million to that segment for the quarter, according to MKM Partners. This is the first full quarter that LinkedIn has been a part of Microsoft, but the company has previously said that it expected the acquisition to be 1% dilutive to its earnings per share segment in 2017 and 2018. Stifel analysts also expect better-than-expected server transactional revenue for the quarter, thanks to Microsoft’s releases of Windows and SQL Server products. They see the intelligent cloud segment growing 8% on the strength of Azure, Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. The device side, which includes Microsoft’s Surface laptop, may have some tougher comparisons on the consumer side, but analysts see upside from the commercial device segment. There are also rumors that Microsoft could be introducing new products at a hardware event in May. While all of these should be positives for the stock, MKM Partners says “two wild cards” could affect the stock after earnings: fiscal 2018 guidance for 606, a new revenue rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that makes revenue hard to compare to previous quarters, and guidance for gross margins, which could be weighed down by the company’s legacy businesses. Microsoft has consistently been returning capital to its shareholders, and analysts expect that to continue, which could help boost the stock.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman The New Radeon Pro Duo Delivers Professional-Grade Performance & Flexibility for Today’s Most Complex Multi-Tasking Workflows /EINPresswire.com/ — LAS VEGAS, NV–(Marketwired – Apr 24, 2017) – NAB SHOW 2017 – Today AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) announced the world’s first dual-GPU graphics card designed for professionals: the Polaris-architecture-based Radeon™ Pro Duo. Built on the capabilities of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100, the Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card is designed to excel at media and entertainment, broadcast, and design and manufacturing workflows, delivering outstanding performance and superior flexibility that today’s creative professionals demand. The Radeon Pro Duo is equipped with 32GB of ultra-fast GDDR5 memory to handle larger data sets, more intricate 3D models, higher resolution videos, and complex assemblies with ease. Operating at a max power of 250W, the Radeon Pro Duo harnesses a total of 72 compute units (4608 stream processors) for a combined performance of up to 11.45 TFLOPS of single-precision compute performance on one board, and twice the geometry throughput of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100.2 The Radeon Pro Duo enables professionals to work up to four 4K monitors at 60Hz, drive the latest 8K single monitor display at 30Hz using a single cable, or drive an 8K display at 60Hz using a dual cable solution. „Today’s professional workflows continue to increase in complexity, often demanding that creators switch between a wide variety of applications to progress their work, pausing efforts in one application while computing resources are focused on another. We designed the Radeon Pro Duo to eliminate those constraints, empowering professionals to multi-task without compromise, dedicating GPU resources where and how they need them. It’s a continuation of our promise for Radeon Pro: to provide greater choice in how professionals practice their craft, enabling superior multi-tasking, accelerated applications, and powerful solutions for advanced workloads like VR,” said Ogi Brkic, general manager, professional graphics, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. Divide The Radeon Pro Duo’s distinct dual-GPU design gives professionals the flexibility to divide and conquer their workloads, enabling smooth multi-tasking between applications by committing GPU resources to each. Professionals can maintain their creative momentum and get more done faster, allowing for a greater number of design iterations in the same time. „I was very impressed with the power of the Radeon Pro Duo, particularly in Nuke. The flexibility of being able to divide GPUs between tasks is phenomenal and represents the ultimate in multitasking: compositing a complex shot while jumping into a 3D application to create assets, exporting back to Nuke to keep compositing then switching to Photoshop or Mari and paint a projection, to load it back into Nuke and continue. The Radeon Pro Duo handles the general and varied tasks without missing a beat with excellent 3D performance. For the kind of projects I undertake as a generalist, the Radeon Pro Duo is a no-brainer. It does it all,” said Kynan Stephenson, freelance artist. Accelerate The Radeon Pro Duo dramatically increases performance in today’s most popular professional applications through support of multiple GPUs or plug-ins, speeding through tasks. On select professional applications, the Radeon Pro Duo delivers up to 2 times faster performance compared with the Radeon Pro WX 71003 and up to 2 times faster performance than the closest competing professional graphics card.1 Create The Radeon Pro Duo’s potent combination of performance and dual-GPU flexibility makes it the ideal solution for today’s advanced workloads, including professional VR content creation. VR represents a significant inflection point for the media and entertainment industry and is becoming more commonplace in today’s studios. Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card leverages the power of two GPUs to render out separate images for each eye, increasing VR performance over single GPU solutions by up to 50% in the SteamVR test.4 AMD’s LiquidVR™ technologies are also supported by the industry’s leading real-time engines, including Unity and Unreal, to help ensure smooth, comfortable, and responsive VR experiences on Radeon Pro Duo. „In developing 4K 360 VR content, the biggest hurdle is the tech, because as an artist, I just want to create and not worry about limitations of the hardware. Faced with raw, un-optimized content, VR creators need a lot more horsepower than VR consumers. With the new Radeon Pro Duo, I have performance in spades. I immediately saw a speed difference of up to 2X, allowing me to push the boundaries of my projects without having to compromise on creativity or productivity,” said Jonathan Winbush, Founder & Creative Director, Winbush.tv. The Radeon™ Pro Duo is designed to meet the stringent requirements of workstation form factors, comes with 24/7 support5, and is bolstered by professional-grade software certified across leading applications for media, entertainment, CAD and engineering. Radeon™ Pro Software offers users unprecedented driver stability, quality and reliability, with quarterly updates for features, performance and stability. The Radeon Pro Duo’s planned availability is the end of May at an expected SEP of US$999. Radeon Pro at NAB 2017 Along with the launch of the Radeon Pro Duo at NAB 2017, AMD is showing off a wide range of innovations for media and entertainment professionals: Professional color correction using BlackMagic Resolve powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Incredible real-time 360 video stitching and real-time VR preview using Radeon™ Loom and the HTC Vive, and powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Accelerated rendering performance in Blender using Radeon ProRender and „Out of Core” technology to access system memory for increased frame buffer capacity powered by the Radeon Pro Duo VR content creation using Radeon Pro Duo Real-time rendering at 4K resolution in Radeon ProRender powered by AMD’s next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG 8K video post-processing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017 enabled by AMD’s next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG Stunning VR experiences from Rewind and The Foundry’s Nuke running on Radeon™ Pro WX 7100 Demonstrations are available at the AMD booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, South Lower Hall, #SL7620, and in the Studio Xperience booth, also in the South Lower Hall, #SL2424.

Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this press release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this press release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD’s manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD’s business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD’s business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD’s receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD’s business and operating results; the markets in which AMD’s products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD’s notes and the secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD’s products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold.

Not content with the way that Redmond was updating its software, he decided to patch Microsoft’s patch. Zeffy is irritated with Microsoft’s decision to stop updating Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer CPUs. The company, which worked hard to push users to upgrade to Windows 10, announced in January last year that it would not update versions of these older operating systems running on seventh-generation processors (that’s Kaby Lake silicon from Intel, and Bristol Ridge silicon from AMD). A select set of products using sixth-generation Skylake processors would continue to get support until the middle of this year, it said. On April’s patch Tuesday, the policy finally took effect. Microsoft’s update messages told users of older operating systems using seventh-gen chips that their combinations of Windows version and CPU were not supported. Windows 7 and 8.1 users running Intel seventh-generation Core processors, along with AMD “Bristol Ridge/Ryzen/Zen,” and Qualcomm 8996 chips are being locked out of updates, according to Bleeping Computer. “A giant middle finger” In the Readme.md file on his Github repo, Zeffy calls this “a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. He took matters into his own hands, expanding the Microsoft update file so that he could see all the update files it contained. Then, he excluded all the binaries that were related to Windows Update, leaving him with 14 files. He compared those with the ones already on his system, and found one file containing two functions: IsDeviceServiceable and IsCPUSupported. He patched the file to bypass those functions, preventing Windows Update from checking to see whether it liked the host CPU or not. This isn’t the first time that one person has patched another’s software. Naked Security has already written about Operation Rosehub, a volunteer effort by 50 engineers patching open source projects that used a flawed version of the Apache Common Collections library. Many projects used this code, including WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, and Jenkins. No one came to patch many open-source projects relying on the Apache library, so Google stepped up. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Another example of guerrilla patching is 0patch, a project from Slovenian consulting firm Acros Security. This approach uses what the firm calls “micro-patching“, in which the binary isn’t modified at all. Instead, the patches are in-memory changes, typically shorter than a tweet, that block malware trying to exploit a particular vulnerability. The idea is to quickly patch binaries against specific exploits before the vendor can. In many cases, it can be easier to install a targeted in-memory patch than to try and test a bundle of different patches that will affect binaries directly, explained Acros co-founder Mitja Kolsek. Working around inadequate patching policies These different approaches to guerrilla patching highlight existing problems with software updates. 0patch has appeal because it’s an easier way for enterprise admins to protect their software without relying on binary patches that may break the systems. The project has now issued more than 300 patches for various products, many of which were not zero-days. Like 0patch, Operation Rosehub has appeal because in some cases, vendors simply don’t patch vulnerabilities quickly enough. In Google’s case, the problem lay with open-source projects for which no single person has responsibility. This highlights one of the key problems with open source: many eyes may eventually start a problem, but no one may step up to fix it. Zeffy’s case highlights something different altogether: selective patching, designed to support a vendor’s own agenda at the expense of its users. Microsoft’s decision to stop updating Windows 7 and 8.1 on current-generation processors furthers its own agenda, which has always been to force as many Windows users to upgrade to Windows 10 as possible. Microsoft explains this by arguing that developers would have to work too hard to support “Windows 7’s expectations” when running on newer silicon. Nevertheless, it in effect holds users of older versions to ransom, which is what irked Zeffy so much. This is unfortunate, because fighting the security battle is already hard enough. We should be able to rely on software vendors to support their products on all platforms until their official end of life. Microsoft has vowed to offer extended support for Windows 7 – which includes security updates at no extra charge – until January 2020. Windows 8 gets extended support until January 2023. If patches themselves become a battleground, and users who don’t want to upgrade their OS must begin hunting around for tools that let them patch vendors’s own patches, then system protection – already a complicated and uncertain process – becomes even more daunting for that vast majority of users that simply wants to feel safe when using their operating system. Zeffy’s irascible fix might not be the last.

If all our parents followed this dorks advice and use his patch, we will be expected to fix the issues. Everyone knows that eventually you must upgrade your hardware. Hey, where is my patch I want Windows NT back? Geeeeeese come on. Reply Andrew says: April 24, 2017 at 7:25 pm If Microsoft didn’t want to update Windows 7 until 2020 and Windows 8 until 2023, they shouldn’t have said that. Zeffy going around the “older CPU” block to get patches for his system is irrelevant. This is an issue with Microsoft not updating older operating systems, as they said they would, using hardware as the deciding factor. I personally don’t find Windows 10 the “steaming pile” that Zeffy thinks it is, however if I had a 7th gen CPU and wanted to continue using Windows 7 or 8, I shouldn’t require a special process to do so. Microsoft is advancing their agenda to get people to upgrade to Windows 10 if on newer hardware or risk being vulnerable to security deficiencies on their operating system. Bottom line is that Windows 7 and 8 are not at their End Of Life dates and as such, should continue to receive security patches.

W10 is junk bloatware for a business. For gaming the same thing. Every time MS releases something new/rehash, it becomes more bloated, more complicated to use, more risk issues. Business (and gamers) want a stripped down OS, efficient. MS is more like a dictator than a product. Oh sure they make a crippled version for home users, that just adds commands to limit things, but its still the same crap, not better performing. Back when,,,, we hacked XP down under 70mb in memory and it rocked for gaming (would have been good for work too if we hadn’t taken all print function out) If MS doesn’t make a better product, someone else will, and will take their market (fingers crossed sooner than later).

Built on the capabilities of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100, the Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card is designed to excel at media and entertainment, broadcast, and design and manufacturing workflows, delivering outstanding performance and superior flexibility that today's creative professionals demand. The Radeon Pro Duo is equipped with 32GB of ultra-fast GDDR5 memory to handle larger data sets, more intricate 3D models, higher resolution videos, and complex assemblies with ease. Operating at a max power of 250W, the Radeon Pro Duo harnesses a total of 72 compute units (4608 stream processors) for a combined performance of up to 11.45 TFLOPS of single-precision compute performance on one board, and twice the geometry throughput of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100.2 The Radeon Pro Duo enables professionals to work up to four 4K monitors at 60Hz, drive the latest 8K single monitor display at 30Hz using a single cable, or drive an 8K display at 60Hz using a dual cable solution. "Today's professional workflows continue to increase in complexity, often demanding that creators switch between a wide variety of applications to progress their work, pausing efforts in one application while computing resources are focused on another. We designed the Radeon Pro Duo to eliminate those constraints, empowering professionals to multi-task without compromise, dedicating GPU resources where and how they need them. It's a continuation of our promise for Radeon Pro: to provide greater choice in how professionals practice their craft, enabling superior multi-tasking, accelerated applications, and powerful solutions for advanced workloads like VR," said Ogi Brkic, general manager, professional graphics, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. Divide The Radeon Pro Duo's distinct dual-GPU design gives professionals the flexibility to divide and conquer their workloads, enabling smooth multi-tasking between applications by committing GPU resources to each. Professionals can maintain their creative momentum and get more done faster, allowing for a greater number of design iterations in the same time. "I was very impressed with the power of the Radeon Pro Duo, particularly in Nuke. The flexibility of being able to divide GPUs between tasks is phenomenal and represents the ultimate in multitasking: compositing a complex shot while jumping into a 3D application to create assets, exporting back to Nuke to keep compositing then switching to Photoshop or Mari and paint a projection, to load it back into Nuke and continue. The Radeon Pro Duo handles the general and varied tasks without missing a beat with excellent 3D performance. For the kind of projects I undertake as a generalist, the Radeon Pro Duo is a no-brainer. It does it all," said Kynan Stephenson, freelance artist. Accelerate The Radeon Pro Duo dramatically increases performance in today's most popular professional applications through support of multiple GPUs or plug-ins, speeding through tasks. On select professional applications, the Radeon Pro Duo delivers up to 2 times faster performance compared with the Radeon Pro WX 71003 and up to 2 times faster performance than the closest competing professional graphics card.1 Create The Radeon Pro Duo's potent combination of performance and dual-GPU flexibility makes it the ideal solution for today's advanced workloads, including professional VR content creation. VR represents a significant inflection point for the media and entertainment industry and is becoming more commonplace in today's studios. Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card leverages the power of two GPUs to render out separate images for each eye, increasing VR performance over single GPU solutions by up to 50% in the SteamVR test.4 AMD's LiquidVR™ technologies are also supported by the industry's leading real-time engines, including Unity and Unreal, to help ensure smooth, comfortable, and responsive VR experiences on Radeon Pro Duo. "In developing 4K 360 VR content, the biggest hurdle is the tech, because as an artist, I just want to create and not worry about limitations of the hardware. Faced with raw, un-optimized content, VR creators need a lot more horsepower than VR consumers. With the new Radeon Pro Duo, I have performance in spades. I immediately saw a speed difference of up to 2X, allowing me to push the boundaries of my projects without having to compromise on creativity or productivity," said Jonathan Winbush, Founder & Creative Director, Winbush.tv. The Radeon™ Pro Duo is designed to meet the stringent requirements of workstation form factors, comes with 24/7 support5, and is bolstered by professional-grade software certified across leading applications for media, entertainment, CAD and engineering. Radeon™ Pro Software offers users unprecedented driver stability, quality and reliability, with quarterly updates for features, performance and stability. The Radeon Pro Duo's planned availability is the end of May at an expected SEP of US$999. Radeon Pro at NAB 2017 Along with the launch of the Radeon Pro Duo at NAB 2017, AMD is showing off a wide range of innovations for media and entertainment professionals: Professional color correction using BlackMagic Resolve powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Incredible real-time 360 video stitching and real-time VR preview using Radeon™ Loom and the HTC Vive, and powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Accelerated rendering performance in Blender using Radeon ProRender and "Out of Core" technology to access system memory for increased frame buffer capacity powered by the Radeon Pro Duo VR content creation using Radeon Pro Duo Real-time rendering at 4K resolution in Radeon ProRender powered by AMD's next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG 8K video post-processing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017 enabled by AMD's next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG Stunning VR experiences from Rewind and The Foundry's Nuke running on Radeon™ Pro WX 7100 Demonstrations are available at the AMD booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, South Lower Hall, #SL7620, and in the Studio Xperience booth, also in the South Lower Hall, #SL2424.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman The New Radeon Pro Duo Delivers Professional-Grade Performance & Flexibility for Today’s Most Complex Multi-Tasking Workflows With up to 2 times faster performance vs. the closest competing professional graphics card(1) on select professional applications, users can truly divide and conquer LAS VEGAS, NV–(Marketwired – Apr 24, 2017) – NAB SHOW 2017 – Today AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) announced the world’s first dual-GPU graphics card designed for professionals: the Polaris-architecture-based Radeon™ Pro Duo. Built on the capabilities of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100, the Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card is designed to excel at media and entertainment, broadcast, and design and manufacturing workflows, delivering outstanding performance and superior flexibility that today’s creative professionals demand. The Radeon Pro Duo is equipped with 32GB of ultra-fast GDDR5 memory to handle larger data sets, more intricate 3D models, higher resolution videos, and complex assemblies with ease. Operating at a max power of 250W, the Radeon Pro Duo harnesses a total of 72 compute units (4608 stream processors) for a combined performance of up to 11.45 TFLOPS of single-precision compute performance on one board, and twice the geometry throughput of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100.2 The Radeon Pro Duo enables professionals to work up to four 4K monitors at 60Hz, drive the latest 8K single monitor display at 30Hz using a single cable, or drive an 8K display at 60Hz using a dual cable solution. „Today’s professional workflows continue to increase in complexity, often demanding that creators switch between a wide variety of applications to progress their work, pausing efforts in one application while computing resources are focused on another. We designed the Radeon Pro Duo to eliminate those constraints, empowering professionals to multi-task without compromise, dedicating GPU resources where and how they need them. It’s a continuation of our promise for Radeon Pro: to provide greater choice in how professionals practice their craft, enabling superior multi-tasking, accelerated applications, and powerful solutions for advanced workloads like VR,” said Ogi Brkic, general manager, professional graphics, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. Divide The Radeon Pro Duo’s distinct dual-GPU design gives professionals the flexibility to divide and conquer their workloads, enabling smooth multi-tasking between applications by committing GPU resources to each. Professionals can maintain their creative momentum and get more done faster, allowing for a greater number of design iterations in the same time. „I was very impressed with the power of the Radeon Pro Duo, particularly in Nuke. The flexibility of being able to divide GPUs between tasks is phenomenal and represents the ultimate in multitasking: compositing a complex shot while jumping into a 3D application to create assets, exporting back to Nuke to keep compositing then switching to Photoshop or Mari and paint a projection, to load it back into Nuke and continue. The Radeon Pro Duo handles the general and varied tasks without missing a beat with excellent 3D performance. For the kind of projects I undertake as a generalist, the Radeon Pro Duo is a no-brainer. It does it all,” said Kynan Stephenson, freelance artist. Accelerate The Radeon Pro Duo dramatically increases performance in today’s most popular professional applications through support of multiple GPUs or plug-ins, speeding through tasks. On select professional applications, the Radeon Pro Duo delivers up to 2 times faster performance compared with the Radeon Pro WX 71003 and up to 2 times faster performance than the closest competing professional graphics card.1 Create The Radeon Pro Duo’s potent combination of performance and dual-GPU flexibility makes it the ideal solution for today’s advanced workloads, including professional VR content creation. VR represents a significant inflection point for the media and entertainment industry and is becoming more commonplace in today’s studios. Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card leverages the power of two GPUs to render out separate images for each eye, increasing VR performance over single GPU solutions by up to 50% in the SteamVR test.4 AMD’s LiquidVR™ technologies are also supported by the industry’s leading real-time engines, including Unity and Unreal, to help ensure smooth, comfortable, and responsive VR experiences on Radeon Pro Duo. „In developing 4K 360 VR content, the biggest hurdle is the tech, because as an artist, I just want to create and not worry about limitations of the hardware. Faced with raw, un-optimized content, VR creators need a lot more horsepower than VR consumers. With the new Radeon Pro Duo, I have performance in spades. I immediately saw a speed difference of up to 2X, allowing me to push the boundaries of my projects without having to compromise on creativity or productivity,” said Jonathan Winbush, Founder & Creative Director, Winbush.tv. The Radeon™ Pro Duo is designed to meet the stringent requirements of workstation form factors, comes with 24/7 support5, and is bolstered by professional-grade software certified across leading applications for media, entertainment, CAD and engineering. Radeon™ Pro Software offers users unprecedented driver stability, quality and reliability, with quarterly updates for features, performance and stability. The Radeon Pro Duo’s planned availability is the end of May at an expected SEP of US$999. Radeon Pro at NAB 2017 Along with the launch of the Radeon Pro Duo at NAB 2017, AMD is showing off a wide range of innovations for media and entertainment professionals: Professional color correction using BlackMagic Resolve powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Incredible real-time 360 video stitching and real-time VR preview using Radeon™ Loom and the HTC Vive, and powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Accelerated rendering performance in Blender using Radeon ProRender and „Out of Core” technology to access system memory for increased frame buffer capacity powered by the Radeon Pro Duo VR content creation using Radeon Pro Duo Real-time rendering at 4K resolution in Radeon ProRender powered by AMD’s next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG 8K video post-processing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017 enabled by AMD’s next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG Stunning VR experiences from Rewind and The Foundry’s Nuke running on Radeon™ Pro WX 7100 Demonstrations are available at the AMD booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, South Lower Hall, #SL7620, and in the Studio Xperience booth, also in the South Lower Hall, #SL2424.

Built on the capabilities of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100, the Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card is designed to excel at media and entertainment, broadcast, and design and manufacturing workflows, delivering outstanding performance and superior flexibility that today's creative professionals demand. The Radeon Pro Duo is equipped with 32GB of ultra-fast GDDR5 memory to handle larger data sets, more intricate 3D models, higher resolution videos, and complex assemblies with ease. Operating at a max power of 250W, the Radeon Pro Duo harnesses a total of 72 compute units (4608 stream processors) for a combined performance of up to 11.45 TFLOPS of single-precision compute performance on one board, and twice the geometry throughput of the Radeon™ Pro WX 7100.2 The Radeon Pro Duo enables professionals to work up to four 4K monitors at 60Hz, drive the latest 8K single monitor display at 30Hz using a single cable, or drive an 8K display at 60Hz using a dual cable solution. "Today's professional workflows continue to increase in complexity, often demanding that creators switch between a wide variety of applications to progress their work, pausing efforts in one application while computing resources are focused on another. We designed the Radeon Pro Duo to eliminate those constraints, empowering professionals to multi-task without compromise, dedicating GPU resources where and how they need them. It's a continuation of our promise for Radeon Pro: to provide greater choice in how professionals practice their craft, enabling superior multi-tasking, accelerated applications, and powerful solutions for advanced workloads like VR," said Ogi Brkic, general manager, professional graphics, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. Divide The Radeon Pro Duo's distinct dual-GPU design gives professionals the flexibility to divide and conquer their workloads, enabling smooth multi-tasking between applications by committing GPU resources to each. Professionals can maintain their creative momentum and get more done faster, allowing for a greater number of design iterations in the same time. "I was very impressed with the power of the Radeon Pro Duo, particularly in Nuke. The flexibility of being able to divide GPUs between tasks is phenomenal and represents the ultimate in multitasking: compositing a complex shot while jumping into a 3D application to create assets, exporting back to Nuke to keep compositing then switching to Photoshop or Mari and paint a projection, to load it back into Nuke and continue. The Radeon Pro Duo handles the general and varied tasks without missing a beat with excellent 3D performance. For the kind of projects I undertake as a generalist, the Radeon Pro Duo is a no-brainer. It does it all," said Kynan Stephenson, freelance artist. Accelerate The Radeon Pro Duo dramatically increases performance in today's most popular professional applications through support of multiple GPUs or plug-ins, speeding through tasks. On select professional applications, the Radeon Pro Duo delivers up to 2 times faster performance compared with the Radeon Pro WX 71003 and up to 2 times faster performance than the closest competing professional graphics card.1 Create The Radeon Pro Duo's potent combination of performance and dual-GPU flexibility makes it the ideal solution for today's advanced workloads, including professional VR content creation. VR represents a significant inflection point for the media and entertainment industry and is becoming more commonplace in today's studios. Radeon Pro Duo professional graphics card leverages the power of two GPUs to render out separate images for each eye, increasing VR performance over single GPU solutions by up to 50% in the SteamVR test.4 AMD's LiquidVR™ technologies are also supported by the industry's leading real-time engines, including Unity and Unreal, to help ensure smooth, comfortable, and responsive VR experiences on Radeon Pro Duo. "In developing 4K 360 VR content, the biggest hurdle is the tech, because as an artist, I just want to create and not worry about limitations of the hardware. Faced with raw, un-optimized content, VR creators need a lot more horsepower than VR consumers. With the new Radeon Pro Duo, I have performance in spades. I immediately saw a speed difference of up to 2X, allowing me to push the boundaries of my projects without having to compromise on creativity or productivity," said Jonathan Winbush, Founder & Creative Director, Winbush.tv. The Radeon™ Pro Duo is designed to meet the stringent requirements of workstation form factors, comes with 24/7 support5, and is bolstered by professional-grade software certified across leading applications for media, entertainment, CAD and engineering. Radeon™ Pro Software offers users unprecedented driver stability, quality and reliability, with quarterly updates for features, performance and stability. The Radeon Pro Duo's planned availability is the end of May at an expected SEP of US$999. Radeon Pro at NAB 2017 Along with the launch of the Radeon Pro Duo at NAB 2017, AMD is showing off a wide range of innovations for media and entertainment professionals: Professional color correction using BlackMagic Resolve powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Incredible real-time 360 video stitching and real-time VR preview using Radeon™ Loom and the HTC Vive, and powered by the new Radeon Pro Duo Accelerated rendering performance in Blender using Radeon ProRender and "Out of Core" technology to access system memory for increased frame buffer capacity powered by the Radeon Pro Duo VR content creation using Radeon Pro Duo Real-time rendering at 4K resolution in Radeon ProRender powered by AMD's next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG 8K video post-processing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017 enabled by AMD's next-generation Radeon™ Pro SSG Stunning VR experiences from Rewind and The Foundry's Nuke running on Radeon™ Pro WX 7100 Demonstrations are available at the AMD booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, South Lower Hall, #SL7620, and in the Studio Xperience booth, also in the South Lower Hall, #SL2424.

By Liam Tung | April 24, 2017 -- 12:02 GMT (05:02 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Unlike the Surface Pro, the Surbook runs on an Intel Apollo Lake processor, the cheaper alternative to the seventh-generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Image: Chuwi Chinese hardware maker Chuwi is launching a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 lookalike, but core specs suggest it will be a more affordable option. There's no shortage of Windows 10 2-in-1 devices that have taken inspiration from Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, from Samsung's enterprise Galaxy Book 12, Dell's new Latitude 5285, or Lenovo's affordable MiiX 510. They've all got Surface-like designs with a kickstand, keyboard, and stylus, but deviate from the Surface Pro 4 on some core specs. ed bott First look: Surface Pro 4 adds refinement and polish This hybrid device isn't for everyone, but the small changes add up to a significantly better user experience. Read More Chuwi, which has made several budget Surface-family alternatives, has now unveiled the "powerful but affordable" SurBook, a very close rendition of the Surface Pro 4's design. Like the Surface Pro 4, it features an aluminum body, detachable keyboard, stylus, and built-in kickstand. It also shares the Surface's screen specs with a 12.3 inch display at a 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution. Unlike the Surface Pro's Intel core m and Core i processors, the Surbook runs on an Intel Apollo Lake processor, the cheaper alternative to the seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors. Chuwi intends to launch a crowdfunding campaign shortly on Indiegogo and is currently offering to give away two devices under an early promotion for fans who can suggest a desirable feature. Other core features include 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and a 10,000mAh battery. Chuwi sent ZDNet additional specs. The device has a microSD slot, a five-megapixel (MP) rear camera and 2MP front camera, a USB Type-C port, two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, a mini HDMI port, and 3.5mm headphone jack. Wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The device will ship with Windows 10 Redstone. Chuwi hasn't revealed pricing yet but the choice of Apollo Lake suggests it will be cheaper than Microsoft's entry level Surface Pro 4. Chuwi is taking a somewhat similar approach to Finnish hardware startup Eve, which crowdfunded its Surface Pro 4 rival, the Eve V. The company raised $1.4m from backers for the device, which features near identical specs to the Surface Pro 4, but with Intel's seventh-generation processor. Eve is producing 2,000 devices for its backers. Eve played up the fact that Microsoft launched the device in 2015 with Intel's sixth-generation processors.

Only with a good foundation and iteration does something become the best at what it purports to be. The personal technology world is filled with examples of this. The iPhone, Google’s Android operating systems and the Sony PlayStation 4 are all iterations that improved on what they replaced. Four iterations of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon have offered decent battery life, a comfortable keyboard, and a decent display. Lenovo hopes that its ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 will be as close to perfect as the line of ultrabooks has gotten thus far. It just might be. Available now for as little as $1,329 on Lenovo.com, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 has lots of upgrades. New Thunderbolt 3 ports offer speedy file transfers. With them, charging the notebook takes less time than ever. A new precision touchpad experience grants you granular control of what you can do with a tap or swipe. Its software is free of unnecessary programs. Its display has bezels so small that Lenovo says this 14-inch portable powerhouse is roughly the size of a notebook with a 13-inch display. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 is also thinner and lighter than the notebooks that came before it. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 Review Summary Perfection is relative. Whether the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 is perfect for you depends on what your needs are. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 is the best thin, light professional grade Windows 10 laptop to arrive this year. That’s why it’s earned a Gotta Be Mobile Editor’s Choice Award. It’s not every day that computers come this light, this powerful and this well stocked with ports. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 Pros Thin & Light USB Type-C Glare-free Display Fingerprint Sensor Cons Price Fan Spews Hot Air on Your Mouse Hand The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 is the thin, light professional notebook that users need. Buy at Lenovo Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 Design Available in either black or silver, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon keeps its angled look from previous generations. It still resembles a carbon fiber wedge. The rear edge is a hard corner. The front is tapered to make you feel like you’re carrying a grade school binder. A silkscreened logo sits in one corner of the notebook, while a tilted ThinkPad logo that faces outward sits in the other. The red dot in this logo still glows when the notebook is awake and blinks if it is sleeping. What’s changed are the dimensions. This new notebook measures 0.63-inches from top to bottom. It replaces a laptop that was 0.65 inches thick and heavier. This new model weighs 2.49 pounds instead of the 2.57 pounds. Despite being thinner, this notebook is still as rigid as notebooks come. When closed, the carbon and magnesium alloy frame doesn’t flex. When open, the keyboard deck is flex free, too. Lenovo says that the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 has still managed to pass MIL-STD 810G military tests for humidity, shock, vibration and extreme temperatures. The spine of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 is almost entirely free of ports. There is one that’ll immediately catch your eye, a MicroSD and SIM card slot for adding storage and mobile internet connectivity to the notebook with ease. A single USB 3.0 port and headphone jack sit on the notebook’s right edge. USB 3.0, HDMI and Micro-Ethernet ports sit on the left edge. Also on the left edge are two Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C ports. Thunderbolt 3 offers very, very fast file transfers. That is, moving your pictures, music, movies and documents from the internal drive to an external drive takes a lot less time than it would with a USB 3.0 port. Thunderbolt 3 ports can handle 40GBs of information transfer per second. These ports are also notable for being versatile; they can also double as display connections. One charges the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 to 80% of its capacity in just one hour using the included adapter. Because Thunderbolt 3 is a relatively new standard, Lenovo wants to keep users safe. The ports have protection to keep the notebook from being fried by devices and cables that appear to meet the standard but don’t. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 Internals Our ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 came with the latest internals. Opening the notebook revealed the 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1080 resolution display with super-thin bezels. This display was crisp, clear and had great viewing angles. Lenovo doesn’t offer a touch option, though. At its heart was a 7th Generation Intel Core i7-600U processor and 16GB of RAM. Because there’s no room for a dedicated graphics card in a notebook this thin, the X1 Carbon comes with Intel HD 620 integrated graphics. Our model had 512GB of solid state storage from Samsung and 16GB of RAM – as much RAM as the notebook will handle. Lenovo offers a few choice upgrades to improve your experience. The ThinkPad X1 Caron 2017 can be configured with as much as 1TB of storage and a crisper 14-inch WQHD IPS display that has a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. That second display option and a Windows Hello camera that lets you log in with just a gaze won’t arrive as options until later this year. Almost no one will feel compelled to swing for that Windows Hello camera upgrade. The fingerprint reader in the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 is quick thanks to a built-in processor. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 Performance & Experience Almost every input method on this PC is fantastic. The single-button trackpad has a more satisfying click than did its predecessors. It’s also larger. Lenovo has turned over control of the trackpad drivers and software updates to Microsoft. New gestures and ways to navigate Windows 10 are updated automatically going forward. You decide what taps and swipes on the trackpad do in the Windows 10 Settings app. At long last trackpad utilities are a thing of the past. Palm rejection works fine. You won’t find yourself accidentally moving the mouse cursor when you type, for example. I’ve had the notebook not register a swipe or finger movement some, and it’s frustrating when it happens. The TrackPoint buttons have mechanical improvements designed to make them more comfortable. I think the effort made here paid off. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017’s keyboard does nothing to jeopardize the line’s place in my list of PCs that offer the best laptop keyboards. There’s lots of key travel and a satisfying click. Other companies making laptops this thin still have a lot to learn from Lenovo. There are plenty of thin PCs with terrible keyboards. Bad battery life also plagues notebooks in the same market as the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017. Lenovo estimates that this machine can reach as much as 15 hours on a single charge. In real world use, that means the web with two different browsers, editing images periodically and listening to music constantly, I reached about 10 hours. That was with the 80% of the display’s 300 nit brightness active. With 50% brightness, I was able to stream movies from Microsoft’s Movies & TV store for a full 14 hours before the system died on me. That’s without using the Battery Saver feature that Microsoft includes in Windows 10. I honestly believe that anyone can make it through their work day with this notebook. Built-in fast charging allows buyers to top off their battery conveniently fast, making battery life even less of a concern than it already was. Windows 10, and every productivity app that I could throw at this notebook, ran well thanks to the Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. Lenovo also gets credit for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017’s svelte software package. The company barely installs anything extra. In fact, the only useless apps were the games that Microsoft itself added to Windows 10 Pro. Only a few things bother me about the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017. This notebook is so thin that the display runs along the back of the keyboard deck. Instead of running out of the back, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon expels hot air through its right side. If you’re right handed, use a mouse and frequently have lots of tabs open in Chrome, expect warm knuckles as the machine forces hot air out its side. Fan noise bothered me, too. With nothing open, I could hear the notebook’s fan running six feet away. Other times browsing a few websites in Edge didn’t result in any fan noise at all. By no means do these two things ruin the notebook.

I don’t say this lightly: the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the best Ultrabook that you can purchase. It’s certainly the best Ultrabook I’ve come across since I reviewed the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2016 around this time a year ago, and I was a pretty big fan of that one as well. If you’re into gaming or really want a touchscreen, this machine isn’t for you. With a starting price of $1,329, it’s not for the budget conscious, either. For everyone else, this is the machine to beat. Are you looking for a notebook with great battery life? The ThinkPad X1 Carbon is perfect. Could you find a PC with mobile data useful? That’s on offer, too. Do you want ports that make docking to your entire setup as easy as plugging in a single cable? Are you someone that prizes a great typing experience above all else. This laptop delivers the goods. I don’t know if any piece of technology can ever be truly considered perfect. I do know that the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2017 has to be the closest any Ultrabook has come. I’d certainly be perfectly happy adding one to my own daily routine.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech Reviews / Razer Blade (Kaby Lake Core i7) with Razer Core / GTX 1080 Razer Blade (Kaby Lake Core i7) with Razer Core / GTX 1080 Leo Waldock 19 hours ago Featured Tech Reviews, Laptop / Mobile, Lifestyle, Mobile, Reviews Rating: 9.0. We began our recent review of the 2017 Razer Blade by telling you that Razer had updated the graphics chip from GTX 970M to GTX 1060. The laptop has continued to evolve and now it’s the turn of the CPU which has been changed from Intel Core i7-6700HQ Skylake to Core i7-7700HQ Kaby Lake. The only other change we found in the specification was a minor update from DDR4-2133MHz RAM to DDR4-2400MHz. As you will see in our video this means the revised Razer Blade is effectively unchanged. Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p60 HERE Razer Blade Kaby Lake Specification: Processor Intel Core i7-7700HQ Quad-Core (2.8GHz/3.8GHz) GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB GDDR5 VRAM System Memory 16 GB DDR4-2400MHz SSD 256GB Samsung PM961 PCIe M.2 Screen 14.0-inch IPS Full HD Matte, 1,920×1,080 resolution Wi-Fi Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth 4.1) Ports and connectors: Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) USB 3.0 port x3 (SuperSpeed) HDMI 2.0 video and audio output 3.5 mm headphone/microphone combo port Other features: Built-in 2Megapixel webcam Built-in stereo speakers Array microphone Dolby Digital Plus Home Theatre Edition 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI) Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) security chip embedded Anti-ghosting keyboard with per-key lighting powered by Razer Chroma Razer Synapse enabled with programmable keyboard, track pad, back lighting, and fan control Kensington security slot Compact 165W power adapter Battery Built-in 70Wh rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery Size 17.9 mm (Height) x 345 mm (Width) x 235 mm (Depth) Weight 1.89 kg Operating System Windows 10 64-bit We admire the quality of the hardware and love the look and feel of the aluminium chassis. Our sample came with a Full HD 1,920×1,080 2K display that looks superb, just like it did before. You won’t be surprised to hear that our list of Pro and Con points is almost exactly the same as before, with one minor change. Previously we failed to criticise the way the keyboard backlights provide a light show that looks great but which doesn’t light the characters on the keys. This can lead to a frustrating search for the @, ! or % key that really shouldn’t be necessary and we didn’t pay this sufficient heed in the previous review. So this is effectively the same laptop and that earns Razer another award from KitGuru, however that isn’t the basis for an interesting review. Happily the day was saved as Razer sent us its Core unit which is intended to be paired with the Razer Blade Stealth laptop to beef up the relatively feeble Intel HD Graphics 620 GPU. The idea is that you install a graphics card in the Core up to 310mm in length (either AMD or Nvidia works perfectly well) and then connect the Core to your laptop using the supplied Thunderbolt 3 cable. This prompts the Core to power up and act as both an external graphics unit and also as a docking hub. The Core provides 4x USB 3 ports along with Gigabit Ethernet and includes a 500W power unit with two 6+2 connectors that had no problem powering our reference GTX 1080. We installed the Razer GPU Switcher software in order that we could choose between the GTX 1060 GPU inside the laptop or the GTX 1080 in the Core, and then we were set to roll. Testing As you will see in our video the simple shift from GTX 1060 to GTX 1080 doesn’t make a massive difference to game play or frame rates. In 3D Mark you can see the graphics score leap forward but this doesn’t deliver much benefit in the real world. We started our testing with the Core and GTX 1080 powering the laptop display however this turned out to be a poor idea as the graphics data shares the Thunderbolt 3 cable with the data that is heading the other way. Disabling the laptop screen and outputting from the Core to an external display gave an increase of a handy 5-10 frames per second over the previous set-up. We then increased the screen resolution to 2,560×1,440 where we saw frame rates that were similar to those delivered by the basic laptop i.e. GTX 1060 on internal 2K display. Our final stop was to increase the resolution to 3,840×2,160 and weren’t massively impressed by the results as the laptop hardware wasn’t really up to the job. We had been able to comfortably play games at 1080p and now, after a massive graphics upgrade, we were now able to play the same games at 1440p which seems like a pretty lousy return for £1500. It was clear the Core unit was delivering the goods while the bottleneck was the 45W TDP mobile Kaby Lake CPU. This may sound like a terrible failure but actually highlights the importance of the CPU in a gaming laptop. We have seen high end laptops with dual GTX 1080s that struggle to perform and know full well that desktop CPUs give an edge you simply don’t get with a mobile chip. On a more positive note our testing convinced us that Razer has chosen a sensible pairing of CPU and GPU as the GTX 1060 is an excellent graphics chip for a high end mobile CPU. Cooling Performance. Thermal images showing the laptop idling and then with CPU and internal GTX 1060 under full load. And these thermal images show the laptop with the external GTX 1080 doing the heavy lifting. As you can see, the Core housing allows the GTX 1080 to remain lovely and cool. We didn’t discuss cooling in the video however there are a couple of points of interest. The first is that this Kaby Lake model has higher idle temperatures for the CPU and GPU than we saw with the previous Skylake model. Loaded temperatures are the same so we have to conclude that Razer has adjusted the fan curve to reduce low load noise. Secondly, and more interestingly, when we used the Core with GTX 1080 this removed the load from the GTX 1060 GPU inside the laptop. This reduced the loaded CPU temperature from 88 degrees C to 69 degrees C, which shows how much effect the GPU has on the cooling of the CPU. Acoustics performance. Razer Blade continues to be fairly noisy under load but we don’t have much in the way of complaints. This is a very slender laptop that packs a decent CPU and GPU and the result is a certain amount of heat. Razer deals with this as well as can be expected so while we would like the Blade to be silent we accept this is not possible and will instead put up with the noise that is produced. Closing Thoughts. The Razer Blade continues to be superb. While we found the Razer Core graphics housing to be interesting and to work superbly well, it ultimately proved irrelevant. Yes, you can add a better graphics chip to the Razer Blade but the benefit you gain is marginal and the cost is prohibitive. Comparing the new, slightly revised Razer Blade with Kaby Lake CPU to the recent, slightly lesser Razer Blade with Skylake is fairly pointless. The two laptops are effectively identical and while the Kaby Lake offers a slightly faster CPU we would happily buy the Skylake if we found it on sale at a discount. We have to assume that Razer will update the Blade when the 8th Gen Intel Coffee Lake CPU comes down the pipe, however we see no reason to think this will require a major change to the hardware. Give or take, one way or the other, Razer Blade is the definitive 14-inch laptop for 2017.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 04.24.17. 04.24.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The Race To Build An AI Chip For Everything Just Got Real Getty Images Yann LeCun once built an AI chip called ANNA. But he was 25 years ahead of his time. The year was 1992, and LeCun was a researcher at Bell Labs, the iconic R&D lab outside New York City. He and several other researchers designed this chip to run deep neural networks—complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data—but ANNA never reached the mass market. Neural networks were pretty good at recognizing letters and numbers scrawled onto personal checks and envelopes, but they didn’t work all that well when performing other tasks, at least not in any practical sense. Today, however, neural networks are rapidly transforming the internet’s biggest players, including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. LeCun now oversees the central artificial intelligence lab inside Facebook, where neural networks identify faces and objects in photos, translate from one language to another, and so much more. Twenty-five years later, LeCun says, the market very much needs chips like ANNA. And these chips will soon arrive in large numbers. Related Video All of the Big News from Facebook’s F8 2017 Google recently built its own AI chip, called the TPU, and this is widely deployed inside the massive data centers that underpin the company’s online empire. There, packed into machines by the thousands, the TPU helps with everything from identifying commands spoken into Android smartphones to choosing results on the Google search engine. But this is just the start of a much bigger wave. As CNBC revealed last week, several of the original engineers behind the Google TPU are now working to build similar chips at a stealth startup called Groq, and the big-name commercial chip makers, including Intel, IBM, and Qualcomm, are pushing in the same direction. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft can still run their neural networks on standard computer chips, known as CPUs. But since CPUs are designed as all-purpose processors, this is terribly inefficient. Neural networks can run faster and consume less power when paired with chips specifically designed to handle the massive array of mathematical calculations these AI systems require. Google says that in rolling out its TPU chip, it saved the cost of building about 15 extra data centers. Now, as companies like Google and Facebook push neural networks onto phones and VR headsets—so they can eliminate the delay that comes when shuttling images to distant data centers—they need AI chips that can run on personal devices, too. “There is a lot of headroom there for even more specialized chips that are even more efficient,” LeCun says. In other words, the market for AI chips is potentially enormous. That’s why so many companies are jumping into the mix. Tech Specialists After acquiring a startup called Nervana, Intel is now building a chip specifically for machine learning. IBM is too, creating a hardware architecture that mirrors the design of a neural network. And more recently, Qualcomm has started building chips specifically for executing neural networks, according to LeCun, who is familiar with Qualcomm’s plans because Facebook is helping the chip maker develop technologies related to machine learning. Qualcomm vice president of technology Jeff Gehlhaar confirms the project. “We’re very far along in our prototyping and development,” he says. Meanwhile, nVidia is apparently pushing into the same area. Just last month, the Silicon Valley chip maker hired Clément Farabet, who explored this kind of chip architecture while studying under LeCun at NYU and went on to found a notable deep learning startup called Madbits, which was acquired by Twitter in 2014. nVidia is already a dominant force in the world of AI. Before companies like Google and Facebook can use a neural network to, say, translate from one language to another, they must first train it for this particular task, feeding it an enormous collection of existing translations. nVidia makes the GPU chips that are typically used to accelerate this training stage. “For training, GPUs basically have cornered the market, particularly nVidia GPUs,” LeCun says. But Farabet’s arrival may indicate that much like Qualcomm, nVidia is also exploring chips that can execute neural networks once they’re trained. Related Stories Cade Metz Facebook’s Augmented Reality Engine Brings AI Right to Your Phone Cade Metz Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers Cade Metz Google, Facebook, and Microsoft Are Remaking Themselves Around AI GPUs—or graphics processing units—were not designed for AI. They were designed for rendering graphics. But about five years ago, companies like Google and Facebook started using them for neural network training, just because they were the best option for the task, and LeCun believes they will continue to play this role. Coders and companies are now so familiar with GPUs, he says, and they have all the tools needed to use them. “[GPUs] are going to be very hard to unseat,” he says, “because you need an entire ecosystem.” But he also believes that a new breed of AI chips will significantly change the way the big internet companies execute neural networks, both in the data center and on consumer devices—everything from phones to smart lawn mowers and vacuum cleaners. As Google’s TPUs have shown, dedicated AI chips can bring a whole new level of efficiency in data centers, especially as demand for image recognition services increases. In executing neural networks, they can burn less electrical power and generate less heat. “If you don’t want to boil a small lake, you might need specialized hardware,” LeCun quips. Meanwhile, as virtual and augmented reality become more pervasive, phones and headsets will need similar chips. As Facebook explained last week in unveiling its new augmented reality tools, this kind of technology requires neural networks that can recognize the world around you. But augmented reality systems can’t afford to run this AI back in the data center. Sending all that imagery over the internet takes too long, ruining the effect of the simulated reality. As Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer explains, Facebook is already starting to lean on GPUs and other chips, called digital signal processors, for some tasks. But in the long run, devices will surely include an entirely new breed of chip. The need is there. And chipmakers are racing to fill it. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

The PMS scheme has given 36.8% annualised returns in the past 5 years, beating the benchmark Nifty by 25 percentage points. However, experts feel small investors should stay away from portfolio management services (PMS). The large ticket size (the minimum investment is `25 lakh) is a deterrent. Further, most PMS schemes have only matched the performance of the best performing equity diversified funds. The PMS structure and investing philosophy may not suit the risk appetite of the average investor. "PMS is mainly for seasoned HNIs who understand direct equity well," says Tarun Birani, Founder & CEO, TBNG Capital Advisors. Small investors find SIP investments through mutual funds to be more rewarding. PMS managers themselves say that investors should not enter this space unless they are ready for the risks. Unlike mutual funds, PMS can levy higher charges, though competition keep the charges within a reasonable band. PMS charges can be a fixed fees or a profit-sharing arrangement based on fund performance. Porinju Veliyath's Equity Intelligence, for instance, charges a fixed anagement fee of 2% per year, and additional performance fees of 10% of the returns above 10% per annum. Experts say that since the PMS manager has his skin in the game in the profit-sharing model, it helps generate alpha. There is also an exit load if you withdraw early . According to portfolio managers, higher charges are incurred only if the portfolio is churned too often. "We typically hold stocks for 4-5 years and our churn rate is only 15%, compared to 100% for mutual funds," says Sonthalia. However, some experts say that PMS should not be compared with mutual funds at all, because the two are very different.

When the company announced its Snapdragon-for-Windows-10 plans in December 2016, the company said “The first devices running the full Windows 10 experience based on Snapdragon processors are expected to be commercially available in the second half of 2017.” But in last week's Q2 2017 earnings call, CEO Steve Mollenkopf said “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into Mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year.” Also on the call Mollenkopf said, adding that “We remain on track for commercial shipments of our server processors by the end of the calendar year and we continue to receive good feedback from our customers.” Previously the company had said we could expect that kit by the latter half of 2017. Qualcomm announced its plans to build Windows-10-capable Snapdragons in December 2016. It's since worked with Microsoft to port Windows Server to ARM. Mollenkopf told financial analysts the company still feels “we have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the datacenter.” If the company can't start that disruption of the PC space by Christmas, that opportunity will shrink because PC sales are declining and ARM CPUs offer little obvious advantage for PC users. Microsoft and Qualcomm think they're on a winner because the planned CPUs and SOCs should be power-misers. But they'll also have to run either Universal Windows Apps, x86 emulation or API bridging to ensure users can run the apps they use on other Windows devices. If that's not done flawlessly, Qualcomm-powered PCs have a strong chance of becoming an historical footnote to rank with the unloved and unmourned Windows RT. ® Tips and corrections 17 Comments MORE Qualcomm Arm Windows 10 More from The Register BlackBerry wins $814m Qualcomm patent-cap arbitration Besties still 4 Comments Apple goes global in Qualcomm license war: Patent spat hits China One-billion Yuan lawsuit in Middle Kingdom alleges further royalty wrongdoings 11 Comments Qualcomm takes $1bn BlackBerry bite like a champ, struts away Patent royalty check dings profits but nothing Snapdragon biz can't handle 3 Comments Ha ha, OK, fun's over.

However as we all found out, Darwin will still built and maintained on Intel, as it was a very secretive plan B, in case something went wrong with the PowerPC platform. Being portable had saved NeXT before, and now it would save Apple. So with this little background, and a lot of stumbling around in the dark, I came up with some steps, that have permitted me to build the Darwin 0.1 kernel under DR2. This is beyond awesome.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Sponsored Intel and VentureBeat shine a spotlight on game developers VB Staff April 24, 2017 3:30 PM Presented by Intel Debut articles in the highly anticipated collaboration between VentureBeat (VB) and Intel are about to start rolling out. The first posts flying the “Developer Spotlight” banner will be available on the PC Gaming Channel of VentureBeat’s GamesBeat section, starting on April 25. Because each game developer has a unique story to tell, the Developer Spotlight series will showcase some of today’s most innovative and inspiring game developers. New and established game makers alike will find something to take from this look at the ins and outs of the development process, and gamers will get a backstage peek at what goes into building their favorite titles. In 2017, game development has reached an amazing level whereby anyone could construct an entertaining, compelling, and lucrative game. Whether an established studio with a multimillion-dollar budget and dozens of employees crafting the next Triple-A blockbuster, or a small coalition of developers spread around the globe, working out of their homes to create an “indie” title using a limited budget generated by a crowdfunding campaign, high-powered creative tools can now be used to make photorealistic scenes and characters; render detailed, movie-like animations; and formulate rich story presentations. Some of these tools — such as the Unity and Unreal game engines — are available for free, so game-makers can start building products right away and for no initial or up-front cost (that’s because a studio only needs to pay for those tools when it starts selling a finished product). Making software available in this way supports the evolution of a game-making democracy, allowing more creators to participate in developing new games. All developers, however, from the biggest studios to the smallest collectives, face many of the same challenges when it comes to making a game, including imagining a viable game idea; deciding which tools and resources are need to create the new game; designing all aspects of how the new game will look, sound, and play; verifying that the game works as designed, testing, tweaking, and polishing as needed; establishing how the game will be released to gamers; and, finally, determining how the game will make money. In this series, the featured developers will discuss how they guided their product through this game-making process, the obstacles that can be found in the contemporary game industry — as well as how to get past them — and how to get products to market and into gamers’ hands. Among the studios that will be covered in the Developer Spotlight profiles are: Freejam Games was founded by five veteran game developers, and has since grown to a team of 40. The UK-based studio’s primary project has been Robocraft, a free-to-play robot-building/driving/combat game that first launched in 2013. It’s been extensively updated, and upgraded with new items, new maps, and new gameplay modes, since its release. High-Voltage Software is a veteran game-developer, headquartered near Chicago. It’s the studio behind the Hunter: The Reckoning series, and has done work for 2K Games, Activision, Microsoft, Sega, and Ubisoft. Most recently, it created the virtual-reality titles Damaged Core and Dragon Front for Oculus. Southern California-based Insomniac Games has more than two decades of game creation under its belt, with games that include well-known franchises (Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet & Clank, Resistance), and interesting experiments (Fuse, Sunset Overdrive, Song of the Deep). The company is currently working on the next Spider-Man title for PlayStation 4 — its first foray into developing a game from a licensed brand. Telltale Games, located in Northern California’s Marin County, is best known for taking high-profile movie and TV licenses — including Back to the Future, Game of Thrones, Jurassic Park, and The Walking Dead — and turning them into deep episodic games with story arcs that branch off from the originals. The Intel/VentureBeat content project will launch just ahead of the upcoming GamesBeat Summit (held May 1–2 at the Claremont Club & Spa Hotel in Berkeley, California, and sponsored in part by Intel). GamesBeat Summit attendees will be able to meet and learn from experienced members of the Intel® Game Dev Program.

ADVERTISEMENT “While I have said throughout this process that I do not believe a waiver is necessary for this nominee, I have, at the same time, pledged my support to working with our committee colleagues on the issue so long as it was kept separate from unrelated demands," Hatch in a statement on Monday. Democrats have insisted that Lighthizer needs the House and the Senate to approve a waiver because he represented foreign governments in trade negotiations or disputes in 1985 and 1991. Committee approval of those items is expected to be followed by a Hatch colloquy on the Senate floor where he will agree to take action at the committee level on a bill that would protect healthcare and pension benefits of more than 22,000 retired coal miners, an aide told The Hill.  Hatch has expressed frustration with Democrats' demand that the coal miners' bill be attached to a waiver for Lighthizer.  Democrats have repeatedly urged Hatch to take action on the miners' legislation before taking up the Lighthizer nomination. Congress passed a four-month extension of miners’ benefits in December, but that short-term patch is set to expire at the end of the week. Lighthizer is expected to win approval from the Senate panel.  Tags Orrin Hatch Ron Wyden Robert Lighthizer Office of the United States Trade Representative Senate Finance Committee   View the discussion thread.

Ron WydenRon WydenTrump to impose tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber State removes post highlighting Trump Mar-a-Lago resort Lighthizer expected to win committee approval to lead trade office MORE (Ore.) said in a statement Monday, according to The Daily Beast. "For this investigation to be successful, the committee must recognize the enormity of the job and provide the resources to tackle it." ADVERTISEMENT Reports emerged Sunday that the Senate Intelligence Committee has no full-time staff members dedicated to the probe and that those working on it have no investigative experience. The panel has also reportedly scheduled no interviews with any major figures related to Russia's influence campaign. The Daily Beast first reported on the committee’s progress, saying it seems to be moving slower than similar efforts by other panels. “It’s either a real investigation or not,” an individual with knowledge of the committee’s activities said. “You have to have an approved investigative guide.” “You have to make it formal. Can you have a credible investigation with only seven part-time staffers doing everything in secret?” The committee announced earlier that seven staff members had been assigned to review documents relating to its investigation. The Daily Beast noted that the panel plans to add two more staffers soon, one with extensive legal skills. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a committee member, earlier Monday defended its investigation so far. “Reports about #Russia probe are wrong,” he tweeted. “Don’t confuse silence for lack of results. Intel Cmte must conduct classified investigations quietly.” Reports emerged Monday that “partisan divisions” between members are undercutting the panel’s work.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Doubts have arisen about the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's election interference, according to The Daily Beast. No interviews with individuals key to possible ties between President Donald Trump and Russia have been interviewed, and no staff members are focused on the probe full time, three officials told the Daily Beast. "It's either a real investigation or it's not. You have to have an approved investigative guide. You have to make it formal. Can you have a credible investigation with only seven part-time staffers, doing everything in secret?" one official said. "The biggest obstacle now for a serious investigation into Trump-Russia ties is dedicated resources for staffing," one source with committee ties told the Daily Beast. Also, the seven staffers lack experience as either prosecutors or legislators. "I don't see how you can do this without trained investigators and prosecutors. I think you need to have expertise on the Intel side and on the prosecution side. You would ideally need someone who knows how to do a counterintelligence operation," according to Scott Horton, an attorney focused on corruption with a Soviet Union specialization. "I don't think they're deploying the resources that are necessary to do a real investigation," Horton said. The committee has gained access for five aides — three Republicans, two Democrats — to review the U.S. intelligence community's raw data. They have also interviewed intelligence analysts who concluded that Russia did interfere in the 2016 election. The committee has not questioned anyone over suspicion of colluding with Russia. They have not requested emails, memos, or phone records of the Trump campaign or set a deadline to get that information. The panel's Republican Chairman Richard Burr will not sign letters from Democrats to call for that information, according to Yahoo News. Sen. Ron Wyden last month sent a letter to the Republican and Democrat committee leaders, asking them to probe for financial ties between Russia, Trump, and Trump's associates. The letter appeared to imply that the committee was not already doing so, according to the Daily Beast report. Members of the committee itself are looking for efforts to ramp up. "I would like to see this moving more quickly," said Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) , according to Yahoo.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Cor blimey, love a duck, and stone the crows: Activision have announced that the next Call of Duty game will be Call of Duty: WWII [official site]. Their official announcement says about as much as the leak which gave this away four weeks ago. Another supposed leak has sprung with unconfirmed babbling about unsurprising things like D-Day and a co-op mode. But what’s most important is that ↑ teaser artwork up there. What’s going on with the man we shall assume is named Robert Gunnington? Activision’s page has that picture of Robert along with a countdown to a “worldwide reveal livestream” at 6pm on Wednesday, April 26th. CoD fansite Charlie Intel has some snaps of what’s supposedly leaked Australian marketing materials pegging the game for a November 3rd release. The gubbins gabs about visiting Normandy D-Day and jaunting across iconic battles, as well as a co-op mode with “a new and original story”. That co-op is called a “next-level standalone game experience” (next-level!) but the description’s vague enough that it could describe just about anything. None of that is confirmed, though none would be surprising. No, for cold hard facts we’re only got Robert Gunnington. And… Pip noticed a hint of something reflected in his pupils: Go a bit closer and we see shapes which might be a couple fellas and their dog staring at a road sign. Let’s go closer: Or a crucifixion?

At some point very soon Ubisoft is going to figure out that since all their games are essentially the same now (open world icon hunts) they can set them in the same universe – meaning it’s all ‘creeds from here on out. Far Cryed, Wildlanded, Watch Dog-peed, Steepeed, Just Danc-eed, For Honoureed, The Crew-eed. Just imagine, you get all A+ ranks in Just Dance (I have not actually played the game, so insert appropriate ranking method) and the post credit scene has you waking from the asbergo machine, getting a high-five from your mildly attractive assassin handler for stopping the Templar plan of controlling the world through pop media.

Mark Warner and Richard M. Burr are slowly plodding ahead. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call file photo) Niels Lesniewski @Niels Lesniewski Posted Apr 24, 2017 3:11 PM Save for later Democrats may be frustrated about the pace of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but recent reports of trouble could be overblown. A congressional source familiar with the committee’s work noted in particular the reported concerns about the Intelligence panel not having a full time staff for the investigation. The individuals detailed to work on the probe are spending roughly 95 percent of their time working on Russia’s activities in the United States, the source said. The Daily Beast had reported that there were just seven “part-time” staff members working on the Russia probe. There is reason for frustration about the lack of process, which is said to be shared in part by Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia, the Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, said a person familiar with the senator’s views. A source said there would be complications getting additional staff members the needed clearances and access from intelligence agencies to documents that had previously only been accessible to the “gang of eight” — the group of top congressional and intelligence committee leaders. Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican involved in the investigation, responded to the reports with a Monday afternoon Tweet. “Reports about #Russia probe are wrong. Don’t confuse silence for lack of progress. Intel Cmte must conduct classified investigations quietly,” Lankford said. Before the two-week Easter recess, Intelligence Chairman Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Warner appeared together to signal unity on the plan for the investigation. “I’ll do something I’ve never done. I’ll admit that I voted for him. We always hide who we vote for,” Burr said at a news conference. “That’s part of the democratic process, but I’ve got a job in the United States Senate, and I take that job extremely seriously. It overrides any personal beliefs that I have or loyalties that I might have.” Following the work of the Senate Intelligence panel can be maddening because it conducts its work in such a secretive manner, for obvious national security reasons. But aides on both sides of the aisle said Monday that it was their understanding the bipartisan work was continuing. No one should be hoping for or expecting a quick result. A source said the committee has now finished a first round of interviews with analysts from within the intelligence community, a process that will lead the committee staff to speak with additional people from the intelligence community this week. The Intelligence Committee has not seen high-profile public hearings with figures from the Trump campaign or the transition, which may be some of the source of the frustrations that have begun to emerge with Burr. According to a report from Yahoo! News, Burr has thus far declined to sign letters requesting e-mails and other records from President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign operation that might (or might not) point toward collusion between campaign officials and Russian operatives. Burr’s office declined to comment for this story in response to the reported criticism. Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.

So the software giant plans to make less expensive hardware available to the education market, according to tech news site Windows Central. Microsoft's idea is to help hardware partners build cheaper hardware running Windows 10 for schools. The goal is to challenge Google Chromebooks, have done extremely well with schools. Microsoft's existing Surface laptops and tablets have been well reviewed, but they start at $799 for the Surface Pro 4 to $1,499 for the Surface Book without software. Chromebooks, by contrast, can be had for as little as $179, ranging up to $499. Citing a confidential Microsoft (msft) document, Windows Central lists minimum specifications for a new "Cloudbook." The laptop would run an Intel (intc) quad-core processor with 4GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. One of the goals for the computer is that it have a battery that lasts all day (there are a limited number of plugs in classrooms, after all). In addition to the usual keyboard , it may also come with the option of a touch screen or the ability to use a stylus to write or enter data directly on the screen. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter The new details follows months of reports Microsoft plans a new foray into education. Schools may have budget shortages, but they are an important market for software and hardware companies that want to get people to use their products early. Students who learn to use one kind of computer tend to stick to that computer (and software) for years, which is why Microsoft, Google (goog), and Apple see value in pursuing the education market. In fact, Apple blazed the trail here in the 1990s with its K-12 discount programs for schools. "Education is the on-ramp to college which is the on-ramp to work," said Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy, an Austin, Tex., research and consulting firm. What's happened in recent years is that Google Chromebook has not only replaced Windows notebooks and desktops, but also Apple (aapl) iPads and Macs, he added via email. "It's not just about the hardware, it's about the management too. Google currently offers very compelling and nearly-free services to educators," Moorheaad said. "Microsoft does need to respond to the threat." These new Cloudbooks may be what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will trot out at a planned May 2 event in New York City.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Cor blimey, love a duck, and stone the crows: Activision have announced that the next Call of Duty game will be Call of Duty: WWII [official site]. Their official announcement says about as much as the leak which gave this away four weeks ago. Another supposed leak has sprung with unconfirmed babbling about unsurprising things like D-Day and a co-op mode. But what’s most important is that ↑ teaser artwork up there. What’s going on with the man we shall assume is named Robert Gunnington? Activision’s page has that picture of Robert along with a countdown to a “worldwide reveal livestream” at 6pm on Wednesday, April 26th. CoD fansite Charlie Intel has some snaps of what’s supposedly leaked Australian marketing materials pegging the game for a November 3rd release. The gubbins gabs about visiting Normandy D-Day and jaunting across iconic battles, as well as a co-op mode with “a new and original story”. That co-op is called a “next-level standalone game experience” (next-level!) but the description’s vague enough that it could describe just about anything. None of that is confirmed, though none would be surprising. No, for cold hard facts we’re only got Robert Gunnington. And… Pip noticed a hint of something reflected in his pupils: Go a bit closer and we see shapes which might be a couple fellas and their dog staring at a road sign. Let’s go closer: Or a crucifixion? Probably not. We’ll need heavy-duty technology for this. I turned to the Deep Dream Generator and uncovered startling truths reflected in that pupil: Do you see? Taxis, orangutans, dimetrodons, and laboratory equipment. We’ll find out on Wednesday how that all fits into World War 2.

At some point very soon Ubisoft is going to figure out that since all their games are essentially the same now (open world icon hunts) they can set them in the same universe – meaning it’s all ‘creeds from here on out. Far Cryed, Wildlanded, Watch Dog-peed, Steepeed, Just Danc-eed, For Honoureed, The Crew-eed. Just imagine, you get all A+ ranks in Just Dance (I have not actually played the game, so insert appropriate ranking method) and the post credit scene has you waking from the asbergo machine, getting a high-five from your mildly attractive assassin handler for stopping the Templar plan of controlling the world through pop media. Bring up the real-life downfall of MTV for some pseusdo-reality tie-in and setup the sequel where Michael Jackson is an alien, elder, or whatever they are.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman No More Compromise Between Price and Efficiency: Elecard Provides Support of AV1 Implemented in Its Flagship Product, StreamEye CUPERTINO, Calif., April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The rapidly increasing demands of IT industry drive a need for an open mainstream codec without excessive patent licensing fees which ensures fast streaming of 4K video while reducing the amount of bandwidth. The stiff challenge was taken by the Alliance for Open Media, a consortium including industry giants such as Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Netflix. The joint efforts have led to the creation of a royalty-free codec – AV1 which can boast a number of winning features, such as advanced performance, compression efficiency and compatibility to any modern device at a required bandwidth. It is projected to provide a considerable quality advantage over HEVC, with estimated improvement to reach 25%. Andrey Pozdnyakov, the founder and president of Elecard Group, explains, „The quality of intra frames encoding is striking, almost all intra blocks in AV1 are encoded more efficiently than in HEVC, with a similar partitioning. Asymmetric Numeral Systems coding by Jarek Duda brought an entropy coding mechanism which is many times faster and simpler than CABAC.” It is hard to overestimate the importance of AV1 global distribution for easier, cheaper and faster streaming of video content.  Elecard believes that this emerging format will boost the development of the streaming industry and the team is ready to support its further expansion. „The Elecard AV1 suite of analyzer solutions will help accelerate the debug and design cycles, allowing for better time to market. We are perfectly positioned to answer the demand from a technology and support perspective. This royalty-free open source codec will be fully supported by Elecard – an aggressive business strategy will be designed to enable the AV1 ecosystem,” comments Marc Clément, Vice-President of Sales and Marketing.

Latest News  Uncover Cezanne and Zola in “Cezanne et moi” Pros and Cons of Tech in 2017: An Interview with Prof. Tom Conte Houstonian Tales: Shonnie Murrell Log inorRegister FOLLOW FPH Home NEWS MUSIC ART FILM VIDEO MORE Art Editorial Entertainment Film Featured Events Food and Drink FPSF Local and State Music News SPORTS DESK POLITICS Advertise with FPH Day for Night Fest  Added on April 24, 2017 Russel Gardin innovation , Moore's Law , Technology , VPN No Comments Pros and Cons of Tech in 2017: An Interview with Prof. Tom Conte Decrease Font SizeIncrease Font SizeText SizePrint This PageSend by Email Early last year, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers revealed the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, a group dedicated to “identifying trends and developing the roadmap for all of the related technologies in the computer industry.” Following a SXSW keynote on the future of the tech industry, Georgia Tech professor Tom Conte spoke with Free Press Houston to discuss the history of Moore’s Law, why the industry needs to move past it, and how we can protect ourselves from the invasion of Internet privacy.   Free Press Houston: I will admit, before preparing for this interview I had no idea what Moore’s Law is. Can you talk about it and its significance, or perhaps the importance that it used to serve? Tom Conte: So, Gordon Moore is one of the founders of Intel, along with Boy Noyce. In 1965 [Moore] realized that the semiconductor industry was following a certain trend where the cost of transistors were getting half as expensive every two years. Sometimes the number changed to one-and-a-half years, and sometimes it’s been a little higher than two years, but it was usually pretty steady. For a long time, the way you made them cheaper was to make them smaller, and when you made a smaller transistor, you made a faster transistor. So Moore’s Law, for a lot of people, had been interpreted to mean computers get twice as fast every two years.   FPH: What exactly are you trying to do by “surpassing” Moore’s Law? Conte: Well, let’s talk about the problem. In 1995, it turned out that, even though the transistors were getting smaller, wires were getting longer. You have to charge up a wire to use it, so the wires started to dominate. So we started to slow down of the transistor wires by doing tricks in microprocessor design. Those tricks would do crazy things, I’ll just put it that way. Nobody knew. I mean, only a thousand people or so around the world knew what we were doing. In 2005, the fun ended. We hit a wall where we could clock the transistors faster to a point where we were clocking in at 1GHz, and they were dissipating 2(W/cm)^2. So to put 2(W/cm)^2 into perspective, that’s the same power density as an operating nuclear reactor core. It’s hard to get rid of that much heat, right? So what we had to do with Moore’s Law kept on giving us more transistors for the same price. We weren’t using them any faster, so we started to put down microprocessors with multiple cores, and if you look, most laptops and cellphones advertise how many cores they have. But that didn’t really speed up general programs, it only makes things faster when you have two completely independent things. So Moore’s Law effectively — not Moore’s Law, but the computer performance — effective ended. They were detonated. Since that time we’ve been trying to figure out other fundamentally different ways to compute that we could use to continue this exponential growth in computer performance or anyway to want to continue that is fundamental improvement in the human condition in every aspect of life. It isn’t just your iPhone, it’s anything from medical diagnosis to telecommunications to how your car runs. I mean, every single aspect of life was improved because of that, so we need to get back back on track then, right? So in 2012 I helped launch IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It was an effort to look at fundamentally different ways to compute. We call it rebooting computing. And since that time we’ve been holding summits of experts, trying to exchange ideas, and we’ve come up with some cool ways to compute. Things like computing using devices that operate similar to how the brain is wired. Another one that people have heard a lot about is quantum computing, so computing using, in essence, the parallel universe nature of quantum physics. There are a lot of interesting ways we can compute. The question now is, how do we build all of that? Because the semiconductor industry keeps giving us the same kind of transistors. We don’t want that, we want something different that will let us build these unique kinds of computers. So that’s what the group is about, it’s about taking applications that we care about, like voice recognition and self-driving cars, and figuring out how the novel computers, how they have to work, and then figuring out how individual transistors we need to make to make it work.   FPH: What exactly is the IRDS? Conte: That’s the roadmap. That’s our entirety as a roadmap, the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems. By systems we mean computer systems; by devices we mean transistors and others things made of silicon or whatnot. We’re trying to link the two, and say, if we want to have a self-driving car that runs on a tablespoon of gasoline, or maybe 2 AA batteries — this is kind of silly, because they won’t — in other words, some extremely efficient way that’s extremely likely. We have to figure out how to get to build independent devices. We need to make that happen.   FPH: Do you feel that right now younger generations are where they need to be in terms of enthusiasm about tech innovation? Conte: That’s a good question. You know, I teach at Georgia Tech, which is one of those “egg-head” places. I teach freshman and sophomore up to graduate students, and the enthusiasm I feel is really strong among them. There’s a whole generation of tinkerers and hackers coming forward. These are people that started with gaming console, building a gaming computer, or just playing on their phones and figuring out how to go further. I mean, they are doing incredible things. It started with Lego Mindstorms and building robotics, and again, they kept on pushing the limit. It’s amazing, the kind of enthusiasm that this generation has. I think it’s fundamentally higher than others, and I’ve been in academia for coming on two decades. There’s no stigma attached to playing with computers. It’s not only fine, it’s cool to to try to make computers do something interesting. Back in the day, it was for the ultra-nerds who put on a beanie hat with a propellor on top; now, this generation has really embraced it. It’s great.   FPH: When the excitement occasionally lowers, what keeps you motivated to continue what you do? Conte: I really think it is the students. When I’m feeling down I go talk to some of the students or walk through a lab and see their enthusiasm. It makes me feel better, because, like I said, the enthusiasm in the next generation is really high.   FPH: I wanted to get your opinion on the recent controversy of congress and internet security, and the urgency of setting up a VPN; Is the problem as severe as the media has made it out to be? Is our privacy really for sale? Conte: So, the President, as you might now, signed a law that lets our ISP’s collect our browsing history, so for me, that’s an incredible invasion of privacy. I don’t know about you, but I’m running through a VPN, so that they can’t get ahold of it. I don’t want anyone to collect information about what I’m browsing. It just doesn’t make sense. They might as well put a meter in my bedroom. I mean, it’s way too private for me.   FPH: How is that information sold? Who is the typical buyer? Conte: Marketers. If they know what you’re browsing, they know what you’re interested in. They can start to do even more targeted marketing. You would contact AT&T, for example, and say “Who in Northeast Atlanta is interested in this? What are they interested in? Tell me what this one particular house is interested in, and we’re going to try to get him to buy targeted products.” I don’t want someone making up my mind for me, do you know what I mean?   FPH: It seems as if people like Elon Musk are modern rockstars. Do you think there is anything wrong with how quick he is trying to change the game of conventional innovation, whether that be with Tesla and SpaceX, perhaps even SolarCity? Conte: Well, it’s a self-fulfilling — I don’t want to say prophecy, it’s more anticipation. Having computers get faster and faster does more and more things, and people become to expect it. There is a lot of enthusiasm from trying to figure out how to keep that going. It’s a great time to get into computers because everything is about to change. We’re trying out novel things, stuff we haven’t really changed since the 40’s It’s an exciting time in the sense of people wanting to push the limit. Let me tell you another story. I tell it every now and then. Do you remember when I said since 2005 computers haven’t really been getting that much faster? I’ve had members of my family come to me and say “I’ve bought a new laptop, and it’s no faster than the one from five years ago. Why?” It’s finally dawning on people that, “Hey, there’s something going on.” I think it’s starting to sink into the zeitgeist that we have this bubbling catastrophe coming soon, so we have to do something about it.   FPH: Besides Moore’s Law, what is something that is critical for the public to do more research on that media is not covering? Conte: I think, really, the security issues we have, and just securing communications and transactions. You don’t need an alarm system today in your house, because that’s not where the money is, it’s in your phone and computer. People were cracking into our devices and stealing, and I think the awareness needs to increase to the public, and in the industry as well, to try to be fundamentally secure things that can’t be cracked. That’s the other tsunami I see: security.

Elecard announces that a beta version of Elecard analyzing tool StreamEye supporting OAM AV1 codec will be demonstrated at NAB Show 2017 News provided by Elecard 24 Apr, 2017, 13:30 ET Share this article CUPERTINO, Calif., April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The rapidly increasing demands of IT industry drive a need for an open mainstream codec without excessive patent licensing fees which ensures fast streaming of 4K video while reducing the amount of bandwidth. The stiff challenge was taken by the Alliance for Open Media, a consortium including industry giants such as Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Netflix. The joint efforts have led to the creation of a royalty-free codec - AV1 which can boast a number of winning features, such as advanced performance, compression efficiency and compatibility to any modern device at a required bandwidth. It is projected to provide a considerable quality advantage over HEVC, with estimated improvement to reach 25%. Andrey Pozdnyakov, the founder and president of Elecard Group, explains, "The quality of intra frames encoding is striking, almost all intra blocks in AV1 are encoded more efficiently than in HEVC, with a similar partitioning. Asymmetric Numeral Systems coding by Jarek Duda brought an entropy coding mechanism which is many times faster and simpler than CABAC." It is hard to overestimate the importance of AV1 global distribution for easier, cheaper and faster streaming of video content.  Elecard believes that this emerging format will boost the development of the streaming industry and the team is ready to support its further expansion. "The Elecard AV1 suite of analyzer solutions will help accelerate the debug and design cycles, allowing for better time to market. We are perfectly positioned to answer the demand from a technology and support perspective. This royalty-free open source codec will be fully supported by Elecard – an aggressive business strategy will be designed to enable the AV1 ecosystem," comments Marc Clément, Vice-President of Sales and Marketing. A beta version of Elecard StreamEye supporting OAM AV1 will be demonstrated at NAB Show 2017, April 24-27, in Las-Vegas. Beta orders will be accepted for a select group of customers and partners. Find out the performance results of AV1 vs HEVC encoded streams. Please contact us for more information on AV1 availability and associated partner program.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Cor blimey, love a duck, and stone the crows: Activision have announced that the next Call of Duty game will be Call of Duty: WWII [official site]. Their official announcement says about as much as the leak which gave this away four weeks ago. Another supposed leak has sprung with unconfirmed babbling about unsurprising things like D-Day and a co-op mode. But what’s most important is that ↑ teaser artwork up there. What’s going on with the man we shall assume is named Robert Gunnington? Activision’s page has that picture of Robert along with a countdown to a “worldwide reveal livestream” at 6pm on Wednesday, April 26th. CoD fansite Charlie Intel has some snaps of what’s supposedly leaked Australian marketing materials pegging the game for a November 3rd release. The gubbins gabs about visiting Normandy D-Day and jaunting across iconic battles, as well as a co-op mode with “a new and original story”. That co-op is called a “next-level standalone game experience” (next-level!) but the description’s vague enough that it could describe just about anything. None of that is confirmed, though none would be surprising. No, for cold hard facts we’re only got Robert Gunnington. And… Pip noticed a hint of something reflected in his pupils: Go a bit closer and we see shapes which might be a couple fellas and their dog staring at a road sign. Let’s go closer: Or a crucifixion? Probably not. We’ll need heavy-duty technology for this. I turned to the Deep Dream Generator and uncovered startling truths reflected in that pupil: Do you see? Taxis, orangutans, dimetrodons, and laboratory equipment. We’ll find out on Wednesday how that all fits into World War 2.

At some point very soon Ubisoft is going to figure out that since all their games are essentially the same now (open world icon hunts) they can set them in the same universe – meaning it’s all ‘creeds from here on out. Far Cryed, Wildlanded, Watch Dog-peed, Steepeed, Just Danc-eed, For Honoureed, The Crew-eed. Just imagine, you get all A+ ranks in Just Dance (I have not actually played the game, so insert appropriate ranking method) and the post credit scene has you waking from the asbergo machine, getting a high-five from your mildly attractive assassin handler for stopping the Templar plan of controlling the world through pop media. Bring up the real-life downfall of MTV for some pseusdo-reality tie-in and setup the sequel where Michael Jackson is an alien, elder, or whatever they are.

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | Apr 24, 2017 9:00 AM PT Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Optane: What users can expect in PCs and when it will ship Intel's speed-boosting Optane Memory won't work with Celeron and Pentium PCs Intel claims storage speed record with first large-capacity Optane SSD Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD At a Glance Intel Optane memory PCWorld Rating $69.99 MSRP $45.00 View on Amazon Intel’s Optane Memory gives mainstream users a rare first bite at the bleeding edge of technology. No matter how much hardcore PC enthusiasts yell, scream, and gnash their teeth, they're not going to be using this as standalone storage just yet. Instead, Optane Memory debuts as a caching drive that can—at times—make a hard drive competitive with even the fastest SSDs. If this seems too good for your dog-slow drive to be true, don't worry. We ran the benchmarks, and you can see the results for yourself. You can also see the caveats in the system requirements, which unfortunately bar the vast majority of PCs from this speedy upgrade.  Setting up Optane Intel’s Optane M.2 SSD You’ll need a mobo that supports Optane and a Core i3 Kaby Lake CPU to run Intel’s newest memory technology. Not everyone will be able to run Optane Memory. Essentially a 32GB or 16GB M.2 module that supports the fast NVMe data/communications interface, it requires a motherboard that has an M.2 module and BIOS support for Optane. You’ll also need a Kaby Lake Core i3 CPU or better. Intel doesn’t say why it won’t support Celeron or Pentium chips based on the Kaby Lake architecture, but we’d guess the company would rather sell expensive Core i3 and Core i5 CPUs than budget chips. Skylake users are also excluded, to reduce the qualification Intel would have to do, the company claimed. And remember, Kaby Lake is a Windows 10- (or Linux-) only CPU. [ Further reading: We tear apart a hard drive and SSD to show you how they work ] To set up Optane, you simply drop it into the M.2 slot, install the drivers and application, then pair the drive with your primary boot drive. The Optane software moves some OS files to the Optane drive itself to aid in faster performance. If you decide to remove the Optane drive, you must unpair them so you don’t lose files. IDG You pair your Optane memory with your hard drive, which moves some OS files to the SSD. If you pull the drive without unpairing it, you’ll lose data. Once installed, the Optane memory drive will be invisible to the OS, and only your hard drive will appear in the File Manager. This is actually one key advantage that Intel touts for Optane, and I’d agree. While a more advanced user can manage having a small 240GB SSD with a 2TB hard drive, the typical person just wants to save files to the primary drive and call it a day. Optane Memory caching for, say, a 4TB drive would be a lot easier for those folks. Gordon Mah Ung We used a 32GB Optane memory module in an Asus B250 motherboard for our tests. How we tested To test Optane Memory we used an Intel-provided system with a quad-core Core i5-7500, 16GB of DDR4/2400, and an Asus B250 Prime motherboard using the Intel B250 chipset. Intel provided the system sans-GPU, so we dropped in a budget Radeon RX 480 for all of our testing. For storage, Intel provided a 1TB Western Digital Black 7,200rpm hard drive with Windows 10 installed, and a 32GB Optane memory module in the M.2 slot. To get a feel for how Optane Memory would do against the best, I installed a $629 Samsung 1TB 960 Pro NVME M.2 drive in a PCIe slot. Obviously, Optane is aimed at mainstream-level technology, so I also tested with what I’d consider the opposite of the 960 Pro. With its TLC NAND and limited cache The 960GB Toshiba Q300 SATA SSD is technically an SSD, but it posted disappointing results in our review, often performing like a hard drive. Although other TLC-based drives aren’t the dog the Toshiba Q300 is, budget SSDs may get worse as QuadLevel Cell NAND is introduced. Still, the question today is how an Optane Memory-accelerated hard drive will perform. IDG The Optane control panel is pretty bare-bones right now. CrystalDiskMark Performance Our first test is the synthetic CrystalDiskMark 5.2.1 benchmark that’s built on Microsoft’s DISKSPD server and cloud storage performance testing tool. I ran the test on the bare Western Digital hard drive, as well against the same hard drive with the Optane module for caching. I also ran it on the Optane drive itself configured as a standalone 32GB SSD, plus the Toshiba Q300 and Samsung 960 Pro SSDs. The first result you see here is a sequential read performance using 1MB block sizes and a queue depth of one. As far as workloads go, this would be like reading or copying a single file from your drive. As you can see, the pricey Samsung 960 Pro buzzes along with read speeds around 2.5GBps. The Toshiba Q300 is held back by the SATA 600 interface, with read speeds of about 546MBps. The Western Digital Black 7,200rpm hard drive plods along at 165MBs. Optane Memory, whether configured as a standalone non-caching SSD or used as a caching drive for the Western Digital Drive, turns in a consistent performance of 1.3GBps.  IDG The sequential read speed of the Optane memory either cached or standalone easily outstrips the Toshiba Q300 SSD but can’t touch Samsung’s 960 Pro. Although the read speed of the Optane memory is relatively healthy, write speeds are less impressive—closer to that of a low-end SSD, worse even than the Toshiba Q300. Synthetic benchmarks aren’t everything, though, and we’ll cover the weaknesses of budget SSDs vs. Optane in a few paragraphs. Either way, write performance on Optane memory is nothing to write home about. IDG In pure sequential writes using a single thread, Optane memory doesn’t wow us. The thing is, to wring the most out of an NVMe SSD with multiple channels, you really need high queue-depth workloads (high queue depths are basically multiple simultaneous requests of the drive).  Here’s the performance of our drives reading 128KB blocks with a queue depth of 32. The Samung 960 Pro is simply smoking, with read speeds of 3.3GBps. Intel’s Optane drive set up as a small SSD also gives up a decent, but certainly not as impressive score of 1.4GB. When configured as a cache drive it’s pretty much identical, with a score of 1.4GB. The Toshiba Q300’s performance is essentially constrained by the SATA interface with read speeds of 562MBps. And yeah, the hard drive gives up a “blazing” 169MB read speed. IDG The read performance, however, of the Optane drive as a cache and standalone is far better with a 1MB block-size load and queue depth of 1. One argument against using high queue depths as a measurement of SSD performance is that few consumer workloads ever actually match that. Intel says concentrating on high queue depths just isn’t realistic, and many reviewers would agree. This excellent Tom’s Hardware primer by Andrew Ku shows that loading and playing games, for example, are “almost completely at a queue depth of one.” Another argument Intel makes for Optane is its performance on small 4KB blocks. Configured as a standalone SSD, the Optane module offers substantially higher performance with small files with a single queue depth. In fact, even the mighty Samsung 960 Pro gets its lunch eaten here. Running the Optane module in its cached mode we also see a significant performance advantage. And yes, the plain Western Digital hard drive is basically moving as slow as a snail here, with a score of 0. IDG One of Intel’s arguments for Optane is off-the-hook latency when reading small files with very low queue depths. Optane as a cache for the hard drive also destroys both SSDs, including the mighty Samsung 960 Pro. Read on for how Optane memory does in more real-world tests. At a Glance Intel Optane memory PCWorld Rating $69.99 MSRP $45.00 View on Amazon Intel's Optane Module will make a world of difference for users stuck with traditional hard drives. Those drives must be in higher-end Kaby Lake systems running Windows 10, though. Pros Exceptional 4K file performance Can rival high performance SSDs under some circumstances Wipes out hard drive-only performance Cons Only works with Kaby Lake Core i3 and up CPUs Performance drops once you burn through the cache Would feel better if $15 lower in cost.

Investors in these three stocks have enjoyed stellar returns. Are the good times about to end? Steve Symington, Dan Caplinger, and Brian Stoffel (TMFSymington) Apr 24, 2017 at 11:00AM One of the most gratifying feelings as an investor is to see your buy thesis for any given stock come to fruition. But given the happy consequence of share-price appreciation that tends to come with this type of situation, you might be left wondering whether it would be wise to take profits off the table. So we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in on what investors should think about three popular high-flying stocks. Read on to learn what they had to say about Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Any missteps could badly hurt this graphics chip specialist Steve Symington (Advanced Micro Devices): Shares of AMD have soared nearly 400% over the past year as of this writing, and with good reason. After losing significant graphics card market share to competitor NVIDIA from late 2014 through the middle of 2015, AMD gradually regained its footing to end 2016 with market share of roughly 29.5% (up from 21.6% at the start of the year). Most recently, AMD investors are rightly excited over the prospects for the impending launch of high-end cards based on the chipmaker's Vega GPU architecture. But given its meteoric rise, I'm not the only one worried that AMD's stock price may have gotten ahead of the actual business. Earlier this month, shares declined after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on AMD with a sell rating and $11-per-share price target (the current price is around $13), arguing that AMD's remaining market-share gains are limited, and that both NVIDIA and Intel have the flexibility to reduce their own chip prices in an effort to stem AMD's progress, if necessary. The GPU market also tends to ebb and flow given the combination of upgrade cycles and continuous innovation in the space. So investors shouldn't underestimate the ability of AMD's competitors to claw back what they've lost over the past year with their own new technology. But more concerning is the fact that AMD still isn't profitable, delivering a GAAP net loss of $497 million last year and an adjusted (non-GAAP) net loss of $117 million -- albeit narrowed from 2015 GAAP and adjusted losses of $660 million and $419 million, respectively. So if AMD suffers any hiccups this year as it strives to maintain its momentum and return to sustained, profitable growth, I fear its stock price will give back the recent gains in a hurry. Veeva has been on a tear, but how long will it last? Brian Stoffel (Veeva Systems): Veeva Systems has found a very profitable niche. The company, which is the brainchild of its founder-CEO and former salesforce.com executive, Peter Gassner, offers cloud solutions to drug companies. These solutions can do everything from tracking sales of certain drugs to storing and sharing mission-critical information during the drug approval process. Shareholders have been rewarded handsomely for their faith in Gassner and company, with the stock up 140% since February of last year. But that has put the company in nosebleed-valuation territory. Currently, shares trade hands for 69 times non-GAAP earnings and 51 times free cash flow. When stocks have this type of valuation, the slightest worry can send shares down. And in fact, there are a number of things that investors need to be aware of. For starters, Veeva has developed a cloud solution for clients outside of the pharmaceutical industry. I believe part of the run-up in price is associated with high sales expectations for Veeva in this new venture. But this new path is untested, and it remains to be seen how well it will be received in other industries. Furthermore, Veeva has made it clear that it will be investing aggressively in its future. That means that while sales may continue to grow, profitability may not. In fact, after adjusting their calculations, analysts expect Veeva to show non-GAAP EPS growth of only 8% this year. That's not typically what you'd expect from such an expensive stock. But, as a long-term shareholder, I am unconcerned. I am well-aware that Veeva's stock may fall in the short term. That is the nature of its industry. Over the long run, however, I have faith in the company's moat and its undeniable business momentum. Don't hit the brakes on this stock Dan Caplinger (Tesla): Tesla has gotten headlines lately because investors have assigned a valuation on the company that exceeds those of the much more mature Big Three automakers. Just since the beginning of 2017, Tesla is up 40%, yet the company is nowhere near being profitable. The stock price implies a multiple to trailing sales of 7, and skeptics believe that there's little chance that Tesla can ramp up quickly enough to justify its current valuation even as the mass-market Model 3 approaches its anticipated release date later this year and starts to deliver on the roughly 400,000 preorders that the new car company has gotten for the lower-end Tesla car. Tesla has a number of growth prospects in its pipeline that it hopes will allow it to maximize its potential. On the solar front, Tesla has released new solar panels that it claims have more attractive designs to entice homeowners into using them on their homes. Meanwhile, the automaker also foresees entering the commercial transportation arena, with a heavy-duty truck and transit alternatives that could take advantage of Tesla technology for non-consumer purposes. None of this is to say that Tesla isn't richly valued and potentially vulnerable to a decline, but people have been predicting that Tesla would see an outright crash for a long time without having succeeded. Betting against Tesla right now is likely a mistake. Brian Stoffel owns shares of Tesla and Veeva Systems. Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Since Activision officially announced the name of the next Call of Duty game, Call of Duty: WW2, different bits of information have been slowly making their way online. First, we learned some details about the story, the new co-op mode, and the boots-on-the-ground multiplayer. The November 3 release date was then spotted on a big ad. There’s also going to be a “private beta” you can get into by pre-ordering. But, until now, we hadn’t actually seen any footage or screens beyond the official art. The eagle-eyed folks at Charlie Intel noticed that the official Call of Duty website, particularly the account log in page, was updated with three new WW2 images briefly, following the announcement. These have now been taken down of course, but not before the site grabbed them. As you can see, these images have a very low resolution, but we can at least see the good ol’ Thompson submachine gun. Despite the low resolution, you can easily see how well-detailed everything looks. This is after all the first time we’re seeing a WW2 setting on this console generation. Call of Duty: WW2 will be officially revealed in a livestream this Wednesday at 10am PT/1pm ET/6pm UK. We expect this showing to focus almost entirely on the single-player, judging by how Activision handled similar events for other Call of Duty games in the past.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Netgear Faces Consumer Class Action for Defective Cable Modems SAN FRANCISCO, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Consumers today announced the filing of a class action lawsuit against NETGEAR, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTGR), claiming that the global networking company sells cable modems containing a serious defect that results in high spikes in network latency, degrading users’ Internet connections, according to Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe, which represents the consumers. The lawsuit, filed on April 14, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that consumers who purchased Netgear’s CM700 modem—which Netgear claimed was „ideal for the fastest Internet speed services plan”—suffers from severe network latency spikes. Hundreds of users have complained in online forums, and Netgear itself has acknowledged the issue. Netgear, however, has failed to fix the problem for SB6190 purchasers. (PRNewsfoto/Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe)… „Consumers paid top dollar for a high-end cable modem, but the Netgear CM700 suffers from a serious flaw that affects network connections,” said Noah Schubert, a partner at Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe, „Netgear and other cable modem manufacturers shipping modems with the defect should recall the affected models and issue refunds.” According to the lawsuit, the root of the problem is Netgear’s decision to swap out the Broadcom chipset in this modem with the Puma 6 chipset from Intel Corporation. Intel has acknowledged that the problem stems from its Puma 6’s chipset, which causes cable modems to suffer from significant jitter and latency on their network connections. Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP is actively investigating whether other cable modems containing the Puma 6 chipset, including modems from Linksys, Cisco, Hitron, and Arris, also suffer from the same severe network latency defect. To see if your cable modem may be affected by this defect, please visit our website at http://classactionlawyers.com/netgear. If you purchased a Netgear CM700 or other cable modem containing the Puma 6 chipset, you may be entitled to a refund of the purchase price. If you think you may be affected by this cable modem defect, please contact us today to learn more. About Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe represents shareholders, employees, and consumers in class actions against corporate defendants, as well as shareholders in derivative actions against their officers and directors. The firm is based in San Francisco, and with the help of co-counsel, litigates cases nationwide. Contact Noah M.

By Liam Tung | April 24, 2017 -- 13:54 GMT (06:54 PDT) | Topic: Hardware The ZBook 17's entry-level model features an i5 processor, while the smaller ZBook 15 G4 has a 15.6-inch full HD display. Image: HP HP has unveiled four new laptops in its fourth-generation of ZBook mobile workstations, which are aimed at creators with heavy graphics workloads.

Designed with VR content creation in mind, the HP ZBook 17 G4 can be configured with either Xeon or Core processors and a choice of Nvidia Quadro P4000 or P5000 graphics cards to display VR content at 90 frames per second. The ZBook 17's entry-level model features an i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD storage, and a 17.3-inch display. It will be available for $1,519.

The laptop features a 4K UDH display, and HP says it will offer a 16.5-hour battery life, addressing the Studio G3's more limited power cell. As with the last year's model, HP is highlighting the effort that went into its design. The laptop can be configured with Intel Xeon or Core processors, Nvidia graphics, and up to 2TB storage. The model starts at $1,399. Finally, it's also released the ZBook 14u, a smaller sibling to the recently announced ZBook 15u. The ZBook 14u features a 14-inch full-HD display with optional touch, an AMD FirePro graphics card with 2GB video memory, up to 32GB memory, and up to 2TB storage.

One year on from its official launch as the UK’s first bank built exclusively for mobile, Atom is adding some star power to its ranks with the appointment of will.i.am as a Strategic Board Advisor. The Voice coach and pop star has a well-documented interest in technology; while serving as the Director of Creative Innovation for Intel, will.i.am acts as an ‘idea generator’ while looking to “the next frontier of interactive technology”. Will.i.am has also, among other tech accomplishments, debuted a song on Mars and combined interest in digital photography and augmented technology to create the i.am+ foto.soho iPhone case. At Atom, will.i.am will provide the Durham-based bank with an external perspective on culture, philanthropy and technology. “Our lives are faster than ever before, but the banking industry hasn’t kept up.  The scale of Atom’s ambition to help people understand and manage their money better, and it’s clever use of technology to give people an entire bank on their phones is awesome,” said will.i.am. READ MORE: Atom kicks off banking revolution as app goes live “I’m looking forward to working with Atom to achieve success in everything we will do together.” As an entrepreneur, will.i.am has some impressive credentials – he was a founding shareholder in Beats Electronics, the creators of Beats by Dre headphones. The Voice Coach has also been recognised for both his p[philanthropy and entrepreneurship, having been named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in March, 2013, in recognition for his role as a STEM education advocate.  Through his i.am.angel Foundation, will.i.am created i.am.STEAM which looks to provide underserved students with learning and interaction opportunities beyond the classroom. The i.am angel foundation in the UK is a STEM education and computer skills joint initiative with The Prince’s Trust.

Meanwhile, ASUS has teamed up with Amazon and Newegg to offer a bundle consisting of a VivoPC X and an Oculus Rift with Touch starting from $1299; $100 cheaper than their combined retail price when purchased separately. As previously reported, the ASUS VivoPC X is the company’s entry-level miniature PC designed for gamers who would like to have a gaming machine in their living rooms, but who are not ready to invest in the ROG GR8 II. The machine uses notebook components to give the PC a small form factor, cut down its power consumption, and thus make it relatively quiet. A drawback of such approach is that end-users are unable to upgrade key parts of the system, such as the GPU. Spec-wise, the ASUS VivoPC X looks to be rather capable for a 5-liter machine (in fact, it carries the Oculus VR Ready label): it is based on the Intel Core i5-7300HQ (4C/4T, 2.5 GHz/3.5 GHz, 6 MB cache, HD Graphics 630, 45 W) CPU, the Intel HM175 PCH, as well as NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 3 GB of GDDR5 memory. As for connectivity, the ASUS VivoPC X has four USB 3.0 Type-A ports, two USB 2.0 headers, Gigabit Ethernet, an IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT 4.1 module, three display outputs (two HDMI and one DisplayPort), 5.1-channel audio with Sonic Suite software enhancements, and so on. The base model that retails for $799 is called the A80CJ-DS51 and comes equipped with 8 GB of DDR4-2400 memory (single-channel) and a 1 TB 2.5” HDD with 5400 RPM spindle speed. Previously, ASUS intended to offer a 512 GB M.2 SATA SSD and a 2 TB 7200 RPM HDD with its VivoPC X; however the company had to cut back a bit on their final specs to hit their $799 price target. At this point the DS51 is the only model available, so we'll have to see if ASUS comes out with any additional versions that are closer to their original specifications. A VivoPC X with an SSD and a faster and more capacious HDD would be a considerably more attractive PC, but it would bring the entry-level SFF gaming system closer to the more expensive ROG GR8 II, muddling the ASUS product lineup. ASUS VivoPC X Specifications   A80CJ-DS51 CPU Intel Core i5-7300HQ Quad Core 2.5 GHz/3.5 GHz 6 MB cache HD Graphics 630 PCH Intel HM175 Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with 3 GB GDDR5 memory Memory  8 GB of DDR4-2400 (single-channel, single slot) Storage 1 TB 2.5" HDD (5400 RPM) Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 Ethernet GbE Display Outputs 2 × HDMI 2.0b 1 × DisplayPort Audio 5.1-channel audio USB 4 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 2 × USB 2.0 Type-A Other I/O - Dimensions 75.94 mm × 259.8 mm × 279.9 mm 2.99 × 10.23 × 11.02 inches PSU 230 W OS Windows 10 The ASUS VivoPC X is available from ASUS Store, Amazon, B&H, Fry’s, Microcenter, and Newegg for $799. In addition, from April 25 to June 13, Amazon and Newegg will offer an ASUS VivoPC X and an Oculus Rift with Touch bundles starting at $1299, shaving off $100 off of the price of a complete VR setup.

POST A COMMENT 24 Comments View All Comments jordanclock - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link I thought this sounded like a nice package but I saw that it has the 3GB 1060. That is barely what I would call VR ready. Reply thesavvymage - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link Saw the 3gb memory on the 1060, doesnt that also use a cut down die making it closer to 1050ti than the 1060 it is named after? makes this product a little less interesting at the $800 price point Reply jordanclock - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link The 1060 3GB is considerably ahead of the 1050ti, but you're right that it has fewer cores in addition to the smaller memory. Reply HideOut - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link Is this even a desktop 1060 or a laptop version thats much much weaker? Reply abrowne1993 - Monday, April 24, 2017 - link Mobile CPU, 3GB 1060, 8GB RAM, HDD, and hardly upgradable? No thanks.

They are also the quietest computers I've ever built. The upgrade path on those are phenomenal, and this thing has almost none. Too expensive, and has no future. This is not a good deal. Heck, it's not even a very good gaming computer. Reply pencil_sharpner_man - Tuesday, April 25, 2017 - link Hey could you share your build details ? I'm considering building a low profile sub 800$ build. Reply npz - Tuesday, April 25, 2017 - link Yeah, but how big is it? I've built lots of PCs for decades of all form factors and you just can't build one as small as this Asus VivoX -- basically gaming console sized -- with off the shelf upgradeable components. Even mITX need to be big, if only just for orginazing the unholy mess of cables inside. These custom machines on the other hand are virtually cable-free.

[Photo: Flickr user Jack Wallsten] By Jackie Snow04.24.17 | 9:30 am Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing just about every industry, with billions being poured into algorithms for everything from self-driving cars to detecting cancer to chatbots. Not so much fashion. advertisement Mad Street Den, a three-year-old artificial intelligence startup founded by a husband and wife team in Chennai, India, is boldly going where few startups have gone before. The couple’s complementary career paths have helped. CEO Ashwini Asokan was previously with Intel Labs working on product design; her husband and CTO, Anand Chandrasekaran, is a neuroscientist who switched over to AI when he realized the technology wasn’t quite there yet to build silicon brains. After living and working in the U.S for years, they returned to their country of birth in 2014 to build a startup, tooling around with a few different ideas before landing on fashion. Since then, they’ve developed over a dozen AI-assisted tools for online retailers, many of them using computer vision algorithms that can suggest pieces to finish an outfit or meet a customer’s tastes. The company says that in an internal study, online shoppers spent 72 minutes on websites where its software was deployed, compared to 25 minutes on sites without it.  Ashwini Asokan   Among the clients they’ve racked up are a mix of internet marketplaces, brands, and big box stores. Their international clients include Villoid, a fashion app cofounded by British model Alexa Chung; HipVan, a Singaporean decor and furniture brand; and Indian online platforms Tata CLiQ and The LabelLife. In the U.S. the company works with Thredup, a fashion resale website based in San Francisco, Shoprunner, and an iconic denim brand that they won’t name. (Its own mysterious name is a hodgepodge of high-tech and human, Asokan explains: Mad stands for “mind able devices,” den is what their first space was like and street comes from a night where one too many drinks were had.) Investors are also taking notice. Mad Street Den recently raised an undisclosed Series A round of funding from Sequoia Capital India along with another infusion from existing investors Exfinity Ventures and growX Ventures. From launching with just one other cofounder and employee, neuroscientist Costa Colbert, they have grown to 45 employees with a headquarters in San Francisco, and offices in London and Chennai.  Fast Company: So what exactly does your software do for fashion? Ashwini Asokan: The first one that we’ve made some fantastic progress on is the suite called Vue Commerce. It’s basically an end-to-end AI-assisted onsite or on-app set of products. So people are browsing a site or looking up on their app and we’re basically trying to understand what they are looking for, at the starting levels, of color pattern necklines, sleeve length, styles. We’re trying to look at user behavior, history, and their cohort. advertisement We’re looking at it at a completely meta level. I think traditionally people have looked at it as big data, but we’re actually looking at it and even the visual aspects of every little thing that the user is doing. At the end of the day fashion is super visceral. It’s super visual. [But] we’ve pretty much stripped that entire experience off of our apps and our sites. We’re missing that tangible and almost emotional experience one has when you go and try something on in a store, when you actually touch and feel something. A big question that we were asking ourselves is, how can we use computer vision to change that experience online? FC: What does that look like, specifically? Anand Chandrasekaran: We have what’s called dynamic personalization, and that becomes relevant when a site has 200,000 dresses. Which of 200,000 should I show you? We can’t pick up all the cues immediately obviously. But in time we can show you 200 of the 200,000 dresses that are relevant to you. And it’s our job and the job of our AI to start picking up those kinds of things. Anand Chandreasekaran AA: So if you’re looking at, let’s say, a pink polka dot A-line dress. Chances are you like the shape of A-line dresses and like pink polka dots. But people like different types of pink. Maybe you like baby pink and I like fuchsia—”pink” is not pink. I might start with that polka dotted dress but I might go down a very different path. Let’s say I’m only interested in A-line. And so I’m willing to go around very specific kinds of styles, while you on the other hand are only looking for specific types of pink. Both of us end up having entirely different experiences on that site. And whether it’s product page recommendations or ensemble creations, we do personalized recommendations with every single click that you make on a given app or a site. FC: Do you think that the “if you like that, you’ll like this” approach could inadvertently keep us in our fashion bubbles, the way our algorithmically designed news feeds keep us in personalized filter bubbles and echo chambers? AA: If you are always going to show me something I’m expecting to see, at some point I’m going to get really bored and move on. The question we ask ourselves is, how do we inject randomness at regular intervals? advertisement On the other hand, it’s all about surprise. How do you surprise someone without pissing them off? It’s wonderful to show someone florals, but if you do it all the time, it becomes really boring. But what happens when you start to understand what florals are all about? It’s about nature—or maybe you like the texture it usually appears on—we all have our own preferences. We do so much understanding of the intent of each and every user. Is this someone that is trying to look at breezy, airy, earthy prints? You can slowly start expanding it to adjacent materials and patterns. You are looking at theme and intent, you’re not looking at it very literally, like, ‘I’m going to go get you more florals.’ We are looking at cohorts, too. We are looking at people like you. Then you inject more variance into the journey. Read more: AI Can Make Us All Dress Better. So Why Isn’t The Fashion Industry Using It More? FC: Why you’d choose to launch your company in Chennai, versus, say, New York ? AA: I had gone up and spoken to the who’s who in computer vision in Silicon Valley. It became very evident they were very jaded by computer vision. They kept saying “Oh no, we’ve seen this stuff, like 10 or 20 years ago. This stuff never goes anywhere.” There wasn’t anything that people were like, “oh my god” about, which was a sign to us. advertisement We want to experiment through the industry and through the market with partners as opposed to just building science projects inside our labs. Moving to India opened up the Asian market for us in ways that I had never imagined.  In Asia everyone’s door was open. Every other retailer or e-commerce site was like, “come on let’s do this together.” So there was some extensive work that we did in the early days with the retailers in Asia, which pretty much allowed us to develop our products for that industry. A couple of months ago, we closed our Series A with Sequoia and I think the reason we got there was because we started in Asia. Now of course we’re pretty much completely in the U.S. But Asia totally leapfrogged the U.S. They were at least two and a half years ahead of anyone else, I would say. FC: I know Gilt and other fashion groups are doing interesting work in AI but there don’t seem to be a lot of startups around fashion and AI. I’m curious if you think this is sort of like a blind spot for a lot of more typical tech companies, who maybe are going to be a lot of young men in the Bay Area who don’t think to innovate in fashion. AA: Yeah, You know the lack of bias does help. FC: I was trying to ask about that as nicely as possible. How does diversity play in? AA: We talk about this all the time. I am very vocal when it comes to the world of gender and I do a lot of work in that space. I am also interested in the trajectory of technology, the intersection of people and quality products and looking at it from a perspective of design. If you look at the industries that are the fastest adopters of technology, they’re usually porn, sports, and fashion, and actually religion. advertisement Retail was the last of our experiments, by the way. We’ve done stuff in gaming, we’ve done stuff in analytics. We’ve done quite a few of our experiments in the space of facial recognition and motion expression recognition. We’ve built up quite a few models. Finally, the models that we ended up doing actually didn’t use a lot of those core technology pieces. We gave up on gaming because we realized that the industry was not ready. The same thing with analytics, the same thing with so many. We were thankfully very connected when we came to India. We’ve known all these VCs for a while and people kept giving us introductions, and it didn’t matter. These industries were just not ready for this. And retail on the other hand opened up and swallowed us whole. They still can’t seem to get enough of us. I would say in the last 12 to 18 months there are a lot of people that have cropped up in this space. Like way more than I have seen in the past, but for us we’re not just looking at fashion. We’re now moving into furniture. We’re moving into all things retail, including offline. We’re looking at retail as the entire value chain and operational stuff. You need to have an open mind and to know that this is one of the industries that’s adopted technology way quicker than most others have. And part of it is not having that bias. FC: I’m sure you are crazy busy but you blog a lot and give talks about AI, a lot of it trying to dispel the Terminator narrative that comes up a lot. Why do you think it’s important to be educating the wider public about AI? AA: To be honest at the end of the day nobody cares about a lot of this stuff, people are going to go ahead and do what they’re going to do. Like, all this AI-madness-killer-robot talk is a press-generated thing. People in their day-to-day are like, ‘whatever’ Sure, they care about their privacy or maybe a few things here and there, but I think what happens when people suddenly see something that changes their life, that brings something of super value to them. Or you show something to a company—that all of this reduces 30% of their costs when it comes to operations—that is magic. We believe that the magic should be in the products and what happens when business industries looks at our products. But education has to be done in very layman, laywoman terms, completely demystifying the topic and letting people know exactly what it is that you’re doing. AC: You know, we already have experience building intelligence. It’s our children and they are pretty useless when they are born. They have to go through a lot of training. They have to be tempered by society before they are of any use to mankind in general. So how is that going to be any different from any other intelligence that we build? And that’s kind of the space that we are operating in. Saying that we can build intelligence is one thing; making that intelligence useful or even worthy of being spoken about in the terms of our potential successors or partners takes a lot of work. advertisement FC: What’s in store for the company and AI in general, as you look ahead? AC: Let me dodge that question. I’m not going to make that mistake again of thinking that AI can be built in isolation. It will be done the way the market decides it. So we will continue to be building useful products. I’ve actually said the future of this is going to be in hardware. There is no way we can be building AI systems at scale without solving the fundamental issue of how much power we are consuming to run these tasks. That will actually bring things to the next level, when we can start putting some of that intelligence in as small of a chip that can go in phones. You’ll be putting a lot more intelligence out there and that will further enable us to bring intelligence to a completely different level. There are people out there building deep learning networks that are very good. But they are very computationally heavy. If you talk with any deep learning practitioners, they say a lot of the work is converting the data, whether that’s audio or images, into signals that are more abstract, and coming up with meaningful inferences. Moving computation into neuromorphic chips, you can move that processing very close to the data it’s working with. If you put it in a phone, you can work with all the photos and videos on your phone. It’s not saying you’re moving the technology to the phone, but you’re going to be able to do a lot of the processing on your phone before streaming it to the cloud for larger brains to tackle.

The Quest to Make Immunotherapy a Bigger Success One of the pioneers of cancer immunotherapy is on a mission. The idea of turbocharging the body’s own immune cells to destroy cancerous tumors continues to give rise to promising new treatments for the disease. But there’s a problem: of all patients dying of cancer in America this year, only one in 12 would be expected to benefit from such drugs. We met with James Allison, who spearheaded the development of immunotherapy, to find out how that might change. Should Autonomous Cars Talk to Each Other? In Britain, robotic cars are set to converse. Oxbotica is to test six communicating driverless vehicles in trials between Oxford and London, and hopes to offer fully autonomous journeys by 2019. The firm's plan to have vehicles communicate isn’t new, but sets the experiment apart from those by many companies, such as Waymo, who are building independent vehicles. As the Guardian recently argued, though, we may only get the best from driverless cars when they do communicate. Ten Fascinating Things Last week, Elon Musk outlined his plans for human-to-human telepathy via neural implants. Our own Antonio Regalado thinks that you shouldn’t believe the hype. The New York Times has a fascinating profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick–including a scandal that almost saw the firm banned from Apple’s App Store. The world’s most expensive medicine, which makes use of a genetically engineered virus, is being pulled from the market because nobody’s buying it. More details have emerged about Apple’s autonomous car trials: safety drivers will apparently take the wheel of vehicles via video games controllers. For the first time since coal power stations were introduced, the UK has gone an entire day without burning the fossil fuel for the generation of electricity. Nicholas Carr explores why the rise of connectedness has been concurrent with our transition into a “fractious time, defined not by concord but by conflict.” Thinning forests can actually turn them into more effective carbon sinks.  Globalization has had many unexpected effects, but here's an unusual one: it appears to increase the number of industrial accidents. Messaging is already encrypted. Should we do the same with voice calls, too? This is the drone that Bruce Wayne needs—because it's kitted out with ultrasonic detectors to keep track of bats. Quote of the Day "In the next 30 years, the world will see much more pain than happiness." — Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese technology giant Alibaba, forecasts a bleak few decades for humanity as technology upends the global economy.

Seventy-year-old Dr Peter Wai Ming-sau, general manager of DME Microelectronics, was among the 68 entrepreneurs who completed the programme, which provides working space, training, facilities and expert advice to start-ups. “We want to make microchips for bluetooth so affordable that they can be used for corporate gifts,” said Wai, who spent 50 years working in the United States for companies including Intel and Texas Instruments. He said he chose to build his business in the Science Park instead of the US because of the facility’s support. “There is an IC [integrated circuit] centre that we can use, which made this business happen at all,” Wai said. “We have invested HK$50 million in the business, but it may have cost up to US$30 million if we did it in the US.” After studying at the London School of Economics, Andy Yeung, 23, returned to Hong Kong to co-found FreshLinker, a job-pairing website. “I think Science Park really helped because they have experts who can show us the way and teach us a lot of technical knowledge,” Yeung said. “A lot of graduates want to find a job in a large company, but sometimes smaller companies can offer better opportunities. What we are doing is to raise the brand profile of smaller companies so they can attract talent.” Hong Kong must attract top companies and experts to become innovation centre, Science Park chairwoman says Some graduates of the programme are already attracting big investors. DeLight Power has secured an investment agreement of over HK$16 million from computer giant Acer for LED technology that helps to protect the eyes. Albert Wong, CEO of Science Park, said innovation and technology required new ways of thinking. “Some people refuse to accept certain new technologies, but innovation will always happen. It is important that the community’s culture can adapt to innovation, and that the law and regulation will be able to catch up with technology,” Wong said. Why Hong Kong children have fallen behind in science race, and the volunteers pushing them to catch up Science Park also announced two new initiatives. The Global Acceleration Academy will partner different industry leaders with start-ups, allowing them to be trained and use their resources. It also launched an expanded Elevator Pitch competition with a prize of up to US$120,000 seed funding, with more international participation. “We will provide training to 100 teams to show them how to convince a potential investor to put money in your business in 60 seconds,” Peter Mok, head of incubation in Science Park, said. “Sometimes the first few seconds including the firmness of your handshake decides your fate.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Start-up dreams start here for city’s entrepreneurs   Most Popular Viewed 1 How China’s aircraft carriers stack up against other nations 2 Donald Tsang speaks of ‘heartaches’ after being released on bail 3 China’s ‘robot goddess’ Jiajia flubs live interview in English 4 Chinese media pull reports on big-spending HNA Group 5 Even Hong Kong property owners want to see prices drop Shared 1 Puffing across the ‘One Belt, One Road’ rail route to nowhere 2 Chinese media pull reports on big-spending HNA Group 3 China’s ‘robot goddess’ Jiajia flubs live interview in English 4 Man and woman arrested for fighting over barbecue bill dispute 5 Trump to call Xi and Abe today as North Korea tensions mount Commented 1 The delusion of Disneyland’s ‘economic benefits’ 2 HNA shares plunge on fugitive’s allegations 3 Asia’s richest woman plans US listing for Chinese school operator 4 Where to spot a billionaire this summer 5 China making full convertibility of its currency a priority Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2017 SCMP Invites you to Le French May “Paris Ballet Legend - A Night With The Stars”       You may also like Politics After fall of Jakarta’s ethnic Chinese leader, is Widodo next? 23 Apr 2017 - 11:18am 7 Connected beauty gets a digital makeover In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Hong Kong Now not the time for Hong Kong electoral reform, says Beijing 23 Apr 2017 - 8:58am 198 Now is the time to invest in Berlin property Brought to you by JLL Hong Kong ‘Aviation competition won’t stop travellers coming to Hong Kong’ 23 Apr 2017 - 9:04am 2 Insight & Opinion Smearing Singapore: why can’t Hollywood ever get Asia right? 20 Apr 2017 - 6:46pm 72 China Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon 20 Apr 2017 - 10:48pm 20 World 45 years of grappling with Vancouver unaffordability 21 Apr 2017 - 1:11am 12 Asia Trump: ‘Korea used to be part of China’.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman No more compromise between price and efficiency. Elecard provides support of AV1 implemented in our flagship product – StreamEye Elecard announced today that a beta version of Elecard analyzing tool StreamEye supporting OAM AV1 codec will be demonstrated at NAB Show 2017. Cupertino, CA(4/24/2017) – The rapidly increasing demands of IT industry drive a need for an open mainstream codec without excessive patent licensing fees which ensures fast streaming of 4K video while reducing the amount of bandwidth. The stiff challenge was taken by the Alliance for Open Media, a consortium including industry giants such as Amazon, Cisco, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Netflix. The joint efforts have led to the creation of a royalty-free codec – AV1 which can boast a number of winning features, such as advanced performance, compression efficiency and compatibility to any modern device at a required bandwidth. It is projected to provide a considerable quality advantage over HEVC, with estimated improvement to reach – 25%. Andrey Pozdnyakov, the founder and president of Elecard Group, explains, “The quality of intra frames encoding is striking, almost all intra blocks in AV1 are encoded more efficiently than in HEVC, with a similar partitioning. Asymmetric Numeral Systems coding by Jarek Duda brought an entropy coding mechanism which is many times faster and simpler than CABAC.” Elecard believes that this emerging format will boost the development of the streaming industry and the team is ready to support its further expansion. “Proactively supporting this evolving standard is a strategic business decision for Elecard. We are committed in supporting the AOM AV1 ecosystem with our suite of Analyzer solutions” – says Marc Clément, Elecard Vice-President of Sales and Marketing. It is hard to overestimate the importance of AV1 global distribution for easier, cheaper and faster streaming of video content. “The Elecard AV1 suite of analyzer solutions will help accelerate the debug and design cycles allowing for better time to market. We are perfectly positioned to answer the demand from a technology and support perspective. This royalty-free open source codec will be fully supported by Elecard – an aggressive business strategy will be designed to enable the AV1 ecosystem,” – comments Marc Clément. Beta version of Elecard StreamEye supporting OAM AV1 will be demonstrated at NAB Show 2017, April 24-27, Las-Vegas. Beta orders will be accepted for a select group of customers and partners. Find out the performance results of AV1 vs HEVC encoded streams. Please contact us for more information on AV1 availability and associated partner program.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Call of Duty: WWII campaign, multiplayer, release date and beta details leak Call of Duty: WWII campaign, multiplayer, release date and beta details leak Matthew Wilson 22 hours ago Featured Tech News, Software & Gaming Following leaks from earlier this month, Activision officially unveiled Call of Duty: WWII alongside plans for a full reveal livestream in two days time. However, the official reveal hasn’t deterred leakers from jumping in while they still can, with new leaks this week revealing the game’s release date, beta program and more. This new information comes via leaked marketing materials obtained by Charlie Intel. According to the leaks, Call of Duty: WWII will be released on the 3rd of November and will offer a ‘private beta’ to those who pre-order. There is no specific mention of an open beta but given Call of Duty’s track record, there should be one, though those who don’t pre-order won’t get as much play time. Here is the game description: “Call of Duty returns to its roots with Call of Duty: WWII–a breathtaking experience that redefines World War II for a new gaming generation. Land in Normandy on D-Day and battle across Europe through iconic locations in history’s most monumental war. Experience classic Call of Duty combat, the bonds of camaraderie, and the unforgiving nature of war against a global power throwing the world into tyranny.” The campaign will tell the story of an “unbreakable brotherhood of common men fighting to preserve freedom in a world on the brink of tyranny”. The campaign is described as a ‘gritty and intense’ journey through the battles of WWII and as always, there will be a cinematic flair to it. Here is the multiplayer description, which goes out of its way to mention players being grounded, which probably means no more jetpacks, despite recent speculation: “Call of Duty: WWII multiplayer engages players grounded, fast-paced combat across many of World War II’s most iconic locations. Players will also enjoy exciting new ways to interact and socialize with their friends and the Call of Duty community”. KitGuru Says: Infinite Warfare was a bit of a misfire but Call of Duty fans already seem excited about the franchise again now that it is returning to its roots. Hopefully we will see some gameplay during the livestream later this week.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech Reviews / Asus Zenbook 3 (Intel i7 7500U) Asus Zenbook 3 (Intel i7 7500U) Dale Shaughnessy 24 hours ago Featured Tech Reviews, Laptop / Mobile, Tech News Rating: 8.0. Today we take a look at the Asus Zenbook 3 laptop that boasts a 12.5″ 1080p resolution screen. Inside is 16GB RAM running at 2133MHz, along with a 7500U CPU Dual core processor and on-board Integrated Graphics from intel. Many will like the lightweight feel factor and back lit keyboard – but how does it handle? Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 1080p60 HERE. Key Specifications Model name: Asus Zenbook 3 UX390UA Chassis colour: Navy Blue Screen: 12.5″ (16:9) LED backlit FHD (1920×1080) 60Hz Glare Panel with 72% NTSC With WideView Technology Graphics: Integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 Processor: Kabylake Intel Core i7 7500U Processor Memory size: 16 GB LPDDR3 2133MHz SDRAM Onboard Memory SSD: 512GB PCIE Gen3 Wireless: Integrated 802.11 AC Battery: 6 Cells 40 Whrs Polymer Battery Dimensions: 296 x 191.2 x 11.9 mm (WxDxH) Weight: 910 g with Battery OS: Windows 10 Home GPU-Z Price: £1499.99 The Asus Zenbook 3 is in short supply of connectors, in fact it only has 1x USB-C port which may cause a problem if you already own many standard USB devices you want to attach. Asus do offer a Universal Dock that can be connected to the Zenbook – this offers up another USB-C 3.1 plus USB 3.0, HDMI, VGA, RJ45 LAN and a 3-in-1 SD card reader. The downfall is that the Universal Dock either may or may not be included depending on specification and region. According to our contacts in ASUS, The cheaper Core i5 model ships with the basic dock, while the more expensive Core i7 version does not. We do not understand the logic with that decision. We have a review sample and this did not include the Universal Dock so I could not extend the review to tell you any more about this, only that I came across more than one complication when trying to transfer over my testing software. I had to use cloud storage to download software onto the Zenbook, which obviously took a lot longer than I originally expected. It would be worth checking with your local etailer to ensure you get this docking system, as there are three separately priced docks available ranging in price from £49.99 to £139.99. More on this shortly. CPU-Z Cinebench CPU Ranking had the 7500U fall in at 7th place as you can see in the above image, just below a competing Chip from a former Generation Ivy Bridge being the i7 3840QM. PCMARK RealTemp 81 degrees under load is not too bad really considering the diminutive chassis design. It is well outside any situation that would involve thermal throttling, which is good to see. Battery Battery life in this benchmark lasted around 2 hours 49 minutes which in real use terms is about 4-6 hours. It can be fully charged from empty within an hour. During testing I managed to charge the laptop fully in 56 minutes. This is very impressive. Closing Thoughts The Asus Zenbook 3 is a fast ultraportable laptop that blazed through Office, media and real world tests during the review. The Zenbook 3 is very comfortable when used on the lap for many hours at a time and didn’t transfer much heat to my legs which was a welcome surprise. The Zenbook 3 is really lightweight , weighing only 900g and has a power pack that can be easily stowed out of sight when not needed. The screen is beautiful and the 1080p resolution works perfectly for the physical size of the panel. It is ideal for both office duties, surfing the internet and for enjoying full HD movies and media files. The aluminium brush finish looks great on first inspection, but it is a fingerprint magnet and I spent a lot of my review time keeping it clean it (I suffer a little from OCD). Keeping this laptop spotless and in tip top condition was a constant battle during this review. The lack of any standard USB ports may prove a problem for many people. Our review sample didn’t ship with the Universal Dock which offers more versatile connectivity, but we have been told this £49.99 extra ships with the less expensive Core i5 model. If you can make sense of this, we applaud you. The image above shows exactly what ASUS PR sent us when we tried to get more detail on the docking system. You can see there are three docks available. One at £49.99, another at £99.99 and the most expensive version at £139.99. The Core i5 Zenbook 3 gets a £49.99 dock bundled as part of the package. Those people who spend more on the faster Intel Core i7 processor version need to buy one of the three versions if they want decent connectivity options. The fingerprint sensor is a nice little extra and I can see it being a key selling point for some people who hate having to constantly type in passwords to get access to their files. I was a little disappointed with the low resolution web camera- surely they could have incorporated a HD camera into the chassis. The Audio quality is surprisingly good. The speakers handle louder volumes particularly well, with very little distortion. It is a surprisingly capable media oriented laptop. The Zenbook 3 does not produce a lot of heat. It comfortably finds a way to expel hot air with minimal noise. The use of a low voltage processor and no discrete graphics means that ASUS are able to cool the laptop with a single fan. Asus have given the Zenbook 3 a white backlit keyboard which looks fantastic in lower light conditions. There is good spacing between each key and I didn’t find any problems with accidentally tapping more than one key at a time. The touchpad is also very impressive, although I would have liked a little more tactile feedback when clicking the button positions left and right. You can buy from PC WORLD HERE or John Lewis HERE. Pros Lightweight. Charges in under 1 hour. Finger print security. Small. Fast for Browsing. Web storage included. Cons It is fingerprint city. SD webcam is dated. KitGuru says: The ASUS Zenbook 3 is a formidable little ultra portable which gives the Apple Macbook a run for its money. We are disappointed that ASUS don’t bundle a docking system with the more expensive Core i7 version (but they do with the Core i5 version!), so be prepared to spend at least £50 to get access to all those older devices.

The company?s ?Touchless Testing Platform? brings together leading open source, commercial and Accenture proprietary tools and algorithms to automate a robust, touch-less testing process for software ? all guided by artificial intelligence and analytics. It allows testing teams to easily integrate tools from leading players such as Conformiq, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel Saffron, Sauce Labs, Tableau, Tricentis and Worksoft, along with key Accenture innovations, to bring new enterprise software solutions to market faster and with higher quality. Continuous testing is increasingly important as companies look to software as a means of competitive advantage. Depending on the client engagement the platform can be deployed independently or as part of Accenture myWizard?. ?Software testing today still struggles with over-engineering efforts that can result in anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of wasted time and effort,? said managing director and global testing lead for Accenture, Kishore Durg. ?With advances in analytics, artificial intelligence and data visualization, however, it?s now possible to not only find these areas of inefficiencies and eliminate them, but also to uncover business risks and opportunities that weren?t visible before. That is what the Accenture Touchless Testing Platform is designed to do,? added Kishore Durg. ?Accenture Touchless Testing Platform is the latest example of how Accenture is using automation and artificial intelligence to disrupt every aspect of the application lifecycle, and make IT an agent for speed, change and customer experience,? said group chief executive Accenture Technology Services, Bhaskar Ghosh. ?Artificial intelligence is helping us rethink old approaches to testing and helping testers operate smarter and more efficiently. Applying analytics to massive amounts of production and test data is key to spotting trends, predicting failures, managing risk and continuously responding to customer feedback, all of which is critical to competitiveness,? added Ghosh. The newly launched platform also provides testers with early warnings on system anomalies, and real-time guided interventions. The overall test design and execution process is guided by an industry-specific reusable testing repository comprising more than 76,000 test scenarios, scripts and conditions across 33 industries and 280 end-to-end business processes.

Atul Gupta at his home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, in 2011, less than two decades after setting up shop in South Africa with a venture cobbling together personal computers. Image: KEVIN SUTHERLAND In his book ’The Republic of Gupta’, award-winning journalist Pieter-Louis Myburgh looks at how the controversial family started from humble beginnings and set about getting their tentacles into the centre of political power in South Africa It was 1995 and South Africa appeared to have shaken off some of the early jitters of its transition to democracy. A wave of patriotism was now washing over the country, partly driven by the Springboks' fairy-tale victory over New Zealand in the Rugby World Cup final held in Johannesburg in June that year. Nelson Mandela's dream of a Rainbow Nation was within reach and the country's economy had absorbed some of the new-found optimism. Businesses, particularly those in the nascent IT sector, sought to exploit the opportunities that accompanied the new political dispensation. ANC may have to hit rock bottom first — Motlanthe It was within this context that John, a Johannesburg-based businessman, met Atul Gupta and his entourage for the first time. John's business had a footprint in South Africa's young IT sector and Atul, who had been busy setting up Correction Computers and Correct Marketing, his two earliest IT ventures, needed help establishing a network of business contacts in his newly adopted city. "I was at my business's premises when four guys pitched up there in a Toyota Camry, one of those with the little wing on the boot. One of the men introduced himself as Atul Gupta," recalls John. The other men were introduced to him as Mr Roger, Ashu and Tony. Ashu would turn out to be Ashu Chawla, the Gupta associate who would later become the CEO of Sahara Computers. Tony may well have been Rajesh "Tony" Gupta, the youngest of the Gupta brothers. This first encounter was the start of a business relationship that would last for years, one that would give John a front-row seat to the rapid evolution of the Guptas' earliest ventures into a multibillion-rand business empire. "Correction Computers was first operated from a house on Van Buuren Road in Bedfordview," he recalls. "It was one of those houses that had been converted into offices. At that stage they knew nobody in town. They were going around making contacts and finding people who could help them with various aspects concerning their new business." About two years after that first meeting, Atul told John that the family had decided to move their IT endeavours under the umbrella of a new brand and identity, namely Sahara Computers. This new venture, says John, originally operated from a small shop in a retail complex in Midrand. As the business grew, the Guptas opened a second store in Midrand. This would serve as an assembly facility for Sahara Computers. Atul Gupta and Jacob Zuma at a T20 match between South Africa and India at Wanderers Stadium in 2012. Image: GCIS "What they had was a [computer] box on which they put the Sahara logo. The motherboard came from whomever was making motherboards, the chip came from Intel, the hard drive came from another manufacturer. They just put the computers together at the assembly facility in Midrand. But in those days that was how everyone did it, not just Sahara," explains John. Through his interaction with the Guptas, John witnessed some of Atul's less savoury business practices. "He was very hard on his staff; he drove them like mad. It was like drawing blood from a rock. That was just how he operated." Atul apparently also had a way of getting, or at least trying to get, all manner of services for his businesses without having to pay for them. "Even though we were in business, Atul always put pressure on me to do certain things for free," recalls John. "He actually wanted everything for free. It was a matter of putting one's foot down, otherwise you'd end up making a loss in your dealings with him." But when it came to getting paid himself, Atul made sure he was never short-changed. "I once saw how one customer's cheque for a new computer bounced, and Atul would only finally be paid about a week later. He almost cried like a stuck pig over this one bounced cheque," John remembers. By 1998, about a year after Sahara Computers was established, Atul's Toyota Camry was replaced with a BMW M5. "I remember how proud Atul was of his new car," John recalls. "He came to me just to show me his new set of wheels." It would seem that by now Atul viewed John as a confidant, someone with whom he could share some of the more sensitive titbits about his business activities. The Big Read: Wake up! SA has been gutted "It was around the time that Atul showed me his new car that he mentioned the name Jacob Zuma," says John. "It is actually crazy how frank he was about this, but he bragged about having an ANC guy in his pocket. Atul said that when this guy eventually becomes president, their [the Guptas'] ship was going to come in big time." Atul allegedly told John that he was paying school fees for some of Zuma's children. "At the time I didn't really take it seriously," says John. "Zuma was a little-known guy with no hope of ever becoming president. I didn't think a Zulu would stand a chance in an ANC that was dominated by Xhosas." Zuma had, in fact, been elected deputy president of the ANC in December 1997, with Thabo Mbeki as the party's president. At that stage Nelson Mandela was still president of the country. There was no guarantee that Zuma would become deputy president of South Africa after the next national elections in 1999, but he was certainly a rising star. The Guptas themselves claim to have met Zuma in the early 2000s, when he was already deputy president of the country. Gary Naidoo, the family's long-standing spokesperson, once told the Mail & Guardian that Zuma met the Guptas in 2001. Atul Gupta later told the Sunday Times that the family's first meeting with South Africa's then second-in-command took place "around 2002, 2003", when Zuma attended an annual function hosted by Sahara Computers. But according to John, they met him earlier. And, considering the recent revelations about the Guptas' relationship with the Zuma-led government, John is convinced that what Atul allegedly told him all those years ago was true. "Would the Guptas be as wealthy as they are without Zuma?" John asks. "Not at all. They targeted him right from the start, and they chose to go into that type of business path way back then." These are all just allegations, of course. But John's knowledge of the Guptas' earliest business dealings in South Africa certainly suggests he was privy to information that could only have come from the family. This includes the name of the small insurance company that to this day insures the Guptas' businesses. A director at the insurer confirmed that his company is indeed a service provider to the Guptas. John also has a cellphone number for Atul that does indeed belong to the middle brother. In addition, John's claim that the Guptas met Zuma as early as the 1990s is backed up by a former Indian diplomat who was based in South Africa at the time. They [The Guptas] targeted him [Jacob Zuma] right from the start, and they chose to go into that type of business path way back then In April 2016, after revelations came to light about the family's alleged job offers to top government officials, a former Indian high commissioner told the Cape Times: "I remember them [the Guptas]. They were courteous but we were all familiar with their proximity with Zuma in the 1990s. It was understandable that they [would] prosper when he came to power." John was also able to refer me to another of the Guptas' earliest business associates, a Gauteng-based businessman who I will call Joe. Like John, Joe witnessed the rapid growth of the Guptas' computer and IT empire in its earliest days, from selling computers from a rented house in Bedfordview to the establishment of Sahara Computers and its subsidiaries. Sometime during the mid-to-late 1990s, Joe visited Atul Gupta at Sahara's first business premises in Midrand. Joe recalls how small the operation was at that stage: "There was just Atul, the lady that was making the tea and a little Chinese guy called Evan Tak. It was just those three, and there were computer boxes lying everywhere." (According to records at the CPIC companies registrar, Tak became a director at Sahara in 2009.) Soon thereafter, Sahara Computers moved to another office just around the corner from the first. It is the building that Sahara occupies to this day, while the former is now home to Annex Distribution, a Sahara-owned company that distributes Sahara's computer products. "I remember how excited Atul had been about the new building," remembers Joe. "When they moved in it was in quite a bad state. The plugs were hanging from the wall and there were electrical wires coming out of the ceiling." He says it was "incredible" that the Guptas were able to afford such large premises after launching their company just a few years earlier. And after the move, things "just exploded" in terms of the business's success, he adds. Prepare to fork out more millions for Nkandla upgrades "I think they just really had a good business model at that stage, and their timing to enter the computer market was just perfect, seeing as everyone needed computers then," Joe recalls. "They were running specials for something like R2,000 or R3,000 for a whole computer set, which was significantly cheaper than most of their rivals in the industry." While he remembers Atul as a humble and friendly person, Joe, like John, also experienced the Gupta brothers' more ruthless side. "Whenever I did work for them, Atul would [haggle] over the bill I'd send him. He would always maintain that he could get the job done for much cheaper elsewhere, and then he'd end up paying me only half of what he owed me." Joe also witnessed first-hand the inner workings of the Gupta family structure. "Ajay Gupta is definitely the main guy," he says. "When he walked into the office, everyone would stand up, and when he spoke, everyone would keep quiet to hear what the big boss had to say." Although the Guptas never discussed with him any details about their ties to government officials or politicians, Joe did pick up signs as far back as the early 2000s that Atul had a connection with Zuma. "I do remember seeing a photo in Atul's office of him and Zuma at a school somewhere, with a whole bunch of computers," remembers Joe. "It was during the time when Zuma had still been deputy president, so it had to have been before 2005." While the context of the photograph is unclear, it is nevertheless interesting to note that one of the Guptas' first major government contracts was for the supply of computers to schools.

Before the end of 2016, it was reported that the software giant successfully converted its current OS to run on a Snapdragon 820-based mobile device. After that, Microsoft announced that it will start working on porting the said operating system to the Snapdragon 835. Qualcomm seems to confirm that the upcoming ARM-based Windows 10 device will be coming just before the end of 2017. According to IDG Enterprise’s CIO, Microsoft and Qualcomm are collaborating on a design of a cellular PC that runs on an ARM chip instead of an Intel or AMD processor. Unfortunately, details of the device are still a bit murky. However, it is said that the device in question will have direct cellular connectivity. Also, 5th generation Bluetooth wireless technology will be a main feature of the device. Further, it seems that the build of the device will be a 2-in-1 form factor enabling it to function as a tablet or a laptop. With this news, many are now beginning to think that this is the new Surface Pro 5. Especially now that it is rumored that the Surface Book will eventually assume a clamshell design instead of the 2-in-1 form factor. Windows 10 UI (via microsoft.com) Unfortunately, Microsoft decline to comment on the report. However, as Qualcomm puts it, the said ARM-powered Windows 10 device will be available on the fourth quarter of 2017. At the moment, Microsoft is still perfecting the conversion of the Windows 10 operating system to ARM instruction set. It has been showcased late last year that the idea works in general. However, at the time of introduction, Microsoft is still sorting out major bugs in the system. It would seem that Microsoft is diversifying its portfolio starting with the ARM SoC. As more ARM-based products are being released year after year, it is only logical that Microsoft aims for the platform as well. This now leaves the question of Apple following suit with Microsoft. Unfortunately, the Cupertino company already clarified that it does not have any intentions of releasing a fully ARM-powered MacBook or MacBook Pro anytime soon. However, it may require ARM chips on some of its peripherals for its line of Mac computers. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Bajenting STOPPED BEFORE ‘RESCUE ATTEMPT’. A police team escorts Renierlo Dongon (center), a suspected bomb maker who got caught Sunday in a checkpoint in Clarin, Bohol. SUNSTAR FOTO / ALAN TANGCAWAN The local police in Clarin, Bohol took custody of a police official from the crime laboratory in Region 11 in Davao City and a suspected bomb maker after allegedly finding them on board a black Nissan Navarra pick-up while the second encounter between government troops and suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) ensued Saturday night. An intelligence source, who asked not to be named, said the official was with a driver whom he described as a Tausug. “They were driving fast, that’s why they were flagged down in a military roadblock near a resort in Barangay Bacani. Intel personnel saw her throw a cellphone on the ground,” he said. The cellphone was traced and the intelligence officer learned that the woman and her driver were allegedly contacting the remaining members of the Abu Sayyaf. “They were allegedly trying to rescue a 17-year-old alias Asis, who was royalty in Basilan,” another source said. Local police have not yet confirmed the information, but said that the police official and the bomb expert were in their office for tactical interrogation past 11 p.m. Saturday. The driver, according to an intelligence police who asked not to be named, is a bomb expert identified as Renierlo “Kudri” Dongon, brother-in-law of former Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Solaiman, alias Abdurajik Janjalani, and his brother Khadafi Janjalani. The two were brought to the Bohol Provincial Police Station (BPPO) at 5 p.m. with a convoy full of Special Weapons and Tactics (Swat) men. At 7 p.m., Chief Insp. Gaylord Tamayo, officer-in-charge of the Inabanga police conducted the search inside the vehicle. Police discovered flippers and snorkeling gear, a police-issued firearm, sets of clothes, first aid kits and food inside. “It’s up to the investigators now to determine the case to be filed against these persons,” Tamayo said. The confiscated items were believed to be supplies to help the remaining suspected Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members in fleeing Bohol. The police official is under the custody of the local police while the bomb expert was already arrested by the virtue of a warrant of arrest for double murder and double murder with attempted murder. It was issued by Judge Vincent Rosales in Branch 23 of the Regional Trial Court in Cagayan De Oro. This was related to the bombing incident in Maxandrea Hotel in Cagayan de Oro last Oct. 11, 2012 in which he allegedly took part as one of the three bombers. The incident, which killed two persons and hurt two cops, was intended to bomb the vehicle of GMA network parked outside the hotel allegedly because of a TV coverage that aired what they claimed to be material offensive to their doctrine, a police report said. Dongon also revealed that his sister Saynab was the wife of Khadafi Janjalani, an ASG leader, who remarried after the death of Janjalani “Maroan” Ebrahim, a Malaysian national and an active member of the Al-Qaeda operating in the provinces of Cotabato and Lanao.

Eben Upton talks chips, children and the future of tech Monday 24 April 2017  | Comment Now Where do you go when you're already at the top? Raspberry Pi creator Eben Upton reveals all Walking into the Raspberry Pi Foundation's office, you wouldn't think it housed one of the most influential tech companies of the last decade. Situated on one floor of a small Cambridge building – which resembles a 1970s university library rather than a technological hub – flanked by impressive, modern buildings owned by Microsoft, Deloitte and KPMG, Raspberry Pi's quietly carries on changing the face of computing. Having started from humble origins, the company behind the £30 microcomputer has gone from strength to strength. It recently celebrated three milestones almost simultaneously: hitting its 5th birthday, its eighth product launch and the sale of its 12 millionth unit. One of the driving forces behind Raspberry Pi Foundation's success is Eben Upton, the founder and mastermind behind the Raspberry Pi. With stints at Broadcom, Intel and IBM - not to mention a three-year tenure as Cambridge University's director of studies for computer science - Upton has an impressive technical pedigree behind him. That knowledge quickly becomes evident upon talking to him and it's immediately clear that the Raspberry Pi is the definition of a passion project for Upton. His eyes light up when speaking about the engineering problems and you can feel his boundless enthusiasm for all things technical ooze out of every pore. Habitually dressed in jeans and rolled-up shirtsleeves, Upton's demeanour is a cross between a well-liked sixth form teacher and a starry-eyed Silicon valley programmer. I get the impression that this isn't a carefully-crafted look of artificial nonchalance commonly worn by tech CEOs, but a genuine result of Upton getting his hands dirty with the day-to-day grunt work of engineering alongside the rest of his staff. He dismissed the idea of working on shiny new technologies like AI, saying (with obvious relish) "the stuff we're good at tends to be grungy, low-level systems programming". It's this passion that's driven the Raspberry Pi Foundation since the beginning. Founded as a way to get more kids into computing at an earlier age, the Foundation has always been motivated by its values rather than its bottom line. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Raspberry Pi Zero – a fully functional computer priced at a mind-boggling $5. Roughly the size of a packet of chewing gum, the Zero is Upton's favourite product – a fact given away by the beaming grin that breaks out across his face when I first bring it up in conversation. "I made a million computers," Upton points out, "and I turned over five million dollars." For any other tech company, selling a product that cheaply would be lunacy. For Upton, though, the very concept of how howlingly insane a business move it was is part of the reason why he's so fond of the Zero. "I love that we were able to do it," he says; "I love that it worked." In many ways, the Raspberry Pi Zero is emblematic of the company as a whole. The first Pi models were a runaway hit but, rather than resting on their laurels, Upton and his team went and built the world's smallest commercial PC purely for fun. "It was just wonderful to be able to take a business that was going well and still be aggressive enough to say 'what happens if we just tear it up and do something else?'" With all this hardware innovation going on, it's easy to forget that devices like the Zero are effectively a side project for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. "You've got to remember that actually, in the end, we're a charity," Upton says. The foundation was set up with the aim of getting kids into computing, but its efforts don't stop at making cheaply available hardware for them to practise on. Outside of the hardware business, the Foundation puts most of its focus on grassroots education projects like Code Club. Following its acquisition in 2015, Raspberry Pi owns and operates Code Club as a subsidiary, setting up volunteer-staffed after-school clubs to teach kids about programming, computing and other digital skills. "Code Club is amazing. What never fails to astound me is the number of kids – there's over 5,000 Code Clubs, we've reached about 75,000 kids." Video of What Does a Code Club look like? "We've got to the point where more than half of the schools [in our age bracket] Code Clubs," Upton says. "It changes what the question is. The question isn't 'what's a Code Club?', the question for a parent is 'why doesn't my school have a Code Club? Because my friend's child's school has a Code Club?'" Not only has Code Club proved to be a huge success over here, it's also expanded internationally. There are hundreds of franchised Code Clubs in countries including Australia, South Korea and Brazil, all of which are working within their communities to get kids working with computers at an earlier age. Upton's goal with Code Club, he says, is "finishing off the UK". While he acknowledged the changing nature of tech means the job's never “done”, his aim is to reach the point where there's a Code Club in every school. This, along with the Foundation's other efforts, like its Picademy teacher training programme, is geared towards combatting the tech industry's burgeoning skills shortage. In particular, Upton is aiming to bring more girls into the tech workforce, which continues to struggle with a serious gender imbalance. "It's the single thing you can change," he says. "Participation rates among women are so low that if you got them up to the same level as they are already among men, then you'd effectively be doubling your workforce. If there's one bit of low-hanging fruit, that's the one." He's aiming to fix this problem through getting girls invested at an earlier age. It appears to be going well; roughly 40% of Code Club attendees are girls, a proportion that far outstrips most tech firms. "The reason it's nice that we're doing this intervention around Code Club at nine to 11 is that is a window where if you can get a girl to the end [of it] and she's still excited about [tech], there's every chance that she'll continue to be excited about it all the way through her career." The progress of the five-year-old foundation is impressive but, for Upton, the important thing is that it's built to last. The way the Foundation is governed has recently been revamped in order to make it self-sustaining. Under the new organisation, the foundation maintains a broad pool of expert members, who are elected by their fellow members to join the board of trustees. The first trustee to be elected under this new system is Dr. Tilly Blyth, head of collections and principal curator at the Science Museum in London. "That gives us some confidence that we're in this for the long run," he says. "We're trying to build an organisation that's going to outlive me; if this organisation dies before I do, I will be very unhappy. You don't want to be predeceased by your children and you don't want to be predeceased by your charitable foundations." So is all this effort paying off? Well, early signs would suggest that it is. The dip in university admissions for computing courses – the problem the foundation was originally created to solve – has reversed. In fact, since its creation in 2012, applications to Cambridge's computer science course have doubled. Upton's witnessed the impact of his efforts first-hand. "When I used to interview people, it used to take me an afternoon to interview my people for my college. I bumped into my successor in a bar after interviews last year, and it was the end of the week, and he was leaning on the bar; he'd had 42 applicants, I used to have six. He was leaning on the bar with a pint of beer, completely ashen-faced," he laughs, "so I've ruined his life!"   Eben Upton exudes passion. From corporate governance to product design to outreach initiatives, it's clear there isn't a single element of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's work which doesn't utterly captivate him. The company he created is thriving and he appears to be accomplishing that most elusive of Silicon Valley goals: making the world a better place. So what's next for the baker of the Raspberry Pi? Founding another startup? Political ambitions, perhaps? According to Upton, working at Raspberry Pi is just too much fun to pass up. "What's not to like: surround yourself with a staff of easy-going geniuses and build great toys all day long! So I'm still here, and while it's still fun, I'll be here."

Although many see the casualisation of the workforce that this growth represents as an inherently bad thing – rightly focusing on the way in which technology is tending to convert full-time work into part-time “gigs” – there may well be a big upside. Co-working is a model that gives workers themselves, the digital nomads of gig economy, more control over their working lives. How big is the sector? Small Business Labs, an organisation that monitors it around the world, suggests that the number of people renting such spaces will grow globally from just under 1m in 2016 to nearly 4m in 2020. According to research by user experience researchers Melissa Gregg and Thomas Lodato, co-working can be a positive choice for many freelancers . They argue that, in part, such workers are seeking “relief from the emotional demands of the corporate office”. Seventeen jobs, five careers: learning in the age of automation Read more Co-working spaces, they write, “expanded significantly in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008/9”, adding this “style of work emerged in response to the slow plod of austerity, hollowed-out corporations, underemployment and career insecurity”. They argue that “co-working spaces met a growing demand for care and fulfilment as much as employment”. So is co-working a good thing in itself or simply a rational response to negative changes in traditional workplaces? Gregg, who is principal engineer in the Business Client Research and Strategy Client Computing Group at Intel Corporation, says with all the variations of experience there is no simple answer to that. Still, she says, “I regard co-working as the most optimistic example we have of conducting enterprise on our own terms. I like that it is often an experience of work that is determined by workers themselves.” Isolation is one of the key problems that arises for freelancers and providing this sort of human contact – a community of fellow nomads – has become the secret sauce of the co-working industry, a large part of what makes it attractive. Karen Corr, founder of the Make A Change organisation, says it would never have got off the ground without the existence of the Synergize Hub in Bendigo but that it was ultimately the community experience that kept her there, even as her organisation grew. Travel blogger Monika Pietrowski writes that after “a solid stint in the corporate world, I gave up the security, the scrutiny and the stress for a nomadic lifestyle”. She says that co-working communities have been central to this change and, although it can be hit or miss, the “biggest advantage for me is the people interaction and social setting”. Lipstick on the robot: why is everyone suddenly happy about tech unemployment? | Tim Dunlop Read more Gregg and Lodato write: “Co-working spaces provide an environment in which professionals can anticipate, withstand and perhaps even wait out the volatility of the competitive job market that surrounds them.” So do they expect the labour market to return to a more traditional form, with less of the sort “gig” work that suits co-working? “Not exactly,” Gregg says. “I think there is a pervasive sense of caution right now that co-working is a speculative economy in a classic sense – it is dependent on real estate and property value.” Indeed co-working spaces have become an attractive choice for landlords, real estate agents and other firms looking to fill floorspace as more traditional tenants, such as retailers, close down. US figures indicate co-working may account for as much as 2% of the office market by 2020. But for those who can “wait out” the job market changes, Gregg thinks they will have developed something “of long term, resilient value” with the co-working space as the centre of a useful network that would not otherwise have been available. In fact, the researchers believe co-working could be a glimpse into a more positive future. They write, “A more just future of work may have less to do with labour hours, the creation of welfare programs or the opening of resources and more to do with hospitality: with whom, through what means, and in which environments we associate and affiliate with fellow workers.” As attractive as this idea is, it could only work if it was underpinned with more formal means of security, something like a universal basic income. If co-working is to be anything more than a temporary response to precarity, don’t we need adequate state welfare measures in place? “Absolutely we do,” Gregg says. “But the state manifests differently in context and it is hard to imagine how this works in Trump’s America, for instance. “Still, I like to think of co-working in terms of what philosopher Peter Sloterdijk calls ‘co-immunity’ – creating shared bubbles of protection that allow people the space to conduct the practices that help them realise their potential.” Nonetheless, she notes, “I don’t pretend that co-working is suitable for all kinds of workers.” Some freelancers point out that the spaces can be noisy and hard to work in. Anis Qizilbash, who runs a sales training business, did several six-month stints but isn’t keen to continue. “I felt uncomfortable and it was hard to concentrate. Often there would be music playing and, being an introvert, I hated the open-plan workspace.” There is not escaping the fact that the nature of work is changing, however, so it’s worth embracing the positive aspects of that change. What constitutes a job is no longer neatly bound by notions of a career, the nine-to-five, of 40-hour weeks and four-weeks’ holiday leave, and nor should it be. Flexibility that empowers workers – as opposed to the sort of “flexibility” imposed from above by employers – should be welcomed and co-working spaces may enable that sort of change. It could be the testing ground for an entirely reimagined notion of employment. “Co-working,” Gregg says, may well be “the millennial’s MBA”.

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) 22 April, 2017 04:25 - - - - print email Comments A Microsoft document detailing the minimum hardware specs for Microsoft Windows 10 Cloud-powered laptops seems to be the best evidence yet that Microsoft plans to launch a Chromebook competitor on May 2. Windows Central obtained a “recommended minimum spec” document, presumably handed out to Microsoft’s partners. The document outlines what Microsoft hopes to achieve with what the document calls an “Edu Cloud device” (and industry watchers have dubbed "Cloudbooks"): all-day battery life, a quick boot and resume cycle, and at least a quad-core Intel Celeron processor powering it all. It’s also titled “Windows 10 Cloud Performance Targets,” confirming the name of the new OS. A Microsoft representative declined to comment. Microsoft’s invitation to an education-focused launch event in New York on May 2 hinted strongly that a Chromebook competitor was in the cards. Though Windows PCs dominate the workplace, Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks have quickly insinuated themselves into American classrooms. Google and its partners have pitched Chromebooks as affordable, simple to use and manage, and rugged enough to survive student use. Windows 10 Cloud appears to be Microsoft's attempt to go back to school. The impact on you: One key advantage of a Chromebook, from Google’s perspective, is that it contributes to a virtuous cycle: Kids use the popular Android tablets and phones at home, then access something similar in the classroom. To help break that chain, Microsoft needs to get kids used to Windows. While this may have little impact on you personally, you might say that this is a fight for the hearts and minds of your children. What Cloudbooks will contain Windows 10 Cloud reportedly will restrict apps to the Windows Store, forbidding the use of non-Store apps like Google Chrome. Microsoft’s document also notes that its performance benchmarks assume the use of Intune device management policies specifically designed for the classroom. The spec document plainly states that Microsoft considers Chromebooks its chief competition. In a comparison of “performance benchmarks,” Microsoft’s target is 10-plus hours of “all day” battery life, with cold-boot times of 20 seconds and resume times of under 2 seconds. The document does not list suggested pricing. Likewise, Microsoft lays out what hardware the new devices should include: a quad-core chip, like a Celeron, or higher; 4GB of RAM, and at least 32GB of eMMC or SSD storage. Interestingly, pen and touchscreen capabilities are listed as “optional,” which would discard one of the chief advantages that a typical Windows PC has over a Chromebook. Who will make these devices remains a mystery at the moment. PC companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo have all already built Chromebooks, meaning they’ll have to choose between platforms, or support both. It’s telling, though, that Microsoft itself admits at least internally that it Windows 10 Cloud-based laptops won’t quite measure up to the competition. In its comparison of the two platforms, the document notes that Chromebooks are faster to cold-boot to a login screen (20 seconds to 15 seconds) as well as from the sign-in screen to the desktop (15 seconds versus 10 seconds). We’ll have to see how Microsoft spins this: Selling something that's almost-as-good as the competition doesn’t sound like much of a pitch. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The blog, initially posted on ShareAmerica, a State Department platform used for sharing what it describes as "compelling stories" detailed the history of Trump’s “Winter White House.”  It immediately led to concerns that the U.S. government was promoting Trump's private resort.  “The intention of the article was to inform the public about where the President has been hosting world leaders,” the web page now reads. “We regret any misperception and have removed the post.” ADVERTISEMENT Ethics groups have warned about the potential conflict of interest presented by the private Florida resort.

X Funding and sponsorships for business courses: what to know A look at the many options that can help students finance their business course about 8 hours ago John Cradden Prospective business students may need to look at multiple finance sources, including scholarships and bursaries as well as loans and employer sponsorship. Photograph: Getty Images/iStockphoto         If you want to do a top-notch business course or MBA, you’ll have to work harder to find funding because the fees charged can be far higher than for courses in other disciplines. For example, a full-time MBA at UCD’s Smurfit Business School or TCD’s Business school will cost well over €30,000 a year, while similar programmes at DCU, NUIG or UCC will cost about €13,000-€14,000 a year. Even a reputable non-MBA programme, such as the MSc in marketing at TCD, can set you back €13,500. This means you may need to look at multiple sources, including scholarships and bursaries as well as loans and employer sponsorship. There are a number of well-known bursaries and scholarships available that has been used for any discipline at third level, such as the cross-Border North-South Postgraduate Scholarships (closing May 4th), the Government of Ireland scholarships or the Fullbright awards for study in the United States (both now closed). Many universities and colleges have their own scholarship programmes that can go towards the cost of any degree programme, but there are quite a few ones aimed specifically at those wishing to study business-related programmes or MBAs. Some of this year’s schemes (for 2017 entry) have already closed, but a few remain open for the next few weeks. Some of the scholarships are particularly generous, so naturally the competition to obtain them is tough. High achievers If you have a top academic record, there are several scholarships for high achievers, such as TCD’s 10 merit-based scholarships that pay 30 per cent of its MBA fees, or UCD’s Achiever scholarships that pay up to 100 per cent of MBA fees. TCD and DCU have both launched scholarships for study at its business schools for high-achieving women in partnership with the 30% Club, which are aimed at helping to increase the representation of women on boards of management and executive management levels. TCD is offering one full scholarship and six bursaries worth €5,000 towards its MBA programmes, while DCU is offering a €10,000 bursary towards postgraduate study at its business school. UCD’s Smurfit School offers a range of scholarships, albeit mostly for students undertaking its MBA programmes or PhDs, but also for some diploma courses and taught MSc courses, such as the MSc in business analytics (worth up to €13,350) or the MSc in aviation finance (worth up to €21,300), which both close for applications in June. There is also the long-running Aspire programme offering 50 per cent funding for course fees for three MBA and nine MSc students for 2017. Closing date is April 29th. At the University of Limerick, the Kemmy Business School offers a number of post-grad fee waivers of €2,000, while the NUIG’s JE Cairnes School of Business & Economics is planning to launch a scholarship for its executive MBA programme. Scholarships and bursaries for institutions further down the scale tend to be less common and more general than just for business-related courses. Many Institutes of Technology offer sports sponsorships, for instance. Some colleges will reward you financially if you can successfully refer prospective students from overseas to them. For instance, students at the Dublin Business School could get up to €500 if they refer such a person. You may need to approach banks or credit unions for additional support. Some may have designated loans specifically for paying course fees. For instance, at Trinity College Dublin there is a scheme called Trinity Finance that offers loans to students to cover the annual €3,000 student contribution charge for undergraduate students. Charged at a rate of 7.5 per cent, the loan can be taken out each year for up to five years. In general terms, credit union student loans are often cheaper, with some offering rates as low as 5 per cent. If you are about to graduate but are set on doing such a course, you could consider targeting a job at a graduate employer that is known to pay for tuition fees for its staff For postgraduate students, Bank of Ireland offers loans of up to €14,000 at a discounted rate of 5.6 per cent with flexible repayment options over a period of up to five years. Don’t forget that there is tax relief on postgraduate tuition fees. You may consider working part time to fund your studies – research students, in particular, may be offered tutorial work, exam marking etc. But do remember that it is less easy to absorb part-time work into the demands of a taught postgraduate course than it may be on undergraduate courses. Employer sponsorship It’s definitely not as common as it used to be, but some employers, particularly multinationals, will still support staff to undertake some of the more expensive taught postgraduate business programmes, including MBAs and professional courses. If you are about to graduate but are set on doing such a course, you could consider targeting a job at a graduate employer that is known to pay for tuition fees for its staff, like Google, Salesforce, Microsoft, LinkedIn or Intel. Intel, for instance, provides financial assistance (tuition reimbursement or prepaid graduate tuition) for eligible employees who are completing job-related degree programs, coursework, certificates, and foreign language training. If a Microsoft employee wants to pursue further education, the firm will pay for two-thirds the cost of their course, be it a diploma, certificate or even a master’s. However, it’s hard to find specific references to smaller or indigenous firms who provide formal tuition benefit or assistance schemes for postgraduate study. Staff at universities and colleges we contacted were not aware off-hand of any companies beyond the multinationals who pay full tuition fees for postgraduate programmes as a policy, although they might offer bursaries. The exception may be for accountancy firms, as its part of the culture to provide support towards professional accreditations such as ACCA, ACA, CIMA and CPA and possibly some relevant postgraduate study. US firm Hedgeserv provides tuition support for its employees in Cork and Dublin. “In our experience, on a case-by-case basis most employers will contribute significantly if it is work related,” said a spokesman for the National College of Ireland. So if you’re currently in work and your employer has no formal tuition benefit or assistance scheme, you will have to convince your boss to sponsor or part-sponsor you or possibly give you paid study leave. The trick is to prove that it will be of benefit to the company as well as your own career. There may well be a particular course on offer that seems like a no-brainer, but it’s worth researching other options that might be available to present as a shortlist. It may also be worth bearing in mind programmes in third-level institutions that are directly sponsored by firms and which offer students the opportunity to work with them. Financial services firm State Street is providing 20 paid internships with a €20,000 salary to students on the MSc by research in fintech programme at Cork University Business School. The student’s only task is whatever fintech research project they are doing.       Topics: John Cradden Business School Dublin Business School Kemmy Business School National College of Ireland School Of Business Smurfit School Trinity College Dublin University Business University College Cork University of Limerick Aca Aviation Finance Bank of Ireland Cima Cpa Google Hedgeserv Intel Linkedin Microsoft Salesforce Trinity Finance Dublin(IE) Ireland United States Read More Free speech under threat on our college campuses Where have all of Ireland’s teachers gone?

Facilities - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 24 Apr, 2017, 18:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Server Microprocessor Unit (MPU) Market 2017-2021" report to their offering. The global server MPU market to grow at a CAGR of 2.73% during the period 2017-2021. The report, Global Server MPU Market 2017-2021, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. According to the report, one driver in market is increased infrastructure spending. HPC is required for analytic applications like big data analytics and other complex cloud-based applications. These applications help operate both virtualized and physical servers in data centers. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft own data centers that are equipped with energy-efficient servers. The rising demand for servers from these organizations will aid the adoption of additional servers. The investment required for servers in data centers is high. In addition, vendors design and manufacture servers, such as mission-critical servers or HPC servers, as per the business needs. The cost of this high-performance infrastructure is also high, fueling the development of white-box servers. White-box servers cost much less compared with branded servers in performing the same operational tasks. During the forecast period, business growth will necessitate the adoption of complex applications with huge volumes of data. This will lead to the construction of additional data centers and adoption of white-box servers at a reduced capital expenditure (CAPEX).

(AMD) Stock Has Too Much Hype AMD stock remains a minnow in a sea of sharks By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 24, 2017, 12:12 pm EDT     View All   Popular Posts: 5 Tech Stocks to Buy for Growth AND Dividends Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) Stock Must Die Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Will Soar With the Rising Cloud Recent Posts: Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Has Too Much Hype Buy Square Inc (SQ) Stock If You Love Innovation Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Is a Dead Drugmaker Walking View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a good little company that designs fast microprocessor chips and has niches in gaming, with its Radeon graphics and in low-priced PC hardware, with Ryzen. CEO Lisa Su and her team have done a great job. But that’s not how an AMD stock investor should look at it. Source: Shutterstock As I explained last month, it’s relative valuation that counts: the value of the company’s activities relative to what should be its value in the market. Early in 2016, at $2 per share, Advanced Micro Devices was woefully underpriced. Last month, it was over-priced. Since my March article, it’s down nearly 12%. It will next announce earnings May 1, and analysts expect a loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $982.55 million. That’s a slightly bigger loss, on a lot less revenue, than in the Christmas quarter. Semiconductors tend to be seasonal. The company is well-managed. So, naturally, what analysts now want you to do with AMD stock is sell, sell, sell. What Is the Natural Value of AMD Stock? The analysts who are screaming sell expect a decline in the general market, and the danger signs of heavy weather coming are everywhere. A crazy, dysfunctional government, an unsettled international situation, a recovery that has gone on for 8 years and is due to roll over — the signs are obvious, their portents heavy. But why sell AMD stock? It’s because Ryzen is a lot like past generations of Advanced Micro Devices chips. It costs less than Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) chips, yes, but it only delivers just as much performance. If you squint. It offers good value if you’re doing office work, but for gaming, which is where you push the envelope in PCs these days, it doesn’t quite measure up to the best from Intel. Putting a value on AMD thus becomes difficult. You could draw a line from 2015’s $3.9 billion in sales to 2016’s $4.3 billion, assume a small profit of 8 cents per share on $4.74 billion of revenue for 2017. That’s what the average analyst is estimating, with a hold rating. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, put out a sell rating on April 6, expecting a 20% drop. AMD stock got half of that drop overnight: the shares went from $14.18 to $12.83 between the close April 5 to the end of the first hour of trading on April 6. You can do that if you’re Goldman Sachs. You’re in the business of making stocks move.

Landrum, opinion contributor - 04/24/17 02:00 PM EDT 2   © Getty Images The late Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman once said the social responsibility of business is to make a profit. He contended that anything businesses do to invest their money elsewhere detracts from the purpose of making money.  In that vein, businesses have often focused exclusively on making a profit. Now that Earth Day is passed and gimmicky connections are over, it is time to get real. Businesses in the 21st century have a moral and corporate social responsibility to heed the protection of the environment. ADVERTISEMENT In 1970, Earth Day was started by Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-Wis.) in response to environmental degradation and to advocate for environmental protection.  Later that year, President Richard Nixon signed an executive order to create the Environmental Protection Agency which initiated the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and more.  The government took a leadership position in protecting the environment. On Earth Day 1971, Iron Eyes Cody portrayed a crying Native American in the Keep America Beautiful ad campaign aimed at reducing litter and pollution.  One of the most memorable ads in history, it helped reduce littering by 88 percent. This partnership between The Advertising Council, Keep America Beautiful and Marsteller, Inc. is an example of nonprofits and business working together for social change to protect our environment. But today’s EPA is taking a new direction, one that has many alarmed, including its own employees.  The EPA is considering rolling back environmental protections against air pollutants that cause smog as well as eliminating programs that prevent exposure to lead poisoning for children, pregnant women, and workers who remove lead paint.    President Donald Trump's administration has already supported the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, revoked protections against dumping mining waste into streams, revoked the lead ammunition and fishing tackle ban on federal lands and waters, removed all reference to climate change on federal websites, significantly reduced the EPA’s budget, dismantled numerous regulations of the Clean Power Plan that protect against increasing carbon emissions, and rejected a proposal to ban continued use of a toxic pesticide. These moves have the support of some businesses and industries that believe the environmental regulations are too harsh and restrictive. But environmental destruction is blamed on advances made during the industrial revolution fueled by the business pursuit of profit. The industrial revolution refers to the gains made by business and industry since the development of mechanization in manufacturing around the late 1700s and throughout the 1800s. These technological advances allowed society to move from small farms and agrarian lifestyles to agribusiness. From artisan handicrafts to mass production, oil lamps to gas lights, horse-powered wagons to steam-powered railways, business and industry were the heartbeat of the industrial revolution. But as a result of the industrial revolution, we have climate change, pollution, toxicity, landfills, dead zones, environmental degradation and more. Because business and industry are partially responsible for our current environmental conditions, the social responsibility of business now is to save our planet. Scientists warn us that we are at a crucial time when radical change is needed.  To avoid much worse impacts of climate change, scientists advise that we need to keep the average global temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees Celsius. Within that scenario, the fossil fuel industry risks a $33 trillion loss, the U.S. agriculture industry risks 10-20 percent or more loss in crop yields, the U.S. energy industry will spend $12 billion more annually to fight rising temperatures, and we could lose up to $507 billion worth of U.S. property. Without radical innovative change, business-as-usual with small advances to reduce unsustainability could put us on the path to a 6 degree Celsius or more increase in average global temperatures.  This is well beyond the 2-degree recommendation. Two reports in recent years (from CDP and Ceres) both confirm that business is not doing enough.  Current corporate sustainability efforts amount to efforts to “be less bad” and are insufficient to tackle the foreboding environmental problems before us. Switching to biodegradable or compostable products is a “less bad” approach that may sound eco-friendly, but when put in the trash and sent to the landfill, the products are sealed within the earth without access to natural processes, such as sunlight, water, and oxygen, that allow the products to biodegrade.  Walmart has just settled a lawsuit for selling products in California that make these misleading biodegradable or compostable claims.  The better choice would be to avoid producing, buying, and using plastic altogether.    While Columbia, REI, and The North Face are marketing the reduced environmental impact of their apparel, Patagonia is the only one telling us to repair and keep what you have and don’t buy more stuff.  This is the radical shift needed by businesses. Business leaders, such as Intel, PepsiCo, Google, and Tesla have communicated to Trump’s administration their commitment to continue sustainability efforts.  But more aggressive action is needed that includes the cooperation of business and industry, nonprofits, governments, and citizens.   Unchanged, the current approach toward corporate sustainability will continue to contribute to increasing sea level rise and more loss of waterfront property, more frequent extreme weather events, increased air pollution, further extinction of plant and animal life, and an increasing number of human deaths. This approach will keep us on track for increasing climate change.  Without radical innovative change, we threaten the very existence of human life. We recognize business must make a profit to remain viable. But profit cannot be the sole purpose of the business’ existence. Businesses must exist to improve the livelihood of communities and people, not only because it is the moral thing to do, but because it is in the best interest of society. Contrary to Friedman’s adage, the social responsibility of business is not to make a profit.  The social responsibility of business is to help save the planet for human life. The earth does not need us; we need her. Nancy E.

 Trump admits he 'never realized how big' a job the presidency is in big interview on first 100 days Associated Press Apr. 24, 2017, 10:02 AM 26,695 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. AP Photo/Andrew Harnik A transcript of an Oval Office interview Friday with President Donald Trump by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace. Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used. AP: I do want to talk to you about the 100 days. TRUMP: Good. AP: I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview. TRUMP: Did you see Aya (Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years) ... AP: Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about? TRUMP: No, just — you know, I asked the government to let her out. ... You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero. AP: How did you hear about this story? TRUMP: Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize — I mean, she was in a rough place. AP: Did you have to strike a deal with (Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah) el-Sisi over this? TRUMP: No. No deal. He was here. He — I said, "I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out." And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ... Trump with Aya Hijazi, an American who was freed from jail in Egypt, in April. Thomson Reuters TRUMP: Yeah, it's funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel. (Crosstalk) AP: Really? TRUMP: Chancellor Merkel. And I guess somebody shouted out, "Shake her hand, shake her hand," you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time. AP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her? TRUMP: No. Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sisi. ... So it was a great thing to see that happen. Trump with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, in March. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst AP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change? TRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier. It's not very meaningful. I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sisi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ... I've developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody's written that. In fact, they said, "Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely," because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, "Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up." He'll pay. AP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting? TRUMP: He's going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it's a different kind of a presidency. AP: Do you feel like that's one thing that you've changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things? TRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, "I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing," or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ... I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million. Gen. (Jim) Mattis (the defense secretary), who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, "I've never seen anything like this in my life." We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut — same planes, same everything — was because of me. I mean, because that's what I do. Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those. ... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, "Could I thank you?" I said, "What?" He said, "You saved us $100 million." Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they (bought). Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of — it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes. Trump with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, in February. AP Photo/Susan Walsh AP: And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order? TRUMP: More. I'm gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn (Hewson), she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know? ___ AP: Do you feel like you've been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well? TRUMP: I have great relationships with Congress. I think we're doing very well, and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it's — we've worked on it long and hard. And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know, I had to get, like, a little bit of grounding, right? Health care started after 30 day(s), so I've been working on health care for 60 days. ... You know, we're very close. And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved. AP: Is it this deal that's between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you're looking at? TRUMP: So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They're great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don't have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it's fine. But you know, there's a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we'll be in great shape on that. It's going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent. AP: That takes precedent over health care? For next week? TRUMP: Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the 100 days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the 100 days. But we've done a lot. You have a list of things. I don't have to read it. Trump with House Speaker Paul Ryan. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts AP: You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan? TRUMP: Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a 100-day plan. But yeah. Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ... (Crosstalk.) TRUMP: But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi (Jinping of China), we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, "By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem," doesn't work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, No. 1. No. 2, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing. It's not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything? AP: I'm OK, thank you. No. ... TRUMP: But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator, the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, "By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you're a currency manipulator." It doesn't work that way. AP: Right. TRUMP: And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know, some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, "He didn't call them a currency manipulator." Well, for two reasons. No. 1, he's not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it's like generalities, it's not. They have — they've actually — their currency's gone up. So it's a very, very specific formula. And I said, "How badly have they been," ... they said, "Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency." That's No. 1, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't. Can you imagine? ... AP: So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success? Trump applauds Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his public swearing-in ceremony at the White House on April 10. AP Photo/Evan Vucci TRUMP: No, because much of the foundation's been laid. Things came up. I'll give you an example. I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 (day) plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge. AP: I think it's on there. TRUMP: I don't know. ... AP: "Begin the process of selecting." You actually exceeded on this one. This says, "Begin the process of selecting a replacement." TRUMP: That's the biggest thing I've done. AP: Do you consider that your biggest success? TRUMP: Well, I — first of all, I think he's a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years. ... He's a young man. I've always heard that that's the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I've done one in my first 70 days. Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. ... I'm rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million — look at that, that's a massive amount of money. And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes — Gen. Mattis said, "I've never seen anything like this," because he had to sign the ultimate (unintelligible). ... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, "I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military." You know, that kind of cutting. Trump speaking to Navy and shipyard personnel in Newport News, Virginia, in March. AP Photo / Steve Helber AP: Right. TRUMP: Now, if I can do that (unintelligible). ... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won't happen. AP: Is that something you're going to take on? TRUMP: (unintelligible) But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. ... ___ AP: Can I ask you, over your first 100 days — you're not quite there yet — how do you feel like the office has changed you? TRUMP: Well, the one thing I would say — and I say this to people — I never realized how big it was. Everything's so (unintelligible) like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to — AP: You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean — The US Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Porter (DDG 78) conducts strike operations in the Mediterranean Sea. Thomson Reuters TRUMP: No. 1, there's great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I'm saying to myself, "You know, this is more than just like, 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that's involved," because people could have been killed. This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area — you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away — and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make. (unintelligible) ... This is involving death and life and so many things. ... So it's far more responsibility. (unintelligible) ... The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest — you know, you go down the list. AP: Right. TRUMP. It's massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that's involved in some of the decisions. Trump meets with business leaders in Washington in January. From left: Corning CEO Wendell Weeks, Trump, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky, and Dell CEO Michael Dell. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters AP: You've talked a little bit about the way that you've brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesn't translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job? TRUMP: Well in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you're talking about health care — you have health care in business, but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You're providing health. This is (unintelligible). Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas, in business, most things don't involve heart. AP: What's that switch been like for you? TRUMP: In fact, in business, you're actually better off without it. AP: What's making that switch been like for you? TRUMP: You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean, we're going to be doing major tax reform. Here's part of your story, it's going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody's saying, "Oh, he's delaying." I'm not delaying anything. I'll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That's another thing that really has — I've never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, "Well, the one thing good is now I'll get good press." And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty. ___ AP: But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week? TRUMP: Well I'm going to roll (out) probably on Wednesday. Around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform — business and for people — we want to do both. We've been working on it (unintelligible). (Treasury) Secretary (Steven) Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful (unintelligible). ... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case (unintelligible). ... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later. AP: Do you have any details on that in terms of rates? TRUMP: Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had. ... Trump leaves after speaking about missile strikes on a Syrian airfield in April. Carlos Barria/Reuters AP: Obviously, that's going to come in a week where you're going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it? TRUMP: I don't know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall. My base really wants it — you've been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it's funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the Electoral College. Big, big, big advantage. I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the Electoral College. The Electoral College — but it's a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The Electoral College is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall. They want to see security. Now it just came out that they're 73 percent down. ... That's a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years, and it's going lower. Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime. You know, the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through. AP: It sounds like maybe you're beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn't have border funding in there, you would sign it. TRUMP: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing. I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive. AP: What do you think the estimate on it would be? TRUMP: Oh, I'm seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less. That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in — and we'll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall — they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall. That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much. And most of it's coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs. AP: But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn't have — TRUMP: I don't want to comment. I just don't know yet. I mean, I have to see what's going on. I really do. But the wall's a very important thing to — not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn't, I mean, I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular. ... The wall is very important to stopping drugs. AP: If you don't have a funding stream, your message to your base is what? TRUMP: My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it's getting built. And it's also getting built for much less money — I hope you get this — than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It's not going to cost anywhere near that. AP: You think $10 billion or less. TRUMP: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it's not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. And they're using those numbers — they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable (sic). And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about. Part of the US-Mexico border. Spencer Platt/Getty Images TRUMP: They had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete. But they didn't say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government. People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO's obsolete — not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO — NATO is obsolete, and I said, "And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism." You know, back when they did NATO, there was no such thing as terrorism. AP: What specifically has NATO changed? TRUMP: (Cites Wall Street Journal article) ... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete — I said two things — obsolete, and the countries aren't paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn't believe. And then some expert on NATO said, "You know, Trump is right." But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror. ... It's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month." __ AP: This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that? TRUMP: Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election. AP: Do you think it's going to help Marine Le Pen? TRUMP: I think so. AP: Do you believe that she should be the president? TRUMP: No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France. AP: Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to — TRUMP: No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you. You could say the same thing. ... AP: I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ... TRUMP: No, I am no different than — no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we've done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come into this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I'm not going to have it in this country. I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it's already largely, you know, we have tens — we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn't be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation, and they were allowed under the previous administrations — they were allowed into our country. It's a big mistake. AP: Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are — TRUMP: I am not endorsing her, and I didn't mention her name. AP: Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear. TRUMP: I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win. She is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front political party and a candidate for French president. REUTERS/Charles Platiau AP: I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though — I mean, the markets go up and down. TRUMP: You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, "Only because of you am I making this massive investment." Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that. ___ AP: What about NAFTA? What's the plan on NAFTA? TRUMP: What would you like to know? AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating. TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA. AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal? TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it. AP: Termination is still on the table. TRUMP: Absolutely. If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA. AP: What's a timeline for that decision? TRUMP: It's a six-month termination clause. I have the right to do it. It's a six-month clause.

You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States? TRUMP: When WikiLeaks came out ... never heard of WikiLeaks, never heard of it. When WikiLeaks came out, all I was just saying is, "Well, look at all this information here. This is pretty good stuff." You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses. They tried to hack both of them. They weren't able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff, and I said, "Wow." It was just a figure of speech. I said, "Well, look at this. It's good reading." AP: But that didn't mean that you supported what Assange is doing? TRUMP: No, I don't support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn't have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI. How about this — they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn't (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based. AP: CrowdStrike? TRUMP: That's what I heard. I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian. That's what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It's incredible. AP: Can I just ask you, though — do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange? TRUMP: I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me. I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Carl Court/Getty Images AP: On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign — TRUMP: And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. ... AP: On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region? TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond. AP: So you believe that they are complying with the agreement? TRUMP: No, I don't say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it. AP: In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East? TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing of all over. AP: When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or (British Prime Minister) Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal? TRUMP: I don't talk to them about it. AP: You don't talk to them about the Iran deal? TRUMP: I mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question. AP: At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal? TRUMP: It's possible that we won't. People participate in the Immigrants Make America Great March in California in February to protest the actions of the Trump administration. David McNew/Getty Images AP: Dreamers, you've talked about them. You've talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked — TRUMP: No, we aren't looking to do anything right now. Look, the Dreamers ... this is an interesting case. They left and they came back, and he's got some problems. It's a little different than the Dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They've taken over towns and cities, and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that's what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country, and we are getting them out in record numbers, and those are the people we are after. We are not after the Dreamers. We are after the criminals. AP: And that's going to be the policy of your administration to allow the Dreamers to stay? TRUMP: Yes. Yes. That's our policy. I am not saying ... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now, we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. (John) Kelly, now (Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border. We are cleaning out cities and towns of hardline criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails, and they are being ... all over the country, and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum. They are all scum. That's probably the worst gang anywhere on earth. ... AP: A lot of the Dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don't want to give them the wrong message with this. TRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The Dreamers should rest easy. OK? I'll give you that. The Dreamers should rest easy. ... ___ (An aide talks about the president's address to Congress.) TRUMP: A lot of the people have said that — some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber. AP: You seem like you enjoyed it. TRUMP: I did. I did. I believed in it, and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success? ... That's another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS? When (current Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al) Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years. ... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it. We don't talk about it. AP: Do you mean you don't talk about it personally because you don't want to talk about it? TRUMP: I don't talk about it, no. And the generals don't talk about it. Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law. Pineiro/Handout via REUTERS AP: You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days. I know they have sent that over. Have you accepted a plan? Are you moving forward on a strategy? TRUMP: We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie. AP: So you have decided on a plan? TRUMP: Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul. AP: Right. TRUMP. Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago. AP: Can you say generally what the strategy is? Should people — TRUMP: Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations. AP: Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS? TRUMP: No, not much. AP: In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals — TRUMP: Well, they've also accepted my strategy. AP: Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like? TRUMP: Not many. AP: So a small increase? TRUMP: It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more. ... This is an important story. I've done a lot. I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days, and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I'm scheduled ... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ... AP: What do you think it was about your chemistry? TRUMP: We had good chemistry. Now, I don't know that I think that's going to produce results, but you've got a good chance. AP: Uh-huh. TRUMP: Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They're coming into China, and they're being turned away. That's never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they've never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There's a great foundation that's built. Great foundation. And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country. Trump and China's president, Xi Jinping, at Mar-a-Lago in April. REUTERS/Carlos Barria AP: One more 100-days question. TRUMP: That's fine. AP: ... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days? TRUMP: Yes. I think my team has been — well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect, as they should be. I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people and very diverse people. AP: Do you mean your White House team when you say that? TRUMP: Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince (Priebus, the chief of staff) has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the Electoral College, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York, and he would lose California. It's just the registration. There's nothing you can do. So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard. Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were ... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York. You lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at — so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida. You have to win Ohio. You have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to — there was no way to 270. AP: Right. TRUMP: So she had this massive advantage. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions ... Yeah. Or more, actually, because we were $375 (million). She was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because, you know, it wasn't 270. It was 306. So there's anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here's a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard, and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes. AP: Three Democratic votes, but yeah. TRUMP: Three Democratic votes. OK. He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all ... nothing. He's like a ... AP: Do you think that you can break through that? I mean this — TRUMP: Yeah, I do. AP: Is one of the biggest challenges for a president. TRUMP: I think I can, to an extent. But there's a — there's a basic hardline core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through. There's a hardline group you can't break through. You can't. It's sad. You can't. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings, and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings (of Maryland). I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation — because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about — he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down, and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be — in front of five, six people — he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country. AP: He disputed that slightly. TRUMP: That's what he said. I mean, what can I tell you? AP: Yeah. TRUMP: There's six people sitting here. What did he — what, what do you mean by slightly? AP: He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then — TRUMP: Well he said you'll be the greatest president in the history of — but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be. But he said will be the greatest president, but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed, and it was like he never even was here. It's incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later, and it's like he was never in my office. And you can even say that. Greg Friese via Flickr AP: And that's one of the difficulties I think presidents have had, is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it's hard to actually change how people vote or change how people — TRUMP: No, I have. It's interesting. I have — seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know, Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people. It's the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning. AP: I remember, right. TRUMP: It had 9.2 million people. It's the highest they've ever had. On any, on air, (CBS "Face the Nation" host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It's the highest for "Face the Nation," or, as I call it, "Deface the Nation." It's the highest for "Deface the Nation" since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It's a tremendous advantage. I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know, they tried to say that the fake media was all the — no, the fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you're fake, but — but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It's not that Fox treats me well. It's that Fox is the most accurate. AP: Do you believe that? That Fox — TRUMP: I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know, when I said it's a terrorism ... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack, and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, "He called it a terrorist attack." They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I'm 10-0 for that. I've called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm ... whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I'm here and they're not. PA AP: Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there's such real-time reaction with everything you say? TRUMP: Yeah. AP: Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision? TRUMP: The one thing — AP: That you have to do — TRUMP: OK. The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don't watch CNN anymore. AP: You just said you did. TRUMP: No. No, I — if I'm passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)? AP: You just said — TRUMP: Where? Where? AP: Two minutes ago. TRUMP: No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I — what'd I say, I stopped watching them. But I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC. I don't watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on. AP: Right. TRUMP: In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch (MSNBC's) "Morning Joe." I don't watch "Morning Joe." I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant if it's about me. Or pleasant. But when I see, it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don't watch things that are unpleasant. I just don't watch them. AP: And do you feel like that's, that's because of the office that you now occupy — TRUMP: No. AP: That you've made that change? TRUMP: I don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last — over the last year. AP: That's interesting. YouTube/Daily Kos TRUMP: And I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly, and I don't watch them anymore. A lot of people don't watch them anymore. They're now in third place. But I've created something where people are watching ... but I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC anymore. I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I'd watch. AP: Sure. TRUMP: I just don't. And that's taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that's a great — it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning, you know, you're — you don't watch this total negativity. I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now. Just don't watch. AP: That's interesting. TRUMP: Maybe it's because I'm here. I don't know.

Image Credit: 20th Century Fox I’m very excited about the trio of technology and entertainment visionaries that are the latest speakers for our upcoming GamesBeat Summit 2017: How games, sci-fi, and tech create real-world magic. They include John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs and co-creator of Pokémon Go; Ralph Osterhout, CEO of Osterhout Design Group, maker of augmented reality glasses; and John Underkoffler, CEO of Oblong Industries, maker of the Mezzanine collaboration software and science advisor for the film Minority Report.

Our visionaries will have a conversation across the seams of science fiction, real-world technology, and games. Above: John Underkoffler, CEO of Oblong Industries, was science advisor on Minority Report. Image Credit: Oblong Industries Underkoffler has been trying to make the vision of the 2002 film Minority Report, where actor Tom Cruise uses “data gloves” and gestures to control a transparent computer, into a reality. He founded Oblong in 2006, and launched Mezzanine for enterprise collaborators in 2012. Oblong’s technological and design trajectories build on fifteen years of foundational work at the MIT Media Lab, where Underkoffler was responsible for innovations in real-time computer graphics systems, optical and electronic holography, large-scale visualization techniques, and the I/O Bulb and Luminous Room systems. He has also been science advisor to films including The Hulk, Aeon Flux, and Iron Man. He serves on the National Advisory Council of Cranbrook Academy in Bloomfield Hills, MI, and on the Board of Directors of the E14 Fund in Cambridge, Mass., and of the Sequoyah School in Pasadena, Calif.

Underkoffler will also be giving a solo talk at our summit on May 1. Above: John Hanke, CEO of Niantic Labs. Image Credit: Niantic Hanke has been running Niantic and riding the rocket ship of Pokémon Go, which has more than 65 million monthly active users and has generated more than $1 billion in revenue in less than a year. His company is dedicated to building “real world” mobile gaming experiences that foster exploration, exercise and social interaction. Niantic has developed and released two games, Ingress and global phenomenon Pokémon Go. The company was originally founded as a start up within Google to explore the creation of new kinds of entertainment at the intersection of location, social, and emerging mobile devices. Niantic was spun out as an independent company in 2015 with backing from investors such as Google, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. Earlier in his career, John was a founder of Archetype Interactive, creators of one of the very first online massively multiplayer games, Meridian59, and then went on to co-found Keyhole, a company acquired by Google for the technology that lead to the creation of Google Earth. He was vice president of Google’s Geo division (overseeing projects including Maps and Street View) for seven years before founding Niantic. Above: Ralph Osterhout, CEO of Osterhout Design Group Image Credit: ODG Osterhout is a developer, designer and entrepreneur.

Who hasn’t been influenced by great novels like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, which gave us virtual worlds, or Tom Cruise’s data gloves and gesture-controlled computer in Minority Report? Now those things have become real, and we want to see what’s coming next. Our theme is about what inspires game developers, executives, and investors to be creative. Part of the event will focus on the inspiration cycle that is accelerating as the walls between science fiction, video games, and real-world technology come down. We don’t think there’s another conference that focuses on the seams between these industries. This event will focus on inspiration and creativity. So much of what used to be science fiction is coming true, and it is inspiring even more accelerated visions of the future in games and other entertainment. We hope to inspire you by taking you to the moments that led to great ideas across multiple industries. You’ll leave refreshed and ready to change the worlds of gaming, technology, and more. We think this conference will offer a rare chance for cross-pollination and networking between high-level people in different industries, and we believe that insights in one place can lead to inspirations in another. This conference is for high-end gaming executives, startup CEOs, developers, investors, publishers, marketers, tech experts, entertainment industry professionals, sci-fi experts, AR and VR executives, and other professionals. I should also point out that this is where we try to create an actual GamesBeat community with our supporters, readers, and attendees. We gather the right people in the room and encourage everyone to get to know each other. Join us. If you’re interested in sponsoring, message andie.rhyins@venturebeat.com.

MSFT stock looks good, whatever Thursday brings. Apr 24, 2017, 9:34 am EDT  |  By Chris Lau, InvestorPlace Contributor Get AMZN alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     View All   When Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reports its fiscal third-quarter results Thursday after the bell, chances are high that the software giant will please investors again and keep MSFT stock heading higher in 2017. Source: Johannes Marliem Via Flickr Analysts expect the company will grow earnings by more than 40% this year. And even after its expensive LinkedIn acquisition for $26.2 billion, the cloud and software business is creating lots of positive cash flow. But even if Microsoft manages to stumble in its Q3 report, it’s hard not to like what MSFT has to offer. The Internet of Things Microsoft announced a collaboration with Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) this morning to address internet of things (IoT) security. While Wall Street and Main Street alike are excited about the prospects for interconnected everything — from computers and phones to refrigerators and toasters — security is an increasingly worrisome issue as more devices are plugged into the internet. Per a press release out today, “The new solution utilizes a hardware ‘root of trust’ integrated into Micron’s flash memory in the IoT device along with the Microsoft Azure IoT cloud to establish a strong trusted link between that IoT device and the cloud.” Speaking of the cloud … Hyperscale Cloud Microsoft appears to have learned from the disadvantages of promoting closed systems. Late last year, the company embraced open standards. As a member of the Open Compute Project, Microsoft’s support for interoperability will accelerate data center hardware development. It also ensures that no matter what hardware supplier is involved — be it Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) or Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) for processors, the servers will all work together. MSFT needs the prices for hardware that powers the cloud to fall as fast as possible. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the biggest player with AWS and has 40% of the market share. Microsoft, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) have a combined share of around 20%. Developments on LinkedIn It’s all too often that people forget about LinkedIn when weighing the prospects for Microsoft stock. Microsoft has plenty of time and resources to develop LinkedIn’s potential. The professional networking site has no real competition and is the “go-to” site for connecting headhunters with job seekers. LinkedIn is even borrowing an aspect of Stories, except its posts do not disappear. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) added disappearing story functions to Instagram and WhatsApp. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) already offers disappearing stories in the Snapchat app. Conversely, LinkedIn is adding trending storylines to its feed and targeting appropriate readers. LinkedIn wants its users to spend more time and to come back more often to the site. The newly added feature will also allow the company to more effectively target ads to the right audience. Microsoft Dynamics Expands Unable to compete on its own against Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft partnered up with Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE). By sharing sales and marketing data and the format, the two aim to have an improved CRM and marketing solution that customers will want. Unfortunately, Salesforce.com’s CRM solution is too good a product to compete against lightly. If Adobe and MSFT mash up their strengths without really figuring out what features would beat Salesforce.com, the partnership will ultimately fail.

The branchless bank launched a year ago as an iOS and Android app offering traditional banking services like savings accounts and mortgages, with more on the way.  "Our lives are faster than ever before, but the banking industry hasn’t kept up," said the rapper-producer in a statement. "The scale of Atom’s ambition to help people understand and manage their money better, and it’s clever use of technology to give people an entire bank on their phones is awesome." Will.i.am's other ventures outside music include being named "director of creative innovation" at Intel Corp. in 2011. Last year he partnered with Deutsche Telekom to launch a voice-activated smartwatch line. The partnership between will.i.am and Atom was facilitated by ITB, a marketing agency that delivers such pairings for various brands. Commented Anthony Thomson, Atom's founder and chairman: "Like us, will.i.am believes that technology can better and simplify our lives, which is at the heart of all that we are passionate about at Atom. As we develop the range of products and services on offer to customers, will.i.am’s unique view on the world and knowledge of future trends will be a great asset for us."

Akitio Node Lite is a small aluminum home for PCIe devices by Zak Killian  10:30 AM on April 24, 2017 When you think "Thunderbolt 3 enclosure", you probably think about the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, the Razer Core, or the Powercolor Devil Box. There's a lot more that can go in a PCIe slot than graphics cards, though. If, for example, you need to hook up an NVMe SSD to your laptop, Akitio has you covered with the Node Lite Thunderbolt 3 external PCIe enclosure. Regular readers might remember the original Akitio Node from when we reported on it back in November. That enclosure includes a 400-watt SFX power supply and is large enough to house all but the biggest graphics cards. The new Node Lite is much smaller, just nine inches long and a little under six inches tall. That means it can only accept half-length PCIe cards.  That's fine, though, because Akitio says the Node Lite isn't meant for graphics cards despite being wide enough to accept dual-slot devices. That warning probably originates in the fact that its PCIe x16 slot can only provide 25W of power, while your typical graphics card expects to draw up to 75W from the slot. The example device the company uses is an Intel 750 PCIe SSD, which would surely be an upgrade from your standard-issue external hard drive or USB stick. The Node Lite takes a Thunderbolt connection via USB Type-C port and has a second Type-C port so that you can pass the connection through to another Thunderbolt or USB device. There's also a DisplayPort connector on the back for use with devices that support DP Alternate Mode. The box comes with its own power adapter to juice up any devices you stick inside it. Akitio says the little aluminum box is completely tool-less, and that it will be available in this quarter for $270.

The main difference between a photonic integrated circuit and an electronic circuit is that photonic ICs use photons as data carriers unlike electronic ICs which use electrons for transferring data. In addition, a photonic integrated circuit is analogous to electronic integrated circuits. The photonic integrated circuits (PIC) market is still in the nascent stage and is poised to offer immense growth potential during the forecast period 2015 – 2022. Competitive Insights The global photonic integrated circuits (PIC) market is highly fragmented and competitive. The top four players in the photonic integrated circuits (PIC) market accounted for less than forty five percent of the global market revenue share in 2014. Some of the leading players identified in the photonic integrated circuits (PIC) ecosystem include Infinera Corporation (the U.S.), JDS Uniphase Corporation (the U.S.), Alcatel-Lucent S.A. (France), NeoPhotonics Corporation (the U.S.), Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd (China), Intel Corporation (the U.S.), and Avago Technologies Ltd. (Singapore). In addition, the photonic IC market is characterized by the presence of large number of small players, accounting for trivial market share individually. Some of these players include including Ciena Corporation (the U.S.), Finisar Corporation (the U.S.), Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (Israel) and Luxtera Inc (the U.S.) among others. Competition among existing market players is comparatively high owing to the fragmented nature of the industry.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Netgear Faces Consumer Class Action for Defective Cable Modems Schubert Law Firm Investigating Claims Against Cable Modem Manufacturers Concerning Latency Issues in Puma 6 Chipset SAN FRANCISCO, April 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Consumers today announced the filing of a class action lawsuit against NETGEAR, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTGR), claiming that the global networking company sells cable modems containing a serious defect that results in high spikes in network latency, degrading users' Internet connections, according to Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe, which represents the consumers. The lawsuit, filed on April 14, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that consumers who purchased Netgear's CM700 modem—which Netgear claimed was "ideal for the fastest Internet speed services plan"—suffers from severe network latency spikes. Hundreds of users have complained in online forums, and Netgear itself has acknowledged the issue. Netgear, however, has failed to fix the problem for SB6190 purchasers. "Consumers paid top dollar for a high-end cable modem, but the Netgear CM700 suffers from a serious flaw that affects network connections," said Noah Schubert, a partner at Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe, "Netgear and other cable modem manufacturers shipping modems with the defect should recall the affected models and issue refunds." According to the lawsuit, the root of the problem is Netgear's decision to swap out the Broadcom chipset in this modem with the Puma 6 chipset from Intel Corporation. Intel has acknowledged that the problem stems from its Puma 6's chipset, which causes cable modems to suffer from significant jitter and latency on their network connections. Schubert Jonckheer & Kolbe LLP is actively investigating whether other cable modems containing the Puma 6 chipset, including modems from Linksys, Cisco, Hitron, and Arris, also suffer from the same severe network latency defect. To see if your cable modem may be affected by this defect, please visit our website at http://classactionlawyers.com/netgear. If you purchased a Netgear CM700 or other cable modem containing the Puma 6 chipset, you may be entitled to a refund of the purchase price. If you think you may be affected by this cable modem defect, please contact us today to learn more.

At the time of writing, it offers a range of competitive savings products. A current account service is in development, along with credit cards and mortgages. Will.i.am is the lead singer in the Black Eyed Peas. He wrote the hit songs Where Is The Love? and Let’s Get It Started, and is currently a host on The Voice UK. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT At first glance, these two things feel mutually incompatible. They go together like pizza and pineapple, or Travis Kalanick and a conscience. Except Atom Bank just announced that will.i.am is joining the company as a “Strategic Board Advisor.” According to a press release from the bank, Mr i.am will provide it with “an external perspective on culture, philanthropy and technology.” The partnership between Atom Bank and will.i.am came about with the assistance of ITB, who are “an Entertainment Marketing agency, delivering strategic and creatively led partnerships rooted in popular culture for brands and individuals alike.” When asked about what will.i.am brings to the table, Katy Ringsdore, Atom Bank Head of PR and Internal Communications said: As we continue to roll out our vision of changing banking for good, his unique view on a future digital world and his knowledge of cultural trends will definitely be a great asset to us. His knowledge and insight will be of huge value to us and will help make sure we stay one step ahead of future trends. Speaking about the partnership, will.i.am said: Our lives are faster than ever before, but the banking industry hasn’t kept up.  The scale of Atom’s ambition to help people understand and manage their money better, and it’s clever use of technology to give people an entire bank on their phones is awesome. I’m looking forward to working with Atom to achieve success in everything we will do together. There’s certainly some merit to that. Will.i.am has consistently shown himself to have his finger on the pulse of the tech zeitgeist. In 2011, he was recruited by Intel as its director of creative innovation, something which earned both will.i.am and Intel scorn back then, but in retrospect doesn’t seem too outlandish. Adding further weight to his startup credentials, will.i.am is also the founder launched his own hardware startup, called i.am+, which has launched a variety of smartphone accessories and headphones, as well as the widely-ridiculed Puls smartcuff. Will.i.am will also be the co-host of Apple’s upcoming original TV series, Planet of the Apps, alongside Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Gary Vaynerchuk. But will this partnership with Atom Bank amount to more than just a headline-catching gimmick? And can the blue-sky thinking of the most creative man in pop music really carry water in the fintech world, where things move slowly and every decision is encumbered by mountains of regulation? Only time will tell.
