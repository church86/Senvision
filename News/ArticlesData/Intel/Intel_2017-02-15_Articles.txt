Price $279 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel Celeron J3355 CPU Processor (2.5GHz Burst Frequency, 10W TDP) • 1 x HDMI • 1 x DisplayPort • Requires DDR3L SO-DIMM memory (twin channels, maximum capacity 8GB at 1866MHz) and hard drive (2.5-inch SATA 6Gbps or M.2). Tweet Email this Print this Feedback A pleasant little 4K surprise. When we first received the pitch email about this product, we were quick to dismiss it. Positioned as a mini-PC designed to power retail displays, it seemed to be rather irrelevant to our audience – we’re pretty sure that specific audience reads “Point of Sale Monthly”. However, after taking a quick glance at the specs, we realised we’d found a hidden nugget of gold that would actually work pretty damn well as a media PC, for an incredibly low price. Let’s explain why this mini-PC is actually much more capable than something designed to deliver images to large displays in the middle of a shopping centre.  At the heart of this tiny box is Intel’s new Apollo Lake architecture, in the form of a J3355 CPU Processor. This was released in the tail-end of 2016, making far less of a splash than the new Kaby Lake processors, and it falls under the Celeron brand. Now, according to Intel’s very own website, all Celeron processors shouldn’t be capable of delivering 4K video. However, the SoC Celeron chip in the DX30 does indeed support hardware acceleration of a wide-range of video codecs; H.264, VC-1, WMV9, HEVC and VP9. It seems that the Intel website might need an update… Compared to most desktop CPUs, this chip looks like a very underpowered critter. With a Turbo frequency of just 2.5GHz and a maximum TDP of a mere 10W, this is no i5-killer. But the secret ingredient here is Intel’s integrated HD 500 (Gen 9) graphics, which have been overhauled since the last version; Intel claims a 45% performance upgrade over the previous generation. The two video outputs come in the form of HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2. The good news is it that even this aging DisplayPort 1.2 port can handle a single 4K stream at 60fps, though the HDMI 1.4 is limited to 4K at 24Hz. Unfortunately there’s no support for HEVC Main10 with this CPU, unlike Kaby Lake, which means it won’t be able to handle Netflix’s 4K streaming service, thanks to its stringent security. The other outputs on the rear of this tiny box (194mm long by 160mm wide by 43mm tall) consist of four USB 2.0 outputs, a PS/2 port for your keyboard, Gigabit Ethernet, and twin RS232 outputs (one of which also handles RS422 and RS485). On the front side are twin USB 3.0 Type A connections, perfect for hooking up your remote control dongle. Thanks to the chips extremely low power usage, it uses a fanless cooling system, so there’s absolutely no noise from the system when it’s in operation.  Like most Shuttle boxes, you’re going to need to add a few extras to get it off the ground. Firstly, there’s no memory, with twin DDR3L SO-DIMM slots ready to handle memory speeds of up to 1866MHz with a maximum capacity of 8GB. So that’s another $80 or so to the equation. There’s also no hard drive, and you’ve got two options for fulfilling this need. A standard SATA 6Gbps connection will handle a 2.5-inch drive, while there’s also an M.2 slot for speed demons. The good news is that utilising the M.2 port doesn’t require you to remove the integrated 802.11b/g/n card, which has its own dedicated port. An external power pack is included, but it’s tiny, so you won’t need to worry about hiding it. In fact, the entire box is small enough to fit onto the back of most TVs, provided they come with a compatible VESA mount. If there’s one issue with using this as a media player, it’s the Realtek ALC662 sound chipset. According to Shuttle, this is only capable of 2-channel high definition audio, but heading to the Realtek website reveals that it’s actually ready for 5.1 channels. Again, it seems somebody needs to update their website… With a total cost of ownership of about $400, this is a nice little jewel that we’ve uncovered. It’s totally silent, very small, and ready for 4K playback, making it an ideal media player to stream your 4K content over your home network.  Related Reviews Review: Next Thing Co CHIP computer Review: Lenovo Y710 Cube gaming PC Review: Acer Spin 7 convertible laptop Review: WD Blue SATA 1TB PC SSD breaks new ground Review: Hitman: The Complete First Season Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Intel Goes Ahead & Drops i915 Driver From OpenGL 2.1 To 1.4 By Default Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 15 February 2017 at 07:21 PM EST. 8 Comments Intel Linux developers have partially reverted Mesa work done years ago to drop the default OpenGL behavior with the older i915 driver from exposing OpenGL 2.0+ support to now only having OpenGL 1.4 out-of-the-box. See Older Intel Graphics To Drop From OpenGL 2.1 To 1.4 On Linux for more of the background to this story. This change just affects i915 to pre-i965 hardware by dropping OpenGL 2.0 by default due to Chrome and other applications making use of really slow code-paths when using the GL2 extensions on this old hardware that doesn't have adequate OpenGL 2 capabilities. So there's a better out-of-the-box experience by actually dropping the exposed OpenGL version back to v1.4. But the latest Mesa code will at least continue to expose OpenGL ES 2.0 and the OpenGL 2 support can be restored if setting the fragment_shader and stub_occlusion_query options. The change is present for Mesa 17.1. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel has dropped its long-time support of one of the nation’s biggest science fairs, reportedly over a belief that such events are focusing more on life sciences and biotechnology, which aren’t Intel’s main areas of interest. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: February 15, 2017 at 2:25 pm | UPDATED: February 15, 2017 at 2:26 pm Top of the Order:   The Fair is Over: For years, Intel has thrown its weight behind efforts to increase interest in science and technology among America’s youth by supporting various different science fairs. Having Intel’s name attached to events like the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) gave the gathering a sense of gravitas. It was good public relations for Intel, too. But, that’s all coming to an end. Related Articles Apple gets closer to premiering its own, original TV shows Apple shares surge to a record-high close Biz Break: Yelp’s investors yelp in response to company’s outlook Biz Break: Pandora flexes muscles, but outlook disappoints IBM employees petition CEO to back away from Trump Intel said it would no longer support the ISEF event, a move that follows the semiconductor giant ending its backing of the national Science Talent Search last year. That event is now sponsored by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, while ISEF is looking for a new supporter of its fair. Intel didn’t give a reason for why it was backing off from supporting such science fairs, which are geared toward supporting junior high and high school students interested in science. The New York Times reported that the ISEF event has only grown in popularity as 78 countries and territories participated in the fair last year, up from 22 in 1997, the year before Intel began its sponsorship. So, it seems like a lack of interest in the fair wouldn’t be a reason for Intel dropping its ties to the event. What does seem to be at play is the opinion of Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. According to the Times, Krzanich has told other Intel officials that the science fairs’ emphasis has shifted more toward life sciences and biotechnology, which fall outside Intel’s main areas of interest. Middle Innings: At a Price Like This: Six months have gone by since Yahoo said it would sell its internet properties (or, pretty much all of itself) to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. Since the deal was announced, Yahoo has revealed that it was the victim of a pair of widespread security breaches of its network; one that occurred in 2013, and another in 2014 that affected the email accounts of at least 500 million of its users. And for months, there have been rumors and speculation about what, if anything, Verizon would do about its Yahoo plans. Everything from canceling the deal to cutting the price of its acquisition was said to be possible. Well, now it appears that Verizon is going the route of getting the same thing it was going to buy, but at a discount. Citing unnamed “people familiar with the matter,” Bloomberg said that Verizon is close to renegotiating the deal to shave $250 million from its originally agreed-upon price for Yahoo. The main reason for the discount is the security hacks, and now the deal is expected to close, at last, in the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Yahoo also said Wednesday that its users may have been subjected to malicious attacks by hackers using forged cookies to access users’ accounts. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Wednesday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Genomic Health, RingCentral, Impax Laboratories, QuinStreet and Gilead Sciences. In the Red: Decliners included Lending Club, Infinera, ShoreTel, Jive Software and Finisar. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6 percent to 5,819.44. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 percent to 20,611.86. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also rose 0.5 percent to end the day at 2,349.25. Quote of the Day: “This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.” — President Donald Trump, in a tweet in which he expressed his latest thoughts about ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s meetings with Russian government officials.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected By Joel Hruska on February 13, 2017 at 2:45 pm Comment Last year, Intel announced that it would abandon the Tick-Tock model that had served it for nearly a decade and switch to something called PAO — Process, Architecture, Optimization. The point of switching from a two-step process to a three-step system was to give Intel extra time to roll out its next-generation process nodes, while simultaneously affording more opportunity to eke maximum gains out of each current node. Now, new information suggests Intel may have a product plan that tears up PAO (or at least complicates it) going forward. Analyst Ashraf Eassa claims to have confirmed with Intel that upcoming 8th generation Core processors will use an updated/enhanced variant of 14nm technology yet again — call it 14nm++. Intel was able to squeeze some gains out of Kaby Lake in this fashion compared with Skylake, but they weren’t huge leaps. Image by Anandtech A slide showed by Intel at a recent speech on the future of its data center business confirms this by stating “Data center first to next process node,” Anandtech notes. It also makes the point that enterprise and government spending are only worth a 2% increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) while the cloud services business is expected to grow by 15% from 2017-2021. Still, at first glance, this may seem a foolish strategy. After all, AMD’s Ryzen will debut in the imminent future, and one might reasonably conclude that Intel’s best leap forward is with a strong 10nm chip rather than a third iteration on 14nm. But this misses a larger issue — one we’ve discussed multiple times over the past few years. As node shrinks become more difficult and the advantages of any given node shrink are less and less potent, it can take longer for a company to deliver meaningful advantages. Intel is still pursuing full node shrinks, unlike its competitors at GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and TSMC. These firms won’t offer equivalent gate lengths or feature sizes to Intel until they deploy their 10nm nodes and aren’t expected to match Intel’s 10nm until they hit 7nm. This is why Intel can still plausibly claim to be ahead on process technology, despite using a higher number to describe it. Image by Ars Technica When Intel debuted 14nm, it pushed that technology into ultra-mobile parts first, where the reduction in power consumption and improvement of low-power clock speeds was seen as critical to the company’s ability to compete with ARM. As we’ve recently discussed, the improvements to Intel’s low-power CPUs have been considerably larger than the boosts to desktop performance in an equivalent period of time. AMD, prior to Ryzen, has been stuck in a similar scenario. We may be arriving at a point where it makes more sense to keep older nodes around and to improve process nodes and architecture over several generations than it does to aggressively transition to each new node. Earlier this year, Mark Papermaster of AMD made comments to suggest that AMD would stick to 14nm for multiple product generations. It’s not clear how this will play out or how aggressively the smaller CPU manufacturer will use the strategy. But we could be seeing a similar play from Intel, which has already deployed 14nm across three families of processors (Broadwell, Skylake, Kaby Lake) and may be prepping desktop Cannon Lake chips for a fourth. Other foundry manufacturers have begun referring to certain nodes as “long-lived” (28nm, 14/16nm, and possibly 7nm) while others (20nm, 10nm) are being described as short-term nodes. This differentiation didn’t used to exist in semiconductor technology and it indirectly speaks to what Intel may be driving at: Some nodes are better than others for certain types of semiconductors. 8th-gen chips on 14nm are now expected in the second half of 2017 rather than the first half of 2018 as had previously been reported. This could mean Intel wants to push new hardware to compete with Ryzen sooner than later. Intel might defend PAO as a process with an undisclosed number of steps in the “Optimization” portion, rather than a discrete series of changes that was meant to apply to three, and only three, groups of processors. This interpretation is undermined by how Intel raised precisely zero objections last year when the world+dog described PAO as a three-step process compared with the two-stop pendulum model of tick-tock. We may see multiple process nodes gathered together under the 8th Generation Core banner, with ultra-low-power mobile and data center chips moving to 10nm first, while desktop and high-power laptop processors following at a later date.

Come on inside, if you haven't already guessed the winner. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Feb 15, 2017 at 4:31PM Just five months ago, fellow Fool Leo Sun compared the investing theses for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). He found NXP to be the better pick, thanks to massive growth opportunities and a low PEG ratio. A lot has changed since that comparison. Intel shares are still trading at roughly the same prices as last September, but NXP got a game-changing buyout bid from sector rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). So which one of these semiconductor giants would be the better buy today? Let's have a fresh look. What's going on with NXP? Assuming no new surprises, NXP's future as an investable asset is crystal clear. Qualcomm has offered a firm $110 per NXP share, to be paid in 100% cash, and with all the necessary financing already lined up. The companies are aiming to close their merger by the end of calendar year 2017, but Qualcomm's tender offer has been on the table for nearly two months now. All that's really missing is a handful of regulatory approvals, and this stock is locking in a $110 exit with no questions asked. NXP shares recently traded as much as 13% below Qualcomm's offer price, as investors were rattled by newly crowned President Trump as he tarnished his diplomatic connections to China and Taiwan. NXP and Qualcomm do most of their business in the Middle Kingdom, and the merger could very well be scuttled if Chinese leaders don't get along with America's new administration. But Trump has softened his Taiwanese stance recently, and NXP investors have visibly relaxed. Monday night, NXP shares traded just 7% below Qualcomm's offer price. The big payoff by the end of 2017 is more guaranteed than ever, but the returns of playing this simple strategy have diminished greatly. Image source: Getty Images. The case for Intel Assuming that NXP will get its Qualcomm wedding by the end of 2017, all Intel has to do is beat a 7% return in 11 months or less. Beyond that finish line, investors can reassess their options again. There's certainly room for value creation here. Intel shares are trading at just 17 times trailing earnings, and that's on top of an earnings base that was temporarily lowered in the second quarter of 2016 because of a series of restructuring and cost-cutting moves. If Intel delivers full-year results in line with its own guidance and analyst estimates, the current P/E ratio would lift share prices north of $47. At an even skimpier 15 times trailing earnings, Intel should end 2017 at $42 per share or more. In other words, I wouldn't be surprised to see Intel delivering at least a 17% return by the end of the year -- far ahead of NXP's safe but increasingly unexciting 7% gain. As the PC market continues an unexpected return to reasonable health while Intel is exploring new growth markets in the Internet of Things, I'm more than happy to keep my Intel position intact while staying on NXP's sidelines.

Speaking at this year’s RSA Conference, Intel revealed information on its data centre security strategy and additional components. In a presentation, Simon Johnson, Intel’s SGX program architect discussed the reasons why an effective security strategy is built on a foundation of trust rooted in hardware and also why it requires technologies that protect the data through all phases, at-rest, in-flight and in-use. Intel also confirmed the availability of its newest cryptographic isolation technology for data centre usages. The company mentioned that its Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) being deployed to data centres will allow application developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel SGX is also distinguished from other cryptographic isolation technologies as it addresses all cryptographic isolation at the most granular application level to enable fine-grained data protection within the tightest trust boundary. The technology offers the most granular level of encrypted protection so far in the industry and assures data privacy even if the case of breaches into the OS, BIOS, VMM and other applications. In a blog post, Intel identified that for a long period of time developers have been overwhelmed by the level of security capabilities major platform providers have exposed for application development. Read more: Intel Security looks to the cloud for new McAfee anti-malware line-up Only until now has there been a change to the usual force directed to developers to rely on the provider’s security architecture and no way to apply a security model designed to fit their own requirements. This is what led to the design of Intel SGX, a new model that protects selected code and data from disclosure or modification and also described as “a hardware-assisted trusted execution environment with the smallest possible attack surface.” By using Intel’s trusted execution environment, developers are able to identify and record privacy, secure browsing, DRM, harden end point protection or any high assurance security use case that needs to safely store secrets or protect data. Intel SGX is now available for use on Intel’s Xeon E3 v5 platform, consisting of a set of CPU instructions and platform enhancements to deliver secure locations for application code and associated data.

Stratoscale shows you how Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 IT managers are finding it difficult to keep their applications and data safe in the cloud, and many are slowing cloud adoption because of it. That was one of the findings of an Intel cloud security report that surveyed 2,000 IT professionals in different countries and industries last fall. The issue isn't with the cloud itself, since trust outnumbers distrust for public clouds by more than two to one, according to Intel's survey. IT professionals told Intel that shadow IT and a shortage of cybersecurity skills are causing the most problems. The study showed that 49% of IT professionals said they have slowed cloud adoption because of a lack of cybersecurity skills, and 65% say shadow IT is interfering with keeping the cloud safe and secure. "I think people have bought the story that the cloud is a panacea to them," said Dan Olds, an analyst with OrionX. "They think it must be good because the cloud is the hot thing right now. What I've found in my research is that real data center folks aren't that enthusiastic about the cloud, and they don't think it's more secure." Olds agreed with the survey results that the problem is largely coming from shadow IT, or employees who skirt around their company's IT department to set up applications on their own. "This problem goes directly back to shadow IT," he said. "You're in a marketing unit and you want a cool application up. Rather than going through IT, you just go out and buy it in the cloud. You're going around IT. That can cause a lot of problems. Companies need to get this under control." Judith Hurwitz, an analyst with Hurwitz & Associates, said IT shops should pump the brakes when it comes to jumping on to the cloud, and they should think through all of the security implications. "IT is traditionally skeptical about security issues with the cloud," Hurwitz said. "They are right to reserve judgment. Not all clouds are the same. Some are more secure than others. IT gets the blame if something goes wrong." And company executives need to make it clear that shadow IT is harmful to the company and won't be tolerated, Olds said. "First they need real IT to say, 'We will help you,' and then they need to say there will be penalties for going around them," he added. "The penalties need to be significant." IT needs to take charge of the cloud, especially since the Intel study showed that 62% of the companies surveyed store sensitive customer information in the public cloud. "Companies might look back and find they've gone too far with the cloud and are paying too much for cloud services they have too little control over," Olds said. "I think companies need to understand all the applications they have on premises and on the cloud, and develop some criteria for what can go out on the public cloud and what should never go out to the public cloud." The report was released at the RSA security conference in San Francisco. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Let’s not forget that Intel and Altera signed a foundry agreement exactly four years ago for the 14nm product that they are just now shipping today. This agreement led to the image below showing that the Intel 14nm process is by far superior to the TSMC 16nm process.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Intel officially releases support for the Vulkan API on Windows with its latest driver 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Feb 15, 2017 at 16:22 GMT17 hours ago Intel yesterday released its update graphics driver v15.45.14.4590 for Windows. With this driver update, Intel is finally bringing official support for the Vulkan API (version 1.0.33.0) on Windows. Vulkan targets high-performing real-time 3D graphics applications, like games, while giving low-overhead hardware control over GPU acceleration to developers, enabling games to better handle virtual reality or 4K HDR. This update also contains multiple optimizations to increase performance on popular games like Far Cry Primal, Fallout 4, and Rise of the Tomb Raider.

First Intel abandoned its successful "Tick-Tock" strategy, and now it looks like the new "Process-Architecture-Optimization" approach has gone the same way. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 15, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) | Topic: Processors Intel's "Tick-Tock" strategy, where each "tick" representing a die shrink was followed up by a "tock" representing a new microarchitecture, served the company well for a good decade before being replaced with a different approach in 2016. But has Intel given up on its new strategy in order to compete against AMD's upcoming Ryzen silicon? Must read: OLED iPhone 8 may finally have the feature that owners have been craving The Internet of Things 10 types of enterprise deployments As businesses continue to experiment with the Internet of Things, interesting use cases are emerging. Here are some of the most common ways IoT is deployed in the enterprise. Read More Intel's new approach was a three-pronged strategy called "Process-Architecture-Optimization," and Kaby Lake chips are a product of this strategy, being an "Optimization" of the Skylake "Architecture" and the "Process" of Broadwell. The idea was that Intel could squeeze three generations of processors from a single architecture. Or that was the plan. But the announcement last week that Intel was going to release 8th-generation chips codenamed Coffee Lake which are based on 14-nanometer architecture, as opposed to the anticipated 10-nanomenter architecture (codenamed Cannon Lake) suggests that the "Process-Architecture-Optimization" strategy might already be abandoned as Intel reuses the architecture for a fourth time. It's doubly interesting given that both last year and earlier this year, Intel denied rumors that the 10-nanometer architecture would be delayed. In fact, rumors that Intel was having trouble with its 10-nanometer die shrink date back to 2015. In spite of Intel seemingly abandoning the "Process-Architecture-Optimization" strategy at the first hurdle, the new Coffee Lake chips are still expected to produce a 15 percent performance boost over its predecessor, although it is unclear whether this refers to desktop or mobile chips. Bear in mind that Intel promised a similar jump between Skylake and Kaby Lake, and this only materialized for desktop chips, and the performance boost was down to clock speed and not instructions per clock. While Intel is being tight-lipped about what's going on here, the broad strokes are pretty clear -- Intel needs new chips to compete against AMD's upcoming Ryzen chips, but 10-nanometer Cannon Lake silicon isn't yet ready, so Intel is forced to squeeze another iteration out of the 14-nanometer architecture. And this might not be the last time. As the architectures get finer, making the jumps will be more difficult, and if Intel is having difficulty transitioning from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer, future die shrinks are going to be equally -- if not more -- tricky.

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. This year, Maldonado is submitting his proposal alongside Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in "socially responsible investing." While that amplifies Maldonado's voice, it still doesn't give him anywhere near the Apple holdings needed to pass the proposal. Maldonado and Zevin will need help from other investors. And right now, there's a major voice standing in their way: Apple. In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." The proposed policy, Apple concludes, "is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn't good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it'll hurt Apple's business in the years to come. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints.” "In the long term, this will affect them," he says. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else." Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a "reputational risk" by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its "search light as wide as possible" for new engineers and executives. That'll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are "basically irreplaceable." Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple's decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company's efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge." For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that's led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to "to get ahead of carbon pricing;" on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. "You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues," Tomaino says. "Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward," says Tomaino. "With Apple and diversity, the case is clear." For Maldonado, diversity is solely a business issue Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?" Maldonado says Apple's leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. "I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person," he says. "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company's 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn't happy with the answer. "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado says. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Six percent is this year’s goal Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple's 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That may have been an overwhelming failure, but it was high enough — above 3 percent — to allow Maldonado to submit the proposal again this year (missing the target would have let Apple bar similar proposals for three years). It’ll go up for a vote again at the company's shareholder’s meeting on February 28th. Maldonado doesn't expect to win this year, but he's hoping to get enough support to keep the proposal going. This time, the threshold he needs to reach is 6 percent in order to resubmit. "If I can reach six percent," he says, "then I can live again to fight another day."

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News Society for Science & the Public Launches Campaign to Identify Title Sponsor of the International Science and Engineering Fair — the World’s Largest STEM Competition WASHINGTON, Feb. 15, 2017 — The Society for Science & the Public (the Society) announced today that it is seeking a new title sponsor for the nearly 70-year-old International Science and Engineering Fair, the world’s largest international high school STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) competition. The International Science and Engineering Fair is the world’s premier STEM competition and stands on the value of ensuring all young people from around the world can be inspired to compete and become the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. The title sponsorship of this event is now available for only the second time in its storied history. Intel became the title sponsor in 1997 and renewed that sponsorship through 2019. A new sponsor will assume the sole title sponsorship in May 2019. Each year, millions of high school students from around the globe enter this most powerful STEM talent pipeline. These students — tomorrow’s leading scientists, engineers, innovators and entrepreneurs — strive to discover answers and develop new solutions to humanity’s greatest problems. The Society will initiate and manage a competitive process to find its new title sponsor for the International Science and Engineering Fair. A Request for Proposal is being made available today at https://www.societyforscience.org/future-isef. Interested entities should visit the site to learn more about sponsorship details. The next sponsor will commit at least $15 million annually for a minimum sponsorship term of five years. „We are at an inflection point. Our next sponsor has an extraordinary opportunity to inspire and impact future generations of scientific leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs,” said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO of Society for Science & the Public and Publisher of Science News. „This competition and its affiliated science fairs held across the globe reach young people like no other program can, igniting their passion for science and their desire to discover innovative solutions to some of our world’s most intractable problems.” The International Science and Engineering Fair has been cultivating and celebrating the world’s most powerful STEM talent pipeline since its launch in 1950, and has provided more than $100 million in awards to competing students. The competition identifies and fosters the best and brightest minds through its more than 425 affiliated fairs in more than 75 countries, regions and territories globally. Tens of millions of students compete in science fairs every year around the globe at local, state, regional and national levels, with hundreds of thousands then rising to compete in the Society’s affiliated fairs. Top winners at these fairs — about 1,800 students representing the top talent — are selected as finalists each year and earn the right to travel to and compete at the culminating International Science and Engineering Fair held each May. This weeklong event hosts the student finalists as they are given the opportunity to showcase their independent research and compete for (on average) more than $4 million in prizes, scholarships and awards. Also attending are nearly 8,000 additional people including volunteer judges, alumni, members of the global science fair community, local school children and their educators, distinguished guests and members of the media. The event is hosted in the United States, and provides significant economic impact to the host city, most recently estimated as $13.1 million to Los Angeles in 2014, $9.3 million to Phoenix in 2016 and $7.2 million to Pittsburgh in 2015. „Sponsorship of the International Science and Engineering Fair spans global borders, providing an invaluable platform that ensures we can identify and develop the next generations of top young scientists, engineers and innovators,” said Craig Barrett, former CEO and Chairman of the Board of Intel Corporation and current Society Trustee. „These young people make the world a better place for all of us.” The International Science and Engineering Fair presents an extraordinary opportunity for the next sponsor to inspire, connect with and directly support top high school students in their local communities and on a global stage. The program enables the next sponsor to establish a global legacy of fostering and advancing all sciences, while inspiring the next generations of scientific entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders. Exclusive title sponsorship also generates deep and meaningful access to a global talent pipeline as well as the chance to build significant reputational capital and awareness among a broad network of global leaders and influencers, and with the general public. Since 1997, the International Science and Engineering Fair has grown from 27 participating countries, regions and territories to 78 in 2016, and annual awards to participating students have increased from about $1 million in 1997 to about $4 million in 2016. In total over these past 20 years, more than $80 million has been awarded to International Science and Engineering Fair participants by sponsors and awarding organizations. „Intel is extremely proud of our nearly two-decade partnership with Society for Science & the Public and the millions of amazing young scientists and technologists who have inspired us through their talents and passion for changing the world,” said Rosalind Hudnell, Intel Vice President of Corporate Affairs and President of the Intel Foundation. „We are committed to supporting a world-class Intel International Science and Engineering Fair through 2019, and to continuing to inspire, educate and engage the next generation of innovators in the U.S. and around the globe.” The annual program and competition celebrates tomorrow’s leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs — while presenting the title sponsor the opportunity to inspire, connect with and directly support an unparalleled talent pipeline and alumni community on a global stage. In its nearly 70 years, the International Science and Engineering Fair has yielded thousands of distinguished alumni, including top innovators and entrepreneurs as well as recipients of the world’s most coveted science and math honors such as the Nobel Prize, National Medal of Science, Breakthrough Prize, Lasker Award and MacArthur Fellowship. The Society’s search for a new sponsor follows the recent transformational sponsorship by Regeneron of the Science Talent Search (the Society’s program for U.S. high school seniors) from 2017—2026 for $100 million; and the renewal from the Broadcom Foundation of the Society’s premier middle school science competition, Broadcom MASTERS, through 2021.  About Society for Science & the Public Society for Science & the Public is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization dedicated to the achievement of young researchers in independent research and to public engagement in science. Established in 1921, its vision is to promote the understanding and appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in human advancement.

Democrats are planning multiple press conferences across the Capitol today to again highlight what they say are too-cozy ties between Trump’s White House and the Kremlin, push for an independent probe and roll out bipartisan Russian sanctions legislation. So far, most Republicans have resisted joining with Democrats to demand an independent investigation into Trump's ties to Russia but that could change as more news leaks out about his campaign's communications with the Kremlin. So far investigators have found no evidence of cooperation between Russia and Trump’s campaign to sway the election but “the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin,” report Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo for the New York Times. More: http://nyti.ms/2lP0Bof A house divided: A growing number of Senate Republicans are calling for further investigation into Flynn’s conversations with Russia but the GOP is still largely united against Democrats’ demands for an independent probe into connections between Trump and Russia. Some GOP lawmakers suggested Flynn will likely have to testify before the House and Senate Intel Committees, which are both leading an investigation into Russia’s election meddling. But House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes seems more content to praise the former national security adviser than anything else. Flynn “deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” Nunes said in a statement. Republicans investigate Republicans? No. Nunes “told CNN that he wants to investigate how transcripts of Flynn’s calls with [the Russian ambassador] got leaked — not the impact of the calls themselves,” Elana and Kyle report. Later on Fox News radio Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul suggested Republicans shouldn’t investigate other Republicans in the first place. “I just don’t think it’s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,” Paul said. “We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans.” BIBI ON THE HILL — Following lunch at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be on the Hill today for meetings with top congressional leaders. Netanyahu will sit down with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at 5:15 p.m. He’ll then cross the Capitol for a 6:45 p.m. meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. PUZDER ‘VOWED REVENGE,’ EX-WIFE CLAIMED — Labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder’s ex-wife told Oprah in 1990 he “vowed revenge” after she went public with allegations of abuse. Lisa Fierstein, Puzder’s ex-wife, said he told her, “’I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over. You will pay for this,’” report Marianne Levine and Timothy Noah after reviewing the tape Tuesday night. Puzder’s confirmation hearing is set for tomorrow but four Republicans have already expressed reservations about his nomination. Fierstein has since retracted the abuse allegations. Much more: http://politi.co/2lOLsn0 WHICH WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY? The GOP's intra-party warfare over Obamacare reignited this week after conservatives agreed to make a concerted push to dismantle the health care law immediately, something moderates say would be disastrous. Now doubts are growing that the GOP can even reach agreement on how to repeal Obamacare, despite having control of both Congress and the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan crossed the Capitol Tuesday for lunch, seeking to ease Senate GOP concerns about House progress on the healthcare rollback. But not everyone was buying it. Sen. Rand Paul left before it was over, saying he was hearing “things that are unacceptable to me.” Today Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price will attend lunch with Senate Republicans but “it may take a direct intervention from Trump to get the party's warring factions in line,” report Burgess, Josh Dawsey, Rachael and Jen Haberkorn. “It’s hard to see how this gets done unless the president says, ‘OK, let’s do it this way,’” said Senate HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander.

Anthony List: Congress will soon consider re-directing taxpayer funding away from Planned Parenthood and to community health centers, which outnumber Planned Parenthood 20:1 nationwide. These centers provide comprehensive health care for women but do not perform abortions or harvest fetal body parts. Polling shows the majority of Americans support this effort. http://bit.ly/3kWW0mi ** DEMS BLAST CANCELED IMMIGRATION MEETING — House Democrats were fuming Tuesday after the top federal immigration official abruptly canceled an afternoon meeting with leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus over recent deportation raids. CHC Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham told Huddle it was clear after a phone conversation with ICE acting director Thomas Homan that he scrapped the meeting for political “cover.” Grisham and other Dems said they think Homan wasn’t ready to answer questions about the more than 680 people arrested last week, including at least one Dreamer, in what they fear could be the start of “mass deportations.” A bipartisan meeting with ICE is now scheduled for Thursday. WH ‘SHOULD DO SOMETHING’ ON CONWAY — House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz says the White House “should do something” to discipline adviser Kellyanne Conway. His remarks come after the Office of Government Ethics said Conway committed a “clear violation” by plugging Ivanka Trump’s clothing line on TV last week. “We’re going to see what the White House does at this point,” Chaffetz told the Huffington Post Tuesday. “I don’t know what the proper remedy is. It is a first-time offense. I’m not trying to make any excuses for it, but I want the White House to let us know what they’re doing.” Paul Blumenthal with more: http://huff.to/2lOOtnk Speaking of Chaffetz, he sent a letter to the White House Tuesday demanding to know “details on why President Donald Trump conducted some of his response to a North Korean missile test in a public dining room at his Mar-a-Lago club,” Kyle reports. “White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that no classified material was discussed in public, and that Trump was briefed in a secure location both before and after his dinner. But Chaffetz said that assurance may not be enough.” More: http://politi.co/2lOWOrl TROUBLE’S A BREWIN’ — Trump’s plan to funnel billions of more dollars to the Pentagon to “load up” the military is threatening to blow open a rift between budget and defense hawks over just how much should be spent on defense and whether the plus-up should be offset elsewhere. Top defense hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham say they’re willing to back the defense spending surge without paying for it. But fiscal hardliners like Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz “worry the GOP will abandon its mission of reining in red ink now that the Obama administration is in the rearview mirror,” Austin Wright and Jeremy Herb report. Much more: http://politi.co/2kRSetU On a related note, GOP Sens. Thad Cochran and John McCain say they’re concerned about Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s nominee to lead the OMB, because of his previous hardline stances on defense spending. Sen. Susan Collins also said she hasn’t made a decision on whether to support Mulvaney, whose confirmation vote is expected later this week. Three GOP defections could sink Mulvaney's nomination. CNN’s Manu Raju: http://cnn.it/2lgLzKB WALDEN’S SILVER LINING — Given how much he’s on the Hill, Vice President Mike Pence really seems to be loving his new House digs. But he had to boot House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden out of the hideaway space first. “If you’re going to lose your hideaway, its better to lose it to the vice president of the United States than some other shmuck, right?” Walden said. “He said I can keep a key but I doubt the Secret Service will allow it.” EXTRA, EXTRA: An 'absolutely crazy' time for a meeting with POTUS. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flew to DC to kick off a new era after his rocky dealings with President Obama. Then the last 48 hours happened. In an exclusive BONUS “The Global Politico” podcast with Susan Glasser, longtime US ambassador Dan Shapiro, who served as Obama’s top Israel adviser throughout his presidency and sat in on meetings with Bibi, takes us inside what will no doubt be an extraordinary first formal meeting with President Trump.

Anthony List: Despite receiving over $550 million tax dollars a year, Planned Parenthood's cancer screening and prevention services have dropped by 57% since 2010. Additionally, contraceptive services dropped by 20% since 2010. Community health centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 20:1 nationwide: Women don't need Planned Parenthood. Just this December, after reviewing over 20,000 documents, the Senate Judiciary Committee referred Planned Parenthood to the Department of Justice and the FBI for potential criminal prosecution for trafficking fetal body parts from abortions for profit. And despite claiming to offer prenatal services, undercover investigators discovered fewer than 6% of facilities surveyed provided prenatal services. A 2015 nationwide poll showed 53% of Americans support redirecting tax dollars to federally qualified community health centers. Congress should redirect taxpayer dollars to community health centers that provide real healthcare for women. http://bit.ly/3kWW0mi ** « View Archives This story tagged under: Congress Most Read FBI releases files on Trump apartments' race discrimination probe in '70s Trump to take breather from White House, hold rally this weekend Trump blames ‘fake media’ for treating Flynn ‘very unfairly’ Trump, asked about anti-Semitism, brags about election victory Poll: Trump trails generic Democrat, but not Warren, in 2020 ‘Real News’ Joins the White House Briefing Room ‘An Absolutely Crazy Time to Hold a Meeting with the President of the United States’ Fallon responds to Trump: He's trying to distract from 'very serious allegations' about Russia Congress blocks rule barring mentally impaired from guns House intel chairman dismisses call for expanded Russia probe Huddle - POLITICO Archive Wednesday, 2/15/17 Tuesday, 2/14/17 Monday, 2/13/17 Friday, 2/10/17 Thursday, 2/9/17 View the Full Huddle Archives » Politico Magazine Congress Needs to Investigate the Flynn Case By Rich Lowry Does Kicking Out Mexicans Create Jobs?

There are many components that make up the data industry, from software companies to cloud players, data centres, telecoms companies and more. As part of Data Week, we will list all the major constituents of the industry in Ireland. On Monday, we provided a list of the top players in telecoms and yesterday, we listed 20 leading cloud service providers. Today, we feature internet of things (IoT) enablers. Stay tuned for the global data carriers connecting our shores to the world, culminating in a final list on Friday that incorporates data centres in Ireland. Analog Devices Founded in 1965 by Ray Stata and Matthew Lorber, Analog Devices is now one of the largest semiconductor businesses in the world and has rapidly adapted to the growing IoT market. Celebrating its 40th anniversary in Ireland last year, where it now employs 1,200 people, the company made a strategic move to buy its rival Linear Technology for $14.8bn last July. It also bought LiDAR developer Vescent Photonics to expand the company’s capabilities with autonomous driving tech. Asavie From its Dublin HQ, Asavie has developed the award-winning PassBridge platform to make IoT connectivity that bit easier. Connecting myriad ‘things’ to the internet is no easy task. There are multiple protocols and standards, ever-evolving cellular technologies, and varying device capabilities and requirements to navigate. PassBridge has helped Asavie hook in more than 20 operators seeking to quickly launch scalable and secure mobile and IoT projects, including AT&T, Three, Vodafone and Eir Business. DecaWave One of Ireland’s most exciting young companies, DecaWave creates wireless devices that can be located indoors to an accuracy of 10cm. By last summer, the company had already deployed over 1m internet of things chips globally. Having raised $30m in funding to date, its ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology has close to 1,000 customers throughout the world. DecaWave is headquartered in Dublin, with offices in France, China and South Korea. Eir Last year, Eir joined forces with Irish IoT player Asavie to build an IoT Connect platform that can be used by small and large companies, from healthcare to transport and manufacturing, to connect machines to the internet and gather real-time intelligent data. This will see Eir’s cellular network be employed by businesses to connect machines in the field via a self-care portal that firms can log in to over a public cloud, or through a VPN. Image: Besjunior/Shutterstock Firmwave Firmwave is a product and solution design company that specialises in designing ultra-low power hardware and firmware for IoT and wearable devices. Based at GEC in Dublin, Firmwave is targeting the emerging IoT sensors market that is predicted to reach $34.75bn by 2023. It also has offices in Gdansk Technology Park, Poland. Last summer, the company partnered with Asavie on a low-power, wireless sensor network platform in the US. Ericsson A tactile IoT that anticipates needs, rather than waiting to be instructed, is the focus of Ericsson’s 1,600-strong workforce in Dublin and Athlone. In 2014, Ericsson revealed plans to create 120 new software roles in the two areas. The global telecom giant’s legacy in technology is enduring, with the next generation focused on 5G, IoT, fibre, VR and more. The company currently has 800 people focused on next-generation software, and 400 involved in a global consulting hub. IBM The company known as ‘Big Blue’ is investing heavily in the world of IoT, proving its clout as a leader in the connected world. Claire Penny, IoT leader for IBM, recently spoke about the potential of the Watson supercomputer in industries such as healthcare. Just last week, IBM and Ericsson revealed 5G tech 10 times more powerful than ever before, with “potential to unleash and inspire brand new ideas and innovations we haven’t yet imagined”. Intel/Movidius Since establishing in Ireland in 1989, Intel is one of the top employers in the country. The local operation supplies a significant proportion of the company’s 14nm chips to the rest of the world. Intel Ireland has also played a key role in developing Intel’s Galileo board for IoT, which was designed in Ireland. In September 2016, Irish company Movidius was acquired by Intel. Movidius designs low-power processor chips for computer vision and deep learning. The company is headquartered in California and has two design centres in Dublin and Romania. Movidius recently signed a deal with Google for the company’s chips to feature on smartphones that can sense their immediate environment. Image: Besjunior/Shutterstock Johnson Controls Johnson Controls is a global technology and IoT company, designing, fitting and monitoring intelligent buildings such as hospitals, airports and manufacturing facilities. The company also works to support IoT, managing data centres built to house the data created by connected devices (and structures). Following a 2016 merger with Irish security systems company Tyco, the US-headquartered Johnson Controls operates out of an additional location in Cork. Nokia Bell Labs The legacy of Alexander Graham Bell continues through the work of Nokia subsidiary Bell Labs in Dublin, where an R&D group has achieved a number of firsts, including the first lightRadio transatlantic calls. Bell Labs became a part of Nokia when the latter revealed plans to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6bn. The acquisition will lay the foundation for the next wave of technological change driven by 5G and IoT. PCH Cork is the global headquarters of Liam Casey’s PCH, a $1bn-a-year supply chain player focused on professional services around IoT. The company, which also has offices in San Francisco and Shenzhen in China, devises the design and manufacture of connected devices. In the past year, PCH has been cultivating specialised relationships with consumer brands in the fashion, luxury and health markets, including alliances with brands like Johnson & Johnson and L’Oréal. S3 Group Founded in Dublin back in 1986, S3 has focused its business on two areas: the design and supply chain management of advanced semiconductors, as well as cloud and data analytics services for the health sector. Of particular interest to S3 is the design of semiconductors for satellite communications and the field of industrial IoT. Image: Besjunior/Shutterstock SAP As well as handling a myriad of business support functions for German software giant SAP, Dublin is also home to SAP’s App Haus, as well as its BusinessObjects’ R&D centre, which develops business analytics. Specifically, App Haus works with start-ups on SAP’s next-generation in-memory computing platform SAP HANA, which can be harnessed to manage and deploy real-time IoT and machine-to-machine applications. Three Three is one of Ireland’s most prolific data carriers. When it comes to IoT, according to ComReg in Q2 2016, Three Group had the largest market share of M2M subscriptions, at 50.1pc. In early 2016, Three announced the roll-out of 4G Plus, to allow users to access speeds of up to 225Mbps on the move. Taoglas Irish IoT company Taoglas designs and manufactures antennas that enable M2M connectivity for wireless devices. The Wexford-headquartered announced a $2m investment in a state-of-the-art San Diego IoT centre early last year. Other investments in Taiwan, Germany and France give the company an international footprint. Now, Taoglas is reaching for the stars. The company received funding from the European Space Agency last month, which will be put towards its telecoms research. Vodafone Beyond offering mobile and fixed data connections to Irish consumers, Vodafone also uses its networks to support IoT. ComReg reported that in Q2 2016, Vodafone had a 43.9pc share of M2M subscriptions. Through its Siro partnership with ESB, Vodafone aims to bring high-speed broadband access to rural Ireland. In November, Vodafone revealed that it is planning to invest €250m in 2017 in a network and IT transformation programme to deliver its plan for the Gigabit Society. VT Networks Founded in 2015 by Mark Bannon and Will Ferguson, VT Networks successfully raised €1.2m last year to roll out Ireland’s first IoT network. Using Sigfox technology, the nationwide network went live in June 2016 and aims to connect 1m devices by the end of this year. Bannon believes that the future of IoT lies in creating products with zero battery consumption, noting specific potential with sensors in the agricultural sector. Wia Wia, led by Conall Laverty, is an NDRC-based IoT start-up that originated in Belfast, and aims to provide makers with a platform to bring home and school projects to life. The company is targeting both consumers and businesses. Wia’s SDK provides an interface between a hardware device and its real-time service. With just a few lines a code, a developer can create a production-ready product, as well as a complementary mobile app. In-Depth: Data Week Related: Movidius, Intel, Bell Labs, data, pch, SAP, Ericsson, DecaWave, Analog Devices, Vodafone, internet of things, Asavie, Eir, wireless, IBM, networks, Three Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Enterprise Data for Dummies: The essential data glossary 3 hours ago9 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Jobs 6 top international companies hiring in data right now 20 hours ago10 Shares Enterprise Smart steps for securing your employees’ smartphones 22 hours ago64 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

The CEO announced that Intel will invest $7 billion to complete a manufacturing facility in Arizona. Fab 42 will create about 3,000 full-time Intel jobs and more than 10,000 jobs in Arizona to run and support the factory, he said in an e-mail to his employees. “The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona,” Krzanich said in a press release. #Intel Corp. announces $7 billion investment in #Arizona plant https://t.co/Z59VcbhWC7 — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) February 9, 2017 “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located,” he added. The seven nanometer (nm) chips that the company is targeting for this factory will power state-of-the-art computers, data centers, and other high-tech devices. They will enable amazing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, automated driving, medical research and treatment, and the factories of the future, the release stated. “Leading-edge technologies like 7 nm require an increasing amount of factory space per wafer. These two factors have driven Intel to a point where we must get to work and build out another factory for 7 nm capacity. These state-of-the-art factories take a couple of years to build out capacity and begin the start-up process. As a result, we made the decision to start the process now. We are excited to begin this journey to build the world’s most advanced and complex factory producing Intel’s 7 nm technology,” he said. He added that Intel has maintained this U.S.-based manufacturing even though approximately 80 percent of their products are sold outside the U.S. “We support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies,” he said, adding that government policies play a critical role in enabling and sustaining American-driven innovation. “At Intel we meet with governments from around the world, discussing and debating issues and policies important to our business, employees, and shareholders. When we disagree, we don’t walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation,” he said. Shedding light on Fab 42, Ann Kelleher, Intel vice president and general manager of Technology and Manufacturing Group at Intel Corporation, said that the firm started building the facility in 2011. “Fab 42 is a factory that we originally started building in 2011, aiming for our 14-nanometer technology. Then, based on a number of manufacturing efficiencies, we were able to defer using Fab 42 because we were able to fit the 14 nm capacity into our existing factory on the Arizona site. Since we deferred Fab 42, we’ve been consistently saying, “Yes, we will need Fab 42 for future space, capacity and for future technologies.” Well, that time has come. So we’re starting to prepare Fab 42 for 7 nanometer,” she said. #SuperBowl 2017 #ArtificialIntelligence #AI, #IoT and #LadyGaga Lighting Extravaganza with #Intel Drones https://t.co/BhvEEdXuvy pic.twitter.com/t4lRdfJtd5 — VCloud News (@VCloudNews) February 12, 2017 Hopefully, President Donald Trump’s initiative will provide more job opportunities to Americans.

Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course More like this Intel Itanium Hpe Data Center Servers Next Superdome CPU chips amble into HPE Intel shipping Kittson samples into Itanium-land Itanium Poulson (8500) die 15 Feb 2017 at 11:01, Chris Mellor There have been reports that Intel has already started shipping its latest, Kittson version, Itanium processor chip. The current Itanium processors are the 9500 series, code-named Poulson, and introduced in 2012. There are four versions: 9520, 9540, 9550 and 9560. HPE uses Itanium chips in its high-end Superdome 2 servers, running the HP-UX operating system, and has previously said it will have a Kittson refresh coming out this year. Megsco has sued Oracle over Larryco's wish not to develop its software for Itanium servers any more – because of low sales and, now, Oracle's headlong cloud rush. Our understanding is that Itanium was developed by Intel to compete with IBM's POWER and Oracle/Sun's SPARC processors. However, multi-processor, multi-core Xeon developments, the unwillingness of mainframe users to migrate to POWER/SPARC/Itanium server alternatives, and the rise of public cloud computing are three things that have weakened the POWER/SPARC/Itanium server market. Itanium server sales are understood to lag POWER and SPARC server sales, with all three being a long way behind Xeon server sales. It is generally reckoned that Intel would like to dump Itanium and concentrate on its more mainstream Xeon and Knights Landing products. Consequently Kittson is likely to be the end of the line for Intel's Itanium processor architecture products. Itanium does not provide significantly more powerful servers than Xeon chips do. Applications need to be specifically built to execute on Itanium, and HPE also bears the cost of developing Itanium server hardware and the HP-UX software. All-in-all Itanium-powered servers are costly beasts to develop, support and operate, and there is no easy migration path off them. Another factor to bear in mind is that HPE has bought HPC server supplier SGI and its technology overlaps that of Superdome in the shared memory area. There has been speculation that there could be some kind of convergence of SGI and Superdome technologies. HPE will, of course, support its Itanium customers for a number of years, at least until 2025, after having introduced Kittson-powered Superdomes later this year. There is no available information about any Kittson performance advantages over Poulson Itanium processors, although this will emerge when HPE launches its Kittson-powered Superdomes. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register Oracle to driver developers: 'Come play with our interface' Big Red lets C/C++ types talk to its call interface 5 Comments Oracle settles court spat with fired cloud 'sales inflation whistleblower' Terms of settlement not disclosed SHOCKER 18 Comments Oracle slurps enterprise cloud API wrangler Apiary Time for REST... and it's only January Solaris continuous upgrades have already begun, says Oracle But Big Red's staying schtum about the new cloud services on its recently-updated roadmap 5 Comments Oracle crashes AWS and Azure UK cloud data centre party London base in global expansion 18 Comments Oracle refuses to let Java copyright battle die – another appeal filed in war against Google If at first you don't succeed, try { try { again } } 63 Comments Whitepapers Faster Applications with Predictive Flash Interactive tool outlining the benefits of Predictive Flash to remove the app-data gap.

A 'sled' from the Boston Quattro 12256-T. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Developed as an alternative to market-leading Nvidia Tesla and AMD FirePro GPUs, the Phi takes the same approach of dumping complex chip architectures in favour of a huge number of much simpler cores. Equipped with their own RAM and high-speed interconnects linking all the cores together, GPUs were originally developed to handle graphics processing but can also be used alongside a conventional CPU to offload parallel processing workloads and, thereby, boost the performance of HPC applications. The first release of the Xeon Phi was on a plug-in PCIe card, just like the Tesla, but the second generation, known as Knights Landing (KNL), is not just faster but also available in a standard CPU form factor ready to plug into a host processor socket. More than that, the new Xeon Phi can boot and run a standard x64 operating system, typically Linux, for easier integration into enterprise data centres with 16GB of on-die 'near memory' based on MCDRAM technology to further boost throughput. It is also available with optional support for direct connection to massively parallel HPC clusters using Intel's preferred Omni-Path technology. The latest Xeon Phi processors are based on modified Atom Silvermont cores and are up to three times faster than previous-generation coprocessor implementations. Image: Intel The Quattro story of Phi The Xeon Phi may be radically different from other Xeon processors, but the Boston Quattro server in which it's used here isn't. In fact the 2U Quattro chassis from Supermicro has been around for a number of years now and is effectively a mini-blade platform with four sleds instead of blades, each designed to take an independent server motherboard. These plug in at the rear of the unit with power provided by a pair of hot-swap 2000W supplies that, similarly, slide into place at the back. Four server sleds and two redundant power supplies all slide into place at the rear of the Boston Quattro chassis. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet On a Quattro fitted with standard Xeon processors there's usually a small amount of disk or SSD storage located within the sleds themselves, but not on this model. Instead, the storage is arranged across the front of the unit and organised into four banks of three, one per node (server) connected via a passive backplane in the centre of the chassis. There's no room for storage in the server sleds so it's all located at the front of the chassis, in four banks of carriers to take magnetic disks or SSDs. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet The Xeon Phi also has a relatively high thermal rating (up to 260 Watts) which means that, even though there's only one per sled, it can get very hot in there, so there's a bank of fans in the middle of the unit and ducting in the sleds to direct the airflow and keep the processors cool. The end result is as noisy as you would expect -- but that's not really an issue on this kind of server, which will typically be locked away in a soundproofed machine room. The fans and sled backplane are in the middle of the Quattro chassis. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 The Supermicro motherboard in the bottom of each sled has a single socket to take the Xeon Phi coprocessor, which is based on highly modified Intel Atom Silvermont cores and available in a number of variants. The main differentiator is the number of usable cores/threads, our review system shipping with 1.3GHz Xeon Phi 7230 processors to give it 64 cores (256 threads) per node. Sitting in the middle of a three-SKU range, the alternatives are 1.4GHz chips with 68 cores (272 threads) and 1.5GHz with 72 cores (288 threads). There's room for just one Xeon Phi per sled, with up to 384GB of DDR4 RAM in 6 DIMM slots arranged on either side. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet The processor is neatly sandwiched between two sets of DIMM slots able to take up 384GB of DDR4 RAM, which can be clocked at either 2133MHz or 2400MHz depending on the processor fitted. In addition each Xeon Phi chip has a further 16GB of high-performance multi-channel memory (MCDRAM) built in as standard on the die. This 4-5 times faster than DDR4 and, under application control, can be used as a high-speed cache, a distinct NUMA node or a combination of the two in order to keep all those cores fed with data and instructions. It's also worth noting that, even though each sled contains an independent server with up to 72 cores (288 threads), Xeon Phi processors are designed to work together to build highly scalable processing clusters containing tens of thousands of nodes to handle massively parallel workloads. To this end the review machine was fitted with Mellanox InfiniBand PCIe adapters (one per node), although there are Xeon Phi variants available that come equipped with Intel's own Omni-Path fabric on-board. These are identified by a protruding connector on the processor designed to fit into a gap in the motherboard socket to take the cables for connection to an external switch. The review servers each had a Mellanox PCIe InfiniBand adapter installed (top right of the interfaces in the photo), although the Xeon Phi is also available with the technology to connect to Intel's own Omni-Path fabric built in. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet A second PCIe slot is also available along with two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces per node managed by an on-board Intel i350 controller plus an integrated IPMI management interface with KVM and another, dedicated, LAN connector. Storage, meanwhile, is looked after by a SATA3 controller in the Intel C612 chipset with RAID 0,1,5 and 10 support, where needed. Phi squared The key to positioning the Boston Quattro 12256-T, and Intel's Xeon Phi in general, is understanding that it's not your everyday Xeon server. It's not designed to run Windows (although it can) or Windows applications, and it's certainly not a virtualisation platform. Neither does it make a good platform for cloud applications. For all these reasons, it should not be considered as an alternative to standard Xeon-based servers for the majority of enterprise IT projects. Where it scores best is in handling workloads that can be broken down into multiple processing streams and spread across hundreds or thousands of cores in parallel. Workloads such as DNA sequencing, for example, or deep learning, big data analytics and complex modelling. The Quattro 12256-T isn't cheap by any means -- the Xeon Phi 7230 CPUs used in our review unit cost $3,710 each, for example. However, Boston's server compares well on price with other HPC solutions. Moreover, it's available for delivery now, with the Boston Quattro 12256-T providing a practical platform from which to exploit the capabilities of Intel's latest Xeon Phi processors, which are already proving popular with HPC customers worldwide.

These startups were assessed to be in a position to disrupt the spaces of preventive healthcare, infant mortality, and waste management, respectively. | TNN | Feb 15, 2017, 11.51 AM IST CHENNAI: Startups Allizhealth, iNICU & iCHR, and Banyan Nation have been announced as the top three teams of the Intel & DST - Innovate for Digital India Challenge 2.0 (Challenge 2.0). These startups were assessed to be in a position to disrupt the spaces of preventive healthcare, infant mortality, and waste management, respectively. Shortlisted from nearly 800 applications received nationwide, the selected three teams will now receive go-to-market support and access opportunities led by Intel, DST and T-Hub and their knowledge network of partners and industry. In addition, they will have the opportunity to travel to the United States for a bootcamp and go-to-market mentoring program with US Market Access Center (USMAC). Each team will also receive grants of up to Rs 5,00,000 to take their solutions beyond the beta stage and from local to global markets. Challenge 2.0, the second edition of the Intel & DST Innovate for Digital India Challenge, is a platform for end-to-end hardware product innovation that identifies and incubates homegrown entrepreneurial solutions that address India's indigenous issues. This year, Intel India and Department of Science & Technology ("DST") collaborated with T-Hub to identify ideas that could solve complex issues at the country's grassroots level through technology and automation, accelerating the transition to a Digital India. Each solution is designed for scale, and to improve the quality of people's lives in the remotest corners of India. From developing the Minimum Viable Product that allowed teams to collect maximum validated learning about their customers with the minimum effort, to go-to-market strategy, Challenge 2.0 intended to help participants take their prototypes from mind-to-market. The Smart City category introduced this year garnered almost a quarter of all entries, as did the IoT category, indicating a trend of citizen participation in India's smart and connected urban infrastructure. Here is the list of the top three teams, in no particular order: AllizHealth is an assistive device based on the Intel Curie module in the preventive healthcare technology space. It connects the user with a health management platform that assesses and anticipates health risks particularly related to geriatrics support. Providing an integrated, predictive algorithm, the wearable digitally connects users with various ecosystem partners / caregivers for alerts on falls and resulting support and condition management. Banyan Nation is a mobile technology platform that integrates the supply chain of India's waste management and plastic recycling sector. Based on the Intel® Edison, and using the Intel® based Jan Unnati tablet, the smart waste platform automates end-to-end urban recycling operations through on-field bin sensors, GPS truck routers, landfill management toolkits and back-end analytic engines. The solution follows a modular design which is customizable to suit the needs of different municipalities and third-party system integrators developing smart city solutions. iNICU & iCHR is helping reduce the neonatal infant mortality rate with a system that integrates real-time clinical data from connected devices within the laboratory with bedside observational data. Based on the Intel Cybertan Gateway and Intel Edison, the solution presents the information in medically comprehensive formats to reduce mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It enables complex clinical decisions to be made in real-time by automatically collecting clinical data, providing critical care for preterm babies. Debjani Ghosh, MD and VP, sales & marketing, Intel South Asia, said, "Developing local solutions to address India's widespread social challenges, is one of the prerequisites to make Digital India a reality. We urgently need technologies that are relevant for addressing some of the most basic needs of our country, and the Intel & DST - Innovate for Digital India Challenge is a platform to make that happen. I've spent time with the top ten teams, and while many of us dream of changing India, these individuals are actually leading that change. Congratulations to the top three, and I am certain that like last year's teams, this year's top teams will also go from mind-to-market, not just in India, but in other countries as well."

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Editorial  ⋮  Hardware AMD Calls Check; Your Move, Intel By Usman Pirzada Feb 14, 2017 376Shares Share Tweet Submit Something incredible has happened, for the first time in many years, there is an x86 microarchitecture out there that is going to pose a very real, and very significant threat to Intel’s monopoly in at least one major segment. I am talking of course, about AMD’s brand new Zen architecture, powering the all new Ryzen processors that are all set to hit the market by the end of this month. This isn’t a marketing buff or a nomenclature gimmick, the comeback is very much real. AMD is competitive again in the x86 scene and from everything we have heard so far, its going to massively undercut Intel in terms of pricing, marking the end of an era in computing (and the beginning of a price war). A monopoly is broken: AMD’s highly competitive x86 Ryzen processors to enter the battle at a fraction of Intel cost Amidst status quo shattering applause, AMD’s Ryzen processors will enter the arena this month. If you are a reader of Wccftech, you would know that we have already talked about pretty much all of the details concerning Ryzen. 8-core performance leaks have been coming for a long time now and they have not disappointed. The much cheaper Ryzen processor is able to go toe to toe with Intel’s $1000 chip which presents a very obvious problem for chipzilla considering the price difference. Intel will have to respond either by introducing new SKUs and/or by dropping the price of existing units. The public can see that the $329 Ryzen processor can do the job just as good as a $1000 Intel CPU, which means that the premium they have been charging for as a monopoly tax will quickly have to be removed. A price cut from Intel, is therefore anxiously anticipated. Even if one does come however, it will be too little, too late. Intel has been enjoying the high throne for quite some time now and is quite confident in its margins. All this however, is liable to change with the arrival of Ryzen CPUs. The only question is whether AMD can maintain supply at rates this cheap, and the answer to that, is given further down the article for anyone that wants to look. We also saw that the processors have a high overclock potential, dependent almost entirely on the VRM of the board and the cooling system used. If a single core can hit 5 GHz on air, ignoring the effects of electromigration, then you can realistically expect cherry chips to overclock up to 3.8-4.2 GHz on all cores with a high-end cooler and a mature enough revision of the Ryzen processor. A Ryzen chip with a decent overclock will be able to give comparable performance to (and possibly even beat) Intel’s $1000 i7-6900 in optimized scenarios and match the i5s in gaming performance. So in short, we know the following things for sure about Ryzen: The eight core Ryzen will have comparable optimized/threaded performance to the $1000+ Intel piece and comparable gaming/unoptimized performance to the quad-core i5 pieces. This is because any unthreaded application will rely mostly on the clock rate, at which Intel is currently ahead. It will have overclocking potential. Intel should still be in the lead in terms of pure IPC. It will be half as cheap as its Intel counterpart (tentative pre-order pricing is at around $499). This is just a ridiculously good value proposition that no enthusiast will be able to ignore. Lower attach and upgrade costs of the AM4 platform as compared with Intel’s Z270 platform. This is very good news for any tech enthusiast waiting to go with a Ryzen build. All this information points to the fact that we are looking at a very real AMD comeback on the compute side of things. Ryzen is not only going to be a game changer for the company in terms of its profitability (in the long run) but also a status quo shattering product for the x86 industry at large. Keep in mind however, that caution is advised as far as raw gaming performance is concerned. Games usually are not capable of utilizing a lot of threads and instead rely on high clock rates, applications like server/enterprise and rendering farms however are going to benefit from the arrival of Ryzen a lot. That is the industry where it is truly going to be a game changer, providing Intel-level performance at 1/2-1/3 the cost.

Actually, that’s where the amended WSA comes in The amendment is of a very material nature to the success of AMD (and Ryzen) but before we get into that it is interesting to point out that this is one of the more significant amendments to the WSA that has happened so far. It came almost a year after the amendment of 2015 and was officially filed as the “The Sixth Amendment to the Wafer Supply Agreement”. Advertisement The initial point of the contract was to make sure that AMD continued to buy a set quantity of wafers from the foundry every year and not simply shift to other foundries after the spin off. With almost every amendment AMD has attempted to re-adjust the grip of the WSA and paid corresponding monetary compensation according to the terms for doing so. Unlike the previous amendments however, this particular contract changes quite a few things for the duration it will stay active. The original Wafer Supply Agreement stated that it will stay active no later than 2024, and this particular amendment will end on 2020.  One thing is for certain though, it would seem that AMD is not as confident in the capabilities of GlobalFoundries as it once might have been. Zen is critical to AMD’s success and quite possibly its ability to stay afloat going forward. It can be argued that the company remaining a going concern depends on Zen not being a failure. With that context in mind, it is easy to see why AMD might be looking to diversify its options in case GlobalFoundries does not perform. Since GlobalFoundries and Samsung share the same 14nm process, it is more probable that the amendment will be utilized to harness TSMC’s ability to create high powered SOCs at the 16nm FinFET node. This amendment will also serve as a fail safe option for AMD’s Zen processors – which are due to land sometime in early 2017. So basically:   AMD is free to source wafers from foundries that are not GlobalFoundries for any product it sees fit, provided it pays a penalty for every time this happens. It will give the company an unparalleled and unprecedented capability to not only hedge its bet with GloFo but make sure it has a fall back if the foundry does not perform. This means that as far as the supply risk is concerned, Ryzen is fairly hedged. You can also read our complete and thorough breakdown of the amended WSA agreement but I think readers will be able to see what I am talking about when I say that AMD has never been in a better position to support high demand for its products. With this amended WSA in place, the sky’s the limit as far as its ability to meet demand goes. I’ll end on the same note I began, AMD has made its move and it is most definitely a check. Whether this is also consequently a ‘mate’ for a colossal AMD win, depends entirely on how Intel chooses to react to it. Will it cut its pricing across the board in response or will it chose to do what it has always does with AMD processors (which is to say, nothing) and face the consequences?   Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It was, however, a Pentium, and it didn't make much sense for many users who wanted that little extra bump when it came to using the CPU for more intensive tasks such as gaming.   Since Kaby Lake is pretty much the end product of the Process, Architecture, Optimize cycle which Intel is using for its new processors, they decided to unlock a Core i3. The Kaby Lake i3-7530K is pretty much a 7700K divided by two. While it uses the same HD630 graphics core, it has exactly half the core count (2) and half the L3 cache (4MB) as the 7700K. Intel also decided to provide it the same base clock of 4.2GHz, but they didn't give the 7350K Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. The 7350K has a TDP of 61W.     If you are still not sure if you want to get a 7th generation Intel CPU over a 6th generation Intel CPU, I wrote a piece on the 7700K versus the 6700K clock-for-clock here, and I also wrote a piece on the process improvements and iGPU additions the 7th generation products offer here.   The i3-7350K is really a top of the line i3 processor. In fact, it is right at the top of the i3 product category just like the 7600K is the top i5 and the 7700K is the top i7. The one interesting feature the 7350K offers is the ability to overclock, so I have decided to make this review an overclocking review. That means I found the CPU's maximum overclock, used a reasonable memory kit with XMP enabled, and compared those results to the 7350K at stock, and again at 4GHz clock for clock versus the other CPUs in the charts.     I want to mention something before we move forward; there are two very basic metrics when it comes to CPU performance. The number of cores a CPU has, and the speed of each core are important factors when it comes to judging a CPU on paper. Software that is optimized for core count, like rendering software, will take advantage of higher core counts, and physical cores are better than virtual cores. It's why the i5 series exists, even though many i3s offer HT on two cores resulting in the ability to render four threads, the i5s with four real cores and no HT perform better when core count matters. Software that is optimized for an average number of cores (we can say four), like most games, can benefit more from frequency and IPC increases, and that is where the 7350K should do better. So, can an overclocked 7350K compete against the i7s in our charts when overclocked? Let's find out.     The 7350K is unlocked, meaning it can overclock the CPU, iGPU, cache, and memory. However, you will need a motherboard with the ability to drive the 7350K, and you have two options; the Z170 and Z270 chipsets. I would recommend the Z270 chipset because most of the motherboard UEFI's have been optimized to overclock Kaby Lake CPUs such as the 7350K, but if you need to save a few bucks, then the Z170 chipset should also work. The 7350K offers the same IO capabilities as the 7700K, including x16 PCI-E 3.0 lanes, support for 64GB of DDR4, identical iGPU output capabilities, and the same storage capabilities.     Pricing   The retail price of the 7350K is $179.99 on Newegg, while the 7700K costs $349.99. The closest 7th generation CPUs to the 7350K in price are the i3-7320 at $164.99, and the i5-7400 at $194.99.   So for $15 less, you get a Core i3 that uses 9W less at 100MHz lower and is locked. For $15 more, you get to replace the two virtual cores with two physical ones, add 4W of power, but you lose 700MHz at Turbo, but 1.2GHz at base and the CPU is locked.

Dell XPS 13 Kaby Lake review: Yes, this is the best one so far It’s an incremental update, but a good one. Shame about the Aussie price hike though.

But when your ultrabook is the one that’s being copied by everyone, that’s not such a bad thing, is it? Would you buy this? Yes 5 No 0 Price $ 1,999.00 (AUD) Special Offers Coupon: Lenovo 5% Off Notebooks and Desktops Coupon We can all agree that Dell’s latest XPS 13 with Kaby Lake is an incremental update. But when your ultrabook is the one that’s being copied by everyone, that’s not such a bad thing, is it? Externally, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the latest XPS 13 and its direct predecessor. You still get that beautiful InfinityEdge, nigh-zero bezel that lets Dell put the guts of a 13-inch laptop into the body of an 11-incher. The outside is still brushed aluminum and the keyboard deck, carbon fiber. Gordon Mah Ung Three generations of InfinityEdge PCs. Dell knows it has something good, so it hasn’t changed its XPS 13 much for three generations. The real changes are inside, where you’ll find Intel’s latest 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU, basically a souped-up Skylake chip that’s roughly 10 percent faster. On the GPU side, you'll see a similar boost. Dell also increases the battery capacity by using slightly denser cells. That takes your fuel tank from about 57.5 watt hours to 59 watt hours. Gordon Mah Ung The trackpad on the latest XPS 13 has less friction than more rubbery-feeling predecessors. I think the keyboard is still a tad small, though. Although Dell says the trackpad hasn’t changed, to my fingers, the trackpad definitely feels less rubbery than before, and more similar to the Microsoft Surface Book's silky-smooth glass version. I have no complaints. The keyboard, unfortunately, hasn’t changed either. It’s not a bad keyboard, and I’ve used an older XPS 13 for several months. Still, I’d still be remiss if I didn’t mention that the keys just feel a tad bit small versus the competition. And no, I don’t mean Apple’s MacBook, I mean HP’s Spectre x360, which gives us a roomy keyboard. Ports don’t change either: You still get a Thunderbolt 3 using a USB-C, as well as two USB 3.1 (10Gbps) Type A ports. There’s also a cowardly headphone jack and SD card reader too. Gordon Mah Ung The newest XPS 13 (top) has the same ports as the previous iteration (middle) and let you charge via USB-C. The oldest XPS 13 (bottom) has a mini-DisplayPort. Like the previous version, charging is done via the legacy Dell barrel charger or by using a USB-C Dell charger. Our unit came with the legacy barrel charger, but I've tested the XPS 13 with USB-C chargers from Dell, HP, Google and Innergie with no issues. It’ll also work with Dell’s own USB-C external battery pack brick. What this really comes down to is Intel’s Kaby Lake so let’s get on to it. The review model here was equipped with an Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB of LPDDR3/1866 in dual-channel mode, and a 256GB M.2 NVMe PCIe drive. The screen is a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel with a light anti-reflective coating. Dell offers touch and 4K display options, but they cost more money and eat the battery, too. Cinebench R15 Performance Our first test is Cinebench R15, a 3D rendering benchmark using the same engine that Maxon uses in its Cine4D application. For comparison, we have a Broadwell Core i5, a Skylake Core i5, and finally, I threw in the Gold XPS 13 with Intel’s higher-performance Skylake Core i7 and Iris graphics aboard. Kaby Lake is based on the same 14nm process as Broadwell and Skylake—Intel's backup plan when it couldn't move to a smaller process as planned. Intel took its experience making Broadwell and Skylake and squeezed higher clock speeds out of the chip while using nearly the same amount of power. As Cinebench R15 is a CPU benchmark, all the performance gains you’re seeing come from the higher megahertz of Kaby Lake—about 10 percent more clock speed and performance over Skylake. Here's a bonus: The Core i7 Skylake, with its fancy eDRAM cache, can’t pull away from the Kaby Lake chip either. The 7th-gen Kaby Lake in the latest XPS 13 comes out on top in the Cinebench R15 CPU test. Handbrake performance Cinebench R15 takes just a few minutes to run. To see how laptops fare under a longer load, we use the free and popular encoder Handbrake to convert a 30GB high-resolution MKV video file using the Android Tablet preset. The entire process can take up to two hours on a dual-core Core i5 or Core i7 CPU. On a desktop or larger laptop, cooling generally is not an issue. On tiny little laptops, this test can function as a performance test or an indicator of how well the laptop handles heat. Some laptop makers will opt to reduce performance to keep the laptop cooler and the fan noise down. Dell, generally, favours performance. That pattern doesn’t change here, as the Kaby Lake-based XPS 13 comes in well ahead of its siblings and again bests even the pricier Core i7 / Iris-based XPS 13. The Kaby Lake outpaces even the Core i7-based Skylake chip with its fancy-pants Iris graphics and eDRAM. 3DMark Cloud Gate performance For graphics performance, I tested all four units using Futuremark’s synthetic gaming test, 3DMark Cloud Gate. It’s a test made lower-ambition laptops that lack discrete graphics—all models tested here rely on the graphics integrated directly into their Intel CPUs. The Kaby Lake chip comes out well ahead of the 5th-gen Broadwell and 6th-gen Skylake. I’d say it does pretty well against the Dell XPS 13 with its fancy 6th-gen Core i7 and Iris graphics, too. The Iris graphics and eDRAM don’t give the Core i7 much of an advantage in Cloud Gate. To be fair to Iris graphics, the overall Cloud Gate performance score does factor CPU performance into its final score. When you look at only the graphics performance, the Iris graphics and the 64MB of eDRAM used as a buffer give it a respectable 10-percent advantage. Cloud Gate favors the XPS 13 with 6th-gen Core i7 when only graphics is factored in. Battery life I expected to get pretty good run time out of the slightly-larger battery on this laptop, and I did. Our test loops a 4K video file in airplane mode with sound enabled (using ear buds). The screen is set to a fairly bright 250 to 260 nits, which is a good setting for watching a movie in a typical office or home. While you might look at the results and decide Kaby Lake gives you more battery life over Skylake, there are differences between the two Core i5 XPS 13 units in SSD power consumption. The Lite-On SSD in the Kaby Lake XPS 13 is far more power-efficient than the one in the Skylake XPS 13. SSD performance may also play into the battery life of the 5th-gen Broadwell: That particular generation of XPS 13 used an M.2 SATA drive rather than the more power-hungry NVMe PCIe drives of the newer models. If you're wondering just how much of a power hit you can take from a higher-resolution screen with touch, just look at the loser in all this: the gold XPS 13, which gives you about six hours of video vs. the 11 hours of the Kaby Lake XPS 13. The Kaby Lake XPS 13 has pretty great battery life while playing video. One more thing Perhaps the most significant improvement with the 7th-gen Kaby Lake chip is the video engine. Intel basically added hardware support for 10-bit HEVC video, and boatload of other encoding and decoding features. Of course, 10-bit HEVC and other support doesn't yet matter for most of us, but it’s something keep in mind. The practical upshot is you can actually play video encoded using 10-bit color on the Kaby Lake, while a Skylake or a Broadwell machine would just spit furballs. Here’s the proof in pictures: Playing a 1080p file encoded with 10-bit color saw the Kaby Lake XPS13 basically at idle. Gordon Mah Ung The 7th gen Kaby Lake CPU in the latest Dell XPS 13 can play 10-bit color video files without breaking a sweat. Without the hardware support in the GPU, that means the CPU is doing all the work. Decoding that Tears of Steel video file with 10-bit color depth isn’t easy, either. It took battery life on the Skylake-based XPS 13 to a dismal three hours. That higher clock speed means more power consumption, which means less battery life. The Kaby Lake XPS 13, though, took a minimal hit and could loop the video for 10.5 hours. Gordon Mah Ung Skylake can’t handle video files encoded at 10-bit color depth without cranking up the CPU and even then will drop a massive amount of frames. Should you upgrade? If you’re already aboard the Dell XPS 13 train, you don’t need to be told how great of a laptop it is. The question you’re probably asking is whether you should upgrade. I’d say it depends. If you own a 6th gen-based Skylake chip based XPS 13, I’d say no. The performance bump you’re getting is maybe 10 percent or so. Because that revision of the XPS 13 already has Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C charging and NVMe drive support, it just doesn’t make sense for anyone who isn’t made of money. When you step back one more generation to a 5th-gen Broadwell-based XPS 13, then it starts to get interesting. You get roughly a 20-percent or more performance increase, a much faster NVMe drive and Thunderbolt 3, plus the ability to do USB-C charging. Coming from that generation of XPS 13, it’s a very decent upgrade, especially if you can sell your older unit to a friend or family member. Conclusion In the end, you can look at Dell’s latest XPS 13 as a “if nothing’s broken, don’t fix it” moment. It’s arguably one of the best if not the best laptop available. You get that beautiful InfinityEdge display, a super-compact body, and oodles of performance. Not that anyone should resting on their laurels, because the competition isn’t going to sit still for much longer. For now though, it would be hard to beat the XPS 13. Gordon Mah Ung Some may ding the XPS 13 for not changing much but it’s clear the latest one is the best. Join the PC World newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

We know about the declining sales of the iPad and Apple’s seeming inattention to the Mac line as whole in 2016. In turn, that has created some discussion about their respective future developments. John catalogs the likely and not-so-likely roadmaps for these products. What looked like simple evolution has become not so simple. Each of these plans below is someting I’ve read or thought about. They’re in no particular order, but I have assigned a prognosis for each plan. There may be other brilliant plans being cooked up by Apple, but I thought it would interesting to list the most often discussed evolutionary scenarios for macOS, iOS and possible integration. Here we go…. Plan A. “Let it Be.” Or: Survival of the fittest. The Intel-based Macs and iPads are allowed to continue as distinct products. They will evolve to work better and better together, and we’ve seen Apple do that already. But the products remain essentially as they are. Apple will, instead, depend on dramatic improvements in iOS/iPad technologies to stem the decline on iPad sales. Eventually, an inflection point will come when the iPad can do everything the Mac does today. Then, the Mac, without touch capability, fades into history. Downside. Thousands of great macOS apps depend on Intel and Macs. Reference: “Let iPad be iPad: Why making it a traditional computer isn’t the answer,” by Rene Ritchie. Likelihood: Low Plan B. “Here Comes the Sun.” Or: Intel plus ARM. Slowly migrate macOS apps to run on ARM by including low-power but fast ARM processor in all new Macs. macOS and iOS, however, remain distinct. Gradually transition more and more tasks to ARM until an Intel CPU is hardly necessary in, say, five years. It helps reduce Apple’s dependence on Intel.  A possible gateway to Plan D. Reference: “Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel Role,” by Mark Gurman. Likelihood: Moderate Plan C. “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” Or: The Toaster Fridge. Single out MacBooks that have ARM in the lid and Intel under the keyboard. When connected, the system operates as macOS/Intel Mac with low power ARM functions. When the lid is detached, it’s an iPad. Desktop, Intel-based Macs will use and ARM for iOS simulator and other supporting operations. One problem is continued dependence on Intel CPUs. Another is cost, confusion and lack of elegance. Likelihood: Low. Plan D. “Strawberry Fields Forever.” macOS apps run in iOS. New, much larger iPads will have a Rosetta-like system with mouse and other needed frameworks added back in. macOS apps remain Intel-based, run on standard Macs, but can also run on large-display iPads. This continues until Macs and macOS apps fade into history, as with the old Classic apps. This is an attractive option because it avoids a premature obsolescence of the Mac by allowing all those thousands of macOS apps to have new life on the platform of the future, the bigger iPads. It essentially competes with the ground-breaking notion of the Microsoft Surface Studio and buys time for the iPad to evolve. When the iPad reaches technical maturity and can do everything a Mac can, including the role as an iOS development platform, then the Mac can be left behind. In the meantime, macOS apps remain viable. Likelihood: High. This is just the kind of technical brilliance Apple is known for. They did it before with the Classic to Mac OS X and the PowerPC to Intel transition. It combats the Surface Studio nicely. Apple’s dependence on Intel goes away. So there you have it. My four roadmaps for the evolution of macOS and iOS apart or together. What do you think? Have I missed any attractive avenues? Or pitfalls? Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, iOS, iPad, Mac, macOS 3 Comments Add a comment Rick Allen February 14, 2017 John; Love your analysis, yet I think giving option D a “High” mark is a huge stretch. ARM would need would need to up its horsepower either to have a VM environment capable of hosting an x86 modern Mac OS without being dog slow. Rosetta approach might work, yet I feel only if the conversion were pre-bundled in the app bundle and not have to be done on the ARM device itself. February 14, 2017 at 5:21 EST PM geoduck February 14, 2017 Yes, option D is certainly the one I would not be surprised to see Apple follow, and am hoping for. I’ll be sad to see the Mac fade away, but I’ve been dreaming of a true tablet to replace my Mac since I got my iPad 2. However to truly replace the Mac, padOS has to be split off and incorporate functions that both aren’t needed and would be useless on phoneOS. You mentioned a mouse, that’s a good start. Until that happens the iPad just won’t be able to cut it. It has the horsepower now to do nearly everything I want to do. The limit is the OS. February 14, 2017 at 5:23 EST PM John Martellaro February 14, 2017 Rick: A birdie on my shoulder told me that it wouldn’t be very hard to fix up iOS to run macOS apps with mouse and other related support. As for the evolution of the ARM CPUs, supporting a Rosetta-like instruction translator, recall that the A10 in the iPhone 7 can, according to Phil Schiller, process 100 billion operations in 25 milliseconds when processing camera images. If those operations are floating point, that works out to 4 teraflops. This may not apply to other computational tasks, but it gives us a feel for the A10. And I’m thinking the A12 era for Plan D. https://www.wired.com/2016/09/iphone-7-plus-camera/ February 14, 2017 at 7:39 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

This CPU will have the multi-threaded performance of Intel's Core i7-6900K, which costs $1000+ and the gaming performance of a high-end Core i5/i7 CPU.   Belgian online retailer centralpoint.be has listed pricing for the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 - priced at $499, $389, and $319 respectively. The 1700X will feature 8C/16T at up to 3.8GHz for $389, while the Ryzen 7 1700 offers the same 8C/16T with a 65W TDP (95W on the 1800X and 1700X) while the clocks are reduced to 3.7GHz through Turbo, priced at $319.

This latest version of the Blade swaps out the Skylake Core i7-6700HQ for a Kaby Lake Core i7-7700HQ. These two processors are largely the same, however the Kaby Lake model is clocked up to 300 MHz higher, with a 2.80 GHz base clock and 3.80 GHz boost clock, compared to 2.6 and 3.5 GHz previously. This should provide a minor performance improvement in CPU-limited workloads. The rest of the Blade's hardware is the same as before, including the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, 16 GB of RAM, and SSD options that range from 256 GB to 1 TB. The base model includes a 1080p IPS display, although a variant with a 4K touchscreen display will be released in Q2 2017. The upgraded Blade is $100 more expensive than its predecessor, with the base model starting at $1,899 rather than $1,799. It is available starting today from Razer's website, followed by "select retailers" next week ahead of a worldwide launch in March.

And while we don't have specifics on an Australian price or availability, we're starting to get an idea of what AMD's new CPU will look like. The details have since been taken down, but for a brief period Belgian electronics retailer Centralpoint had them online. A cache of the page is still available on Google, however. Digital Trends spotted the listing first, so kudos to them. And if you like their information in a slightly more readable form, here's the full details of what was posted: AMD Ryzen R7 1800X: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.6GHz base speed, 4.0GHz boost speed, 16MB L3 Cache, 95W TDP R7 1800 Pro: 8 cores, 16 threads, 16MB L3 Cache, 95W TDP, rest unstated R7 1700X: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.4 GHz base speed, 3.8 GHz boost speed, 16MB L3 Cache, 95W TDP R7 1700: 65W TDP, rest unstated R7 1700 Pro: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.0GHz base speed, 3.7GHz boost speed, 16MB L3 Cache, 65W TDP The R7 1700 and the R7 1800 Pro presumably have the same base/boost speeds as the X-named variants, although for now we'll leave that one as unconfirmed. Digital Trends also got details on the four and six-core Ryzen R5 chips, as well as the entry level quad-core R3 CPUs. Some synthetic benchmarks featuring Ryzen have leaked online over the last couple of weeks, but the real interesting part will be when games start to get involved. Expect to see more of that pop up in the next week or so. Early March isn't far away now. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

The same will be made available on the Company's website at the following weblink https://www.infosys.com/investors/news-events/events/Documents/chasing-growth-conference-13feb2017.pdf This is for your information and records. Yours sincerely, For Infosys Limited A G S Manikantha Company Secretary Kotak Chasing Growth Conference February 13, 2017 CORPORATE PARTICIPANTs Vishal Sikka Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Moderator: Our next speaker is Dr. Vishal Sikka. Dr. Vishal Sikka is the current CEO and Managing Director of Infosys, a globally recognized innovative and business leader in the IT Services Industry. Dr. Sikka was born and raised in India. He studied Computer Science at Syracuse University before receiving his Ph.D. in AI Stanford in 1996. After a very long successful stint at SAP in 2014, he joined Infosys as CEO to help drive a massive transformation not only at Infosys but also within the larger IT services industry. In the last two and half years since he took over, his vision and leadership has helped accelerate Infosys transformation resulting into growth of their global work force to almost 2 lakh people. There was a massive reduction in attrition, doubling of large deal total contract value, number of large clients and industry leading cash flows generation with revenues of $9.5 billion despite strong headwinds. Infosys new software and new services has seen tremendous growth as well. Client satisfaction levels are accordingly at the highest levels ever, particularly at the CXO segment which according to Infosys Annual Survey showed 22 points increase.  May I invite Dr. Vishal Sikka to talk about Infosys and the future of IT Services Dr. Vishal Sikka: Thank you so much. That was quite a handful introduction. Hi, Mr. Kotak. Good to see all of you. Uday has asked me to organize my talk in two sections. In the first part I want to talk about our performance and financial metrics that most of you care a lot about and then following I want to spend some time looking at the bigger picture. I hope to finish this speech itself in another 25 minutes and then leave around half an hour for your questions.     Two and half years ago, when I started, we laid out a relatively straight forward strategy. The idea was to launch a three-part strategy of renewing the core business entering into new businesses and the culture of the company. And the interesting part about this three-part strategy was also that it reflects the challenges of our clients the challenges of business that they have this dual priority of only one hand getting better at everything that they did and on the other hand doing new things that they never did before. In this, they have their own timeless culture and value system that they operate on. So, if we look over the last two and half years, the execution that we have followed on this path is starting to show signs of success. I will quickly walk you through some of these metrics. The relative revenue performance compared to the industry has distinctly improved. When I joined, our revenue was significantly below the industry. It has now got up towards the top of the industry, or certainly in line with the industry. Year-on-year if you compare the first three quarters of this financial year to the last one, you see the performance there and despite the challenging environment, we have managed to keep the operating margin steady. If you look at many of the operational parameters of our business the core business utilization for the last seven quarters has been above 80% which is for the first time in a very long time in our company. The employee cost as a percentage of revenue has come down. You can see the operating cash flow as percentage of net profit is getting close to 100%. The onsite we can still do better but the subcon costs are something that are continually improving. I know a lot of you have questions around the visa policies and things like this, we can talk about that in the Q&A but our endeavor has been to get closer to the 30% number. In terms of the core business, IT services continue to grow through a dedicated focus on renewing our existing services through a combination of automation and innovation as well as mixing our portfolio increasingly towards more high value, value add kind of services. One area of disappointment for us has been the consulting business. We continue to focus on this over the course this year. The negative performance of consulting in Q1 impacted us more than we expected. Products, platforms and other areas of the business also continue to grow and here is a different cut on that. If you look from the time when I started to last quarter, revenue per quarter has grown by more than $400 million per quarter.  While the margin is same from 25.1% to 25.1%, operating profits has gone up from $536 million to $640 million. Attrition has come down significantly from 23.4% at a group level in the quarter when I joined to now a little bit below 15%. There is a separate attrition metric that we have started to internally focus on over the last year which is high performer attrition and that number has come down significantly to single-digits. Revenue per FTE is one of the key metrics of our strategy. While it has decreased compared to when I started, it has in the last couple of quarters started to go back up and that is something we are very happy about. One key part of the strategy is the new software. When we talk about renew and new, there are new services in unprecedented new areas and there are also new software that we did not have before. Excluding Finacle, the software revenue in the quarter when I started was $35 million a quarter and that number has already gone up to $60 million now. The $100 million accounts went up from 12 to 18. $200 million accounts have doubled from 3 to 6 in that time. Organizationally Pravin and I have established a strong team around us. Jayesh is here, our Deputy CFO. Similarly, we have appointed Ravi as our Deputy COO. There are three Presidents responsible for our go to market. Below their level we have established 15 industry heads to create much more focused small encapsulated empowered business units, so that client focus and agility can be achieved and it is the best way for us to achieve scale. Similarly, we have been making a lot of progress and Pravin oversees this on simplifying our internal policies, systems and process so that we can become much more agile. So, when we look at this in the broader context of the strategy, beyond the numbers you can clearly see that on all the three dimensions of strategy things have been taking hold. One program that I am particularly proud of, I am approaching it since two years, next month it is going to be two years since we started it, is the Zero Distance. It has been deeply engrained into our company's culture. More than 95% of the projects of the company have Zero Distance plans. The idea of Zero Distance for those of you who do not know about it, is it inspires our project team to bring innovation in every single project no matter what. The number is actually 100% and the projects that do not have a Zero Distance plan are the ones that just started recently. So, if you look at the Zero Distance plans of project that started more than six weeks ago, it is 100%. Every project is basically covered by Zero Distance project and it has become a part of the culture. For the last nine months or so, we have been focusing on elevating the Zero Distance innovation idea where project teams think of bigger innovations. The CWRF is a tribute to Martin Luther King's quote that, "If you cannot fly we must run, if you cannot run we must walk, if you cannot walk we must crawl, but we have to always keep moving forward" and so we have this framework of most of the Zero Distance innovations, even though we are close to 100%, are quite incremental quite small and so our endeavor now is to elevate these towards more and more transformative innovation for our clients coming from the grass root.     Zero Bench, which was the other initiative that we launched in July of 2015 that also reached close to 100%. So basically, everyone on the bench has done a Zero Bench project. We have now more than 34,000 jobs on our internal market place. 470 jobs show up every week on this and it has touched basically everybody on the bench. As I mentioned earlier, one of the direct impacts of Zero Bench is giving the youngsters an opportunity to get some experience by working on a Zero Bench project. That experience then makes it easier for them to get into production. So, Zero Bench has had a direct impact on the utilization, especially on the fresher utilization. The utilization is above 80% consistently now, but in particular the fresher utilization and off-shore utilization has gone up directly as a result of Zero Bench. The renewal of our existing core business, in particular the maintenance and run parts of the business but also to some degree the build parts of the business is impacted by automation. I mentioned, in the earnings in January that more than 2,600 people over the course of Q3 were saved but 2,650 FTE worth of effort was eliminated with automation. Over the last 12 months that number has crossed 8,000. The Mana platform plays a very important role in helping us achieve that automation. All 8,500 is not due to Mana but Mana for IT has a huge impact on bringing automation led productivity improvements to our work. And within our core business, we have launched many new services like the Mainframe Modernization, the API Economy, BI Renewal, the work with Salesforce.com, ServiceNow, etc. Roughly 10 or so of these have launched in the last couple of years and they have all been showing growth that is faster than the growth in the company. As a result of all of this, the client satisfaction, a survey done since last 12 years, has demonstrated the highest ever score this time. In particular, as you said in the introduction, the CXO satisfaction has jumped up by 22 points.      So, I am quite proud of the work that our team has done in renewing our core business. When you look at new, getting into new dimensions of business is something that should come easily to us. When you create something new, you do that but culturally and organizationally new is much more difficult to pull off because it is not just enough to create a separate appendage that is sitting somewhere else and doing something totally independent. You have to find a way to make these harmonious. The idea of 'Renew and New' comes from Arthur Koestler's word on creation, this idea of two habitually distinct but self-consistent frames of preference where you are doing something unprecedented in the new dimension, whereas you are continuously improving in the existing dimension. We have seen continued strong momentum in the three acquisitions that we have made Skava, Panaya and Noah, as well as the new services that we have launched organically. One of the things that we are very proud of Skava, is that beyond retail Skava has now entered into other industries in particular financial services, telecommunication, and utility. We have opened new frontiers with Skava and our home-grown Mana platform. Mana helps us renew our services in particular in maintenance and run areas. The same Mana platform also has huge applications in helping our clients build breakthrough business application of artificial intelligence. I think, having a common platform that does both is extremely important to our strategy. A lot of people in the industry build captive automation capabilities in service of their own business. When we do that, the platform would not be competitive. You have to ensure that the platform that is powering the productivity improvement of the existing business is a world class platform. Therefore, it is important to have this platform subjected to the outside world, to the light of the outside. Building breakthrough business applications on Mana is a very-very critical part of the strategy. I am really excited by what our teams are doing, what our clients are doing, all the way from CPG companies using it for revenue reconciliation and financial consolidation much faster to companies in the pharmaceutical industry, working on much better forecasting, using Mana for contract management and compliance to contracts to dynamic fraud analysis for banks and applications like that.  From new services dimension, our digital services as well as the strategic design consulting services are things that have been going forward quite well. One key part of our strategy is the cultural dimension and there are two main parts to that. One is the agility of the company as a whole and the other one is education. Infosys always had a very strong emphasis on education. Mr. Murthy always talked about this. The idea of learnability, the ability to learn. Especially in the times ahead, learnability is going to be a very critical thing for our future. So, when you look at all the work that we do in culture dimension, it is dominated by this. ILP, the Infosys Learning Platform that is our own platform to very immersively teach our fresher as well as our regular employees what is going on in the world around in a very immersive way. We drop them into boot camps, into projects and into sub-sets of the projects, so they are learning in a much more accelerated way. We have done a lot of innovation in learning itself and how people learn and so forth and brought that into ILP. One of the most interesting program that we have done is for our top 200 executives. We have done a global leadership program together with Stanford and we have now done three cohorts of this. Some of the Infoscions and the senior executive who go through this, have said that this is the best thing they have done in their entire Infosys career. This is a two-and-a-half-week program or distributed over a year which is done together with the Stanford Business School, and the Stanford School of Engineering and Design School. It has a huge impact on changing the perspective of our management team.  As well as we have been investing in on-site learning and I think more and more as we focus on-site creating on-site environment for learning is going to be critical. Design thinking training has become an integral part of being at Infosys. We have now more than 130,000 Infoscion who have been trained on design thinking. By the end of this year I expect that we will be able to train everyone in the company on design thinking and similarly training in artificial intelligence, agile methodologies, and in all manner of new technologies is something that we continue to invest in. In a nutshell, two and half years going from $8.2 billion in revenue or so to now we just crossed $10 billion on a LTM basis, continued protection of margins and continued to ensure that we have strong margins. That is the philosophy of consistent profitable growth. Improvement in revenue per employee despite the pressure, the commoditization, improvement in the attrition and the sense of inspiration among the employees is growing into completely new dimensions. We are now achieving new scale in the new dimensions and highest client satisfaction ever. That is basically in a nutshell from a performance point of view where we are. As I look at the journey ahead, as happy as I am looking backwards to the last two and half years, the journey ahead is even more challenging and even more interesting one. Here is a quote from my friend Bill Ruh of GE. He will be here day after tomorrow talking at the NASSCOM Event. We have been doing some amazing work together on bringing design thinking and new kinds of solutions, co-innovation, to their platform. Here is a quote from the Head of HR and the Head of Technology for Visa on how we have helped establish a dramatic new culture as well as doing our traditional services. Visa has been one of our fastest growing accounts over the last two years and it is something that we are particularly proud of.     So as I said, as good as it is to look backwards and feel good about this dimensions of improvement that we have managed to achieve, the world around us is growing through a very rapid transformation. I want to switch gears a little bit and share with you some thoughts on what I see happening in the world around us. It is difficult to capture what is going on in a nutshell, but it basically has three dimensions. A very deep rooted sense of end user centricity. When you look at retail or banking or insurance or communications and telco and so forth. In any industry there is a very deep rooted sense in which things are becoming more connected. A continuous connection to the end user and serving end user needs has never been more important. These experiences are now increasingly becoming digital but they are also being powered by AI technology.  Underneath this enablement of the new experience is the intelligent infrastructure. It is governed by this exponential laws. I am calling it Moore's Laws, I know it is Moore's Law but I am calling it Moore's Laws because there are many of the similar laws not only in the performance improvement or cost performance improvement of processors but in many other dimensions of technology. We see these exponential price performance improvement. As a result of that, computing is becoming far more pervasive and that is all enabling and extreme efficiency of disinter-mediating existing industry.    If we look into this in a little bit more detail, here are three projects done by our strategic design consulting team. I mentioned, in the new dimension of our strategy, this one service that we offer where we co-innovate with our clients on things that are the most important to their future. On the right-hand side is a 3D printed fully functioning replica of a low fidelity model of a GE engine that is an aircraft engine. The entire engine is 3D printed and with a Microsoft HoloLens, you can deeply examine the operational behavior of this engine. You can go back and change its design parameters, tune its design parameters and you can do predictive maintenance on it. All of that in real time. It actually has the potential to dramatically accelerate the lifecycle of these engines to dramatically redesign the nature of maintenance and repair on these engines. And also make the entire machine far more connected and far more intelligent, as it goes through its lifecycle. In the middle, you see a project that we have done with a very large agriculture company. This is a digital farm that we have built. Our team actually builds the farm. It is not only a digital farm, but it is a highly affordable digital farm that can be put together with extremely cheap components and it makes the plant itself connected. Supply of nutrient, supply of water, supply of light to the plants can be controlled thousands of times more effectively than in traditional agriculture. Instead of supplying water once a day or twice a day you can supply it two thousand times in a day by milliliters individually to the plant. The CEO of this company have told me that Vishal if you are able to do this, if you are able to connect into the plant itself, we will be able to improve agricultural yield by 30%. What we found in our experience was that some of the plants actually grow 10x faster than in the normal conditions, not only 30%. The entire Green Revolution that happened in our lifetimes, in my lifetime here in India, was at 22% improvement in agricultural yield. So, you can imagine what kind of a revolution this can create. On the left hand side is actually a store that we have built for one of our luxury retail client and this is an entire store that looks like a store from 1850's but it is completely digital. Every aspect of the store, every part of this is digital. It is like a complete room, it is a large computer that is programmable, those mirrors and the coat hangers, and the closets, and everything that you see is all completely digital. The mirror turns on when you put on a coat. It knows what coat it is. You can see yourself in different circumstances and things of this nature. So, all industries are going through this deep transformation because of a very deep rooted understanding of users enabled by a pervasive connectivity and pervasive computing. This is powered by Moore's Laws rapid advance. Moore's Law this year is going to be 52 years old,   two years older than me. It is one of the extraordinary feats of human engineering achievement. Many people say that Moore's Laws is reaching its end. It is true that traditional Moore's Laws is reaching its end. On the upper right, you see a 7 nanometer wafer that DFMC has started to produce on a non-production scale yet. In early 2018, they will go production on 7 nanometers. When I spent summer at Intel working in the Intel AI Lab in 1990, I remember the micron process was going live, that was 1,000 nanometers. When I was building HANA at SAP we were at 22 nanometers process of Intel. Now it is down to 7 nanometers. This is an extraordinary thing. Of course, the reason people say that Moore's Laws is going to end is that 7 nanometers is getting already pretty close to physical scale. There are two silicon atoms in 1 nanometer, so at 7 nanometers you are basically at the width of 14 or so silicon atoms. So, there is not much more that you can get out of this. Probably by 2022, 2023 we will have 4 nanometers, 5 nanometer process but that is as far as it will grow. But then other things are happening. On the left-hand side in the middle you see the neuromorphic board that has already been made by Jenn Hasler at Georgia Tech. These neuromorphic boards are ways of bypassing the traditional CMOS manufacturing process and going into new kinds of chip design. So therefore, some other new way continuing Moore's Laws is going to continue post 2024.   On the bottom middle you see the Nvidia AI Box that has 170 teraflops box of computing in it, two Intel processors of 20 cores and 12 or so of these Tesla GPU chips inside it. This is already shipping, a lot of the deep learning algorithms run on this kind of path. And then of course on the bottom right you see this incredible growth that our partner AWS have had. That is a data center picture of a part of the datacenter of Amazon. They have dozens of datacenter, each one between 50,000 servers and 80,000 servers and collectively somewhere between 3 million servers to 5 million servers in AWS. This is an astonishingly large amount of computing capacity and AWS has seen 40%-45% growth in the last 12 months. So, what we see is that this entire digitization and AI revolution is being powered by computing that is simply exploding. Even though the traditional Moore's Laws is nearing a trend in the next seven-eight years, the new kind of architectures and new kinds of technologies is going to ensure that we are going to grow significantly further beyond that. As a result, new AI technologies are becoming possible. We all heard about this AlphaGo from Google last year that beat the world champion Go player. Recently the news came out that some students from CMU have put together a Poker playing robot. Now, why was Go significant last year, because Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in the middle of 90's. That was more or less a Brute Search computational capability exercise because the computer can look ahead in the Chess moves much more than the human brain can. Go is a different kind of a game. The computational complexity of Go is much worse then of Chess. With AlphaGo they were able to overcome that by bringing learning into that. A new frontier has been broken. Poker is based on human intuition, on deception, on bluffing and things like this. It actually has beaten four of the top Poker players continuously and has earned something like $1.7 million as a Poker player online. So, this is quite an interesting development. On the left-hand side, you see the autonomous car from Toyota which actually learns the driver's behavior as you drive the car and adjust itself to that. So, this is a great advancement that has happened in autonomous driving. Udacity has a car that is fully programmable by the students of Udacity who take the autonomous driving car class on Udacity. On the right-hand side is open AI which is a consortium of research in artificial intelligence in the public good. I am very proud that we, at Infosys are one of the sponsors of open AI. Universe is a package that the open AI team has released recently. It has now 45 world class researchers and they are really doing some amazing work in artificial intelligence. As a result of all of this, basically what we see, that it becomes much easier for a new comer to come in and disrupt in industry. Big parts of the supply chain and of the value chain can be disrupted and can be digitized. The world of atoms where we have been coming from, has huge numbers of intermediary. As digitization and computing replaces these atoms with bits, you can see that the value chain can be much more connected and can be much more zero distance. It can be much more efficient as a result of that, both in terms of pricing and in terms of production. So, this is what is going on. As a result of that, when we look at the journey ahead for us, a lot more needs to be done. I studied artificial intelligence as a graduate student. There are two pieces of research that our team picked out. One is from McKenzie that was done a few months ago, going through various kinds of jobs and the potential of automation in those jobs. The other is the impact of automation in the IT BPO industry, in our industry, that was done by HFS Research recently. And you can see that India, according to this study has the biggest impact of jobs among all of these countries. There are dozens of studies like this. If you research you can find out that recently, couple of weeks ago McKenzie Global published another one and Eric Reynoldson and Andy have done something. There are dozens and dozens of reports on automation. But really all you have to do is walk into any one of our floors at any company in the IT BPO industry and it becomes starkly clear as you walk around the floor that a huge number of these jobs are going to go away. It may not be two years it might be four years, five years, seven years, ten years, but there is no doubt that these jobs are going to be replaced with automation. So, what do we do? What is the nature of the journey that we are on? My sense is that there is only one way forward. Professor Mashelkar use to have this beautiful line "doing more with less for more" that is basically the nature of the endeavor. If you look at the complexity of human activity and plot that against time, the natural course of event is that we have to constantly be moving upward.  That journey upwards is not only a journey upwards, it is actually accelerating.     There is a very straight forward duality that we have to follow. On one hand, we have to eliminate our work through automation and improve our productivity while on the other hand we have to deploy that improved productivity towards innovation. This is basically the formula. The reason for automation is so that we can continue to do the work that has already been commoditized more efficiently and more productively and used that improvement in productivity, become more innovative to do the new kinds of things for which there is still tremendous opportunity and tremendous value. Self-driving car engineered today is worth millions of dollars. What if we were able to produce a hundred thousand self-driving autonomous driving engineers? This continues productivity improvement but actually shifting continuously from things that are commoditizing towards things that are innovative is the basic point that has to be fueled by education. This idea that we study for the first 21 years of our life and then we do not study any more, we have to abandon this idea because technology will continually change. So we have to continuously re-skill ourselves. Thankfully we at Infosys have a tremendous advantage on this because we have always had a culture of learnability like I said. So, the fueling of this automation and innovation journey on the basis of education is the key. The other basis is software. It is the intellectual property. If all we did was moving upwards on the basis of education, which alone will also become commoditized over time. Therefore, we have to take advantage of this improving productivity using software, using our software, software that is monetized. Instead of 10 people doing something if you now get that same thing done with three people, if you do not have your own software to do the work of the remaining seven then you are losing value and somebody else who made that software is capturing that value. Therefore, that software has to be monetizable. But for that software to be monetizable, it is software that has to be world class. It is software that has to withstand the test of outside world. It cannot just be a captive thing that you do only for yourself. So, having software together with education powering this transformation is something that is critical for our future. This is why the same Mana platform applies to the renewal of our services and for the breakthrough new business solution. This is the reason why education for our traditional services as well as in the breakthrough new areas is something that is critical. So this in essence is the nature of our journey in the future. John McCarthy the father of artificial intelligence once said, in a lecture that "articulating a problem is half the solution". That lecture changed the course of my life. Within our lifetimes, we are going to see AI Technology and get to the point where a well-articulated problem, a well-specified problem will be solved automatically. The human frontier at that point is going to be problem finding, creativity, the ability to look at a situation and see what is not there, to see what is missing, see what can be innovated, that is our future. One way or the other it is going to happen. When I look at 3.7 million people in our industry the only future I see is a future that is fueled by automation and getting ahead of this curve of automation. I see the future where the automation enables us to be more innovative to exercise our creativity, to exercise our ability and to find problems, not only solve them. If we do that we will be okay, if we do not we will get disrupted. This is the journey that I see in front of us. So, I do not know how long I went on, Uday. We laid out a clear strategy. We have seen signs of early success but the world is going through a very rapid change driven by AI and Technology. Much more is still to be done to lead in the next generation of IT and with focused execution we will do it. Thank you. Moderator:                Thank you, Mr. Sikka. Okay, we have the first question already. Participant:                Very nice presentation. My first question is that, how much of the value in this transformation will be captured by the software versus the services company? I understand that Infosys is trying to adopt software plus services model but when you look at the overall value chain it is the software company that are gaining bigger and bigger share of the overall value in this transformation. Dr. Vishal Sikka:       Our core business is services. We are a services company. But it is the software just like there is software-defined networking and software-defined datacenter and software-defined in retail and similarly there is software-defined services. So, we are talking about amplifying our services ability through the use of software, through the use of automation and by moving up in the value chain. So it is both, the value of the software itself will be there but it is more in services, where the real power will come from. And you see that in the numbers already. The productivity improvement in the first nine months of this financial year, compared to the first nine months of the last financial year. Last financial year in the first nine months we hired 17,500 people, this financial year's first nine months we hired something like 5,500 people, and yet we improved utilization, we improved revenue and RPE and so on and so forth. So, more with less for more, powered by software and education. Participant:                The second question that I have is something which is on top of everyone's mind, that how is your relationship with the founders and what does it mean for Infosys? Vishal Sikka:             My relationship with the founders, it is wonderful. I meet Mr. Murthy quite frequently. I do not meet the other founders quite as frequently. I ran into Kris the other day in a Lufthansa flight and I have not seen Nandan for more than a year. But it is an amazing relationship. I have a heartfelt warm relationship with Mr. Murthy. I probably meet him four, five, six times a year, something like this. He is an incredible man, we usually talk about quantum physics and things like this and technology. He was telling me the other day about the Paris metro and how he worked on the Paris metro in the 1970s before he started Infosys. It had this whole idea of automation of autonomous driving and things like this. So, all this drama that has been doing on in the media, it is very distracting. It takes our attention, but underneath that there is a very strong fabric that this company is based on and it is a real privilege for me to be its leader. Participant:                Hi Vishal, great presentation. I was curious if you could talk about, from your personal experiences over the last two and a half years, you have been turning around a really large ship. What have been your deepest personal experiences, what have been most difficult to accomplish, what have been easy to accomplish? And in light of that, if you think I were to ask the same question from the leaders of the smaller mid-tier IT services companies, what do you think they would likely say? Vishal Sikka:             The second question I cannot answer. Compared to two and a half years ago, to me, it is disappointing to see the rate of growth and embrace of automation in the industry. I think more should have been done by now, but that is my opinion. When it comes to Infosys, it has actually been quite counter intuitive. I would not have imagined that zero distance would get picked up the way it did. One month after I started, I think September or October of 2014, this customer satisfaction survey came out, and it was incredibly depressing. I actually got the details of customers, the client's feedback, it was a pile of paper that thick, and I read it over a period of one month. I read every single one of them. Consistently it was the same story that we used to get high marks on quality, on delivery excellence, on being responsive, being professional. And we would get the lowest scores on strategic relevance, on innovation, on being proactive, and it was a shock to me that that was the case. So, a lot of the ideas for Zero Distance formed in those four, five months, and by March of 2015 I launched it. Within nine months we had managed to create a very grass roots oriented culture around that. Recently, Ravi, our Head of Delivery, was talking to some youngsters and they told him that it is not a new thing for us anymore, we just assume that it is a part of our job to come up with something innovative in whatever project that we are doing. That to me has been the biggest positive. The bringing of design thinking at a very massive scale has been surprisingly easy because of the scale. This comes from Mr. Murthy, the scale that was setup for education employees. The new, it is always difficult to embrace the new. So, I think bringing new in, in particular, letting go of your existing way of doing things and embracing. If a piece of software automates the work that you do, then embracing that piece of software and letting go of some of the manual work. It is something that is visible to you, that is something that is very difficult for people to do, and so that has been a hard thing. Some things that I thought were going to be much easier have turned out to be not so easy, some that I thought would be difficult have turned out to be much easier than I thought. Participant:                In your Vision 2020, where we are in that journey? Would inorganic be a big component of it, how products will contribute? And given the recent noise in media, how confident you are seeing through that journey? Vishal Sikka: How confident am I of what? Participant:                Of achieving that vision? Vishal Sikka: See, that $20 billion, 30%, $80,000 revenue per employee, has always been an aspiration for us. What good is an aspiration if it is not aspirational? So, we are marching down that path. When you launch something like training people on design thinking, you cannot say that we will get 100,000 people trained in the next one year or two years, you have to setup a grassroots movement and then let it go and see what happens. When you do it like that, usually it surprises you. These numbers are a consequence of the work that we do, they are not that you figure out some way to get to that number. You do the right thing and then if you do the right thing, these numbers are the footprint that we leave behind. They are the consequences of the work that we do. So, this is how we look at it. Where are we on this journey? We are still early in this journey, we still have a lot of things to deal with, we have to get the consulting endeavor right, and we have to get BPO transformed. If we talk about the Infosys transformation as a whole, BPO transformation is even more difficult because it is even lower in the ranks and the skill levels and things like this. Many of the software assets have to still be transformed, like Finacle and so forth. We are still in the early stages of that. But generally, in the renewal of the code services and the adoption of the new services, I feel very good about where we are. So now as we look ahead to the future, a new financial year is starting and so forth. We are going through this exercise of trying to think about what does the journey ahead looks like. Taking stock of the last two and a half years and figuring out what the path ahead is going to look like in terms of both the software as well as the services, and the services amplified by software and so on. Participant:                How big would be the inorganic component? Moderator:                I have to stop you, one question. Because we are running out of time. I am going to come to this side of the hall and then back to you sir. Participant:                Vishal, I understand that you are going through two huge transitions or transformations we are going to call it. One on the technology side where you articulated your walk through on floor, half the jobs would not be there in five years. On the other side, you are going through a cultural transition or transformation, a founder run company that moved in to your hands and the obvious changes that play out. I am sure this is creating a bunch of insecurity at the organization level through the different ranks. So two questions here, how do you communicate, what do you communicate through the ranks to ensure that people are calm and focused on the job. And the second is, what are the two or three key pieces of your strategy? As you are saying, two of our key foundation stones are moving around and we are probably shaking a bit. How do you make sure you anchor the ship better and navigate through this? Vishal Sikka:             I think continuous and intense communication is very important across different parts of the organization and so on. That is something that cannot be overstated. You need to just communicate, communicate and communicate. And in our case it is not easy because the onsite employees are difficult to communicate to. They are inside their client context and so forth. So it is not so straightforward. The other part of it is that you have to demonstrate by example, talk is cheap but you have to really demonstrate in work that you are focused, that you are ignoring the noise and the distractions and so forth, and continuing to stay engaged. That is something, there are natural latencies that our brains have and there is not much you can do about that. I think that organizational change, organizational transformation is important. A lot of people would say that why go through this exercise of taking the leadership team through two years of a Stanford program and things like that, instead of just changing the leadership team. But if you change the leadership team then what happens to the layers below. You create a complete disruption, and not to mention you missed the point of transformation that is supposed to happen. So, I think that creating a context, creating an atmosphere which elevates everybody is something that is exceedingly important. Elan Kay says that context is worth 80 IQ points. So, if we build a real context around us that elevates everybody and can have the biggest transformative effect that takes time. The benefit of that approach is that it is very sustainable, long-term, lasting approach. The drawback is that it takes time. It is easy to plant a company here or there, buy some companies, put them inside and hire some leaders and put them inside, but that is like appendages growing out of control out of you. That is not sustained, organic transformation in the true sense. Moderator:                We have time exactly for one more brief question and one more brief answer. So try and keep your question as brief as you can. Participants:              My question is on buyback. Some of the founders have said that they have written letters to the Board on this issue and they have not heard anything. Just your views on how you plan to utilize the cash? Vishal Sikka:             The official answer is the Board from time to time will consider capital allocation policies. In the last four years we have reviewed twice, we have improved dividend payout, once from 30% to 40% and then again from 40% to 50%. When we have something to report, we will report it. Jayesh, did I miss something? Did I do a good job? Jayesh Sanghrajka:  Yes. Vishal Sikka:             But that was an official answer. The unofficial answer is that you look at the business circumstances over the next four, five years and then you look at what you need the capital for. Then based on that you decide. We will do that as necessary. In our case, it is basically three things, there are strategic growth initiatives, and there is a capital for buildings and infrastructure and so forth to house the employees. Then there is the investments, the acquisitions. I am not interested in buying yesterday's technology to make something or the other look good. We are interested in tomorrow's technology. And tomorrow's technology is usually expensive if it is really good. So, you have to be very, very selective in that. Based on how that mix changes over the next five years and based on that you take a decision on how to utilize the cash. We have done this with 50% so far and as we go through this exercise we will take a look at it. Nobody asked about visas or Donald Trump etc Moderator:                Would you like to Suo Moto answer the question about Visas and Donald Trump? Vishal Sikka:             No, there is nothing that has happened so far. Moderator:                Okay. I am afraid that concludes our session. Thank you, Dr. Sikka. Thank you for being a very responsive audience. This is a disclosure announcement from PR Newswire.

(Photo credit: MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)    Report: Intel Community Is Withholding Information From Trump Rachel Stoltzfoos Reporter 9:47 PM 02/15/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5485309 The intelligence community is withholding sensitive information from President Trump over concerns he cannot be trusted with the information, The Wall Street Journal reports. Current and former officials told TheWSJ they are concerned about Trump’s ties with Russia and the level of support he publicly expressed for Vladimir Putin during the presidential campaign, and said the intelligence community is worried some of the information they give Trump could be leaked or compromised. The decision to withhold certain information suggests a deep level of mistrust within the agencies toward Trump, and the leak underscores the developing narrative of a major rift between Trump and the intelligence community. Trump has at times praised and bashed the intelligence community in recent months. He blamed them Wednesday for leaking the news about Michael Flynn that led to his resignation. (RELATED: How The Nation’s Spooks Played The Game ‘Kill Mike Flynn’) Officials told TheWSJ the withheld information was not crucial information about national security threats, and was in some cases regarding the sources and methods of the information. Agencies have withheld similar information from past presidents, the story notes, but not because they deemed those presidents untrustworthy. The White House told TheWSJ they have seen nothing leading them to believe the report is an “accurate account of what is actually happening.” John Schindler reported the intelligence community was withholding information from Trump in the Observer Sunday, writing extensively about what he called “the spy revolt” against the president. “None of this has happened in Washington before,” he wrote, referring to the cloud of uncertainty regarding Trump’s relationship to Russia. “A White House with unsettling links to Moscow wasn’t something anybody in the Pentagon or the Intelligence Community even considered a possibility until a few months ago. Until Team Trump clarifies its strange relationship with the Kremlin, and starts working on its professional honesty, the IC will approach the administration with caution and concern.” Follow Rachel on Twitter Send tips to rachel@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

 $1 TRILLION WEALTH MANAGER: Invest in America now Tom Naratil, UBS Feb. 12, 2017, 8:41 AM 15,473 facebook linkedin twitter email print U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Before taking office last month, President Trump said that his administration will follow the rule of “buy American and hire American.” To make success more likely, we must add “invest American.” While anticipated reforms to spur growth can be complex and take time, today we have an immediate opportunity to grow the economy, driven by rising optimism and a willingness among investors and small businesses to put their cash to work. Let’s build on those sentiments and provide reasons to invest in America through incentives, by removing structural impediments, and by focusing on areas that have both the most need and the most interest from investors. In the United States, UBS manages more than $1 trillion of our clients' assets. We speak to investors daily and frequently gauge their feelings about the U.S. economy and prospects for growth. According to our most recent Investor Watch survey of high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals*, their optimism about the U.S. economy has increased dramatically since the presidential election. A majority of these investors are actively looking for opportunities in the market, with 42% looking to add to their equity portfolios. Meanwhile, our survey of business owners revealed that they are twice as likely to increase investment and hiring in their businesses than to scale back. When you consider these sentiments, along with widely held expectations globally for continued U.S. economic outperformance, the signs of demand for growth are encouraging. Tom Naratil, President Wealth Management Americas and President Americas, UBS REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Let’s be clear that both investors and business owners we spoke with still have a number of concerns. Individual investors continue to express apprehension over the political environment in Washington. Small business owners are chiefly worried about employee healthcare costs, taxes, and regulations. Yet despite those issues, and after an extended period of uncertainty, both groups overwhelmingly indicate that they are ready to get off the sidelines and begin making the kind of decisions that will positively impact the economy. Business and political leaders should be doing everything we can to listen and respond. The challenge, in this polarized political climate, is deciding how to make the most of this momentum. Today, there is a great deal of effort and political capital being spent on pushing more complex policy changes that will take time, such as overhauling the politically-sensitive Affordable Care Act or wholesale tax code reform. Instead, why not pursue "quick wins” on issues where there is more likely to be common ground across the political spectrum? Doing so will make a strong case for investing in the U.S. economy right now, while also building the institutional, bipartisan muscle memory that is necessary to address the long pole items like improving ACA. Investors and business owners suggest two specific areas where policymakers can break the persistent legislative gridlock and make meaningful progress. Residents inspect a washed-out section of collapsed road after Hurricane Matthew hit the state, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Reuters/Jonathan Drake The first is the continued enthusiasm for infrastructure investment. The American Society of Civil Engineers sees a $1.4 trillion funding gap by 2025 to improve key infrastructure, with mass transit facing the largest shortfall. Encouragingly, there is bipartisan consensus that infrastructure investment—particularly when leveraging private capital—is one of the single best ways to put people to work and to grow the economy. The federal government has a powerful opportunity to shape incremental tax policy that creates incentives for investors to take on more risk from these projects, encouraging private capital to amplify the effect of its own spending. The second area is scientific and medical research. Despite the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, the U.S. share of global medical research funding has declined by nearly 25% since 2004, according to the American Medical Association. Investors see this as an opportunity with economic upside and clear societal benefits through research that unlocks new cures and treatments for diseases and chronic ailments. Here again, tax policy can help drive investment in early-stage commercial research projects that would help satisfy investor appetites while addressing a vital need. These are just two areas where investors tell us that they see opportunity, and which also provide a boost to the economy and more broadly felt benefits. In the coming months, we will surely see a number of bruising legislative battles waged. But if lawmakers can prioritize policies that can be passed in short order, the wider economy will feel the effects much sooner and with the potential for greater long-term growth. Investors are eager to deploy their capital, and the federal government should recognize its role in making that possible. America will be stronger as a result.

Y’know, Moore’s law and all that. Now though, it’s going for “process - architecture - optimisation”, a three-year cycle that’ll mean smaller gains, but still plenty to get excited about for anyone upgrading. This year’s chips aren’t about to blow holes in benchmark leaderboards or crank out unbeatable overclocks - but you should still be excited that Razer’s sticking them in its Blade laptops. Because Kaby Lake uses a slightly updated manufacturing process, each chip can squeeze out a few extra megahertz without draining a whole lot more power. That means you’ll get slightly better performance, and won’t spend as long plugged into the mains between charges. The Blade is also getting faster DDR4 memory, and finally gets a 4K touchscreen display option - the first time a UHD panel has wormed its way inside the 14in laptop. READ NEXT: Review: Asus GL502VS with GeForce GTX 1070 That brings it on par with the smaller Blade Stealth, which has had a 4K touchscreen option since launch. It should be ideal for image and video editing, and means you’ll be able to get your game on at 4K resolutions without having to plug into an external monitor, although that might be asking a lot of the GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card. The 14in Blade is one of the skinniest gaming-grade notebooks around. The all-metal black chassis is basically an inverted MacBook Pro, complete with super-speed Thunderbolt connections and a nifty colour-changing keyboard. The updated Blade is on sale through Razer’s online store right now, with prices starting from $2799 here in Australia.

The national security columnist also quoted a senior intelligence official telling him that Trump “will die in jail.” “Now we go nuclear. [Intelligence community] war going to new levels. Just got an [email from] from senior [intelligence community] friend, it began: ‘He will die in jail,'” Schindler tweeted. The Observer columnist has for months taken a strong stance against Trump. He recently wrote an article called “The Spy Revolt Against Trump Begins.” (RELATED: Rep King: Leakers In Intel Community Have To Be ‘Purged’) This came after President Trump angrily tweeted about continued leaks to major media outlets. “Information is being illegally given to the failing [New York Times] & [Washington Post] by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia,” Trump wrote. (RELATED: Journalists Go Nuts Over Rehashed New York Times Story) Schindler received heat for his tweet suggesting a coup by the intelligence community. ABC News chief foreign correspondent Terry Moran tweeted, “If this source is for real, talk of a ‘Deep State’ coup aren’t insane. [The president] will ‘die in jail’? Who do you think you are?” The former NSA analyst stood by his comment and said, “Surprisingly, some US spies consider [the president] colluding with [Russian intelligence services] + Kremlin, [including] election theft, to be kinda treason-y.” Tags: Donald Trump, John Schindler, leaks Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Nunes said the probe should focus not on Flynn's conversation with a Russian diplomat prior to the inauguration, but on the leak that exposed the discussion. But Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffPresident rekindles feud with intelligence agencies Intel Dem: House GOP now open to investigating Flynn Overnight Defense: Dems raise pressure for Flynn probe | Trump blames leaks for ouster | Mattis pushes NATO on spending MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Intel panel, said he spoke with Nunes Wednesday afternoon, and that's no longer the chairman's position. "He assured me that we would investigate everything that the Senate is looking at, including the Flynn allegations," Schiff said, "and that he will not preclude any area that Democratic members thought was a subject of legitimate investigation. "So I was pleased with the discussion." Nunes's office said Wednesday night that "it is possible" the investigation would expand to include the Flynn episode. “[W]e’re not excluding the possibility of investigating anything related to Russian intelligence and counter-intelligence activities,” a spokesman said in an email. Schiff's comments suggest that House GOP leaders — after five days when the Flynn story has monopolized the news cycle, agonized the White House and put intense pressure on congressional Republicans — are ceding some ground in their defense of President Trump's former national security czar. Flynn was pushed out on Monday, just 24 days into his tenure, following revelations that he'd misled Vice President Pence and other top administration officials about the nature of a discussion he'd had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn told Pence the topic of U.S. sanctions on Russia had not been broached, a claim he walked back after The Washington Post reported Friday that the Justice Department had intercepted information proving it false. Both the Senate and House Intel committees had previously launched investigations into Russian hacking of Democratic campaign offices during the election, and Senate GOP leaders earlier in the week had indicated they were open to expanding that probe to include Flynn.  Sen. Roy BluntRoy BluntJudiciary Committee wants briefing, documents on Flynn resignation Intel Dem: House GOP now open to investigating Flynn Dems: 'Crazy' to trust GOP to investigate Flynn MORE (R-Mo.) said Tuesday that it's "likely" Flynn will be called to appear before the Senate panel. Schiff said the House may now follow suit. "I'm encouraged that we'll have the ability to investigate everything we need to," he said. Schiff said the process may take some time.  "There really isn't a timeline, but this won't be something we can get done overnight," he said. "Frankly, investigations of far less scope have taken years here. "I think there was a sense of urgency about this investigation," he added. "But we have a lot of work to do." - This story was updated at 7:18 p.m. Tags Adam Schiff, Roy Blunt   View the discussion thread.

This family is ideal for a wide range of applications within wireline access networks and cellular infrastructure, the defense and commercial aviation markets, and Industry 4.0 (the term "Industry 4.0" refers to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, and it encompasses thinks like cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing). Microsemi has evolved substantially in recent times. Around 15 years ago, the company was predominantly selling discrete components into the aerospace and defense industries. Today, by comparison, approximately 60% of the company's revenues come from the communications and data center markets, while aerospace and defense account for only 26% of revenue. This should not, of course, be taken to imply that Microsemi's share of the aerospace and defense markets are falling; rather that the other market segments are growing. The leading factor contributing to this evolution was Microsemi's acquisition of FPGA vendor Actel in 2010. Most people at that time thought this was a strange move. As Mark LaPedus wrote in his Microsemi buys Actel for $430 million column: Observers were scratching their heads about the deal. It was a complete surprise. Analog and FPGAs are completely different markets. What many people didnt realize was how having FPGAs in its portfolio would allow Microsemi to sell sub-systems and complete systems based on its newly acquired FPGAs coupled with its discrete components. Even if all a developer does is to download a reference design, can you guess whose components are featured in that design? To this day, I still hear people who arent aware of the past saying "Microsemi FPGAs?" in tones of derision, without understanding that Actel had a rich history regarding the creation of highly reliable and robust FPGAs for use in the harshest environments, including a wealth of space-grade offerings. When it comes to off-the-shelf FPGAs (as opposed to embedded FPGA IP for use in SoCs), there are only four big players left standing: Intel (used to be Altera), Lattice Semiconductor, Microsemi, and Xilinx (there are also a few smaller players in the FPGA world, like Atmel and Achronix, but they account for only a fraction of the overall market). Intel and Xilinx are, of course, focused on the high-end of the market, targeting the highest performance and highest capacity FPGAs the universe has yet seen. Lattice, meanwhile, is happily dominating the lower-end of the market with its ultra-low-power devices that are ideal for consumer and prosumer products. This is not to say that Intel, Lattice, and Xilinx dont have a presence in the mid-range arena, just that this is not their focus, and when something is not your focus it can become a weakness. By comparison, in the case of its FPGAs, Microsemi has set its sights firmly on the mid-range market, hence the introduction of its PolarFire family. The "Polar" portion of the moniker comes from that fact that these devices consume relatively little power (and thus run cooler) than their competitors in this market segment. Meanwhile, the "Fire" part of the name is a metaphor for the relatively high capacity and performance they offer. (Source: Microsemi) As one example, in collaboration with Silicon Creations, Microsemi has developed a 12.7 Gbps transceiver optimized to be area efficient and low power, resulting in total power of less than 90 milliwatts (mW) at 10 Gbps. These transceivers, which are featured in PolarFire FPGAs, satisfy the performance requirements of a wide range of mid-bandwidth applications. The transceivers in higher-end FPGAs can be "turned down" to the 12.7 Gbps level, but the fact they are designed to support much higher bandwidths leaves them less efficient at this lower speed (I cant believe I'm referring to 12.7 Gbps as "lower speed," but that's the way things are these days). Of particular interest to me is the deployment of PolarFire FPGAs in IoT applications, in which security is (finally) recognized as being a key factor. High levels of computation are no longer relegated to the core of the network; instead, more-and-more computation and intelligence is being pushed out to the edge of the network. Similarly, hardware and software security has to be pushed out to the edge of the network.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 10:08 am Wed Feb 15, 2017 Researchers show they can beat address space layout randomization with Javascript in a browser (!) From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Address space layout randomization is an important first line of defense against malicious software: by randomizing where in memory instructions are stored, ASLR makes it much harder to overwrite memory with new code that will be jumped to as a program executes, offering significant protection against buffer overflow attacks. report this ad A group of researchers from Vrije Universiteit published a research paper today, in which they demonstrate a side-channel attack against the CPU's memory management unit that allows malicious code to bypass ASLR, using Javascript code running inside a sandboxed browser. The vulnerability is common to at least 22 identified processor architectures from ARM, Intel and AMD. The researchers don't believe there is a cost-effective countermeasure for their attack and say that we should give up on ASLR as a first line of defense immediately. AnC works by using what's known as an EVICT+TIME cache attack that detects which memory locations are accessed by a CPU's MMU. The researchers identified 22 microarchitectures from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and ARM that were vulnerable. They went on to say they have yet to test an architecture that didn't provide the MMU signal necessary to exploit the side channel. The vulnerabilities are indexed as CVE-2017-5925 as they apply to Intel processors, CVE-2017-5926 for AMD processors, CVE-2017-5927 for ARM processors, and CVE-2017-5928 for a timing issue affecting multiple browsers. The paper was written by Ben Gras, Keveh Razavi, Erik Bosman, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida of the VUsec systems security group at the University of Amsterdam. They have published this resource page with additional information about the technique. Given how crucial caching is to the performance of modern CPUs, the researchers say architectural fixes are likely to be too costly to be feasible. And even if hardware mitigations are possible—say, by creating a separate cache for page tables—the researchers warn that the vulnerability may resurface in software. They conclude their findings with a recommendation that's sure to get the attention of software developers everywhere: "We hence recommend ASLR to no longer be trusted as a first line of defense against memory error attacks and for future defenses not to rely on it as a pivotal building block."

Steve Symington, Anders Bylund, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSymington) Feb 15, 2017 at 10:41AM One of the most important aspects of any business is the strength of its brands. And in today's fast-changing world, it's increasingly difficult for companies to successfully build and maintain thriving brands that continue resonating with consumers. We asked three top Motley Fool contributors each to choose a big-brand stock that they believe investors would be wise to purchase this month. Read on to see why they picked Nike (NYSE:NKE), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Nike's new Air Jordan I golf shoe. IMAGE SOURCE: NIKE Sprinting your way to investing success Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Nike): Nike, the Dow's worst performer last year, has underperformed the market by a wide margin since last February. Sure, the athletic-apparel titan is going through major challenges right now, including slowing growth and spiking competition in the U.S. Profitability has been trending lower, too, dropping by 1.4 percentage points last quarter, to 44% of sales. But the profit pain of the last few quarters has left Nike in a stronger inventory position that should help it speed up sales gains and earnings growth. It has a packed product portfolio with brands including Jordan, the Air VaporMax, which will likely push its expansion pace higher over the next six months, even as average prices rise. Meanwhile, investors don't have to fear the type of brutal demand slowdown that rocked rival Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) recently, given that Nike is far less reliant on the weakening North American market. Western Europe and China, for example, just logged their 13th- and 10th-straight quarters, respectively, of double-digit revenue growth. The battle for market share in the U.S. could ding profits for both Nike and Under Armour in the short term. Yet Nike has strong advantages on its side, including a broader product line, entrenched sports partnerships, and a dominant marketing budget. These strengths all imply it can withstand any industry slump better than its peers. Meanwhile, investors have a chance to snap up one of the top branded-businesses in the world following a rare double-digit price decline in 2016. IMAGE SOURCE: Yum! Brands. Mouthwatering shareholder value creation Steve Symington (Yum! Brands): Shares of Yum! Brands are up around 13% since late October, when the parent company of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC completed its planned spinoff of Yum China. But considering the progress Yum! Brands demonstrated in its solid fourth-quarter report last week, I think now is a great time for investors to open, or add, to their positions in the fast-food juggernaut. Fourth-quarter revenue climbed a modest 2.4% year over year, to just over $2 billion, as a 2% decline in comps at Pizza Hut was more than offset by same-store sales growth of 3% at both Taco Bell and KFC -- and this despite what both Yum! and other fast-food specialists describe as exceedingly difficult industry conditions in the United States. Core operating profit simultaneously grew 27% for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share rose 19%, to $0.79. Perhaps most important, Yum! Brands continued to move forward with its vision for growing its unit base, driving higher traffic, and maximizing profits over the long term. To that end, Yum! Brands refranchised 232 restaurants last quarter alone for proceeds of $200 million. That brought its franchise ownership mix to 93%, up from 77% last October, and a solid step toward its goal of being 98% franchised by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition to plans for optimizing its capital structure in the coming years, Yum! also aims to reduce annual capital expenditures by 80%, to $100 million, and lower general and administrative expenses by $300 million by the end of fiscal 2019. At the quarter's end, Yum! also had $1.9 billion remaining of the $2 billion repurchase plan its board authorized in mid-November. In the end, for investors who are willing to buy now and watch the company continue to realize its vision for maximizing shareholder value, I think Yum! Brands stock still represents a compelling portfolio candidate. An Intel-powered drone. IMAGE SOURCE: Intel. Intel: Modest valuation doesn't match the top-shelf business Anders Bylund (Intel): Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a chronically undervalued market leader. The largest semiconductor maker is trading below 15 times trailing earnings and 17 times free cash flows right now. That's cheap compared to the average valuation of the S&P 500 (average P/E ratio: 24), or the Dow Industrials (P/E: 20). This valuation gap is only growing larger at the start of 2017. So far this year, Intel shares have trailed the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points, the index moving up while Intel investors have taken a small haircut. All of this might be fair shakes if Intel had done something to deserve a quick haircut. But that's not what's happening here. The fourth-quarter report at the end of January was of the beat-and-raise variety. The presumably dying PC market showed new signs of life and accounted for 62% of Intel's operating profits. Meanwhile, the company is investing billions in its push into the Internet of Things, including the just-announced $7 billion restart of the dormant Fab 42 manufacturing facility in Arizona. Intel is a proven winner in several markets that aren't going away anytime soon, actively exploring promising growth opportunities, and doing it all with unmatched resources and technical sophistication. And right now, the stock is on sale. So what are you waiting for? Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Nike and Under Armour (C Shares).

There are other specs I can (and will) tell you about this, but really, that’s the most important one: $8,898. Now, to be clear, this is a professional-grade piece of hardware that’s really only meant for companies running servers with big databases. Sure, it’s set a whole bunch of benchmarking records, but it’s not really the kind of chip you’d use to play Overwatch. I’m not even sure you could use this to play Overwatch. Anyway, specs. So, what does your $8,898 investment get you? A 24 core processor with 60MB of cache that runs at 2.4GHz, with a maximum clock speed of 3.4GHz. That makes it pretty similar to Intel’s previous E7-8890 v4 Xeon chip, which has a recommended price of $7,174 (a comparative bargin, I tell you!), but it only runs at a base speed of 2.2GHz. Whether the extra speed boost is worth the $1,716 dollars is entirely up to you. Intel also makes a few other less powerful and cheaper Xeon processors in the E7-8800 line, but the E7-8894 v4 is the best of the bunch. And really, doesn’t your hypothetical industrial-grade server which you will probably never own or interact with deserve the best?

Cellular IoT chip suppliers certainly hope so. In that optimistic spirit, Altair Semiconductor, now a Sony company, announced Wednesday (Feb. 15) a narrow-band CAT-M1 and NB1-based cellular IoT chip, dubbed ALT1250. Although Altair is late coming to the CAT-M1/NB1 market compared to rivals such as Sequans (Paris, France) and Intel, it’s set to leapfrog the others with the new ALT1250, boasted Eran Eshed, Altair’s co-founder and vice president of worldwide sales and marketing. The ALT1250 is more advanced “in terms of cost, ease of integration and service provisioning,” he said in a phone interview with EE Times. “We believe our chip is at least a generation ahead of any other CAT-1/NB1 chips on the market today.” Specifically, the ALT1250 is designed to make it easy for Altair customers “to transform the chip into a [cellular IoT] module,” he noted. Ninety percent of the components in a cellular IoT module -- such as RF, baseband, front-end components, power amplifiers, filters and switches -- are already in the ALT1250. Module vendors won’t need to tune the RF tuner, for example, Eshed added. The only chips that remain external to ALT1250 are “a small flash memory, a bunch of clocks and a few passive components,” he noted. Simon Stanley, principal consultant at Earlswood Marketing Limited, told EE Times, “Key requirements for the cellular-based IoT market to take off are good coverage, and low component costs and attractive connectivity charges.” Certainly, ALT1250’s lower component counts and lower power, and the integration of a GPS receiver, can help, said Stanley. But beyond Eshed’s claims, “I think the wider importance of the Altair announcement is the expected availability of different solutions,” he noted. Chips are coming from Sequans, Altair and Intel, who are all chasing this market, he added. “This gives IoT solution developers and operators the confidence to roll out services and expand the IoT market.” Just like WiFi Since early February, 2016 when Altair was acquired by Sony, the team has worked patiently to completely redefine cellular IoT chip solutions. “We took a whiteboard approach. We knew it would take time for operators to migrate from 2G to LTE networks” for machine-to-machine communication, he said. Altair established a priority to make it painless for service operators to embrace cellular IoT, by lowering cost, increasing security, and simplifying the module design. An easier-to-integrate CAT-1/NB1 solution allows operators to “treat it as though it’s WiFi,” he said. “Obviously, we are not there yet, but we are getting closer.” Why integrate GPS? Now that Altair is part of Sony’s semiconductor operation, it’s adding a new wrinkle to its CAT-1/NB1 chip: integration of a GPS receiver. The integrated GPS suddenly makes the cellular IoT chip more amenable to getting designed into a variety of IoT applications, Altair believes. Such applications range from tracking kids, pets and assets to smart meters and figuring out where any given device is, Eshed explained. “An endless number of applications benefit from the GPS integration.” Next page: FD-SOI on horizon?

Las Vegas Sun February 16, 2017 Currently: 53° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events 0 Washington reels amid the turmoil of Trump’s first month Doug Mills / The New York Times President Donald Trump while meeting with Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, Feb. 8 2017. By Michael D. Shear, New York Times News Service Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 | 2 a.m. WASHINGTON — The resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser caps a remarkably tumultuous first month for President Donald Trump’s White House that has burdened the early days of his presidency with scandal, legal challenges, personnel drama and questions about his temperament during interactions with world leaders. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before his tenure was cut short by an admission that he had misled the vice president and other White House colleagues about the contents of a phone call with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The resignation on Monday night and the continuing turmoil inside the National Security Council have deeply rattled the Washington establishment. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., railed against the administration on Tuesday, denouncing the “dysfunction” of the country’s national security apparatus and accusing the White House of being a place where “nobody knows who’s in charge and nobody knows who’s setting policy.” Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, expressed concern about upheaval inside the White House. “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war,” he said at a military conference Tuesday. Asked about his comments later, Thomas said in a brief interview, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible.” But Flynn’s late-night departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. In record time, the 45th president has set off global outrage with a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban and watched as federal courts swiftly moved to block the policy, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power. The president angrily provoked the cancellation of a summit meeting with the Mexican president, hung up on Australia’s prime minister, authorized a commando raid that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL member, repeatedly lied about the existence of millions of fraudulent votes cast in the 2016 election and engaged in Twitter wars with senators, a sports team owner, a Hollywood actor and a major department store chain. His words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country. “I’ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in Washington,” said Leon Panetta, a Democrat who served as chief of staff, secretary of defense and CIA director during a 50-year career that spanned nine presidents from both parties. “I don’t know whether this White House is capable of responding in a thoughtful or careful way should a crisis erupt,” Panetta said in an interview Tuesday. “You can do hit-and-miss stuff over a period of time. But at some point, I don’t give a damn what your particular sense of change is all about, you cannot afford to have change become chaos.” Trump’s allies note that the president has moved forward in areas that are more typical of the early days of a first-term administration. Trump nominated a Supreme Court justice 12 days into his tenure and has issued a dozen executive orders, including ones to limit the influence of lobbyists, reduce regulations, pare the Affordable Care Act, move forward on pipeline construction, end trade deals and speed up deportations. Those accomplishments are catnip for the president’s most fervent supporters across the country, said Sarah Fagen, who served as a senior aide and political director for former President George W. Bush. The perspective on the White House is very different far outside the interstate freeway that rings Washington, she said. “If you’re someone inside the Beltway, you think it’s been really rocky,” she said. “If you are outside the Beltway, you think, ‘That’s why we sent him there.’ There has been a lot of chaos and a lot of growing pains, but they have gotten a lot done.” Still, half of the president’s Cabinet has yet to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, and several other key White House aides have become lightning rods for daily mockery by late-night comedians. It all has official Washington reeling and exhausted as it tries to make sense of — and keep up with — the nearly constant tornado of activity swirling around the president and his advisers. “If you had no-drama Obama, you’ve got all-drama, all-the-time Trump,” said John Feehery, a veteran Republican strategist, who compared the past several weeks to the chaotic start to Newt Gingrich’s tenure as speaker of the House in 1995. “Newt never settled down. It was always one crisis after another,” Feehery recalled. “This might be the new normal. People will start getting used to the new normal but will also be exhausted by it.” As a candidate, Trump promised to move quickly to stop illegal immigration, bring jobs back, end trade deals and reduce crime. Central to his campaign agenda was his pledge to be a disruptive force in Washington — and he has certainly done that. Since winning the election, Trump and his closest aides have embraced the turmoil, viewing it as evidence of their aggressive efforts to fundamentally reorient the government. The West Wing also uses the chaos as a tactical weapon, believing that the flurry of early-morning presidential tweets, controversial statements during the afternoon briefing and surprise executive actions work to keep their adversaries, the media and others off balance. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, happily kept reporters waiting while he did “a quick recap of the president’s activity,” proceeding to offer a long list of meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders, female entrepreneurs, local officials and educators. Yet the disruptions have come at a cost: the president has so far made little progress on legislation that would repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. The White House has not proposed a promised infrastructure bill to repair deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels. And the president’s aides have not yet drawn up plans for an overhaul of the nation’s tax code. “It’s pretty predictable,” Feehery said. “This guy has never been in government before and he promised to be disruptive.” It may also have consequences for Trump’s ability to help Republicans win in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republican campaign experts acknowledge that his chances for winning re-election may hinge on his ability to contain the White House frenzy. “You are processing so much information in a day now. This stuff would have doomed anyone else, just one or two of them,” said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican member of Congress from Virginia. “They have got to produce something. If all you’ve got is a bunch of executive orders and a Twitter feed, you don’t want to go into an election like that.” Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during both of his presidential campaigns, said Trump’s voters in 2016 wanted him to overhaul an establishment in Washington, which they view as long on promises, long on process but short on action. “Voters certainly asked for change. They certainly wanted to see disruption,” Madden said. “But if change begins to look like confusion and disruption morphs into disorder, you risk losing a certain level of confidence with voters.” 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

 $1 TRILLION WEALTH MANAGER: Invest in America now Tom Naratil, UBS Feb. 12, 2017, 8:41 AM 15,473 facebook linkedin twitter email print U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Before taking office last month, President Trump said that his administration will follow the rule of “buy American and hire American.” To make success more likely, we must add “invest American.” While anticipated reforms to spur growth can be complex and take time, today we have an immediate opportunity to grow the economy, driven by rising optimism and a willingness among investors and small businesses to put their cash to work. Let’s build on those sentiments and provide reasons to invest in America through incentives, by removing structural impediments, and by focusing on areas that have both the most need and the most interest from investors. In the United States, UBS manages more than $1 trillion of our clients' assets. We speak to investors daily and frequently gauge their feelings about the U.S. economy and prospects for growth. According to our most recent Investor Watch survey of high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals*, their optimism about the U.S. economy has increased dramatically since the presidential election. A majority of these investors are actively looking for opportunities in the market, with 42% looking to add to their equity portfolios. Meanwhile, our survey of business owners revealed that they are twice as likely to increase investment and hiring in their businesses than to scale back. When you consider these sentiments, along with widely held expectations globally for continued U.S. economic outperformance, the signs of demand for growth are encouraging. Tom Naratil, President Wealth Management Americas and President Americas, UBS REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Let’s be clear that both investors and business owners we spoke with still have a number of concerns. Individual investors continue to express apprehension over the political environment in Washington. Small business owners are chiefly worried about employee healthcare costs, taxes, and regulations. Yet despite those issues, and after an extended period of uncertainty, both groups overwhelmingly indicate that they are ready to get off the sidelines and begin making the kind of decisions that will positively impact the economy. Business and political leaders should be doing everything we can to listen and respond. The challenge, in this polarized political climate, is deciding how to make the most of this momentum. Today, there is a great deal of effort and political capital being spent on pushing more complex policy changes that will take time, such as overhauling the politically-sensitive Affordable Care Act or wholesale tax code reform. Instead, why not pursue "quick wins” on issues where there is more likely to be common ground across the political spectrum? Doing so will make a strong case for investing in the U.S. economy right now, while also building the institutional, bipartisan muscle memory that is necessary to address the long pole items like improving ACA. Investors and business owners suggest two specific areas where policymakers can break the persistent legislative gridlock and make meaningful progress. Residents inspect a washed-out section of collapsed road after Hurricane Matthew hit the state, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Reuters/Jonathan Drake The first is the continued enthusiasm for infrastructure investment. The American Society of Civil Engineers sees a $1.4 trillion funding gap by 2025 to improve key infrastructure, with mass transit facing the largest shortfall. Encouragingly, there is bipartisan consensus that infrastructure investment—particularly when leveraging private capital—is one of the single best ways to put people to work and to grow the economy. The federal government has a powerful opportunity to shape incremental tax policy that creates incentives for investors to take on more risk from these projects, encouraging private capital to amplify the effect of its own spending. The second area is scientific and medical research. Despite the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, the U.S. share of global medical research funding has declined by nearly 25% since 2004, according to the American Medical Association. Investors see this as an opportunity with economic upside and clear societal benefits through research that unlocks new cures and treatments for diseases and chronic ailments. Here again, tax policy can help drive investment in early-stage commercial research projects that would help satisfy investor appetites while addressing a vital need. These are just two areas where investors tell us that they see opportunity, and which also provide a boost to the economy and more broadly felt benefits. In the coming months, we will surely see a number of bruising legislative battles waged. But if lawmakers can prioritize policies that can be passed in short order, the wider economy will feel the effects much sooner and with the potential for greater long-term growth. Investors are eager to deploy their capital, and the federal government should recognize its role in making that possible. America will be stronger as a result.

UBS Wealth Management Americas had $1.1 trillion in client assets at the end of the fourth quarter.  *  Survey conducted December 20 - 27, 2016, among 2,025 high net worth investors and an oversample of 282 business owners who have at least one employee besides themselves.

This time, we are looking at the official box art of the Ryzen processors which will have several variants at launch. Official AMD Ryzen Processor Box Art Leaks Out – Several Models Listed Online Along With Prices The AMD Ryzen processor models were covered by us earlier this month. We reported that a total of 17 new models based on the Zen architecture would be making their way to the AM4 platform. The lineup would be featuring various SKUs based on 8 core, 6 core and 4 core dies. All models will feature unlocked multipliers and prices that will make AMD very competitive against Intel CPUs (HEDT and mainstream). The lineup was listed on a Thailand based retail outlet along with pre-order pricing. We can tell you that the final prices of Ryzen chips will be lower than that. Prices for the AM4 motherboards were recently covered by us so those of you planning to hop on the new AM4 platform should definitely check out this article. The prices for Ryzen processors are listed in Thai Baht Currency. A Ryzen 7 1800X for 18,790 Baht would be $537 US (Pre-Order). The box art can be seen to be very simple with a full black color theme. The Ryzen logo can be seen on the front along with the AMD logos. The side of the box lists down key features of the processor while the top will feature naming and specifications of the model itself. Based on the size of the box, we can expect a stock HSF (Heat Sink Fan) within the package. AMD Ryzen Processors Listing: AMD Ryzen 7 Series CPUs – Flagship AMD 7 1800X With 8 Cores, 16 Threads, 4 GHz Boost Clocks The AMD Ryzen 7 lineup will feature the fastest “X” variant in the lineup.

AMD will be offering these coolers in three specific models. They include a Wraith based model which is designed to handle thermal loads over 95W so the XFR (Extended Frequency Range) feature can take full benefit of higher clock speeds. The other models include a 95W and a 65W model which are designed for the rest of the lineup. Prices on the coolers have not been confirmed but at least two variants, the 95W and 65W, will be bundled with a range of processors. The Wraith cooler will possibly be sold separately or there will be a bundle package that comes with a “X” series processor along with the cooler itself. A recent picture uploaded by AMD’s Raja Koduri shows that the new coolers could feature LED lightning which is something cool to have on stock bundled HSFs. AMD X370 Platform Specs: As for the platform itself, AM4 X370 will be top of the line. Aside from the budget friendly B350 and A320 chips, the X370 PCH will offer increased PCIe lanes and increased storage / connectivity features. AMD has planned a total of 16 new AM4 motherboards which will be available at launch through their partners. The boards are detailed in our post here. AMD Ryzen AM4 Motherboard Chipsets: Wccftech X370 B350 A320 X300 PCIe 3 Lanes 24 24 TBA TBA CrossfireX/SLI Tri-Fire/2-Way SLI TBC N/A N/A PCIe 2 Lanes 8 6 TBA TBA USB 3.1 Gen2 2 2 TBA TBA USB 3.1 Gen1 8 4 TBA TBA USB 2 6 6 TBA TBA SATA 6Gb/s 8 6 TBA 8 DDR4 DIMMs 4 4 TBA 2 Overclocking Support Yes Yes No Yes NVMe Yes Yes TBA TBA Form Factor ATX ATX, M-ATX M-ATX, Mini-ITX Mini-ITX Estimated Price Range ~$129+ ~$99-$59 <$59 ~$129+ So there you have it, the first pictures of Ryzen processor box packages. We can expect more leaks on AMD’s Ryzen processors and AM4 platform in the coming days as launch comes closer. AMD is expected to unleash their next generation processor family at GDC 2017 which begins on 28th February, 2017. The actual day for launch will be 2nd March which aligns with what AMD has revealed themselves.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Chaffetz: No need for Oversight to investigate Flynn now — but …. posted at 12:01 pm on February 14, 2017 by Ed Morrissey Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES … that doesn’t mean that Congress has closed the case of Michael Flynn, either. House Oversight chair Jason Chaffetz responded to calls from Democrats on his committee to conduct a full investigation of now-former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his contacts with Russia. Chaffetz told reporters this morning that Flynn’s resignation means that the matter is no longer in his jurisdiction — but predicted that the House Intelligence Committee will pick up the matter instead: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Tuesday that his panel won’t investigate the circumstances that led to Michael Flynn stepping down Monday as President Trump’s national security adviser. … Chaffetz said that sensitive intelligence methods falls to the House Intelligence Committee, rather than his House Oversight Committee. “It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation state like that. It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee,” Chaffetz said. However, Intelligence chair Devin Nuñes (R-CA) told CNN that the matter may fall within the realm of executive privilege, and he has no plans to launch a probe yet — of Flynn, anyway. Instead, Nuñes wants to investigate the leaks that made the issue public [see update below]: Rep. Devin Nunes says the Intelligence Committee won't look into discussions between Trump and Flynn, citing executive privilege — Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 14, 2017 House Intel Chair @DevinNunes says Cmte will look into IC leaks of Flynn/Russia call. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 14, 2017 Conversations between Trump and Flynn would fall under executive privilege, but what about between Flynn and the Russian envoy? That wouldn’t fall under executive privilege, as ranking Intelligence committee member Adam Schiff (D-CA) argued: Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told House Democrats Tuesday that the recent revelations about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s conversations with the Russians are only the beginning, and more information will surface in the coming days, according to multiple sources in a closed party meeting. Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said that any conversations that Flynn had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Donald Trump took office would not be covered by executive privilege, potentially making some information subject to congressional investigations. Republicans have so far balked at probing this matter. That may not be covered under executive privilege even if it took place after Trump’s inauguration. However, the more basic question was whether it violated the law. The Logan Act forbids private citizens and public officials from conducting foreign policy without authorization from the president, a law that has been on the books for more than two hundred years and has been used for prosecution exactly zero times. As I argued last week, there is certainly an ethical question about having an incoming administration undermine the foreign policy of the existing one, but the punishment for that should be a high-profile firing and political shaming, which has now been fulfilled. Unless Democrats find evidence of actual espionage — and that seems highly unlikely — the best they can do is to keep using this to beat up the Trump administration. At this point, it’s tough to argue that the White House hasn’t earned this public beating, either, but that doesn’t mean that Republicans will be anxious to hand them more bats. Paul Ryan suggested earlier today that the Trump administration will offer up a more complete explanation of the events of the last few weeks soon. That seems a bit optimistic; right now they seem to have gone into tight-messaging mode and are looking for subject-changers. Ryan also gave his support to Trump for having asked for Flynn’s resignation, which is slightly different than the “Flynn resigned on his own” explanation from last night and early this morning. If nothing else, the White House should cheer that take, as it makes Trump look a little more decisive in dealing with the chaos of the last few days. "I think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this," Speaker Ryan on Flynn's resignation https://t.co/pR7UNjb2BV pic.twitter.com/5VeYMkPhYx — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 14, 2017 .@SpeakerRyan: "I think the president was right to ask for [Michael Flynn's] resignation" https://t.co/W9NDINUSxy pic.twitter.com/06umKECnPb — POLITICO (@politico) February 14, 2017 Update: Eli Lake makes a very good case for Nuñes’ investigative focus: Normally intercepts of U.S. officials and citizens are some of the most tightly held government secrets. This is for good reason. Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do. In the past it was considered scandalous for senior U.S. officials to even request the identities of U.S. officials incidentally monitored by the government (normally they are redacted from intelligence reports). John Bolton’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was derailed in 2006 after the NSA confirmed he had made 10 such requests when he was Undersecretary of State for Arms Control in George W. Bush’s first term. The fact that the intercepts of Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak appear to have been widely distributed inside the government is a red flag. Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told me Monday that he saw the leaks about Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak as part of a pattern. “There does appear to be a well orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration,” he said. “From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level FISA Court information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern.” … In the end, it was Trump’s decision to cut Flynn loose. In doing this he caved in to his political and bureaucratic opposition. Nunes told me Monday night that this will not end well. “First it’s Flynn, next it will be Kellyanne Conway, then it will be Steve Bannon, then it will be Reince Priebus,” he said. Put another way, Flynn is only the appetizer. Trump is the entree. Be sure to read it all.

The advice given was "Use Internet Explorer and make sure to clear all cookies and cache". There are multiple issues here. The first is coding to a single browser platform, and all too often that is still Internet Explorer. According to www.w3counter.com, the current usage stats for browsers is Chrome at the top (with 58.4%), followed by Safari (13.3%), Firefox (9.5%), IE and Edge (8.1%), and Opera (4.4%). Another problem is with the advice to clear all cookies. This is like using an atomic bomb to get rid of a mosquito. If you have years of cookies working for you, then one bad one shouldn't be taken care of by getting rid of the lot. I advised the help-desk staff member to review their suggestions, especially since this was the first time I had used IE to access that site, so there would be a fresh cookie. Western Digital, the hard-drive manufacturer, is starting to make 512GB, 64-layer 3D NAND chips in Japan. The new chips use a 3-bit-per-cell design to pack in the extra density. It will take around six months before we see the new chips on the market. Another manufacturer, Micro, is also working on a 64-layer 3D NAND chip, but 256GB on a tiny 59mm² surface area. Samsung had claimed they would get their version out before the others, but I suspect the Note 7 woes delayed that move. What this means to us is more memory, hopefully at a lower price, in microSD, thumb drives and in other devices like smartphones. There has been much said about new US President Donald Trump in the past weeks but keeping it in the IT sphere, at the time of writing he has yet to sign the cybersecurity executive order. This will add accountability to department heads for any computer security failures and ensure implementation of the NIST-developed cybersecurity defence framework. This executive order at least should be something everyone from both sides of the fence would support. The aim would be to then extend responsibility for security down the system to network admins and programme managers. The Australian government is having problems with the concept of anonymous data. The result is a de-anonymisation bill before Parliament that will ban any research into the field. Admittedly, this comes about after some clever researchers worked out that it was quite easy to trace health data back to its individual owners, but that is the fault of those anonymising it. The wording means that any legitimate researcher must now apply to be able to carry out any research of public data, which seems a little backward. It also puts no onus on those anonymising data to be better at their jobs. As one analyst put it, it's like not allowing people to look at other bridges to figure out why one collapsed. It turns out -- and you will probably laugh at this -- that the Atom series of Intel processors has a flaw. Not laughing yet? Intel has known about it for around 18 months. The result of the flaw is a bricked system, highlighted by the high rate of return that started about 18 months back. It was only two months back that Intel reported it was a flaw in the chip blueprints. Cisco, for example, noted their units failing about 18 months ago, and finally started blaming it on the CPUs. Intel refused to acknowledge there was any link. Lots of other companies were affected, but Intel has some very strong non-disclosure agreements in place. Thanks to the delay in admitting they had an issue, companies with issues are now working on fixing what they can on their side, including any poor press they had on their products not performing correctly. So what is a chipset and why should you care? A chipset is the communications hub and data-traffic manager on your motherboard. It determines what kind of memory you can use, what bits and pieces can be connected to your motherboard, and if for example you can engage in overclocking. Overclocking is tuning the speed of your CPU, usually faster than its normally rated speed. These things help to decide what kind of motherboard you are going to buy or have in your next computer. Back in the beginning, the chips were separate integrated circuits that talked to each other over the data bus. There were chips that responded to the keyboard, generated graphics and sound, and talked to the mouse. Over time these discrete chips were integrated into two chips called northbridge and southbridge. In more recent times these were all integrated into a single unit so the chipset became just one chip, still called the chipset. The system is still a couple of chips, but one of them is quite small and handles fewer functions than the main one. The purpose is to decrease latency so that things happen faster.

The German shop currently lists four base models based on Kaby Lake priced between 1649 and 2459 Euros , but you can easily increase the prices with upgrades. There are some basic components for every model. The processor is a powerful Intel quad-core, either with or without Hyper-Threading . The amount of DDR4-RAM is from 8 up to 32 GB , whereas the storage solution consists of a conventional HDD or a combination of SSD and hard drive. Dell uses a Full HD panel, which is, depending on the refresh rate , based on the IPS or TN technology. Both models support G-Sync. Dell also includes a high-end GPU from Nvidia’s Pascal generation. While the GeForce GTX 1060 is equipped with 6 GB GDDR5-VRAM, the GeForce GTX 1070 comes with 8 GB GDDR5.

USA TODAY Sports Alex Deibold (USA), blue, reacts during the semifinal run of the men's snowboardcross during the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games at Rosa Khutor Extreme Park. (Photo: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports) 1594 CONNECTTWEET 49 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ASPEN, Colo. — With Donald J. Trump not yet in office in early January, the advocacy group Protect Our Winters sought a way to reach out to the then-president-elect. So it tried to engage Trump on his turf – Twitter. Protect Our Winters, or POW, launched a Twitter campaign encouraging the incoming president to keep the Paris agreement, an international effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the top athletes in snow sports — including Olympians Devin Logan, Alex Deibold, Elena Hight and Danny Davis — echoed the message. “There was really no direct line to him through like the White House switchboard,” said Chris Steinkamp, executive director of Protect Our Winters. “Then we realized, my god, he’s on Twitter all the time, and nobody’s really used that medium in reverse. He’s very famous about trying to let us know what’s going on, but we’ve never really messaged to him.” Steinkamp says the #keepparis campaign reached 11 million people, although it did not get a response from Trump. The hashtag was tweeted 24,000 times on Jan. 5-6, when POW was leading the campaign, according to Twitter. “As you know, these athletes don’t give a damn. They stand up for what they want to stand up for,” Steinkamp said. “The steeper the hill for these guys, the better.” MORE COVERAGE: Shaun White is refreshed, focused for shot at 2018 Olympic medal American runners Alysia Montano, Brenda Martinez could get medals They recognize the steepness of the challenge now. Trump made comments in the past and during his presidential campaign that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. He has said he is considering backing out of the United States’ commitment to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Now past Trump’s inauguration, those involved in snow sports generally — and snowboarding in particular — have tried to further advocate on issues they’ve long supported. That’s primarily but not exclusively been around climate change, an issue many athletes have partnered with POW on for years. “I wouldn’t say that I see a renewed focus, but what I do see is almost sort of like buckling down,” said Deibold, a bronze medalist in Sochi. “I think that we realize that the work we’re doing now is more important than ever because we’re fighting such an uphill battle.” Steinkamp says POW has had an “outpouring of people” wanting to get involved and donate since Trump’s election. Donations are up 50% to 75%, he said. The organization says it has more than 130,000 supporters worldwide. For the athletes involved, the story is not just theoretical. POW was founded in 2007 by professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones, and athletes have long been a part of the organization’s voice. It has support of athletes across snow sports, including skiing, ice climbing and mountaineers. Anecdotally, the athletes see the impact that the scientific community, which has reached a consensus in man’s role in climate change, finds in data. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last month that 2016 was the United States’ second warmest year on record. NASA said 16 of the 17 warmest years have occurred since 2001. “When there’s someone in power who cares about that stuff and whatnot, you have a little less feel to be involved,” said Davis. “And then when you have someone maybe like now, you almost feel the need to be more involved and voice it out, educate people.” While the sport demands international travel, equipment and apparel that’s not exactly earth friendly, athletes try to do their part. In their own lives and through their education efforts with POW, they highlight efforts people can make daily to help the environment, simple things like conserving electricity or re-using shopping bags. But POW, and the athletes, are drawing attention to bigger concerns. The Twitter campaign sought to persuade Trump to keep in place the Paris agreement the United States joined with nearly 200 other nations to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

More broadly, they expressed concern not just about Trump but about his administration. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is the former CEO of Exxon Mobil. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who could be confirmed as EPA administrator as early as this week, has sued the EPA more than a dozen times over environmental regulations. “It’s really scary from an environmentalist’s perspective,” said Steinkamp. “Maybe four or five months ago, there was a little bit of complacency throughout the community knowing it was being done. Now I think people realize if it’s going to get done, we have to do it.” Both Steinkamp and Donna Carpenter, CEO of Burton and a member of POW’s board of directors, said athletes’ voices resonate in a way that advocates’ voices sometimes can’t. Having an Olympian can get POW a meeting with a senator rather than a chief of staff. And they see a role for that advocacy in snowboarding’s history, one in which it grew up in opposition to the ski industry, whose resorts initially barred snowboarding. “I think snowboarders and snowboarding is in a position to say no, we speak truth to power and the truth is we’re better off with a diverse community and we’re better off obviously addressing climate change, and we’re better off facing the fact of globalization,” Carpenter said. “We’re not gonna go back. We’re just gonna alienate people.” Carpenter sees a role for businesses in the way some decided not to move to North Carolina after the passage of HB2. The law, known as the bathroom bill, prevents cities and counties from passing protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity and mandates that public schools require bathrooms or locker rooms be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex. The NBA pulled its all-star game from the state, and the NCAA moved its championships. Carpenter said companies like hers that are invested in snow sports would be wise not to invest in or move to states whose representatives deny climate change. For Carpenter, the advocacy doesn’t end there though. She spoke to USA TODAY Sports at the X Games a week after she personally sponsored about 30 Burton employees to attend the Women’s March following Trump’s inauguration. In her business and in her sport, Carpenter sees an avenue to advocate for climate change and gender equity. “We’re the rebellious adolescents of the ski industry,” she said. “We look at things a little bit differently and a little irreverently. We question authority and we always have.” PHOTOS: Donald Trump's first 100 days FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Add A Comment Gabriel Krisman Bertazi of Collabora has published a set of 14 patches today for implementing atomic mode-setting support within the QXL DRM driver. The QXL DRM driver as a reminder is for Red Hat's SPICE with guest virtual machines on QEMU. QXL -- presumably with Linux 4.12 -- will join Nouveau, Intel, and other DRM drivers in supporting atomic mode-setting. The QXL atomic mode-setting has been tested so far with the X.Org Server, the IGT tests, libdrm's test suite, and other custom tests. Adding atomic mode-setting to the QXL driver was 434 lines of new code but 449 lines of deleted code. More details via this patch series.

Would you buy this? Yes 18 No 1 Price $ 1,699.00 (AUD) Special Offers Coupon: Lenovo ThinkPad T Series Laptops Coupon Venom is the unusual Australian-based system integrator that sells computers globally to an enthusiastic, brand-loyal audience. The company is a bit like BMW’s M Division in that it takes away the frills and bloat of the modern computer market and leaves behind a focused machine, with high-quality parts, that does its specified job well, fast and reliably. The Blackbook Zero 14 (Zero references the lack of graphics and the focus on general, work-related productivity) is another of its monolithic laptops but it’s thin, very robust and good-looking. The specs are reasonable and, uncommonly, we’re looking on a 14-inch laptop as an ultraportable. Key Specs 14.1-inch, matte screen, 1920 x 1080, non-touchscreen IPS LCD; 1.2-3.3GHz Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor; 8GB RAM; 240GB M.2 SSD; Intel HD Graphics 615; 41Wh battery; 1.4KG. SKU: L13303. Full specs here. Ports On the left reside two, standard USB 2 ports while on the right are all of the others: USB-C (which supports charging and external video), a USB 3.0 port, micro HDMI, 3.5mm headset jack and a microSD card reader. Design and Build The chassis is listed as a Sand Blasted Alloy composite which sounds about right. It's basically a solid, black metal unibody but with a removable base that allows access to the removable battery and hard drive. The black is matte and uniform but on the edges and around ports we did notice scratches appearing revealing a silver metal beneath. While the whole chassis and lid (which has hardly any flex in it) feels very robust indeed, the paint job is less so. It should also be noted that the matte finish is one heck of a fingerprint magnet. Don't leave it at a crime scene. In terms of styling, monochrome and monolithic are the best descriptors. But we also found it very cool from a multitude of angles as our pre-review slideshow demonstrates. If it wasn't for the blue Intel sticker at the front there'd be no colour here at all. It's all very Henry Ford, but in a good way. The finish gives it a quality feel, as do the flush-fitting ports. You can access the basics by removing a multitude of small screws from the back.

We've been testing TVs using the excellent Costa Rica 4K 60fps demo on YouTube over the past year and are used to colours popping off the screen, but they're more muted and neutral here. They are. However, accurate and motion blur was minimal. The resolution is 1920 x 1080. Some may lament the lack of Ultra High Definition but lettering gets very small in those circumstances. For a laptop that's set up for predominantly typing-based workloads the resolution fits the 14.1-inch screen size very well and it's comfortable to work on for long periods. The viewing angles experience some image degradation from the side, but then with work-oriented notebooks like this, you don't really want people sitting beside you having a crystal clear view of what you're working on. This is also an increasingly-rare breed of laptop that has a matte-screen with minimal reflections – a boon worth the sacrifice of glossy, vibrant colours to many people. We liked it when the Windows 10 Professional image started up and had Chrome and Firefox already installed. That was a nice touch. Input The keyboard is a scrabble tile affair but feels different to many we've used in the past. The keys have a an-ever-so-slightly-rougher surface than competitors and are substantially stiffer than seen elsewhere. All but the top row are full-sized though and this, combined with the spacing, stiffness and coating meant it was one of the most accurate keyboards we'd used in a while - but that doesn't go for the Space Bar whose stiffness takes some getting used to. Indeed, if you're typing all day long you could experience finger fatigue. All in all, though, we were impressed – it feels like a high quality unit. Read more ​The rush to be thinnest, fastest and first with technology As for the mouse pad we're slightly-less convinced. It's smooth enough and accurate enough when sliding your fingers across it and gently tapping it, but the 'buttons' are quite stiff and this might be a bit uncomfortable for some. Performance We respect the choice of Core i5 chips for ultraportables. We've used i7s before and even with Kaby Lake's power efficiencies, they seem to cause problems with heat. This processor however, was very responsive for basic office and media functions, didn't get too hot which means it doesn't toast your unmentionables or have any annoying fans to spin up with that annoying, battery-draining whine. It can get warm at the rear, right-hand side but not enough to be uncomfortable. There's only 8GB of RAM installed but it's an LPDDR3 Ultra Low Voltage variant which has been specially chosen to work efficiently in conjunction with the processor and M.2 SSD to operate at optimum levels for long periods without overheating or system speed throttling. The amount might limit hardcore photoshoppers and multimedia workers but it flew along for other tasks. It scored 2415 in PC Mark which is very respectable for 2D applications. In the dedicated Work 2.0 test it scored 2977 which is among the top scores we've ever seen in this test (which, to be fair, we reserve for ultraportables). For reference, a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (with a more power-hungry Core i5-6300U processor) scored 2613. The integrated Intel graphics couldn't handle the modern 3D Mark tests but it did score 3691 in the Cloud Gate test which shows it can still play older 3D games, at least to some extent.

I like Nvidia, though." Hershey: "Stay long Hershey. Hershey is a great long-term situation. Not going to run here." Accenture: "Accenture should have never gotten down to $114 or $115. I didn't even think that quarter was that bad. I'm a buy, buy, buyer of ACN." Cheniere Energy Partners: "I like CQP. It's got a good yield and I think that the Cheniere dream is coming true, even though it is not going to be read by Charif [Souki, former CEO of LNG]." Inovio Pharma: "Total spec. The vaccine business we have not liked. We have gotten hurt on vaccines but it is not bad if you want a spec only." Emerge Energy Services: "No. We've got Schlumberger trading as if the Permian isn't coming back. We're going to go with Schlumberger. We are going to go high and not low." Seaspan Corporation: "We do not recommend container ships. We do not recommend tankers. We do not recommend anything that is sea born because it has killed us." Questions for Cramer?

Picture taken April 22, 2016. Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Microsoft is expected to release its next line of Surface devices by the end of 2017, and Surface Book 2 definitely is part of the line. Microsoft unleashed the Surface Book i7 late 2016, powered by Intel’s previous generation processor. Along with Surface Pro 5, the Surface Book 2 is also said to have the Intel Kaby Lake processor for faster processing and less power consumption. The Surface Book 2 display is said to receive a bump and may have a 4K display. The device could come with an updated Surface Pen. According to a recent report by Tech Radar, Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date details are still a bit dodgy and the company hasn’t released any official information on the device. Considering the fact that the Surface Book i7 released in October 2016 and is still fresh, Microsoft may choose to release the Surface Book 2 later. Thus, proper information on the laptop may start flowing in only after two months or so. The current model sports a 13.5-inch display with screen resolution of 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. It has an integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. The upcoming Surface Book 2 could offer a more conventional 4K resolution, as Kaby Lake architecture includes better graphics, that improves playback of 4K video and 3D graphics. Microsoft may also think of a better way to detach the screen from the keyboard. The current model has faced a lot of criticism because of its hinge’s locking system. The Surface Book 2 needs a functional hinge that will enable the keyboard to be detached irrespective of whether the device is on or off. The Microsoft Surface Book 2 also needs a better battery to support 4K content and for the built-in Surface Pen recharge dock. Gamers are also expecting a better graphics chip. Rumours state that the device could be VR-ready. Certain reports have provided an April release date though that’s still unconfirmed. It could come with a price tag of US$1,500 (AU$1,950 approx). Recently the price of the Surface Book was increased in the UK as a result of Brexit. “In response to a recent review we are adjusting the British pound prices of some of our hardware and consumer software in order to align to market dynamics ... For indirect sales where our products and services are sold through partners, final prices will continue to be determined by them,” a Microsoft spokeswoman recently told Tech Crunch. It will be interesting to see if Microsoft brings forth the Surface Book 2 in the market amidst the Brexit turmoil. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Microft’s Surface line of products.

Fifteen clients — ranging from online retail giant Amazon.com to Spanish-language network Univision — signed contracts with Brian Ballard’s new federal lobbying firm, Ballard Partners. He says more corporations will join the roster next week. His lobbying partner, Susie Wiles, managed Trump’s Florida campaign. Ballard said he doesn’t plan to act in a way that’s “exploitative of the relationship” he has with Trump and the White House. But he added: “I do think it’s clear that I understand his thinking, and I think I can provide some strategic counsel.” Trump made “draining the swamp” of Washington special interests a rallying cry of his campaign, but his presidency and the unified Republican control of the nation’s capital have sparked new lobbying opportunities for companies seeking to influence everything from tax policy to Trump’s pledge to slash federal regulations. The new president also has demonstrated he’s willing to single out individual companies. Trump and Amazon had a contentious relationship during the campaign, with Trump taking to Twitter to complain about Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post. (After the election, Bezos congratulated Trump on his win and joined other tech executives who met the real-estate magnate in New York. But he has joined dozens of other tech executives who have raised alarms about Trump temporary immigration ban.) During the campaign, Trump had a run-in with a well-known Univision figure, Jorge Ramos. Trump ejected the opinionated anchor from an Iowa news conference last summer after a heated exchange about the then-candidate’s immigration policies.

The GEO Group, one of the nation’s largest private-prison operators, donated more than $200,000 in the 2016 election to a pro-Trump super PAC. The company opposed the Obama administration’s move to phase out the use of privately run federal prisons. But the industry views Trump’s law-and-order stance as good for business. GEO Group, based in Florida, is among several of Ballard’s existing state clients expanding with him to Washington, he said. Other Washington clients include the American Health Care Association, the U.S. Sugar Corporation and American Airlines, he said. Ballard has deep ties to the Republican establishment as a top Florida fundraiser for the presidential campaigns of Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in 2012. Ballard, who has lobbied for the Trump businesses in Florida, initially backed Jeb Bush and then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican presidential primary before joining Trump’s camp. He also served as a finance co-chair of Trump’s inaugural committee, which raised a record $100 million for the real-estate magnate’s swearing-in festivities. Two former top advisers to Trump — his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and campaign adviser Barry Bennett — opened a political consulting firm in December.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple MacBook Pro 2016 buyers were more or less happy with the device’s performance. However, when it came to battery performance, they were thoroughly disappointed. Consumer reports even suspended its recommendation after testing the device. The MacBook Pro 2017 device is expected to get major upgrades to its battery. Apple is said to be making a proprietary chip that can take away some of the load off the device’s Intel processor. Moreover, the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 has reportedly removes bugs that drain the battery away. According to Tech Times, there are certain MacBook Pro 2016 tips and tricks that can significantly enhance the device’s battery life. Users should use Safari, instead of any other browser, even Chrome. This is because Safari performs the best for the MacBook Pro 2016 when it comes to power usage as the program has been designed specifically to not use the AMD graphics processor. Thus, even when a user is using graphics-heavy pages such as Google Maps, it won’t drain much of the battery. Most people already know that background applications drain away a lot of battery. Background has to be cleaned at intervals to remove apps that are not being used currently. All browser tabs must be closed when not in use. If users want to extract 45-60 minutes extra usage from their Apple MacBook Pro 2016, they should watch videos only in full screen mode and also deactivate the closed captioning. Within this state, the laptop draws significantly less power. While these are the main tips to decrease Apple MacBook Pro 2016 battery drainage, CNET has also advised users to dim the screen even though the new screens are 30 percent more power efficient. Apple has shrunk the battery size from 95.5 watt-hours of capacity for the 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro to 76 watt-hours for the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro. Users must also be aware of the USB devices they are using. These devices fire up the laptop’s communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Apple MacBook Pro 2016 users should always unplug dongles once they are done with their work. The new USB-C ports are amazing only when one has the right cables and peripherals. The Apple MacBook Pro 2017 is a highly-anticipated device that may come with an Intel Kaby Lake processor and QHD+ Display that may significantly improve battery life. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple’s Mac products.

The OpenFog Reference Architecture aims to set a baseline for guiding work on standards and product design, starting with security. The year-old group defines “fog” broadly to cover everything from IoT end nodes to cloud services. It aims to define ways to minimize backhaul while providing reliable communications and deterministic latencies. Ultimately its recommendations will touch everything from the design of end node SoCs to gateways and applications. The OpenFog Consortium does not expect all IoT nodes will be compliant with its requirements. But it does aim to enable every IoT deployment with its vision of interoperable services that span eight technical areas and many vertical markets. Along the way it will create test beds and certify products for compliance with itsa requirements. Not surprisingly, security got special attention in the baseline document published this week. “It has a 30-page appendix with many detailed calls for action, mainly for security where we did a deep dive…that every silicon and security stack vendor should review,” said Chuck Byers, co-chair of the consortium’s architecture group and a principal engineer at Cisco Systems. Specifically, the Trusted Computing Group’s standards for a hardware root of trust and how chip designers implement them may need to be modified for IoT, said Rob Swanson, chair of the consortium’s technical group and a principal engineer at Intel. In addition, rivals such as ARM and Intel need to align the security primitives in their competing architectures “to serve app developers in a consistent way, [for example in] common crypto mechanisms for hardware acceleration,” Swanson said. (ARM is a member of the consortium which so far includes few chip vendors.) The OpenFog Reference Architecture covers a broad waterfront from end-node SoCs to cloud services. (Image: OpenFog Consortium) Security is just one of eight tech areas the framework addresses, but it’s currently “the biggest source of heartburn,” said Byers, noting the group also will define APIs and processes for orchestrating IoT services. “The calls to action will come in the next phase,” said Swanson. “We first needed to set the baseline with the reference architecture so we can show how systems are comprised for a given scenario,” he said. Now the group has turned its attention to defining specific low-level functions, minimal viable interfaces and methods for testing them. “There’s quite a bit to do here,” Swanson said. For example, two unannounced open source projects are already in the works that may become part of the consortium’s recommendations in the future. Meanwhile the group is setting up liaisons to collaborate with standards organizations and other IoT efforts including the Industrial Internet Consortium which has its own general and security frameworks. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: China Signs IoT Interop Plan Industrial IoT Nets Blossom IoT Convergence Is Coming Security Experts Cite IoT Risks Email This Print Comment More Related Links Altair Readies Cellular IoT IC with GPS Inside Security Experts Cite IoT Risks SoC Could Power Star Trek-like Medical Scanner 16 Views of ISSCC IoT Convergence Is Coming Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Wong (left) and Yi Fang are leading the research for the school’s project. Photo courtesy of NYU Tandon Associated Press Self-driving cars could account for 21 million new vehicles sold every year by 2035. Over the next decade alone such vehicles — and vehicles with assisted-driving technology — could deliver $1 trillion in societal and consumer benefits due to their improved safety. For autonomous vehicles to make good on that promise they will need onboard artificial intelligence (AI) technology able to link them to highly detailed maps that reflect every change in the status of lanes, hazards, obstacles and speed limits in real-time. Researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering are making this critical machine-to-machine handshake possible. Yi Fang, a research assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a faculty member at NYU Abu Dhabi, and Edward K. Wong, an associate professor in the NYU Tandon Department of Computer Science and Engineering, are developing a deep learning system that will allow self-driving cars to navigate, maneuver and respond to changing road conditions by mating data from onboard sensors to information on HERE HD Live Map, a cloud-based service for automated driving. The NYU Multimedia and Visual Computing Lab directed by Fang will house the collaborative project. Fang and Wong recently received a gift fund from HERE, a global leader in mapping and location-based services owned by Audi, BMW, Daimler and Intel, with Tencent and NavInfo of China and GIC of Singapore also poised to become investors during 2017. NYU Tandon is one of HERE's first university research and development partners in HERE HD Live Map. High-definition maps meant for machine-to-machine communication must be accurate to within 10 to 20 centimeters. Self-driving vehicles need to continuously update, or register, their location on these maps with an equally high degree of accuracy, according to Fang, who said that the goal of the collaborative research is to enhance car-to-map precision to within 10 centimeters. "Essentially, we want to be able to precisely match what the car sees with what's in the cloud database. An incredibly precise ruler isn't of much use if your vision is blurry," Fang explained. "Our work involves employing computer vision techniques to refine the vehicle's ability to continually locate itself with respect to HERE's cloud-based service," said Wong. "That requires real-time images of the street and surrounding objects derived from cameras, LiDAR [a laser-based range-finding technology] and other on-board sensors." The researchers added that this precision is also important because automobiles connected to HERE's HD Live Map service will deliver data to the cloud on road conditions, traffic, weather, obstacles, speed limits and other variables, allowing the service to upgrade nearly in real-time to reflect changing conditions. "3D computer vision and Deep Neural Network are the technologies driving the development of high- definition live maps for self-driving cars," said Xin Chen, HERE senior engineering manager and research scientist. "We're excited to kick off a long-term research collaboration with Professors Wong and Fang individually based upon their expertise in this domain as well as with NYU as a top institution for research and learning in the field." "The convergence of cybersecurity, big data, wireless technology and artificial intelligence is already revolutionizing how people live and travel, and it holds the promise of safer transportation for billions across the globe," said NYU Dean of Engineering Katepalli R. Sreenivasan. "We gratefully acknowledge this research gift funding from HERE, which will advance the important work of Professors Wong and Fang and the students assisting them in this new frontier." The HERE mapping project joins a number of recent initiatives at NYU Tandon addressing safer and smarter transportation. The U.S. Department of Transportation selected a research consortium led by NYU Tandon Department of Civil and Urban Engineering researchers to become the first Tier 1 University Transportation Center (UTC) in New York City, dedicated to using data to make every mode of surface transportation — from walking to mass transit — more efficient and safe.  Another venture — headed by a cybersecurity research team in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering — is developing the first free, open-source method for automakers to secure software updates. Uptane will protect vehicles from cyber criminals and cyber war while providing the auto industry with an inexpensive and quick way to install safety fixes.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Performance, pricing details for AMD’s upcoming Ryzen CPU leak online Performance, pricing details for AMD’s upcoming Ryzen CPU leak online By Joel Hruska on February 13, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Over the weekend, a brace of leaks spilled critical information on how AMD’s Ryzen will compare with Intel’s Core i7 family, and how the chips will supposedly be priced. All of this information should be taken as preliminary and with a substantial grain of salt given the websites involved in leaking it and their records (WCCFTech’s in particular) of playing fast and loose with the truth. This is rumor, not fact, and should be treated equivalently. That said, these rumors are at least plausible. According to VideoCardz, which leaked the performance data, these numbers reflect a CPU without Turbo Mode, apparently running at a flat 3.4GHz. The RAM used was DDR4-2400, and not great DDR4 at that — timings were set to 17-17-17-39 2T. The motherboard was an MSI A320 board (meaning a budget model) rather than a high-end product. Clearly AMD felt these chips were close enough to shipping product to represent Ryzen, but there were obviously a few issues still to be sorted out. Furthermore, VC used Passmark, a synthetic test with limited value for telling us how performance will look in the real world. Caveats aside, let’s examine the data. These figures look plausible enough to me to be worth writing about, even if I wouldn’t draw any firm conclusions on them. Synthetic tests don’t always translate well to the real-world, and the CPU in question is clearly an early core. But what these figures show most importantly is an AMD that’s once again in a position to compete with Intel. CPU pricing will determine how much truth is in that statement, but let’s be honest for a moment — it doesn’t cost Intel anything like $400 to build a six-core processor and it certainly doesn’t cost $1000 to build an eight-core chip. These are price bands Intel has maintained solely to boost its own revenue. Even if you believe accusations of Intel acting in bad faith to slow the speed of performance improvements are unfounded (and I do), there’s no arguing that the company’s price structure is optimized to earn itself the most amount of money, not to push higher CPU core counts into markets that could plausibly use them. And speaking of rumors on pricing… Pricing, positioning details WCCFTech is claiming to have the full suite of AMD SKUs for its eight, six, and quad-core parts. According to the site, AMD will have a set of “Ryzen 3” parts with quad-core chips (no SMT), while “Ryzen 5” chips will a mixture of six-and-eight-core parts, all with SMT. The eight-core chips will be “Ryzen 7” models, and all of them will carry SMT as well. Supposedly all Ryzen cores will have a TDP between 65W and 95W. I am uncertain as to the validity of the entire SKU lineup and so will not address it in further detail. What’s more interesting are three specific claims WCCFTech makes about the “Ryzen 7” product family. If these figures are remotely in the ballpark, Intel is in for a world of hurt. The chip most closely resembling the Ryzen tested above is the Ryzen 7 1700X, a 3.4GHz chip with a 3.8GHz Turbo. The results above suggest (tentatively!) that AMD’s $389 core will land between the Core i7-6800K ($441) and the 6850K ($628). Meanwhile, the top-end Ryzen 4GHz chip will land at $500 — less than half the price of Intel’s current eight-core CPU family. That $389 price point could blow the quad-core Core i7 out of the water at an equivalent price and should be advantageous against the “middle” of Intel’s HEDT lineup. I suspect Intel will hold its fire and avoid changing its product lines further until it sees how Ryzen actually stacks up in representative suites of benchmarks. But these results could mean we’re about to see a competitive CPU market again for the first time in a half-decade. AMD doesn’t need to match Intel at every price point or SKU to build a compelling product; it just needs to offer a CPU that compares well with Intel in overall price/performance. Ryzen looks like it could be shaping up to do just that.

Linux Kernel 4.9.10 Has ARM, x86 and PowerPC Improvements, Updated Drivers GO All users of the Linux 4.9 kernel series must update Feb 15, 2017 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Greg Kroah-Hartman announced today the availability of the tenth maintenance update to the long-term supported and most advanced Linux kernel series, Linux 4.9, for all supported operating systems. Linux kernel 4.9.10 comes one week after the release of Linux kernel 4.9.9, and from the appended shortlog, it looks like it's a normal update that changes a total of 72 files, with 463 insertions and 290 deletions. As for what's included in this new point release of the Linux 4.9 kernel series, half of the patch includes updated drivers, this time for things like Intel i915, crypto, ACPI, CPUFreq, HV, InfiniBand, MD, NVDIMM, SCSI, and networking. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.9.10 kernel. All users of the 4.9 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.9.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.9.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. ARM, x86, and PowerPC improvements, updated sound stack The other half of the Linux kernel 4.9.10 patch is split between various improvements to the ARM, x86, and PowerPC (PPC) hardware architectures and updated networking (mac80211 and wireless) and sound stacks. There's also a little bit of perf, mm, and core kernel work, along with a fix for the Btrfs file system to address btrfs_compat_ioctl failures on non-compatible ioctls, and another SELinux fix for off-by-one in setprocattr. If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution that's powered by a kernel from the long-term supported Linux 4.9 branch, you are urged to update to today's 4.9.10 release as soon as possible, or as soon as the new version lands in the stable software repositories of your operating system. OS vendors are also urged to download the Linux kernel 4.9.10 source tarball from kernel.org or via our website, compile and tweak it for their supported architectures. #Linux 4.9.10#Linux kernel 4.9.10#Linux 4.9#Linux LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news GNOME Calendar App to Finally Add a Week View in GNOME 3.24, Flatpak Support Nautilus 3.24 File Manager Enters Beta, Adds New Keyboard Shortcuts and Features New Fedora 25 Live ISO Respins Now Available with Linux Kernel 4.9.8, Bug Fixes Flatpak Linux App Sandboxing Tool Now Works Out of the Box with OpenGL Drivers Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft’s February Security Updates to Launch in March    Linux kernel 4.9.10 released New Linux Apps mpv: A lightweight and high quality video player based on the mplayer2 and MPlayer projects Suricata: A network intrusion prevention and detection solution for Linux operating systems Google Chrome: The powerful, lightweight and easy-to-use web browser developed by the well known Google company Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds Clonezilla LiveCD: A Debian-based Live CD that allows you to clone hard disks without installing any software SQLite: The world's most widely deployed SQL database engine is now available on Softpedia Reader comments Mesa 17.0 Officially Released with OpenGL 4.5 Capability for Intel Haswell, More more on: Mesa 17.0.0 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It moved to TV in 1952 and in 2014 starting streaming games online. This Saturday night Hockey Night in Canada is going to do its first virtual reality (VR) broadcast when the Calgary Flames take on the Vancouver Canucks. The VR presentation was a long time comes and took several partnerships to make it happen. Beer producer Molson Canadian along with NHL rights holder Rogers Sportsnet are working together for this 360 VR game between the Flames and Canuck. Earlier this month, the NFL along with Intel produced a VR Super Bowl, but there will be a big difference between the Fox Sports VR and the one on Hockey Night in Canada. Hockey Night’s will be live as opposed to nearly live with the Fox Sports broadcast. This will mark the first time 360 VR will be used in an NHL broadcast. It will use the same concept as the VR Super Bowl, however, providing hockey fans a virtual front-row seat inside the arena. And, this 360 VR game will not be a one off, either. The plan is to have six consecutive Saturday night hockey broadcasts. You can watch the games live in 360 VR on Sportsnet.ca Web site and on the Sportsnet app by using special virtual reality viewfinders. These viewfinders are currently available only in select beer cases of Molson Canadian across Canada. The Molson VR headset is a kit with a unique pin code to access all the VR content along with instructions to download the VR compatible mobile Sportsnet app available on the App Store and Google Play. Three different 360 VR cameras will be used during the games, allowing viewers to experience the live action on the ice and take in the arena atmosphere. Similar to Fox Sports, Sportsnet will be providing behind-the-scenes footage and on-demand highlight videos in 360 VR for the pre-game show. Here is the line-up of Hockey Night in Canada games in 360 VR: Calgary Flames @ Vancouver Canucks – Saturday, Feb. 18 Montreal Canadiens @ Toronto Maple Leafs – Saturday, Feb. 25 Detroit Red Wings @ Edmonton Oilers – Saturday, March 4 Calgary Flames @ Winnipeg Jets – Saturday, March 11 Chicago Blackhawks @ Toronto Maple Leafs – Saturday, March 18 Ottawa Senators @ Montreal Canadiens – Saturday, March 25 Post to Twitter Post to Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share with Google+ More Articles Bell's MTS acquisition approved by federal regulators Tech-based creativity: 'interactive digital media' firms employ over 10K in Ontario Tech in Sports 360 VR, Google, NHL, Rogers, virtual reality, VR Related Content Reality, augmented: eSight device restores vision for the legally blind How Montreal’s Valnet uses multiple ad platforms to maximize its content’s value 6 types of misleading ads, sites, and scammers Google took down last year YouTube still a Super Bowl commercial destination for Canadians PageBooks Ayelet Baron – Author, speaker and futurist takes us on a journey to the future of work with an engaging series excerpted from her popular columns in ITBusiness.ca Read More Websites ITWC.ca IT World Canada.com Computer Dealer News.com Direction Informatique.com Publications CSO Digital CanadianCIO Computer Dealer News Computing Canada Community About Us Contact Us Subscribe Social Media Tech Videos Tech News Tech Blogs Tech Slideshows Tech Events CMO Digital Find Follow Produced By: © 2017 ITBusiness.ca

Data for these analytics is currently sourced through cameras in stadiums and courts and is incredibly expensive to acquire. In an effort to make big data analytics more accessible for the sports industry, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have utilized IoT devices--low-cost sensors and radios--that can be embedded into sports equipment (e.g., balls, rackets, and shoes), as well as in wearable devices. "There's a lot of interest in analyzing sports data though high-speed cameras, but a system can cost up to $1 million to implement and maintain. It's only accessible to big clubs," said Mahanth Gowda, a PhD candidate in computer science and lead author of the study, "Bringing IoT to Sports Analytics." "We want to cut down the expense significantly by replacing cameras with inexpensive internet-of-things devices (costing less than $100 in total) to make it possible for many other organizations to use the technology." The team--led by Romit Roy Choudhury, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at Illinois, jointly with Sharon Yang from Intel--has developed advanced motion tracking algorithms from the various incomplete and noisy measurements of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and wireless radios, fitted inside a ball and players' shoes. If the technology gains traction, real-time analytics should be possible at anytime, anywhere. The tiny sensors, which are wrapped in a protective case and distributed evenly in equipment, employ inferencing algorithms that can track movement to within a few centimeters. They can accurately characterize 3D ball motion, such as trajectory, orientation, and revolutions per second. "This level of accuracy and accessibility could help players in local clubs read their own performance from their smartphones via Bluetooth, or school coaches could offer quantifiable feedback to their students," said Roy Choudhury, who is also a research professor at Illinois' Coordinated Science Lab. The feedback could also help with detecting and analyzing player injuries, such as concussions. The sensor inside a soccer ball, for example, can measure how hard it hits a player's head, giving coaches an indication about whether to treat the player for head injury. "We've truly scratched the surface for applications with these sensors. The algorithms provide extremely fine-grained detail and accuracy in measurements, but use common measuring tools that can be found in any smartphone," said Gowda. The paper, to be published in USENIX NSDI 2017, explores tracking the 3D trajectory and spin parameters of a cricket ball; however, the core motion tracking techniques can be generalized to many different sports analytics. The team, composed of students Ashutosh Dhekne, Sheng Shen, along with other Intel collaborators, have also been developing methods to charge the sensors, including harvesting energy from the spin of the ball. "We're motivated to develop this technology to help coaches make better decisions on and off the field and provide enhanced entertainment to viewers," said Roy Choudhury. "We want to bring advanced but affordable sports analytics to everyone, anywhere, anytime." ### Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

Gen. Michael Flynn, left, attends a 10-year anniversary dinner for Russia Today with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Then-retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, left, attends a 10-year anniversary dinner for Russia Today with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Michael Klimentyev / EPA) Malcolm Lazin Imagine that President Donald Trump is awoken by his national security adviser because of a threat to America. Among Trump's options: put American troops in harm's way, call for drone strikes or launch a nuclear weapon. Until Monday, the national security adviser, who is not subject to Senate confirmation, was retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. After just 24 days on the job, Flynn entered the Guinness World Records for having served the shortest tenure as national security adviser. Among Flynn's transgressions was misleading Vice President Mike Pence about whether he discussed lifting sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. There are numerous important issues that require investigation. Among them is what was the vetting, extreme or otherwise, for this sensitive position? Gen. Flynn was "let go" as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Barack Obama, allegedly for his conspiracy theories, temperament and aberrant management skills. Was Obama or his national defense team contacted by the Trump transition team about Flynn? Following Gen. Flynn's termination as Obama's DIA director, Flynn formed Intel Group, which provided services for international clients, including lobbying on behalf of Turkey. In 2015, Flynn sat at Russian President Vladimir Putin's table at a dinner in Moscow marking the 10th anniversary of RT (formerly "Russia Today," the country's state-operated TV station). Flynn appeared on the English-language global cable network that's described by U.S. intelligence as "the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet." Were these potential conflicts vetted? For Trump's presidential campaign, Flynn was a top military adviser; spoke at rallies and the Republican National Convention; and joined "Lock Her Up" anti-Hillary Clinton chants at Trump campaign events. To what extent did these partisan activities play into his appointment? Before being named the national security adviser, Flynn misled then Vice President-elect Mike Pence about Flynn's son needing a security clearance. To what extent did vetting include instances of Flynn providing misinformation to senior officials? Russia denies that intelligence agents were in contact with Trump's campaign team Democrats push for an independent inquiry into White House ties with Russia. Democrats push for an independent inquiry into White House ties with Russia. See more videos It was reported that the Russians had allegedly hacked into and leaked information harmful to Hillary Clinton and that Trump aides had contact with Russian intelligence operatives. Was there an inquiry into whether Flynn was among those under scrutiny? Trending on social media are the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution and the Logan Act. Among other federal officials, the clause prohibits those with military title from receiving money from a foreign government without the consent of Congress. Flynn is under Army investigation for taking money from the Russians. Was that investigation considered in the vetting? The Logan Act bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign government. Violation of the act carries a fine and a criminal penalty. Did Flynn's pre-inauguration conversations with Ambassador Kislyak violate the Logan Act? As a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney, I prosecuted cases involving making false statements to the government including FBI agents. Having intercepted Flynn's conversations with Kislyak and possibly others, the FBI within days after the inauguration interviewed Flynn. If Flynn was untruthful, he could be sentenced to prison for up to five years. In response to Flynn's resignation, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said, "I think the situation has taken care of itself." Republican Sen. Rand Paul opined that "it makes no sense" for Republicans to investigate Republicans. GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, intoned, "It just seems like there's a lot of nothing there." With a Republican majority in the House and Senate, this national security imbroglio requires an independent inquiry. An inquiry with subpoena power and adequate staffing and budget and led by a pre-eminently qualified and respected American. Among those on the top of the list is Colin Powell, a retired four-star general and former national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state. As to potential criminal violations, the information should be turned over to an independent special prosecutor. Malcolm Lazin is a former Department of Justice attorney and a former chair of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission.

James has earned more than $600 million since turning pro in 2003. James’ salary this season is $31 million after re-signing with the Cavs this summer for three years and $99.9 million, while he'll make $55 million in off-court earnings. James added endorsement deals with Intel and Verizon over the last year, while parting ways with Samsung and Tencent. The new partners join Nike, Coca-Cola (Sprite), Beats Electronics and Kia Motor in James’ endorsement stable with James “lifetime” Nike deal potentially worth $1 billion, according to his business manager Maverick Carter. Kevin Durant will make the second most money this season with earnings of $62.5 million, followed by Stephen Curry at $47.1 million. Curry’s $12.1 million salary ranks No. 83 in the NBA but he will make $35 million off the court. Rounding out the top five highest-paid NBA players are James Harden ($46.5 million) and Russell Westbrook ($41.5 million).

Apple is currently doing opposite, pushing back against shareholders who are calling for the company to accelerate its efforts. A small group of shareholders led by investor Tony Maldonado have submitted a proposal to Apple asking the company to “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy...to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If the proposal is approved, it would require Apple to make diversity a priority when hiring at the top levels of the company. The timeline and initiatives put in place would be up to Apple, the proposal would just get the ball moving a bit faster. Maldonado has suggested tying executive pay to diversity goals—a move that Intel and Microsoft have made—or adopting a policy that would require the company to regularly search for potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. According to the company’s 2016 report, 87 of its 107 executive or senior official positions are held by men, and 88 of those seats are occupied by a white person. It is the second year that Maldonado has submitted his suggestion to increase diversity, though he has additional support in his effort this year thanks to backing from Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that emphasizes what it calls “socially responsible investing.” Related Stories Tech Industry Trails Behind When It Comes To Diversity, New Report Shows Apple Planning To Fight ‘Right To Repair’ Bill Despite the support, Maldonado’s suggestion is unlikely to pass, thanks in large part to opposition from Apple. The company has advised shareholders to vote against the proposal, according to a filing from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Apple told shareholders in the letter that it is already exploring diversity efforts across its workforce and has made progress in attracting “more women and underrepresented minorities.” According to Apple, Maldonado’s proposal is “not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple has made strides in its diversity efforts. The company has reportedly removed pay disparities among its employees and has made some progress in its diversity hires. However, much of the changes have happened at the retail and non-tech parts of the company. Maldonado may not get the policy passed this year, but he doesn’t need the full support of shareholders to continue pushing his initiative. Last year the proposal got just over five percent support among shareholders, which was above the three percent threshold required to allow him to submit the idea again this year. He’ll need six percent support to be able to submit again in 2018. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Falcon Northwest's Oculus Ready desktops get a splash of Kaby Lake by Eric Born  2:00 PM on February 15, 2017 Boutique builder Falcon Northwest has a long history of working with Oculus, having built development and demo rigs for the VR headset maker for a few years now. Falcon Northwest's support for the Oculus Ready program continues with its new Tiki and Talon desktop configurations, both recently upgraded with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Falcon Northwest's Oculus Ready Tiki desktop has a slim 4" wide chassis, but that's enough room for some serious hardware. Buyers can choose between Core i5-7500, Core i5-7600K, and Core i7-7700K CPUs, and there's liquid cooling available as an option. The Tiki ships with either 16GB or 32GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 2400 MT/s. Graphics card options on the Nvidia side include the GeForce GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, and Titan X, along with a small selection of Quadro cards. AMD's RX480 is also an option for buyers. The Oculus Ready Talon system is designed to give users the option of adding a second graphics card down the road—or immediately, if a single Titan X just won't cut it. The Talon has the same processor and graphics cards options as the Tiki, but its larger motherboard has enough slots for a total 64GB of RAM. The Talon's beefy 750W power supply means that installing a second graphics card probably won't require grabbing a new PSU. The Oculus Ready Tiki system equipped with a GTX 1080 and an i7-7700K starts at $3040. A similarly-configured Talon starts at $3200. Prices vary significantly depending on components and extras. Interested folks can configure a custom Tiki or Talon at Falcon Northwest's website.   Tags: Graphics Systems Gaming Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Hynes Convention Center in Boston. It was the latest testament to growing adoption of Apache Spark, and the event underscored promising developments in areas including machine learning, deep learning and streaming applications. The Summit had outgrown last year's east coast home at the New York Hilton, but the contrast between those cramped quarters and the cavernous Hynes made comparison difficult. As I wrote of last year's event, the audience was technical, and if anything, this year's agenda seemed more how-to than visionary. There were fewer keynotes from big enterprise adopters and more from vendors. Mataei Zaharia of Databricks recapped Spark progress last year, highlighting growing adoptionand performance improvements in areas including streaming data analysis. The Summit saw plenty of mainstream talks on SQL and machine learning best practices as well as more niche topics, such "Spark for Scalable Metagenomics Analysis" and "Analysis Andromeda Galaxy Data Using Spark." Standout big-picture keynotes included the following: Mataei Zaharia, the founder of Spark and chief technology officer at Databricks, gave an overview of recent progress and coming developments in the open source project. The centerpiece of Zaharia's talk concerned maturing support for continuous applications requiring simultaneous analysis of both historical and streaming, real-time information. One of the many use cases is fraud analysis, where you need to continuously compare the latest, streaming information with historical patterns in order to detect abnormal activity and reject possibly fraudulent transactions in real time. Spark already addressed fast batch analytics, but support for streaming was previously limited to micro-batch (meaning up to seconds of latency) until last February's Spark 2.0 release. Zaharia said even more progress was made with December's Spark 2.1 release with advances on Structured Streaming, a new, high-level API that addresses both batch and stream querying. Viacom, an early beta customer, is using Structured Streaming to analyze viewership of cable channels including MTV and Comedy Central in real time while iPass is using it to continuously monitor WiFi network performance and security. Alexis Roos, a senior engineering manager at Salesforce, detailed the role of Spark in powering the machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning behind emerging Salesforce Einstein capabilities. Addressing the future of artificial intelligence on Spark, Ziya Ma, a VP of Big Data Technologies at Intel, offered a keynote on "Accelerating Machine Learning and Deep Learning at Scale with Apache Spark." James Kobielus of IBM does a good job of recapping Deep Learning progress on Spark in this blog. Ion Stoica, executive chairman of Databricks, picked up where Zaharia left off on streaming, detailing the efforts of UC Berkeley's RISELab, the successor of AMPLab, to advance real-time analytics. Stoica shared benchmark performance data showing advances promised by Apache Drizzle, a new streaming execution engine for Spark, in comparison with Spark without Drizzle and streaming-oriented rival Apache Flink. Stoica stressed the time- and cost-saving advantages of using a single API, the same execution engine and the same query optimizations to address both streaming and batch workloads. In a conversation after his keynote, Stoica told me Drizzle will likely debut in Databricks' cloud-based Spark environment within a matter of weeks and he predicted that it will show up in Apache Spark software as soon as the third quarter of this year. The Apache Drizzle execution engine being developed by RISELabs promises better streaming query performance as compared to today's Spark or Apache Flink. MyPOV of Spark Progress Databricks is still measuring Spark success in terms of number of contributors and number of Spark Meetup participants (the latter count is 300,000-plus, according to Zaharia), but to my mind, it's time to start measuring success by mainstream enterprise adoption. That's why I was a bit disappointed that the Summit's list of presenters in the CapitalOne, Comcast, Verizon and Walmart Labs mold was far shorter than the list of vendors and Internet giants like Facebook and Netflix presenting. Databricks says it now has somewhere north of 500 organizations using its hosted Spark Service, but I suspect the bulk of mainstream Spark adoption is now being driven by the likes of Amazon (first and foremost) as well as IBM, Google, Microsoft and others now offering cloud-based Spark services. A key appeal of these sources of Spark is the availability of infrastructure and developer services as well as broader analytical capabilities beyond Spark. Meanwhile, as recently as last summer I heard Cloudera executives assert that the company's software distribution was behind more Spark adoption than that of any other vendor. In a though-provoking keynote on "Virtualizing Analytics," Arsalan Tavakoli, Databricks' VP of customer engagement, dismissed Hadoop-based data lakes as a "second-generation" solution challenged by disparate and complex tools and access limited to big data developer types. But Tavakoli also acknowledged that Spark is only "part of the answer" to delivering a "new paradigm" that decouples compute and storage, provides uniform data management and security, unifies analytics and supports broad collaboration among many users. Indeed, it was telling when Zaharia noted that 95% of Spark users employ SQL in addition to whatever else they're doing with the project. That tells me that Spark SQL is important, but it also tells me that as appealing as Spark's broad analytical capabilities and in-memory performance may be, it's still just part of the total analytics picture. Developers, data scientists and data engineers that use Spark are also using non-Spark options ranging from the prosaic, like databases and database services and Hive, to the cutting edge, such as emerging GPU- and high-performance-computing-based options. As influential, widely adopted, widely supported and widely available as Spark may now be, organizations have a wide range of cost, latency, ease-of-development, ease-of-use and technology maturity considerations that don't always point to Spark. At least one presentation at Spark Summit cautioned attendees not to think of Spark Streaming, for example, as a panacea for next-generation continuous applications. Spark is today where Hadoop was in 2010, as measured by age, but I would argue that it's progressing more quickly and promises wider hands-on use by developers and data scientists than that earlier disruptive platform.

If the company does in fact announce an full unveiling date, plus a “teaser” for the device, MWC should be pretty exciting for Galaxy fans. With that said, though, all intel we currently have points to a late-March unveiling, followed by a mid-April US launch. As of today, the general belief among Android bloggers is that Samsung will have two versions of the S8: The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Both devices could potentially feature fancy AMOLED “Infinity” displays, Snapdragon 835 processors, plus plenty of other bells and whistles. MWC is right around the corner.

Synacks are you still stuck on those older 2yr contracts? john lens Im on prepaid, but I will be skipping S8 since I dont think it will be much of an upgrade. Osaz E. You messed up on that one. Should have skipped the S7 instead. That was the small upgrade, john lens I had the S5, skipped s6, and now I own S7. LOL Turb0wned S7 was a huge step forward from the crap S6. Me It was.

Shawn Spring Looking forward to a packed MWC with stuff from LG, Huawei, this from Sammy, and perhaps a surprise or two from someone else? Synacks I’m just glad I can actually have a choice between Samsung and something else this time of the year. The G6 is shaping up to be a decent device while Samsung is still exploring the boundaries of the 5th gen Edge devices. I wish they’d be a little less edgy so when I hand my phone to people they aren’t clicking literally everything on the sides of the screen. 2001400ex Between this and G6. Here’s hoping for removable battery and SD card. Things that have kept me on my G3. DanG SD card = yes Removable battery = no Even LG doesn’t have removable battery this for G6. discopunkk LG is pretty much killing off the removable batteries for their phones. The G6 won’t have it and if they do another LG V phone I could see them dropping it from that too. Sadly 2017 will be the end of flagship phones with them. 2001400ex Exactly. I can still hope. I don’t need one to change out daily. But I have bought 3 new batteries for my G3. Cheap way to refresh your phone. discopunkk I’m bummed about it but I expected it. I get that water resistance is a big thing but honestly I don’t need to use my phone in the shower, tub, pool, etc. I’ve been a smartphone user since 2007 and I have not ONCE got a phone wet. D in B i’m sure its going to be great, but i’m not excited at all. Lucky Armpit This will replace my N6 and I really can’t wait. Samsung truly has some of the best hardware out there.

Samsung Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, executive editor at The Verge and editor at large of Recode. About a year ago, I wrote a column suggesting what the major tech companies should try and accomplish in 2016. For Google, I said: “It would be pretty great if Chromebooks could, out of the box, run all Android apps — provided that, unlike on the recent Pixel C tablet, the Android apps were able to adapt better to a bigger screen.” I’m happy to report that the first Chromebook designed from the ground up to run Android apps out of the box has arrived, albeit a little past the end of 2016. It goes on sale this week for $450. It’s called the Samsung Chromebook Plus, and it runs on an ARM processor, the same type of processor that powers the vast majority of smartphones and tablets. It was designed in close cooperation with Google. Alas, in my tests of the Plus over the last few days, I found the Android execution frustrating. Google Play The Android app feature is still in beta, not all apps work, and too many of those that do run seem like awkwardly blown-up phone apps, not software that’s tailored for the Chromebook's 12-inch screen. And there are other issues. Of course, the Plus, which has a touchscreen and comes with a stylus, is still a Chromebook. That means it runs the Chrome OS along with Android apps. And, purely as a Chromebook, it’s very nice. Chrome OS, which is basically a browser that runs everything, including web apps, does fine on this model and its ARM processor. But if you’re looking for a laptop-style, bigger-screen version of your favorite Android phone, I can’t recommend the Plus now. Optimizing a large number of Android apps for the Chromebook is “going to be a long process, to be honest,” one Google official conceded, noting the beta label on the Google Play Store for the Chromebook. Samsung A second, very similar, new Samsung Chromebook, the Pro, is due out in April. The only significant difference between the two is that the Pro runs on a low-end Intel processor and costs $100 more. I tested it briefly, and found it to be even buggier in its current, very pre-release state. I won’t say much about the otherwise identical hardware on these two Samsung machines, since I think it’s the Google-driven Android / Chrome OS combo software that’s their key claim to fame. Their screens are vivid, sharp and responsive. As on many laptops, you can rotate the screen around so that the relatively thin, light, 2.4-pound laptop becomes a relatively heavy, thick tablet. The stylus fits nicely in a slot and works well for things like screen capture, taking handwritten notes and annotating images. The overall design isn’t especially sexy or sleek. The keyboard lacks a backlight, and the touchpad is a tad small. In my tests, battery life was just shy of eight hours, even with heavy web and app use and streaming a full-length movie. For a better understanding of the hardware (as well as his own take on the software), I recommend my colleague Dieter Bohn’s reviews of the Plus and the Pro. Android writ large. Um, no. Compared to running apps on a smartphone, or, more aptly, an iPad, the app experience on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is distinctly subpar. There are likely several reasons for this. Even though this laptop uses the same processor family most Android devices use, the apps are running atop Chrome OS. Google deserves credit for making this work at all, but it’s still a bit laggy and buggy. For instance, in one case I ran into, two Android apps on the Plus were open but unusable, because they kept blinking and jumping in front and in back of each other rapidly. This happened while I was on the phone with a Google exec who worked on the project. He said it was a known bug that will be patched this week. And there are other bugs. In my tests, Android apps just crashed or froze multiple times a day on the Plus. Even a hugely popular app like Facebook only loaded into part of the screen with an endless spinning circle in a blank right rail. And Google’s own Gmail crashed when I was attaching a photo to a message. Samsung But there’s a larger, more fundamental problem: Android apps, including Google’s own, are almost never designed to look right and run right on a large screen — even a standard-sized tablet, let alone a laptop. There are two elements to this. One is visual: Many Android apps look like blown-up phone apps. Some, like Google News & Weather and Google Docs, don’t seem to resize for the bigger screen, so they present a relatively narrow column of text swimming in unnaturally large borders. Others, like Facebook Messenger, stretch the text horizontally to fill the space, in a weird way that makes the type tiny. The other is functional: Most Android apps I downloaded to the Plus didn’t use the larger screens to add helpful extra panels or other UI elements, but still had the narrow, cramped UI of a phone screen. This is in stark contrast to the way iOS apps behave on larger iPad screens versus iPhone screens. For instance, on the iPad, Facebook Messenger has two panels — one for contacts and one for conversations. It doesn’t look like the single-column version on iPhones and Android phones — and on the Plus. That’s because Apple has long given developers the tools and the encouragement to do dual (or “universal”) versions of their apps, and its app store installs the bigger-screen versions on iPads. Samsung Google says it is working hard to do this, but it has been saying that for years. The company says it’s optimizing its own apps for the Chromebook and urging third parties to do the same. But, judging from the 20 or so well-known Android apps I tested, this process is just starting. The company conceded it had done special work to make several of its most popular Android apps, such as Gmail and Google Calendar, look and work well. But it also said that it believes most Chromebook users will still use many productivity apps like these in the browser. Another issue: In tablet mode, apps are always full screen. You can’t create the multi-app views or even narrow sidebar views of apps that you can on an iPad or a Windows tablet. Google says this will be possible in a future release. Bottom line If you buy the Chromebook Plus and intend to use it mainly as a Chromebook, I expect you’ll have a good experience. But if you plan to rely heavily on Android apps, you’re basically buying into the start of a journey, replete with odd-looking presentations of familiar apps, bugs and crashes. You can certainly go along with Google and Samsung on this journey, but I can’t recommend that for a mainstream Android lover who just wants things to work right.

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) has the story. Buzz60 The rapidly unfolding saga of President Trump and the connections between the Russian government, Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Trump administration involves a series of political operatives, government officials and diplomats worthy of a John le Carré novel. Here are some of they key players. Paul Manafort Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, represented the former leader of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, when the longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin ran Ukraine. A longtime lobbyist in Washington and international political consultant, Manafort signed on to run Trump's campaign but left in August following disclosures that his name surfaced in secret ledgers kept by the Yanukovych government that showed he was paid $12.7 million. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Manafort spoke last year to Russian intelligence officials in telephone calls that were monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, Manafort denied any contact with Russian officials, either directly or indirectly. Michael Flynn The recently departed national security adviser worked for the state-owned Russia Today after he was fired by former president Barack Obama as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He advocated for closer relations with Russia. In 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow to speak at the 10th anniversary gala for Russia Today in an event also attended by Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid for the visit, which — if not approved by the secretaries of Defense and State — would violate federal law. He has not said how much he was paid or whether it was approved. His downfall started when U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a telephone call from Flynn to Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, in which the two discussed new sanctions to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. Russia Today was identified in an intelligence assessment as one of the Kremlin's top purveyors of propaganda and misinformation in the 2016 presidential election, leading to a heightened sensitivity over Flynn's participation in the event, which Flynn said was arranged by a speaker's bureau. House Democrats have called for an investigation into those connections. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) Carter Page Page, who runs an investment company called Global Energy Capital, was named as an early foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He was accused last year by former Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., of being a conduit between Trump and the Russian government, which Page denied. Last year, Page gave a speech in which he accused the U.S. government of having a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” toward Russia and other former Soviet republics. Vladimir Putin The president of Russia has been the source of fascination for Trump for years. During the 2016 election, both Trump and Vice President Pence, then the governor of Indiana, praised Putin's leadership style in contrast to Obama's. The Kremlin has denied that Putin had anything to do with the Russian-led hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails, which spawned a series of leaks from the website WikiLeaks during the final weeks of the 2016 general election campaign. WikiLeaks published multiple emails from John Podesta, a longtime associate of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, that cast Clinton and the campaign in a negative light. Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2014.  (Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AFP/Getty Images) Sergey Kislyak Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, received a telephone call from Flynn last December in which the two men discussed new sanctions that were to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. The Obama administration also expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States for their alleged role in interfering with the U.S. elections, a move that was expected to bring a Russian response. Instead, Putin elected to do nothing.

USA TODAY NETWORK Former national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday night, but the saga involving his and President Trump's campaign's connections to the Russian government and the controversy surrounding Russian interference in the 2016 election remains. Here's a timeline of key events. July 2012 Flynn is named director of the Defense Intelligence Agency as a three-star general. June 19, 2013 Donald Trump, then a private businessman, tweeted that the Miss Universe Pageant, which he owned, would be held that November in Moscow. He asked whether Putin would attend and whether he would become Trump's new best friend. April 2014 The White House moves to fire Flynn over his brusque management style.   Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013 September 2015 The FBI informs the Democratic National Committee that a Russian-linked cyber-spy group had likely compromised its computer network. February 2016 Flynn tweets that fear of Muslims is "rational." Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU— General Flynn (@GenFlynn) February 27, 2016 May 6, 2016 Trump says in a television interview that he knows Russia well. "I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success," Trump said. June 14, 2016 Russian government hackers penetrated DNC servers, according to The Washington Post. The Russian government denied the charges. July 20, 2016 Flynn leads chants of “Lock Her Up!” at the Republican National Convention aimed at Hillary Clinton. “You know why we’re saying that? We’re saying that because if I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth of what (Clinton) did I would be in jail today.” July 22, 2016 WikiLeaks releases private emails from DNC officials in the days leading up to the Democratic National Convention. Some of the emails showed DNC staffers favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. July 27, 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump says he doubts Russian involvement in the DNC hack. But he invites them to hack into emails Clinton had deemed personal and deleted for her official account when she was secretary of State. “I will tell you this, Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Donald Trump holds a press conference on July 27, 2016 in Doral, Fla.  (Photo: Gustavo Caballero, Getty Images) Sept. 26, 2016 Trump, in his first debate with Clinton, continues to express skepticism about Russian involvement. “I mean it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?” Oct. 7, 2016 Government intelligence officials call out the Russians for the first time on the hacks. The director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security say they have confidence that “the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including U.S. political organizations.” WikiLeaks also releases the first batch of emails from the personal account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman. Nov. 8, 2016 Trump beats Clinton in presidential election. Nov. 18, 2016 Trump names Flynn as his national security adviser. “I am pleased that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,” Trump said. Dec. 9, 2016 President Obama orders a review of foreign attempts to tamper with U.S. elections. Trump dismisses the CIA’s finding that the Russians sought to sway the election in his favor. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” Dec. 12, 2016 Republican leaders announce that congressional committees will investigate the CIA findings. Dec. 16, 2016 Obama says the Russian government, at the “highest levels,” initiated the hacks of emails, not voting machines. He vows to retaliate. President Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House on Dec. 16, 2016.  (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Dec. 28, 2016 Trump, responding to reports of impending sanctions against Russia, says, “I think we ought to get on with our lives.” Dec. 29, 2016 Obama announces the Russian sanctions, which include expelling 35 Russian diplomats and the closing of Russian compounds in Maryland and New York that had been suspected of spying. Trump insists the issue should be put to bed but agrees to meet with intelligence officials for a briefing. “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump says. Flynn has conversations about this time with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, and urged Russia not to retaliate. The call was captured on a wiretap of diplomats’ calls. Jan. 12, 2017 Washington Post columnist David Ignatius first reports that Flynn had conversations with Kislyak. Jan. 13, 2017 Trump press aide Sean Spicer acknowledges one call between Flynn and Kislyak but says it was for “logistical information.” Jan. 22, 2017 Flynn is sworn in as national security adviser, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. Michael Flynn arrives for a White House senior staff swearing-in ceremony in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 22, 2017.  (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) Jan. 26, 2017 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates informs the White House counsel that Flynn lied about the nature of his calls with Kislyak and is vulnerable to blackmail. Feb. 8, 2017 Flynn denies discussing sanctions with Russian officials in an interview with The Washington Post. A spokesman for Flynn later tries to amend Flynn’s comments, saying Flynn had “no recollection” of discussing sanctions. Feb. 10, 2017 Trump says he’s not aware of the Post report that Flynn may have discussed sanctions but will look into it. Feb. 13, 2017 White House adviser Kellyanne Conway tells MSNBC that Trump has “full confidence” in Flynn. Hours later, Flynn resigns, saying he had “inadvertently briefed the Vice President-Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador.” Feb. 14, 2017 Spicer says Trump asked Flynn to resign because of an “erosion of trust.” Feb. 15, 2017 The New York Times reports that telephone records and intercepted calls show that "members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election."

Bottom Line It may take some time to integrate into your workflow, but the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 is a powerful portable drawing device that offers the full Windows 10 experience, fast components, and top-notch build quality. By Matthew Buzzi, James Jacobsen There are plenty of tools on the market designed to aid digital creation, but many are hampered by their software or a physical setup that requires you to stay at your desk. The Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 (starts at $2,399.95; $2,999.95 as tested), on the other hand, is a drawing tablet that works equally well in your office, at home, or on the road. It's a highly specialized product that will take some adjustment to use to the utmost. But because it runs full Windows 10, you have a virtually unlimited selection of powerful software choices. This, combined with fast components, a high-resolution display, and a comfortable and intuitive pen, the MobileStudio Pro 16 is a capable, thoughtfully designed tablet for artists. //Compare Similar Products Compare Microsoft Surface Book (2016, Intel Core i7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iPad Pro (12.9 inch)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Aspire Switch 11 V (SW5-173-632W)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Transformer Book T100HA   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo Miix 510   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Surface Pro 4   %displayPrice%%seller% Xplore XSlate R12   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Switch Alpha 12   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Spectre x2   %displayPrice%%seller% Your Mobile Canvas The tablet reviewed here is the larger and more potent of the two versions of the MobileStudio Pro (the other is the more modestly outfitted 13-inch MobileStudio Pro 13, which ranges in price from $1,499.95 to $2,499.95). The display itself is 15.6 inches, while the tablet as a whole measures 0.75 by 16.5 by 10.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.86 pounds. Holding it in one arm can get tiring quickly, but you're more likely to rest it in your lap or on a desk when drawing, anyway. (The Wacom Stand, sold separately for $99.95, can prop up the MobileStudio Pro 16 at a variety of angles, too.) There are silicone grips on the rear side of the tablet at both ends, for the times you are holding or propping it up. The black and silver color scheme gives the tablet a sleek look. View All 12 Photos in Gallery The roomy touch display's resolution is 4K (3,840 by 2,160); any artist should appreciate this, as higher resolution is better for individual pixel work. Images look vibrant, and the finish prevents irritating reflections. The display covers 94 percent of the Adobe RGB color spectrum, which is good, though it's a bit disappointing that this art-focused device does not hit 100 percent. Laptops aimed at creatives often boast 100 percent coverage to reproduce completely accurate colors, which is important for matching what you see on the screen to real-life colors on samples or prints. Multiple Ways to Create In addition to the touch-screen input, there are a number of physical buttons to help with executing controls and shortcuts. On the left-hand side are a four-direction rocker ring with a middle-click button, and two columns of four buttons above and below it. (Other Wacom devices have buttons like these in the same place, so if you've used one of those, you should have an easy time adapting.) These buttons are designed to save you the time needed to head back up to the toolbar if you're not using a keyboard, and having a set of commands on hand speeds up any process once you memorize the setup. (You could, of course, connect the tablet to a keyboard via Bluetooth so you can use key combinations you're more familiar with, but that would reduce the MobileStudio Pro's portability somewhat.) By using the Wacom Tablet Properties interface (accessible through Windows or the Wacom Desktop Center app), you can assign a variety of different shortcuts to these hardware controls. You may want to configure the touch ring to rotate or auto scroll, one button to activate a specific key combination, a third to act as the Shift key, and so on, and you can have a different set of assignments for each program you use (Photoshop and Illustrator are somewhat different, after all). Through the Wacom utility you can also make other adjustments, such as deactivating the touch screen in Illustrator, so you don't have to worry about your hand smudging the digital canvas. Last but certainly not least is the included Wacom Pro Pen 2, which is your main tool for manipulating the touch screen. It features 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity, as well as tilt and multitouch support. The back end can be used as an eraser, a concept inherently comfortable to most users, and the two slim buttons toward the tip can either be used for their default functions of left- and right-clicking, or be assigned different commands in the Wacom app. You can read our artist's impressions of using the pen below, but it's highly customizable, and its lack of battery removes a potentially irritating aspect of digital art. Like the Apple Pencil, which is designed to work with the Apple iPad Pro, the Pen 2 lets you make the most of the MobileStudio Pro. Full Windows Power As mentioned, the MobileStudio Pro 16 is a full Windows 10 tablet, not merely a drawing device that runs pared-down versions of creative software. That means it supports the same programs you're used to on a PC, and may also be used for browsing the web, checking your email, and doing anything else you can on manage on your laptop. The on-board SSD has a capacity of 512GB, which is a good amount for storing all different types of media projects and other files, though it could potentially fill up relatively quickly if you have a lot of raw photos or 4K video clips. In addition to Bluetooth 4.1, the MobileStudio features 802.11ac wireless, a 5-megapixel (MP) front camera, and an 8MP back camera equipped with Intel RealSense technology for capturing objects in 3D space. (You also get a 12-month license for using Artec Studio 11 Ultimate 3D scanning and processing software.) To reduce lag or delay while working in your favorite demanding Adobe program (and to generally run all Windows programs quickly), there's a 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7-6567U processor and 16GB of memory. On the graphics side, there's a professional-class Nvidia Quadro M1000M discrete card. Other physical buttons and ports include a Power slider on the left flank alongside a headphone jack, volume buttons, and an SD card slot. The right edge holds three USB-C ports for charging with the included power brick and connecting peripherals (there are no USB Type-A ports, so you'll need adapters if they don't already use USB-C), as well as a Kensington security slot. Performance Because the MobileStudio Pro 16 is designed for a different purpose and audience than conventional Windows tablets or laptops, and because we haven't reviewed many directly comparable products, we didn't perform our typical full battery of performance tests. Still, to get an idea of how it stacks up to other tablets, we pitted it against the 2016 Microsoft Surface Book ($3,299 in our review configuration) in two of our basic performance tests. On PCMark 8 Work Conventional, the MobileStudio Pro 16's score of 2,637 was just a few steps behind the Surface Book's (2,735). And with its score of 368, the Wacom surpassed the Surface Book's 326 on the CineBench R15 rendering test. Given the systems' similar processors, these performance numbers were not surprising. In any case, you should have little trouble running any of the software you need to do your everyday design work. On our battery rundown test, the MobileStudio Pro 16 lasted 3 hours, 43 minutes. That's quite close to what we saw when we ran a similar test on the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro (3:51), but nowhere close to the Surface Book's 15:41. As with a gaming laptop, the MobileStudio Pro 16 is big enough that you won't likely use it very far away from a power outlet for long periods of time, whereas the Surface Book and similar tablets are designed specifically to travel with you. Wacom rates the MobileStudio Pro 16's battery life at about 6 hours, and under normal usage conditions, which doesn't seem out of the question, and when our designer tested the tablet (see the next section), he had no specific complaints about the battery life. Still, the MobileStudio Pro 16's battery life is not legendary, so keep that in mind while planning your day. An Artist's Perspective If you're interested in using the MobileStudio Pro 16 for its intended purpose of drawing, chances are its exact performance will matter less to you than how it functions in the real world of design. To learn how it fares in the hands of a genuine creative type, one of PCMag's in-house designers, James Jacobsen, tested the tablet for a couple of weeks and attempted to integrate it into his normal workflow. Here's his description of his experience. General comments. With the available screen real estate, the program interfaces feel clean, and for the most part the MobileStudio Pro 16 is fast and responsive. Using the pen quickly became second nature in my testing. Web searching by handwriting-to-text conversion was about 95 percent accurate, though that will vary depending on your penmanship. On the whole, the screen looks on par with, or maybe even better than, the display on my 15-inch MacBook Pro. And the shortcut buttons' placement is vastly superior here, as a keyboard often gets between you and the screen. Adobe Photoshop. One distinctive feature of the MobileStudio Pro 16 while using Photoshop is canvas rotation, so you can easily change your point of view on what you're drawing just by pinching and rotating the image on the screen. This is an interesting bonus that might be good for print designers, but as I primarily work on the web, I didn't find it all that helpful; most of my work is straight-on. But for those who do draw and sketch in Photoshop, this is a clear plus over competing tablets. The shortcut buttons are nice, but as I rely heavily on muscle memory, learning them was not easy. A week or two using the MobileStudio Pro wasn't enough to fully adjust to the system, and I often had to switch back to my MacBook to meet my deadlines. To see if it was just me, I handed the tablet off to one of my colleagues in the art department, who became frustrated and gave up after only 30 minutes. While I don't see the buttons as major negatives if you have the time to commit to them, it may take you a while if you've been using the same keyboard shortcuts for years. Adobe Illustrator. The first thing I noticed was a bit of lag when I opened a 460MB multilayered vector file. I sometimes experience some lag on my MacBook when opening this file if I have other programs running, but Illustrator was the only thing running on the MobileStudio at the time. All of my drawing and illustrating is done in Illustrator, so I was excited to use it to test the limits of the rotating canvas. To my dismay, however, it wasn't available. I searched for about half an hour, but found nothing that indicated it was a feature, which is confusing given its inclusion in Photoshop. (Others online mentioned noticing its absence as well.) This would be good functionality to add for Illustrator. Handling vectors and points with the pen was amazing, though. I felt like I had a lot more control moving and adjusting my vectors than I do with a mouse. Drawing felt natural and accurate, almost as if I was using pen and paper. If there's any single incentive to push through all the relearning the MobileStudio Pro 16 requires, it would be to do all my illustrations and artwork. Worth It, If You Can Commit Ultimately, the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 is best seen as a drawing tablet with an unusually rich set of capabilities. It can't really replace a full computer, but it gives you a lot of opportunities you don't get with other portable drawing devices or even the (far less expensive) Apple iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. The ability the PC-grade components give you to run full-featured software is a big plus, as you don't have to worry about compromising on features. And the screen's spacious surface and high resolution are ideal for Illustrator and other drawing programs; you're unlikely to find a more enjoyable or intuitive way to use them. For the MobileStudio Pro 16 to be worth its high price, you have to know you need it, and be willing to invest the necessary time to master its unique features and commit to learning them inside and out. If not, you may be better off with a more traditional Wacom device or a tablet like the iPad Pro or the Microsoft Surface Book. But if you're a determined digital artist who can afford it (or have your employer provide it for you), the MobileStudio Pro 16 is a very appealing solution you will likely come to love.

Published on February 15, 2017. TBWA/Chiat/Day L.A. Chief Creative Officer Renato Fernandez Credit: TBWA Most Popular TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles has named Renato Fernandez its new chief creative officer. Mr. Fernandez steps up from his former post of executive creative director at the agency's Los Angeles headquarters, filling the post vacated by Brent Anderson, who last fall became CCO of TBWA/Media Arts Lab. Mr. Fernandez joined the agency as an ACD in 2011 and has overseen TBWA's Gatorade work both in the States and globally. He first took charge of the U.S. account in 2014 but then in 2015 moved up to assume leadership of all global projects as worldwide creative director. Mr. Fernanadez's arrival comes at a major turning point for the Omnicom agency. Late last week, the holding company announced it was shifting Nissan, one of the agency's top three clients which it has overseen since 1987, to the East Coast to be closer to the client's headquarters in Nashville. The move will lead to a headcount reduction in L.A. In the meantime, he'll help to steer work for new clients such as Intel, whose B-to-B global account the shop won last fall. Related Stories Gatorade's Serena Williams Snapchat Ad-Game Scoring Well With Users How Omnicom Is Shaking Up Its Nissan Account TBWA/Media Arts Lab Names Brent Anderson Chief Creative Officer Notable work under his watch includes Gatorade's poignant goodbyes to retiring pros, including the Emmy-nominated "Made in New York" starring Derek Jeter, the "Dear Peyton" ode to Peyton Manning, and the gripping "Forget Me" starring Abby Wambach. He also oversaw hilarious "Sweat It to Get It" pranks starring JJ Watt and the Manning brothers, as well as Gatorade's in-app Snapchat video game that followed Serena Williams as she competed for her 23rd Grand Slam victory. His leadership last year helped the agency to see its most successful performance in Cannes in six years. "Renato is a master craftsman, and his ability to tell stories across multiple platforms and media is second to none," said TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles Creative Chairman Stephen Butler in a statement. "He challenges himself to create impactful ideas while solving big problems." After starting in advertising in his hometown of Curitiba, Brazil, in 1994, Mr. Fernandez eventually moved to storied creative shop Almap BBDO, where he created work for brands including Volkswagen, Havaianas and Gatorade. He began his career in 1994, in his hometown of Curitiba.

A few troubling aspects of the futuristic device should give prospective buyers pause, though. The advertising may not live up to the device’s performance. To illustrate, watch a video highlighting the primary features of the A12: If you were to judge a book by its cover, the Yoga A12 looks like one of the best devices ever made. It boasts a razor thin profile of 11mm and 13 hours of battery life. On top of that, it offers superior build quality, incorporating magnesium and aluminum into its chassis. However, don’t let appearances fool you. The A12 won’t fit the needs of anyone interested in productivity. 1. Touch Keyboards (Halo Keyboard) Suck A touch keyboard dispenses with physical keys and relies on the same touch technology in a smartphone for registering key presses. To date, few manufacturers employ touch keyboard panels. Other than allowing for an impossibly slim profile, touch keyboards offer spill resistance, touchpad capabilities, and mechanical reliability. But that’s where the advantages end and the problem start. In brief, they suck at the one thing they promise to do: typing. Lauren Goode, of the Verge, reviewed a similar touch keyboard-equipped laptop: the Yoga Book. While one of the most impressive looking devices ever produced, the Yoga Book suffered from a truckload of shortcomings. Namely, its touch keyboard makes typing difficult. Lenovo Yoga Book- FHD 10.1" Android Tablet - 2 in 1 Tablet (Intel Atom x5-Z8550 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD), Black, ZA0V0224US Lenovo Yoga Book- FHD 10.1" Android Tablet - 2 in 1 Tablet (Intel Atom x5-Z8550 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD), Black, ZA0V0224US At just under 2 lbs, it's the world's thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 android tablet Buy Now At Amazon $475.71 But if you’re dying to try the underlying technology, check out the $500 Yoga Book. It may not offer the state-of-art in hardware, but it does double as a functional Wacom for designers. 2. It’s Actually a Downgraded Yoga Book The Yoga A12 offers similar specs to last year’s Yoga Book. Like the Yoga Book, the A12 features a 360-degree keyboard. Users can flip the keyboard back, turning the device into a tablet. We refer to these devices as 2-in-1 convertible laptops because they can transform from a laptop into a tablet. If you aren’t familiar with 2-in-1 devices (what’s a 2-in-1? What Are 2-In-1 Laptops and How to Pick the Best One?

The biggest difference between the Yoga Book and the A12: its operating system. The A12 comes with Android, instead of Windows 10. And that can prove problematic for those interested in productivity. 3. Android Isn’t a Complete Desktop Operating System While the Yoga Book offers both Windows and Android, the Yoga A12 includes just Android. Unfortunately, that leaves out many Windows desktop applications. On top of that, Android’s user interface doesn’t scale properly on anything larger than a 5-inch smartphone. To Lenovo’s credit, they included the ability to run some apps in tablet mode. The result? You get a somewhat awkward-to-use, oversized Android tablet. For productivity, a superior alternative is the Windows 10-equipped Dell Inspiron 15 3000 (CA). It comes with double the RAM, 31-times the storage, and a far more powerful Intel Core i3 processor for $313. It does not include a touchscreen or a rotatable hinge, though. 2016 Newest Dell Inspiron i3558-5500BLK 15.6" Laptop (Core i3-5015U 2.1Ghz, 4GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive, Windows 10, Black) 2016 Newest Dell Inspiron i3558-5500BLK 15.6" Laptop (Core i3-5015U 2.1Ghz, 4GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive, Windows 10, Black) 15.6" display, typical 1366 x 768 HD resolution. Energy-efficient LED backlight. Buy Now At Amazon $298.30 4. It’s Probably Never Getting a System Update There are two reasons why the A12 won’t get a system update (or firmware update): first, Lenovo ranks near the bottom of manufacturers in how often it updates the software of its Android devices, and second, Intel discontinued future Atom processors for mobile, which means a probable end to device updates. Lenovo’s own Android firmware update table leaves out last year’s Yoga Book — meaning, it never received a firmware update. If Lenovo can’t even update a $500 product, it almost certainly isn’t going to update a $300 device. On top of that, the Atom processor suffers from compatibility issues with many Android games. Unless a game provides specific compatibility with x86 processors, there’s a good chance it won’t work. For those interested in running Android apps on a 2-in-1, look no further than a Chromebook. Because ChromeOS uses an emulation technique for running games, it suffers from almost none of the compatibility issues associated with x86 hardware on Android. A great example is the $280 Acer Chromebook 14 (CA), which employs an Atom-based Celeron N3160 processor.

The Specifications Are Woefully Overpriced Perhaps the clearest indicators of its horribleness are the A12’s specifications. Take a quick look: Intel Atom x5 system-on-a-chip 12.2-inch 1200 x 800 touchscreen 2 GB of RAM 32 GB of storage Touch keyboard These specifications approximately equal the impulse-buy $100 laptops sold at Walmart. On the other hand, for slightly less money, you can pick up the $200 Chuwi Hi10 (CA). The Hi10 features double the storage and RAM, a Full High Definition (FHD) 1080p IPS display, and the ability to dual-boot Android and Windows 10. On top of that, the Hi10 includes a tablet-optimized version of Android, known as Remix OS. While the keyboard sells separately, all together, the cost comes out to less than the Yoga A12. The Chuwi keyboard costs around $57.

Even so, you can find cheaper 11.5-inch (only an inch smaller) tablets for around $100. 6. Its Screen Won’t Impress Anyone If you prefer large screens, the A12 comes up short again. The 1200 x 800 resolution on a large 12.2-inch display won’t impress anyone in the $300 price range. You can find similar or larger screens for much less. For example, the $80 RCA 11.5-inch Galileo Pro offers comparable specifications but at $220 cheaper. If you love HD-resolution screens, you can find a much better deal in the $300 Acer Chromebook R11. The R11 offers a slightly better screen, along with overall superior specifications to the A12.

It also injects ads into browsers. While Lenovo offers a tool for removing its malware, some manufacturers don’t include any unwanted software. For example, Olimex. For those concerned about security, Olimex announced a mostly open-source, build-it-yourself laptop for around $250. It offers substantially weaker specs than the A12, but with a better screen. Unfortunately, the laptop kit went out of stock immediately after its announcement — but a restock should be imminent. Who Should Buy a Lenovo Yoga A12? No one should purchase a Yoga A12. The A12 is best seen as an aesthetic triumph and perhaps a portent of things to come. Unfortunately, its design won’t accommodate the vast majority of users’ needs. On top of that, even at $300, the price falls dramatically short of its competition. In 2017, $300 buys a lot of machine. The A12 offers little in the way of specifications, value, and functionality. Had it included ChromeOS instead of Android, it might have been salvageable — but as it stands, you are likely to find a better device by throwing a dart inside a used electronics store, blindfolded, and heavily medicated.

If you hate Android and Lenovo, it probably doesn't make much sense for you to write an article featuring both brands in the same machine. Reply Kannon February 16, 2017 at 8:44 am Right now one of the best desktop operating systems around is Remix OS, which is based on Android. It's great because it combines Android with a desktop user-interface. While the version of Android used on A12 includes a degree of tablet optimization, it's by no means fully tablet optimized. What I'm saying is that there are better Android devices out there. I'd recommend the Chuwi Hi10. It has Remix OS AND Windows in a dual boot configuration for less money.

MWC '17: RIFT.io to Showcase Seven Real-World NFV MANO Use Cases for Mobile Operators RIFT.io and Partner Solutions Highlight Ways to Accelerate Service Provider Transformation to Cloud-Native Network Services BURLINGTON, MA -- February 15, 2017 -- RIFT.io, the leading integrator of open source technologies for carrier-grade network virtualization solutions, today announced its planned activities at Mobile World Congress, the world's largest gathering for the mobile industry.                                
Event:           Mobile World Congress 2017  
                               
Dates:           Feb. 27 to March 2          
                               
Venue:           Fira Gran Via, Barcelona    
                               
RIFT.io Stand:   6J-8                        

 Among the various planned activities, RIFT.io will feature real-world use case demonstrations that show how mobile operators can accelerate their transformation to virtualized network services through network functions virtualization (NFV). RIFT.io has been on the forefront of helping mobile operators and other service providers achieve this transformation in two significant ways. First, RIFT.io is a founding member and a major contributor of seed code to the ETSI Open Source MANO (OSM) project that was introduced at Mobile World Congress in 2016. RIFT.io is also the first company to ship a commercial distribution of OSM (Release ONE code). Second, RIFT.io continues to innovate on the RIFT.ware platform, which is the industry's only solution for orchestrating and automating multi-vendor network services that is backed by a robust open source community. To showcase progress in these areas, RIFT.io will feature seven solution demonstrations of the RIFT.ware and OSM platforms in concert with partner solutions and technologies. The descriptions of the planned demos are as follows:

We round up all of the rumours about a new MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 15 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air in 2017? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article, we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals Last updated to include rumours that Apple is manufacturing more of its own chips for use in Mac laptops New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Back in March 2016, MacBook Air fans were eagerly awaiting an update to their favourite laptop at Apple's special event; after all, the spring event represented one year since it was last updated. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that was for the 13in model only. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. But it does seem likely that the MacBook Air line is being quietly wound down. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leapt past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out anymore," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst foresees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry-level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line-up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that sometime in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic Update 08/02/2017: It's not just the CPU that's getting an upgrade either, as a recent Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on a processor that's meant to improve the battery life of its laptop range. According to the report, the chip is said to handle basic tasks like checking for email and installing updates while the computer is asleep. Apple's current way of working relies on the MacBook's main processor to handle the tasks, but by implementing a dedicated low-power processor, Apple can further reduce battery consumption and provide a longer battery life.   Those with knowledge of the subject claim that the chip is similar to that used by Apple in the MacBook Pro to manage the Touch Bar, and that the new chip may make an appearance in the 2017 MacBook Pro, along with other laptops. It makes sense, as Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticised since launch for its poor battery life. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air.

New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

(Feb. 15) AP President Trump shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 9903 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 92 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Wednesday for a series of meetings intended to "show there is no daylight" between the two leaders on a range of issues. And that includes the so-called "two-state solution" that has been a hallmark of U.S. policy in the Middle East — and a source of friction between the Netanyahu government and Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump professed to be agnostic on the policy. "So I'm looking at two-state or the one-state," Trump said. "I was thinking for a while that the two-state was looking like the easier of the two." He concluded that the matter is up to Israel and Palestine to decide. "I'm happy with the one they like best," he said. The one-state solution would include Israelis and Palestinians in a single, secular country with equal citizenship. The two-state solution calls for a negotiated settlement leading to a Palestinian nation alongside Israel, and it was the U.S. policy under both the Bush and Obama administrations. But with Trump stepping back, Netanyahu reasserted his position that a two-state solution can only happen under two conditions: The new Palestinian state must recognize Israel's legitimacy, and Israel must maintain security control of the West Bank. And he suggested that the very "two-state" label was a hindrance to progress."Rather than deal with labels, I'd like to deal with substance," Netanyahu said. Trump and Netanyahu appeared to have an easy chemistry, even bantering among themselves during the press conference. "Bibi and I have known each other a long time — a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So let’s see what we do," Trump said. "Let’s try it," Netanyahu interjected. "Doesn't sound too optimistic, but he’s a good negotiator," Trump said. "That's the Art of the Deal," replied the prime minister. To underscore the close relationship, first lady Melania Trump made a rare appearance in the East Room of the White House Wednesday, and Netanyahu pointed out Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who Trump has appointed as his deal-maker on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. But even as the two leaders made a public showing of solidarity, the Trump White House has been slow to distance itself from the policies of his predecessors in a number of areas, including: ► The location of the U.S. Embassy. A 1995 law requires the president to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but every president since has invoked a national security waiver to block the move. Trump has signaled that he wants to end that policy, but has moved cautiously in his first weeks. "I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We’re looking at it with great care," Trump said. "Great care, believe me, and we'll see what happens." ► The Iran nuclear deal. During the campaign, Trump threatened to "rip up" the agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and five other global powers with Iran to scale down its nuclear program. But even as the Trump administration has leveled new sanctions for Iran's missile tests, Trump has not made any moves to break the Obama-era agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. On Wednesday, Trump called the deal "one of the worst deals I've ever seen." "I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing, I mean ever, a nuclear weapon," he said. ► Israeli settlements. In an unexpected change in tone this month, the White House responded to continued Israeli settlements in the West Bank with a statement saying those settlements "may not be helpful" in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made," Trump told Netanyahu. Netanyahu downplayed the significance of the issue, but pledged to work with Trump "so we don’t keep on bumping into each other all the time." The two leaders also discussed counter-terrorism operations in the region. Trump has made defeating the terrorist group in Syria and Iraq the overarching goal of his foreign policy — to the extent that he's been willing to rethink the role of old rivalries and alliances. As the closest U.S. ally in the region, Trump will seek to coordinate anti-terrorism strategy with Israel, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. "They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East," he said. A Middle East peace agreement has eluded U.S. presidents for generations, but Trump — who lacks diplomatic experience but built a real estate empire — has said he thinks he can broker "the ultimate deal" where predecessors have failed. "I think a deal will be made. I know that every president would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn’t possible because they didn't do it," he said.

Obama was particularly concerned about Israeli settlements, prompting him to tell Jewish leaders that there needed to be "daylight" between U.S. and Israel if he was going to successfully negotiate a peace deal with the Palestinians. Netanyahu's visit to the Trump White House came at a time of turmoil. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday after Trump and others believed that he misled them about a phone conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn had been a key player in the Trump administration's early overtures to Netanyahu's government. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported this month that Flynn's Israeli counterpart and the chief of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, made secret visits to Washington during the transition to meet with Flynn. But the Flynn resignation re-opened questions about the relationship between Trump and aides and the Russians, the subject of investigation by the FBI and congressional committees. Netanyahu's visit makes him the fourth foreign leader to pay a call on Trump's White House, following British Prime Minister Theresa May, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in addition to dozens of phone calls Trump has made to world leaders in his first month. Trump has not spoken to officials with the Palestinian Authority. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Scott Applewhite, AP) 945 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 111 COMMENTEMAILMORE Democrats in Congress raced to every open microphone Wednesday to demand a broad and independent investigation of Russian ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the president's handling of information about his subordinates' contacts with Russia. Democratic leaders said National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's resignation over his pre-inauguration telephone calls with the Russian ambassador and news reports indicating additional contacts between Trump's camp and Russian intelligence agents have raised a spate of new questions requiring an independent probe. "Every White House press briefing and early morning tweet seemingly introduces new inconsistencies and contradictions that demand a full accounting," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday. "Every report that suggests deeper ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government needs to be followed up on and verified." Read more: White House under siege over probe into Russian contacts with Trump campaign Plenty of unanswered questions about Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia Donald Trump's ties to Russia go back 30 years Senate Democrats convened an "emergency" meeting of their caucus on Wednesday to discuss their strategy for advancing investigations. Immediately following that meeting, Schumer said Democrats had agreed on three principles to guide investigations: Attorney General Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from any investigations by the FBI and federal prosecutors because of his previous role as a national security adviser to the Trump campaign. All emails and other records relevant to the investigations must be preserved from the Trump campaign, the transition team and the administration. Campaign and transition officials, including Flynn and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, must be available to testify — publicly and under oath — before congressional committees conducting investigations. Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign last August amid controversy over his lobbying work for pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs. "I've been in Congress for a long time; I've never seen anything like this," Schumer told reporters. "These reports and revelations should not pit the two parties against one another. They should unite the parties in pursuit of the full truth. We are Americans before we are Democrats or Republicans. Nothing less than our system of checks and balances, democratic institutions, the rule of law and our national security is at stake." A group of 11 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, called for the appointment of an independent special counsel to investigate Flynn's contacts with Russia. "An independent investigation is now necessary to determine what General Flynn did, who knew about it, and when," the senators wrote in a Wednesday letter to Sessions. "To maintain the confidence, credibility and impartiality of the Department of Justice, we urge you to immediately appoint an independent Special Counsel to investigate collusion with the Russian government by General Flynn and other Trump campaign, transition, and Administrative officials." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., speaks with reporters on Feb. 8, 2017.  (Photo: Michael Reynolds, European Pressphoto Agency) In a rare bipartisan approach to the issue, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the panel, wrote a joint letter to Sessions and to FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday requesting a Justice Department briefing and documents about the events that led to Flynn's resignation. Specifically, the two senators are seeking details of Flynn’s reported communications with Russian officials, the Justice Department’s response, and potential leaks of classified material. They asked for a briefing for committee members during the week of Feb. 27. "We request that individuals with specific knowledge of these issues from both the FBI and Justice Department brief committee members and staff," the senators wrote. "We similarly request copies of the transcripts of Mr. Flynn's intercepted calls and the FBI report summarizing the intercepted calls referenced in the media. We anticipate that some of these documents may be classified, some may not, and others may contain both classified and unclassified information." Feinstein said she is satisfied — for now — that the investigation can be handled by the Judiciary and Intelligence committees. “I think we just need to move forward very aggressively," she said. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said he supports any and all investigations into the matter. The Intelligence Committee is "thick and heavy" into its own investigation, he said, and he hopes the panel will call Flynn, Manafort and others to testify in public sessions if possible. "Let’s bring them all in,” Manchin said. “We’re very much concerned about being as public as we can up to the secure level." Manchin said the panel's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is on board with conducting the probe "in the most open light that we can."

A look at the key players Most Republicans on Tuesday said they supported investigating Flynn's contacts with Russia, but they suggested it could be handled by the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are already probing Russian attempts to interfere in the election last year. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ABC News on Wednesday, “If there are contacts between Trump officials and Russian intelligence operatives during the campaign, we need a joint select committee in Congress to get to the bottom of it and also look at Trump's business ties to Russia — if it is true.” Graham said there should be a preliminary investigation first to make sure there is credibility to the allegations of repeated contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives. If they are credible, Graham said, a joint select committee would be the best way to investigate. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Congress needed to find “a non-hysterical but sobering way” to get to the bottom of the allegations. He said the constant “dribble” of damaging news about Trump and Russia was interfering with Congress’ ability to focus on urgent policy matters. “It’s obviously disruptive to governing,” Corker said. “We need to figure out way to better handle this and I don’t know what the answer is.” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. arrives on Capitol Hill on Feb. 9, 2017, for the committee's hearing about the future of U.S. relations with Russia.  (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) He said the Senate Intelligence Committee probe might be the best way for that to happen and expressed concern that an independent probe would simply drag the process out. “The last independent probe was a 2 ½ year process,” Corker said, referring to the commission created to probe the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “I’m not sure that’s what the American people would sign up for." Intelligence agencies announced last year that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts in an attempt to undermine the presidential election. Top House Democrats sent a letter Wednesday to White House Counsel Donald McGahn asking a series of questions about his office's review of Flynn's contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The White House has indicated that Trump was alerted several weeks ago that Flynn had not accurately described the content of those calls, yet Flynn continued to serve while the counsel's office reviewed whether he had broken any laws by discussing U.S. sanctions with Kislyak. The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday adopted a non-binding list of oversight activities for the year, saying the committee will “continue to conduct oversight into allegations of misconduct” by executive branch officials – including any evidence that classified material had been leaked. The Republican majority on the committee rejected Democratic efforts to specifically promise an investigation of Flynn, but did agree that the committee can investigate any allegations of “improper interference” with American institutions or elections. In a press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said Flynn was "a wonderful man" who had been mistreated by "criminal" leaks from intelligence agencies.

Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz Sandoval is visiting Silicon Valley next week to woo tech companies to bring jobs to Mexico. (Photo: Jalisco government, for USA TODAY) 14440 CONNECTTWEET 62 LINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — The governor of Mexico's state of Jalisco is visiting more than 40 U.S. tech companies with the message that it's a great place for high tech, the latest cross-border recruitment effort to respond to U.S. immigration policy. Jalisco Gov. Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz will meet with California Gov. Jerry Brown, 13 large tech companies including Facebook and Google, and 30 startups beginning this week in California. It's an annual trip for officials from Jalisco, birthplace of tequila, synonymous with hot sauce, and sometimes called Mexico's Silicon Valley for its already thriving tech scene. This year, the trip has an added purpose: to talk to Brown about a bi-lateral agenda to support Mexican citizens to remain in the U.S. And, Sandoval will promote capital city Guadalajara and the rest of Jalisco as a friendly environment for skilled workers that may have trouble getting hired by U.S. tech firms if the Trump administration passes more restrictions on H-1B visas, as a draft order indicated. "We want tech companies to know there is a huge opportunity in Jalisco for them to grow," Sandoval, who has created a cabinet-level Innovation Department, told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday. "Jalisco has many advantages" — a close time zone to Silicon Valley, talent, strong university system, government support and infrastructure, Sandoval said. The Trump administration's policies, in particular the possibility of an executive order that could curtail H-1B work visas, also work in Jalisco's favor, he said. The pitch is hardly a slam-dunk. Some tech companies remain reluctant to expand in Mexico, with a threatened 35% tariff from Trump on goods made there looming as large as his much-heralded wall. (Trump floated the idea of a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said it was one of several proposals.) There are also lingering questions about Jalisco's overall tech talent, poor broadband access in some areas and costs related to opening operations offshore. Nonetheless, Sandoval's push to raise awareness about Jalisco comes at a time when the U.S.'s northern neighbor, Canada, is also attempting to recruit tech workers as the U.S. halts entries of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations and threatens to further limit H-1Bs, which offer a pipeline of talent from abroad. Canadian venture firms and companies are enticing U.S. start-ups with funding, sparkling new work spaces, broadband access and a relatively affordable cost of living. Jalisco's pitch is similar. The state  on the western coast of central Mexico has blossomed into a thriving tech hub worth $21 billion. Guadalajara or coastal Puerto Vallarta are home to manufacturing, design and research-and-development operations for Intel, Hewlett Packard and Oracle, among others. Oracle and Intel house innovation centers in Guadalajara, and a 940-acre media-business center is under construction. Wizeline CEO Bismarck Lepe is big fan of Guadalajara as a tech hub.  (Photo: Wizeline, for USA TODAY) Technology goods represent about 55% of Jalisco's exports, and account for 25,000 jobs in the state. Nearly a third of Mexico's tech business comes from Jalisco, according to a spokesman for Sandoval. "The Jalisco government is 100% focused on technology," says Bismarck Lepe, CEO of San Francisco-based tech services firm Wizeline. "It's an ideal region for intellectual property, and not cheap manufacturing." Lepe has deep ties to Mexico. His parents are from there, but left for the U.S. for a better economic opportunity. Lepe, who studied at Stanford University and worked at Google, decided to return in 2010 after a third-party analysis determined Guadalajara was fertile ground for tech talent. Half of Wizeline's 270 employees are in Guadalajara, most of them engineers. DROPBOX mensaje Gobernador Silicon_v2 subt.mp4 Canada seizes chance to skim talent from disaffected U.S. tech companies "We want to make Guadalajara a tech hub for the world — from multinational companies to mid-tiers and start-ups," says Cindy Blanco, general director of StartupGDL, a nonprofit organization that champions the region. Guadalajara has lured entrepreneurs with a pool of tech talent fed by the university system, a comparable time zone (Central) to Silicon Valley and direct flights, Blanco says. Cindy Blanco, general director of nonprofit StartupGDL.  (Photo: StartupGDL, for USA TODAY) The close proximity of Mexico and Canada could offer concerned American companies — and workers — an option should Trump issue executive orders on a revised travel ban, curtail H-1Bs and revise the NAFTA trade accord. Job seekers are likely to choose Canada as a backup. It was the most popular second destination, at 43%, followed by Australia (12%) and the United Kingdom (5%), based on 1,200 people tracked last week by Indeed, a job-search engine. Mexico was No. 12 on the list. 'Not an ideal solution' Mexico is at a disadvantage when it comes to talent, say tech executives. Its engineering pool isn't as bountiful in Mexico as it is in India and China, and salaries for Mexican engineers are significantly higher because competition for them is so fierce, says Stephen Stokols, CEO of FreedomPop, a wireless Internet and mobile virtual network operator. "Mexico is a primary market for us, but it's not an ideal solution," Stokols says. His Los Angeles-based company has 20 people — about 10% of its worldwide workforce — in Mexico City, mostly engineers. "We would have more people there, if the engineering talent were available." Mexico's new economy starts to take off It can also be expensive to open operations south of the border and establish a payment system, says Jesus Hoyos, managing director at Solvis Consulting, which resells tech products in Mexico. Still, Mexico might offer as compelling a case for job seekers turned away by the U.S. It is a huge trade partner with the U.S. — trade between the two companies totaled $583.6 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative — and the home to  more than 1million Americans, the largest community for expatriates. (Nearly 40,000 American and Canadian expats are among Jalisco's population of seven million.)

The senior U.S. official said the Navy is monitoring the ship on its radar systems. NBC Connecticut has not independently confirmed the reports of the ship being off the shores of Connecticut. Trump Quiet After Russia Deploys Missile, Sends Ship Off US Coast A U.S. defense official told The Associated Press that a Russian intelligence-collection ship has been operating off the East Coast, in international waters. If the ship is in international waters, it is legal for them to be there.  Trump Aides Spoke to Russian Intel Before Elections: Report Gov. Dannel Malloy said "the fact that we know that it's there is probably a good thing and I suspect that we have some of our ships in delicate places as well." "I think it’s getting a lot of coverage because of the President’s changed policy towards Russia, which is very different than has been sustained by other administrations. It’s not that we shouldn’t be talking to the Russians, but we shouldn’t necessarily be embracing everything they are doing. And quite frankly, now that we understand that they have recently been active in our own elections, we should be wary of that. But that there are spy ships in the world – we shouldn’t be surprised,” Malloy said. After Flynn Ouster, Dems Push for Probe Into WH Russia Ties The reports that the ship is near the submarine base in Groton also brought a response from many Connecticut congressional representatives, who by and large called the action aggressive and concerning. NBC Connecticut reached out to officials at the base, who said they don’t have a comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Defense. Officials from the DOD have not yet responded. Trump's Labor Secretary Pick Withdraws Nomination The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Groton is home the the Naval sub base, as well as Electric Boat, which designs and builds submarines. Analysis: Few Good Alternatives to Palestine State “I think that clearly they like to track submarines. We know that they do," Malloy said about the ship's proximity to Groton. "This is not something that is brand new. It’s getting a lot of coverage because, again, I think of other Russian stories related to the Trump administration. They seek to understand how we have the best submarines in the world. And they’re made here.” U.S. Senator Chris Murphy’s office said that this is not “unprecedented,” but the senator is concerned this is “part of a pattern of continued Russian ‘boldness.’” 'Firefall' Returns to Light Up Yosemite National Park “Russia is acting like it has a permission slip to expand influence, test limits of reach,” Murphy tweeted. “Questions are obvious: does it, and if so, why?” Russia is acting like it has a permission slip to expand influence, test limits of reach. Questions are obvious: does it, and if so, why? https://t.co/6Hsm7T2GO2 — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 15, 2017 "While this is not wholly unprecedented, it’s part of a series of aggressive actions by Russia that threaten U.S. national security and the security of our allies," Murphy said in a statement. "Just yesterday, news broke that Russia violated an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Coupled with escalating fighting in eastern Ukraine and Russian jets buzzing a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Black Sea, Putin clearly thinks the Trump administration has given him a permission slip to flex his muscles. President Trump and his administration must end their silence and immediately respond to these threats to our national security.” U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said in a statement that the presence of the spy ship "has to be regarded very seriously because Russia is an increasingly aggressive adversary." More Than 55,000 US Bridges Structurally Deficient: Report "It reflects a clear need to harden our defenses against electronic surveillance and cyber espionage. I am personally monitoring this situation and remain in close contact with both the Department of Defense and the U.S. Coast Guard," Blumenthal said in the statement. "The return of a Russian vessel is particularly concerning in the context of escalating Russian aggression - within days of the Russian's buzzing a U.S. Navy ship in the Black Sea, as well as deploying a cruise missile in violation of our arms control treaty - which only underscores the need for an independent investigation into possible collusion between the Trump administration and Russian agents." U.S. Rep. Jim Himes issued a statement saying residents should know that the presence of the ship does not present "a direct threat to our physical safety." NYC Police Use Stun Gun on Pregnant Teen in Scuffle: Video "Its appearance is troubling, however, viewed in conjunction with the ongoing stories of Russian ties and interference in the Trump Administration and the recent deployment of a Russian cruise missile in apparent violation of international agreements," Himes said in a statement. "In my opinion, Russia is making a show of strength and pushing established boundaries and norms to gauge the reaction of a new administration in disarray.” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro tweeted that “Russia is flexing its muscles.” Pope Francis: Native People Have Rights Over Their Lands U.S. Rep. John Larson responded to the reports with a tweet as well. "This is a stark reminder of why we need a full account of Russia's influence in the White House & meddling in our election," Larson tweeted. Pentagon Chief Says NATO Members Must Boost Defense Spending U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney also responded to the reports in a statement. “A Russian spy ship patrolling 30 miles from the Groton SUBASE underscores that the threats posed by a resurgent Russia are real,” Courtney wrote. “This unacceptable, aggressive action, combined with the buzzing of US Navy ships in the Red Sea yesterday are clearly testing the resolve of a new administration. While I have total confidence in our Navy’s vigilant, responsible readiness, the White House needs to move past their seeming infatuation with Putin and treat him like the serious threat to global peace and security that he has been for the last five years.” Husband's Valentine's Day Surprise: Lobster a la L Train Courtney also made a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives about this ship. U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty also responded with a statement. “Russia’s escalating aggression is a serious national security threat," Esty wrote. "Yet again, the Kremlin is testing the resolve of the Trump administration. It is long past time for the White House to stop making excuses for Vladimir Putin and respond to his acts of thuggery with the toughness our security demands.” Check back for updates on this developing story.

Andrew Cunningham - Feb 15, 2017 3:50 pm UTC Enlarge / Intel's 7th- and 6th-gen processors now support the Vulkan API. reader comments 49 Share this story After months in beta, Intel's latest driver for its integrated GPUs (version 15.45.14.4590) adds support for the low-overhead Vulkan API for recent GPUs running in Windows 10. The driver supports HD and Iris 500- and 600-series GPUs, the ones that ship with 6th- and 7th-generation Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Further ReadingVulkan now official, with 1.0 API release and AMD driver [Updated]Vulkan, currently just a day away from its first birthday, is the open source version of Microsoft's DirectX 12 or Apple's Metal, a low-overhead counterpart to OpenGL. It hasn't yet picked up much support in actual games, but adoption is slowly growing as driver and operating system support improves. Modern AMD and Nvidia GPUs have had Vulkan driver support for nearly a year now, and Google announced that Android would use Vulkan as its main low-overhead graphics API (support was added in version 7.0, which most Android users will probably eventually use at some point in the next couple of years). Intel's support of the API in Windows is just a piece of the puzzle, but given that Intel ships more PC GPUs than anyone else, it's still a noteworthy piece. Unfortunately, it looks like owners of 4th- and 5th-generation Haswell and Broadwell CPUs and GPUs won't be getting Vulkan support in Windows, despite the fact that the GPUs seem to be able to use the API.

Minyanville Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way Higher By Scutify Feb 14, 2017 3:11 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Shares of semiconductor powerhouse Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have bounced over the past two trading days, joining the broader stock market. But unlike many parts of the market - which broke higher from sideways consolidation phases - INTC stock bounced off a critical near-term technical support area. This not only promises a further bounce in Intel shares - it allows traders to clearly define their risk. When Intel reported its latest batch of earnings a few weeks ago, its numbers - and its outlook - looked good. However, INTC stock sold off on the news. The post-earnings pullback totaled about 10% by last Friday. Semiconductor stocks as a group currently find themselves at an interesting juncture in the sense that some of the larger stocks in the group trade like a mixed bag of fruit. Intel stock fell after earnings, but now it's bouncing. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) exhausted itself after earnings last week and has since dropped, yet the broader semiconductor as represented by the Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (MUTF:SMH) continues to plug higher. To me, this says that the trading opportunities should be focused on single-stock technical levels. INTC Stock Charts On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that while Intel continues to hold its 2009 support trendline, it has found plenty of technical resistance around the $38 area since late 2014. 7 Stocks to Buy for the Death of Obamacare Of all the things the GOP and President Donald Trump want to accomplish in 2017, killing Obamacare is at the top of the list. But how will they do it - and more importantly, which companies will benefit most from the changes in policy and regulations? I've handpicked 7 stocks that are the best investments in the entire sector as these changes take hold. Get their names here FREE! Click to Enlarge So far this area has been rejected three times, most recently following the latest earnings report in January. Note also that the purple-dotted 2009 support line coincides with the 200-week simple moving average (red), making this a critical area of support, currently around the $30-$31 area. While this support area is of no direct concern to my trade idea in INTC stock today, it is important for greater context. Next Page Moving on to the daily chart, we see that Intel stock had a classic "pop-and-drop" move on Jan. 27 following its earnings report. This is pretty similar to what we've witnessed in NVDA after its earnings report late last week. Click to Enlarge INTC stock initially popped on Jan. 27, but quickly reversed lower and closed in the red for the day. This set in motion the aforementioned 10% selloff that came to a halt last Friday (at least for now). Last Friday, INTC found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red), which currently also coincides with the 2015 diagonal support line (purple-dotted line). The stock closed well off its intraday lows last Friday. This was followed by an up-day Monday, which in turn led my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator to flash a buy signal for a trade. Traders should eye a next upside target around $36.50, while using last Friday's lows around $34.80 as a last-resort stop-loss. Like what you see?

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) reports. Buzz60 President Trump (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) 15329 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 935 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — A months-long inquiry into contacts between Russian government officials and associates of President Trump's campaign and business interests will continue despite the firing of national security adviser Michael Flynn for misleading White House officials about his communication with Russia, a U.S. official told USA TODAY on Wednesday. The federal inquiry — which has amassed intercepts of telephone calls, business records and subject interviews — is looking at how Russian officials sought to meddle in the November election, said the official who is not authorized to comment publicly. The official added that there was no current evidence of collusion to tilt the election. The extent and purpose of those alleged contacts, believed to involve a limited number of Trump campaign and business associates, continue to be weighed, including whether the associates were aware they were communicating with Russian intelligence officials or those working on behalf of the Russian government, the official said. TheNew York Times reported Wednesday that phone records and intercepted calls show Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. The White House faced new questions about links between Flynn, President Trump, his campaign and Russia, as attacks from across Washington consumed the White House and Congress. Trump even defended Flynn in a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday. Flynn was interviewed by FBI agents following last month's inauguration after public statements by top administration officials, including Vice President Pence, about Flynn's pre-inaugural discussions with the Russian ambassador did not track the contents of the intercepted telephone calls. The administration officials had strongly refuted claims that Flynn had discussed sanctions imposed against Russia by the Obama administration. The transcripts of the calls suggested otherwise, prompting then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates to alert White House counsel Donald McGahn that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail as a result of his misrepresentations to senior officials. Amid the renewed questions and investigations about contacts between his associates and Russia over last year's election, Trump Wednesday denounced "conspiracy theories" about his relationship with the Russians and said "illegal" news leaks brought down Flynn. "It's a criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time — before me, but now it's really going on," Trump said during a joint news conference with Netanyahu. Though aides said Trump demanded Flynn's resignation Monday over lying about his talk with the Russian ambassador, the president praised his former aide as "a wonderful man" who has been treated "very unfairly" by what he called the "fake media, in many cases." Trump's comments came as congressional Democrats, and some Republicans, served notice that the Russia story is not going away, especially in light of Flynn's resignation and reports that Trump campaign aides had contacts with Russian operatives during an election in which Russian hackers were accused of sabotaging the Democrats. "It is now readily apparent that Gen. Flynn's resignation is not the end of the story but only the beginning," said Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York. Schumer called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia inquiry, saying the former Alabama Republican senator's close ties to Trump and the campaign disqualified him. During confirmation hearings last month, Sessions said he was not aware of conflicts that would force his recusal and a close aide to the attorney general said Wednesday that position had not changed. The aide, who is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the attorney general's oversight of the inquiry would be re-evaluated if developments warranted. In a morning tweet storm, Trump denounced the media and critics over Russia. "The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred," Trump said. "@MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!" CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Fresh off White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s resignation, questions are swirling, with democratic lawmakers calling for an investigation. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) has the story. Buzz60 In another tweet, Trump accused his critics of scandal-mongering out of deference to defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. "This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign," Trump wrote. Trump complained about news leaks in a third tweet: "Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia." He added, "The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!"

"If there’s contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials outside the norm, that’s not only big league bad, that’s a game changer," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on ABC's Good Morning America. Graham is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which is conducting an investigation into Russia and the 2016 election. In yet another tweet, Trump contrasted his Russia policy with that of predecessor Barack Obama. "Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?" Trump said. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, will meet Thursday with top Russian military officials in Azerbaijan to discuss “the current state of U.S.-Russian military relations and clear military-to-military communication to prevent miscalculation and potential crises,” according to a statement from the Pentagon. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP) Dunford’s meeting with the defense chiefs comes as the Pentagon deals with increasing tensions with Russia over its deployment of banned nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, Russian warplanes buzzing U.S. ships in the Black Sea and the allegations of election interference. In calling for a stepped-up investigation of any ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, Democratic lawmakers renewed demands that Trump release his tax returns, saying they would show any financial relationship with Russia. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted Tuesday, "Your nightly reminder that at the center of this strengthening hurricane are the tax returns." A prominent Republican — Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — expressed concern about the Russia story. "The question is whether the White House is going to be able to stabilize itself," Corker told MSNBC's Morning Joe.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News PC Gaming For Honor Observables: How To Find Observables Easier, Get Rewards For Clearing Story Mode By Jerome Delos Santos on February 16 2017 01:17 AM Source: For Honor Raider Trailer In For Honor’s  story mode, players will often find special interest points called Observables which are needed to be collected for 100 percent progression. More than just random collectibles, Observables trigger some voiceovers that discuss the game’s lore. Here’s what we know about the For Honor Observables. Story Mode Observables For Honor’s story mode delves heavily on its lore not only through storytelling, but also via Observables. These collectibles can be found in the For Honor story mode missions. Observables provide a window to get more details about a character’s backstory, information about the place, and other general lore. Finding Observables Unlike usual hidden-in-plain-sight secret content, most of the For Honor Observables can be triggered instantly. Players will have to look and pan the camera almost everywhere to find these Observables.  As seen on HarryNinetyFour’s video, Observables are little blue diamonds placed near key structures, characters, and even broken debris. Easter Egg Disconnect At best, players should finish the story mode first if they’re planning to collect all For Honor Observables in each mission. It’s possible that you’ll mess up some of the story mode’s mission objectives during your search for these collectibles. Clear out the missions first so it won’t matter if you fail the missions in your search. Activision’s Call of Duty series places some Intel collectibles in its Campaign missions. Players may get disconnected with the game’s tense scenes as they’ll focus on finding these collectibles even if their character dies. Story Mode Rewards Aside from finding Observables in the story mode, players will also be rewarded in the multiplayer mode for completing story mode missions. According to Karmagator’s thread on the For Honor subreddit, players will earn premium scavenger crates, symbols, engravings,  ornaments, Steel, colors, and background for the multiplayer mode. Players who want a headstart on multiplayer mode loot should play the story mode first for these rewards. Additionally, the story mode can be a good training ground to better understand the controls of the game. For Honor so far For Honor has just recently been released, and the game isn’t a week old yet. Players will have to join one of the warring factions to claim as many territories as possible for a reward at the end of the season. For Honor has a fighting system which gives players three points to attack foes and defend themselves. We’ve yet to see if this new Ubisoft game will be a new eSports title or will have a healthy population to keep the game alive.

Over the next decade alone such vehicles — and vehicles with assisted-driving technology —could deliver $1 trillion in societal and consumer benefits due to their improved safety.   For autonomous vehicles to make good on that promise they will need onboard artificial intelligence (AI) technology able to link them to highly detailed maps that reflect every change in the status of lanes, hazards, obstacles, and speed-limits in real time. Researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering are making this critical machine-to-machine handshake possible. Yi Fang, a research assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and a faculty member at NYU Abu Dhabi, and Edward K. Wong, an associate professor in the NYU Tandon Department of Computer Science and Engineering, are developing a deep learning system that will allow self-driving cars to navigate, maneuver, and respond to changing road conditions by mating data from onboard sensors to information on HERE HD Live Map, a cloud-based service for automated driving. The NYU Multimedia and Visual Computing Lab directed by Professor Fang will house the collaborative project. Fang and Wong recently received a gift fund from HERE, a global leader in mapping and location-based services owned by Audi, BMW, Daimler and Intel, with Tencent and NavInfo of China and GIC of Singapore also poised to become investors during 2017. NYU Tandon is one of HERE's first university research and development partners in HERE HD Live Map. High-definition (HD) maps meant for machine-to-machine communication must be accurate to within 10 to 20 centimeters. Self-driving vehicles need to continuously update, or register, their location on these maps with an equally high degree of accuracy, according to Fang, who said that the goal of the collaborative research is to enhance car-to-map precision to within 10 centimeters. "Essentially, we want to be able to precisely match what the car sees with what's in the cloud database. An incredibly precise ruler isn't of much use if your vision is blurry," he explained.  "Our work involves employing computer vision techniques to refine the vehicle's ability to continually locate itself with respect to HERE's cloud-based service," said Wong. "That requires real-time images of the street and surrounding objects derived from cameras, LiDAR [a laser-based range-finding technology], and other on-board sensors."   The researchers added that this precision is also important because automobiles connected to HERE's HD Live Map service will deliver data to the cloud on road conditions, traffic, weather, obstacles, speed limits, and other variables, allowing the service to upgrade nearly in real-time to reflect changing conditions. "3D computer vision and Deep Neural Network are the technologies driving the development of high- definition live maps for self-driving cars," said Xin Chen, HERE senior engineering manager and research scientist. "We're excited to kick off a long-term research collaboration with Professors Wong and Fang individually based upon their expertise in this domain as well as with NYU as a top institution for research and learning in the field."  "The convergence of cybersecurity, big data, wireless technology, and artificial intelligence is already revolutionizing how people live and travel, and it holds the promise of safer transportation for billions across the globe," said NYU Dean of Engineering Katepalli R. Sreenivasan. "We gratefully acknowledge this research gift funding from HERE, which will advance the important work of Professors Wong and Fang and the students assisting them in this new frontier." The HERE mapping project joins a number of recent initiatives at NYU Tandon addressing safer and smarter transportation. The U.S. Department of Transportation selected a research consortium led by NYU Tandon Department of Civil and Urban Engineering researchers to become the first Tier 1 University Transportation Center (UTC) in New York City, dedicated to using data to make every mode of surface transportation – from walking through mass transit – more efficient and safe.  Another venture – headed by a cybersecurity research team in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering – is developing the first free, open-source method for automakers to secure software updates. Uptane will protect vehicles from cyber criminals and cyber war while providing the auto industry with an inexpensive and quick way to install safety fixes. About the New York University Tandon School of Engineering The NYU Tandon School of Engineering dates to 1854, the founding date for both the New York University School of Civil Engineering and Architecture and the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute (widely known as Brooklyn Poly). A January 2014 merger created a comprehensive school of education and research in engineering and applied sciences, rooted in a tradition of invention and entrepreneurship and dedicated to furthering technology in service to society. In addition to its main location in Brooklyn, NYU Tandon collaborates with other schools within NYU, the country's largest private research university, and is closely connected to engineering programs at NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai. It operates Future Labs focused on start-up businesses in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn and an award-winning online graduate program.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 review: bent out of shape Dell's best laptop tries too hard and loses its charm by Dan Seifert@dcseifert Feb 15, 2017, 9:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Dell’s XPS 13 has been one of our favorite laptops for the past couple of years because of its sleek, trendsetting design, great keyboard, and solid performance. When it debuted back in the spring of 2015, it was one of the first Windows laptops that really provided a solid alternative to Apple’s MacBook line. Now there are a lot of great Windows 10 laptops available, many of which have cribbed the ideas first demonstrated on the XPS 13, like its compact size and almost borderless display. So while Dell is still making and selling the original, it announced a new 2-in-1 version of the XPS 13 in January to capitalize on the trend of convertible laptops. What sets this model apart from its siblings is its ability to transform from a standard laptop to a tablet and everything in between. It’s the same concept as pioneered by Lenovo’s Yoga line and adopted by HP’s x360 line among others. The XPS 13 2-in-1 (yes, that is the official name of the product, clumsy as it is) carries over many of the same features of the standard model, including the signature InfinityEdge display that pushes the screen to the limits of the laptop’s frame. But it slims down to a slightly thinner profile and its screen rotates a full 360 degrees. It starts at $999, which is a couple hundred dollars more than the fixed-screen version, and can be equipped much higher. I’ve been testing a $1,299 model that includes a fanless Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of SSD storage, and a 1080p touchscreen display. The question to answer is does the XPS 13 2-in-1 provide enough utility beyond the standard laptop functions to justify choosing it over the less expensive standard model? Based on my time with it, I don’t think there is much justification for its existence, and there are a few other reasons why I’m reticent to recommend this particular laptop. Let’s start with what’s good here, as there’s a fair amount to like. The XPS 13 2-in-1 maintains the same general look and build quality as the original, which means it’s a gray metallic wedge with a soft-touch black patterned deck. It’s distinct and doesn’t look like it’s trying to be a MacBook or some other computer. Build quality is solid and the 360-degree hinge is very stable Build quality across the board is very good, as you’d expect from a computer in this price range. The 360-degree hinge, in particular, is very solid — there’s none of the wobbliness that frequently plagues 2-in-1 convertibles. Dell’s backlit keyboard is a joy to type on, and save for arrow keys which are a tad too small, I have no complaints with it. Same goes for the trackpad: it’s smooth, without being too smooth; supports Microsoft’s Precision gestures; and doesn’t get in the way or register stray clicks when I’m typing. Dell has added a fingerprint scanner to the right of the trackpad that works with Windows Hello to log into the computer. It’s very fast and convenient and perhaps my favorite feature on this computer. The display on this model is the same 13.3-inch size as the standard XPS 13 and has the same minimal frame that makes it look even larger. The 1080p model on my review unit is sharp and bright with well-saturated colors. You can opt for a higher-resolution Quad-HD panel, but I don’t see the need to when the 1080p version is this good. The 2-in-1 version of the XPS 13 swaps out the proper Core i processor for one of Intel’s weaker fanless versions, which might lead you to think it’s not particularly powerful. However, my experience with the Core i7 model (the 7Y75 processor, to be exact) has been exactly the opposite. I’ve been able to run dozens of tabs in a browser, multitask between apps with ease, and go about my day-to-day work without skipping a beat. Like the ultrathin Acer Swift 7, this Dell laptop isn’t the machine for gaming or heavy photo and video editing, but for everyday tasks it performs admirably. Intel’s fanless processor is quiet, yet powerful enough for day-to-day tasks That fanless processor also means this XPS 13 remains perfectly silent when pushed hard – there’s none of the fan noise we’ve become accustomed to with laptops. (Nor does it have the odd "coil whine" from the processor that has affected a small number of standard XPS 13 models.) It can get warm, though, and the underside gets uncomfortable on my lap when I’m using it for long periods of time. Battery life is also solid and reliable, with the laptop generally lasting between seven and eight hours under my usual workload before needing to be plugged in. And if I do have to charge to get through the rest of my workday, the 2-in-1’s USB Type-C ports lets me top up through an external battery. But not all is sunshine and rainbows with the XPS 13 2-in-1. Starting with those ports, the 2-in-1 drops the standard model’s selection of two USB-A, one USB-C, and full-size SD card slot and replaces them with a microSD card slot and two USB-C ports (one of which supports Thunderbolt 3). There is, fortunately, still a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Dell does throw in a USB-C to A adapter in the box to get you started on your dongle life. But I still miss the full-size SD card slot for quickly getting images off my camera and onto my laptop. Another particularly irksome change is the power button, which is now on the right-hand side of the computer. It’s small, mushy, and difficult to press, which wouldn’t be too much of a problem if the XPS 13 2-in-1 reliably woke up from sleep when I opened the lid, but it doesn’t. In fact, this computer has a lot of issues with sleep and hibernation: it either does not sleep properly when I close the lid, leading to loss of battery in my bag, or it shuts down completely and loses all of my active work and programs when I start it back up. We’ve noticed this behavior with two separate review units, so it appears that Dell has something wrong with the software that manages these functions. This computer’s issues aren’t solely relegated to its hardware, either. Despite its premium price, the XPS 13 2-in-1 comes loaded with unhelpful programs from Dell and nonsense such as McAfee trial software. You can uninstall them, but you shouldn’t have to when you spend this much on a computer. Design issues aren’t this computer’s only problem Opening the 2-in-1 is also an inexplicable chore, as Dell failed to provide any lip to grasp onto when lifting the lid. Just getting the computer open and into a usable state requires two hands and a lot of effort. The one black mark on the standard XPS 13’s report card is its poorly located webcam and the 2-in-1 doesn’t address the issue. The camera has been moved from the bad lower-left spot to centered under the display, which is nearly as bad. It’s impossible to look at the camera and the display at the same time, and the up-the-nose angle of view is extremely unflattering. Further, should you use the keyboard while on a video call, your fingers will block the camera, which is just dumb. You could rectify this by flipping the 2-in-1 over into its tent mode, which will put the camera above the display, but then you give up access to the keyboard and trackpad. Dell really just needs to figure out how to put the camera above the screen like every other laptop. Fixing the webcam’s poor placement is also the best reason I could find to flip the 2-in-1 into one of its tablet modes. Unsurprisingly, this computer is still 90 percent a laptop and maybe 10 percent a tablet. Dell doesn’t provide any software to make compelling use of the increased physical capabilities, and I expect that most people will use it in the laptop mode the vast majority of the time. You might want to flip it around to watch a video while on a plane, but that’s about it. The XPS 13 2-in-1 unsurprisingly makes for a poor tablet As a tablet, the XPS 13 is too heavy (2.7 pounds, the same as the normal model) and too thick (between 8mm and 13.7mm) to be comfortable to hold for any stretch of time. The display’s trim borders actually hamper its tablet aspirations, as there is less to hold on to when in tablet mode without errantly touching the display. These aren’t unique complaints to the XPS 13 2-in-1 — they apply to virtually every convertible laptop I’ve used — but the whole reason for the 2-in-1’s existence is its flexibility, which isn’t terribly useful in the real world. This in turn leads me to question why anyone would choose this particular version of the XPS 13. Sure, it’s a fine laptop, with a great keyboard, nice display, and snappy performance, but so is the standard XPS 13, which doesn’t have the compromises in ports or processor and costs less. And for the same price as the model I reviewed, you can get HP’s stellar Spectre x360, which is about the same weight and thickness, has a more powerful processor, more ports, and can do that whole convertible thing if you want it to without the compromises of the Dell. Dell still has an excellent laptop line with the XPS models, but the XPS 13 2-in-1 doesn’t make it shine any brighter than it already does.

The brand new Aorus X3 Plus v7-CF1 follows the usual Aorus philosophy of packing a good deal of gaming hardware in a laptop chassis that seems impossibly thin. Not, admittedly MacBook Air thin, but Aorus is playing in a different league as this gaming laptop measures only 22.9mm in thickness. As the name suggests the Aorus X3 Plus v7 uses a seventh generation Intel Kaby Lake CPU along with a GTX 1060 GPU and 16GB of DDR4 memory to drive along gaming performance. The display uses a panel with IGZO technology that has an unusual QHD+ resolution of 3,200 x 1800. Aorus has a track record of using esoteric screen resolutions so this 3K panel has 6 Megapixels, which is rather more than the Aorus X5 v6 which had a panel that was also nominally 3K but with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,620 or 5 Megapixels. It is clear that Aorus is stepping up every aspect of the new X3 Plus v7 with the intention of delivering a top notch gaming package in a tiny chassis. Watch via our VIMEO Channel (Below) or over on YouTube at 2160p HERE Aorus X3 Plus v7-CF1 specifications: Processor: Intel Core i7-7820HK Processor Clock Speed: 2.9GHz-3.9GHz Graphics Chipset: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 Graphics Memory: 6GB Screen Size: 13.9″ Screen Type: IGZO QHD+ Backlight: LED Screen Resolution: 3,200×1,800 (‘3K’) Memory Supplied: 2x 8GB DDR4-2,400MHz Memory Size: 16GB (2x8GB) Max. Memory Support: 32GB SSD Drive: 1x 512GB M.2 PCIe LAN: Killer LAN Wireless LAN 802.11ac : Intel Wireless-AC 8260 Bluetooth Version: v4.2 Webcam: Yes USB 3.1 Type-C Port: 1 USB 3.0 Type-A Ports: 3 HDMI 2.0 Port: 1 Mini Display Port: 1 Card Reader: SD/SDHC/SDXC Microphone Jack: 1 Headphone Jack: 1 Security: Kensington Lock Battery: 73Wh Dimension: 330mm (W) x 264mm (D) x 22.9mm (T) Weight: 1.8 Kgs Operating System: Windows 10 Warranty: 2 Years As our photos of the innards show, the compact chassis leaves very little space for the components. The battery requires about one third of the available room, the G.Skill DDR4 memory and Lite-on SSD sit in the centre and the CPU, GPU and coolers take up the remainder of the space. It comes as no surprise the chiclet keyboard has relatively short travel keys however that is fine. Our gripe with the keyboard is that the ten keys are outboard of controls such as Backspace and Enter. We can be thankful the touchpad and mouse buttons use a conventional layout. This is a small laptop but Aorus hasn’t felt the need to make any dramatic changes to cram in all the hardware. The ports and connectors on the back and two sides are neatly arranged. On the rear we have Ethernet and the power point, on the right there are two USB 3.0 and a card reader, along with the power button. On the left you’ll find the headset jacks, mini DisplayPort, HDMI, another USB 3.0 type A and a USB 3.1 type C. That’s a full house of everything we want to see on a laptop. It is also worth noting the compact 150W power brick includes a USB port so you can plug in your phone to charge while you’re running the laptop off the mains. Testing We ran through our usual suite of games and 3DMark and were impressed by the way the Aorus X3 Plus v7-CF1 handles games at 1,920×1,080 or 2K. It was a different story at the native resolution of 3,200×1,800 or 3K as the GTX 1060 GPU cannot handle the resolution without pulling back on image quality. This is no surprise but is simply a fact of life. If you want to play games above 2K you are best advised to pack a GTX 1070 GPU, rather than GTX 1060. Cooling Performance. Aorus has a tough job on its hands keeping gaming hardware cool in such a tiny chassis however it manages the job very capably. No doubt it helps that the total power draw is a relatively lowly 150W (that power supply works hard) but nonetheless Aorus has to make the system work correctly. The Kaby Lake CPU tops out at 82 degrees C and the GPU hit 76 degrees, which are each four degrees cooler than the similar Razer Blade laptop. Under extreme load when the Aorus was drawing 150W we saw the CPU temperature bouncing off 90 degrees and temporarily throttling. During our testing the CPU ran at a high idle temperature of 46 degrees; it is our guess this is a deliberate policy to reduce cooling noise to a minimum. Acoustics performance. We have complained about the noise from various Aorus laptops over the past few years. Take two GPUs in SLI or a single beefy GPU and you have plenty of heat to shift. Pack the hardware in a slender chassis and the fans work overtime, hence the noise. This X3 Plus v7-CF1 is the best of the Aorus laptops we have seen. Again, no doubt the relatively modest power draw helps, but it shows that Aorus has adjusted the fan curve to suit and this is welcome. The Aorus X3 Plus v7-CF1 is not a quiet laptop and we consider the Razer Blade to be better in this respect but you get more performance with this laptop and  therefore have to make allowances. Closing Thoughts. We approached the Aorus X3 Plus v7-CF1 with trepidation, wondering how it would perform and whether it would be as noisy as a high speed train arriving at the platform. All the big questions were answered favourably as the new Kaby Lake processor pulls the performance along nicely. The GTX 1060 GPU does a fine job however it has a tough task pushing the high resolution IGZO display. In fact, we don’t see much point in the 3K display and while the laptop looks superb it would surely look very similar with a 2K panel and you wouldn’t have to muck around adjusting the resolution or image quality when you played games. This is a thin and light gaming laptop that does a decent job and has no obvious problems and to be frank, that is a welcome improvement from Aorus. The pricing is interesting as the 512GB SSD helps keep the price below £2,000 and while we would prefer 1TB of storage we can see why Aorus went down this path. In many respects, Aorus X3 Plus v7-CF1 is competing directly with Razer Blade. This is an uneven battle as the Aorus loses a certain amount in terms of build quality and overall finish but wins it back with overall performance, thanks to the faster CPU. Whether or not you buy an Aorus cap, shirt and hoody to go with your new laptop, well that’s a completely different matter. Discuss on our Facebook page HERE. Pros: Thin and light. Excellent IGZO technology display panel. Decent 1080p gaming performance. Solid battery performance. USB port on the power brick for charging your phone. Cons: Cooling fans are audible, even when you unzip files or install games. Keyboard layout is annoying. GTX 1060 graphics struggle to power the 3K display at high image quality settings.

Betsy DeVos Protest by Andy Towle February 15, 2017 | 8:48am Share417 Comments Last night, Rachel Maddow raised the unanswered questions following Flynn’s resignation and asked how we’ll ever get them answered by the government in place, which includes an FBI director who might possibly be involved, an attorney general who might possibly be involved, and a Chairman of the House Intel Committee, who was part of Trump’s transition team. Maddow started by offering an example of how Vladimir Putin has successfully silenced critics and opponents, offering a terrifying counterpoint to what’s going on here in the U.S. Maddow tells the story of the head of the Ethics Committee in Russia’s parliament, who made $75,000 a year but owned several homes, nearly a dozen cars, and many large parcels of land. Rather than reveal how he afforded all these things, the official chose to resign when his wealth was exposed on a blog. The blogger who exposed him, Alexei, Navalny, became an activist figure in Russian politics, and said he would run against Putin next year when Putin’s term is up. Said Maddow: “At one level that makes us all surprised to learn that he’s still alive.” She noted that just last week, Putin found a way to effectively disqualify Navalny from running against him: “They found a remote regional court hundreds of miles from Moscow and they got that court to convict Navalny in some obscure scheme involving timber futures.” ALSO: Rachel Maddow Explains Why The Flynn-Russia Revelations are a Really, Really Big Deal: WATCH And then she turned to our own situation, raising important questions about the Trump-Flynn-Russia connections that haven’t yet been answered: How did Michael Flynn get named National Security Advisor when he was already under investigation by the FBI and the Army? Did Flynn lie to the FBI during his first days as NSA about his conversations with Russia, which would be a felony? Has Attorney General Jeff Sessions interfered with the FBI investigation of Flynn or the investigation of the Trump campaign and its contacts with Russia in any way? Because acting Attorney General Sally Yates told White House counsel at the end of January that Flynn had contacts with the Russian government that were undermining Obama sanctions and was vulnerable to blackmail. Why did the White House take no action for weeks and continue to allow Michael Flynn to have unobscured and unilateral access to the president? Did Flynn help the Russians interfere in U.S. elections? Will that charge be investigated? Will it be prosecuted if it turns out to be true? Maddow then noted how the top Trump officials are either saying “there’s nothing to see here” or were so embedded in Trump’s transition team at national security levels that they have no motivation to investigate the Trump transition and can’t in any way do it fairly. Said Maddow: “So. Rule of Law. The National Security Advisor is out. No National Security Advisor has ever been forced out in 24 days. No National Security Advisor has ever been forced out in circumstances this scandalous and I’m including the ones who were convicted or pled guilty to felonies. The White House’s behavior and the president’s behavior around this ouster is bizarre and unexplained, and in some cases it’s inexplicable. The allegations here about national security risks and the undermining of the U.S. government by a foreign power – these are as serious as anything that has ever been alleged against any president not just in modern times but ever. And the question tonight is where is the rule of law? What’s the remedy for that? Where are we thinking the investigation is going to come from here?” Watch: Maddow then talks to Rep. Adam Schiff about whether Americans can get an impartial Trump inquiry. Will our government even try to get to the bottom of it?

But now I bought motherboard without PCI slots, so I had to buy new PCI-e network card. So I bought Intel 82574L CT Gigabit Desktop Network Adapter(PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_10D3&SUBSYS_A01F8086&REV_ 00) to play video games. Integrated NIC on this new motherboard works just fine, but you can always do better than default or integrated. Here's screens of technologies available to me in NIC's control panel: http://i.imgur.com/qmfuiTc.png http://i.imgur.com/n4w9t8y.png I don't use any kinds of VPNs, routers, modems, etc. Cable goes directly into network commutator of ISP(I believe it's Cisco unless they changed it). If model will make a difference on settings, tell me and I'll get the exact model of the network commutator of ISP. My ISP using DHCP to configure network. I get dedicated dynamic(it's different every time I reconnect) white IP address, so I can setup a server on my PC. Values of properties: Quote: Adaptive Inter-Frame Spacing: Disabled Flow Control: Rx & Tx Enabled Gigabit Master Slave Mode: Auto Detect Interrupt Moderation: Enabled Interrupt Moderation Rate: Adaptive(other possible values: off, minimal, low, medium, high, extreme) IPv4 Checksum Offload: Rx & Tx Enabled Jumbo Packet: Disabled Large Send Offload V2(IPv4): Enabled Large Send Offload V2(IPv6): Enabled Locally Administered Address: Not Present Log Link State Event: Enabled Maximum Number of RSS Queues: 2 Queues Packet Priority & VLAN: Packet Priority & VLAN Enabled Receiver Buffers: 256(minimum value is 80, max - 2048) Receive Side Scaling: Enabled Speed & Duplex: Auto Negotiation(works in 100 MB Full Duplex mode) TCP Checksum Offload (IPv4): Rx & Tx Enabled TCP Checksum Offload (IPv6): Rx & Tx Enabled Transmit Buffers: 512(minimum value is 80, max - 2048) UDP Checksum Offload (IPv4): Rx & Tx Enabled UDP Checksum Offload (IPv6): Rx & Tx Enabled Wait for Link: Auto Detect And there are more properties in TCP Optimizer(and who knows how many more you can tweak in registry manually): http://i.imgur.com/PyzTZCx.png http://i.imgur.com/kEwc4ss.png Screenshoted values above are defaults for all of the properties. I tried to read descriptions about these technologies but unfortunately I am unable to set proper values for all of these properties. I don't know how to test those values and when I tweak all of them, sometimes it works faster than default, sometimes slower. I measure it by how fast I get confirmation of a kill in video games such as CS:GO or Insurgency. I also tried to read different guides on the internet and different people suggest to turn off or turn on the exact same properties of NIC, they also explain and both explanations make sense, so I am completely lost what values should I set for these properties. It would be nice if there was some program to monitor packets and then by seeing how many packets there are, what are sizes of these packets, etc., one could determine proper settings for these properties. Could someone help me to set proper values for these properties, guys? If you need any other info, don't hesitate to ask, I'll provide as many info as I can. If you know some articles and programs which can help me to determine proper values, please post them here. Thanks in advance, gurus!

Will be discontinued in less than a year. You should have bought the i210-T1 or something if you had to have one BTW that intel i219v that comes with your mobo is by far a superior chip in performance and feature set. That 82574L is almost 10 years old.. Let that sink in. I recommend you to return it. As for tweaks, just set optimal in TCP optimizer. Interrupt moderation rate set to Minimal. The rest of defaults are good. Maybe you should replace your wiring to cat6a, cable modem/router because 100mb link means something is old.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   (#3) Kulagin Newbie     Videocard: Nvidia MSI Processor: Skylake@4.6gHz(OC-BCLK) Mainboard: ASRock Extreme4 OC@145mHz Memory: Team DDR4@3000mHz 1x8GB Soundcard: ALC1150&Kave OC'd&Mod 6.0 PSU: Chieftec 700W GPS-700A8 Yesterday, 16:39 | posts: 19 Quote: Originally Posted by Agent-A01 That NIC will stop getting driver support soon.

That 82574L is almost 10 years old.. Let that sink in. I see. Yes, that's not a problem to turn on integrated NIC and use it instead. In fact, I just did it. I bought another one for $4 or something, anyway. Not even worth to return it xd. Quote: Originally Posted by Agent-A01 Maybe you should replace your wiring to cat6a, cable modem/router because 100mb link means something is old. My ISP doesn't provide 1 GBit/s. So I'll have to stick to 100 mb for now. Quote: Originally Posted by Agent-A01 As for tweaks, just set optimal in TCP optimizer. Interrupt moderation rate set to Minimal. The rest of defaults are good. Thanks for suggestions, I'll try these out, but you see, in another thread(this one) people suggest contradicting settings: Quote: Originally Posted by Mineria On the nvidia NIC's I disabled all offloading and enabled flow control, since that worked better. With my current NIC I got offloading and flow control enabled, since those operations are done directly on the cards hardware (it has its own CPU and RAM). So it means different settings are better for different NICs. What I'm interested in is to know how do I find best settings for my specific NIC and for my specific application? And after I finish reading just his post: Quote: Originally Posted by Mineria I don't see the big effect when it comes to pure bandwidth, but pings are definitely a lot lower. That gives me the best performance for mmo gaming. Another thing to take note of is the Sidescaling option. If you got a 1000Mpbs NIC connected to a 100Mpbs interface you will have lower upload than with it disabled, that was something I saw with the NIC's sitting on my board. Nothing dangerous will happen playing around with the settings, just remember to do some tests in between so you know the effect for your system and use. I am completely lost. And there are few more posts like that in that thread. And when I open guides on speedguide.net and alike: http://www.speedguide.net/articles/gaming-tweaks-5812 I have no idea what to actually set, because one people suggest to set some specific setting on and others suggest to set it off or vice versa. What I determined so far that it isn't good for latency and hit registration in video games to have too many small packets with too many headers, it's better to have smaller number of packets bigger in size.

It will be less than 1ms(unless its old) So any benefits you read only that you read online will be minimial. You might get a more stable ping(less fluctuations) but nothing you tweak will be significant enough to matter. All those options for offloading he turned off are just going to put more load on the CPU. He is talking about NVIDIA NIC and again those are ancient. Those improvements he is getting are strictly related to his setup. In that case you can't assume those tweaks will help you; they won't. You should ping the first hop (your ISPs first server, aka where your traffic first gets routed through) and do a comparison of before and after tweaks. You likely see little improvement. Interrupt moderation will be the main one. On extreme setting, it will wait several MS to combine packets. With off it will send every packet interrupt instantly. The downside is having more interrupts creates more load for system hardware. Minimal is the best option and will have very little affect on latency, probably something like less than .2 ms. Quote: My ISP doesn't provide 1 GBit/s. So I'll have to stick to 100 mb for now. You said you have 100mbit connection to your NIC. That has nothing to do with your ISP, that is your LAN speed. Which means you have a very old switch, cable modem, router etc and you'll likely see more benefits in latency replacing those.     Agent-A01 View Public Profile Find all posts by Agent-A01   « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Week day three to seven right here on WBI Annan Bauerle embattled via David were talking about. Michael Flynn. Outs as the national security advisor. Right now it's Keith Kellogg filling that role. What do you see happening to their position in the future is say Keith Kellogg who'll take over rated Petraeus is the name that gets thrown out a lot what do you see happening. You can just because I get hurt at all hours of dog show track that I we. General catalog is green berets are comes the intelligence community a little bit different than Clinton did. Are you all understand that Michael ware and under Obama. Usually has the attache for the military. There and put them that their Director of National Intelligence. We as of cocaine to the Pentagon is equivalent to the NSA inside the Pentagon. So he had a huge. Michael Lewis was kinda prematurely not be afraid to tell commander in chief. I disagree with the real law and I'm gonna work against you in the better interest of the country so. Little sleep kind of words where the rebel Kellogg is the ultimate soldier. Ari did play and do anything wrong and that we talked to Michael Caputo and a earlier in the last half hour. He says this is a rogue intelligence trying to undermine the administration when you think. Chris Rock I do believe politically wrong and he lied until vice president and you know what whenever you start to become open excuse simple life so we're told different stories. We interviewed Michael Flynn and that the story was consistent with the story that he told patch. He may have lied to the FBI as well so that could be another. Another situation where you have the patriots. Telling one story. Been telling the officials another story. Internally. If they made that decision then yes you get so they are delighted to vice president black. Will you help out about an organization obviously this accompanied or god forbid the country. It is. All behind. Sources that have absolutely no evidence. And that won't even come forward and announce who they are and where they're from and what their evidence is and they are leaking into the New York Times. That the president of the United States was working within Russia to get Intel and Hillary Clinton during the campaign. It is a coup d'etat that is being beat by a rogue element in the intelligence community for the salt Turkish. To undermine the president. To placate the senate and house that wants to impeach this president. One of the darkest days of the republic went unnamed people without any evidence. Can go to the newspaper. And just put him completely baseless allegations. I imagine what you what you HR and just. Hello I am a person told me we don't know who he is we don't know what the law that says. But I'm sorry it's just not working out you've got to go home that's double the world work it's it's certainly not the way our government should work. Do you believe Mike Pence is really left in the dark and its soul is stirring things to be made event is that just the vice president's role. We didn't discriminate when the constitution especially I don't know what the light of this we know each section the seventh we know he was that. The big guys who who are. The deciding vote. But to really only be releasing the vice president is talked about is in the event of the death of the presidency at his role in the senate. Everywhere else is kind of invented the world god knows George W. Bush. You know made. Dick Cheney the overlord of the war on terror. You have different roles of Joseph Biden and it sort of covered every president does their role playing and watching that bush. The president is ultra did you see my current and I'm a much more respected war we've ever seen with the vice president. I guess does the big question it is he was kind of pushed out there on TV where he was forced to. I'd deny that anything happened any communications happened and now. With the what we know now with the flames resignation. And he looks bad going back and reviewing that tape saying nothing happened nothing happened. I'm should he be put in those positions if he's not going to be consistently. In the loop with what's going on. And I think you're onto something that it's kind of existential argument of this entire thing whether or not saloon and pencil on the same page. If Kellyanne Connolly should've gone out there and I don't know sold called brand new we're shocked that they are convention area an error occurred the green bureau reporting this. The guy that's running the show all the white out straight now. Is well outside that element too extreme risk. He won the supposed to be communicating with the DHL action and not a rescue people green card card holders in the airport. He's the one that's supposed to communicate with the different branches. It's likely that same something the other guy should know. What's going on the previous system one that doesn't have the organization. And actually get another dual role. It's gonna be the cheapest apple laid out. What trump himself like Aaron David you know if if he did know. And captain in down to himself firs I guess since the nineteenth. You could reach the trouble to but I don't know how that's gonna be able to be proven. That. At least for example did the allegations that trump she actually had any doesn't make any soc process to a decision. We still 1 morning and then Justin Bieber supported. That should leave the mindset of how the left treat stroke and here we have a president that appear to have parent information for seventeen days. And I can make a rush to judgment actually try to find all the facts. And make a rational decision. They eat. Like channel impediment president. I don't know how that place politically but I think yeah he may be useful anchorman a good decision. At the end of the day forums gone by the chaos noise how's continue to leaks continue and you look at that guy who's who and then the gatekeeper. To the White House in the cheapest Kim. I don't know if you're ready for this job because this thing it's a match. We didn't put Bieber on the plane that Trudeau took back from Washington to Canada. And a legal and obtain the marquee from Peru that just being repaired only one point. Yes I.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple MacBook Pro 2016 buyers were more or less happy with the device’s performance. However, when it came to battery performance, they were thoroughly disappointed. Consumer reports even suspended its recommendation after testing the device. The MacBook Pro 2017 device is expected to get major upgrades to its battery. Apple is said to be making a proprietary chip that can take away some of the load off the device’s Intel processor. Moreover, the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 has reportedly removes bugs that drain the battery away. According to Tech Times, there are certain MacBook Pro 2016 tips and tricks that can significantly enhance the device’s battery life. Users should use Safari, instead of any other browser, even Chrome. This is because Safari performs the best for the MacBook Pro 2016 when it comes to power usage as the program has been designed specifically to not use the AMD graphics processor. Thus, even when a user is using graphics-heavy pages such as Google Maps, it won’t drain much of the battery. Most people already know that background applications drain away a lot of battery. Background has to be cleaned at intervals to remove apps that are not being used currently. All browser tabs must be closed when not in use. If users want to extract 45-60 minutes extra usage from their Apple MacBook Pro 2016, they should watch videos only in full screen mode and also deactivate the closed captioning. Within this state, the laptop draws significantly less power. While these are the main tips to decrease Apple MacBook Pro 2016 battery drainage, CNET has also advised users to dim the screen even though the new screens are 30 percent more power efficient. Apple has shrunk the battery size from 95.5 watt-hours of capacity for the 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro to 76 watt-hours for the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro. Users must also be aware of the USB devices they are using. These devices fire up the laptop’s communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Apple MacBook Pro 2016 users should always unplug dongles once they are done with their work. The new USB-C ports are amazing only when one has the right cables and peripherals. The Apple MacBook Pro 2017 is a highly-anticipated device that may come with an Intel Kaby Lake processor and QHD+ Display that may significantly improve battery life. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple’s Mac products.

A court declined to approve an arrest warrant for a man accused of shouting expletives at Danbury high school students in what the mayor described as verbal harassment, and getting into a fight with students in the school parking lot in January, police said. According to police, on Jan. 20 a man, who has not been publicly identified, came to Danbury High School to pick up a relative from school. Video of the incident shows the man holding a Trump sign and waving it around while shouting at students. Police said the man appeared to be intoxicated at the time. Trump's Labor Secretary Pick Withdraws Nomination Several people believed to be students began arguing with the man over the sign. When the man went back toward his car, the teens approached him started a physical fight, according to police. Police said the man did not press charges against the teens. Analysis: Few Good Alternatives to Palestine State At the time of the incident police did not have video evidence of the situation, but video later surfaced on Twitter that shows the man shouting "You’ll be out of the country you [expletive] illegal," at students. Based on the man’s actions and apparent public intoxication, officers applied for an arrest warrant but it was not approved by the court. The case is now closed, police said. Trump Quiet on Russian Ship Off US Coast, Cruise Missile Though no criminal charges will be filed, Mayor Mark Boughton said that the principal has banned that individual from the school property. Police stressed that school officials cooperated with them during this investigation and that both police and school officials will continue to work together “to ensure the safety and security of the students at Danbury High and all schools throughout the city."

While this posturing may benefit the U.S. in trade negotiations with most nations, Korea is unlike most nations. Korea, its technology firms, its universities and its independent inventors have an intangible advantage that is not well understood. Now may be a good time to take stock of the related assets. Over the last 20 years, Korean firms, universities and inventors have invested in product innovation, process automation and overall productivity. Beyond the success that these investments have earned for Korean firms in market share and revenue gains, these investments have secured a mostly hidden advantage. This hidden advantage is not typically discussed at the highest levels of government (U.S. or Korea) or at the top levels of private firms. While its meaning has been ascending over time, the significance of this hidden Korean advantage relative to U.S.-based firms remains in the shadows. This advantage is embodied in the growing portfolio of Korean-owned intellectual property. Yes, Korean firms have excellent intellectual property. And more importantly, much of the associated intangible value is based on patents granted by the government of the United States. The high quality of Korean intellectual property is significant because of the contemporary media narrative about claims of Samsung illegally copying Apple, Hyundai and Kia copying a hybrid vehicle inventor, LG copying AMD, etc. Such media narratives, independent of their validity, ignore important facts about Korea based innovations as objectively measured through patent data. The supporters of Trump reading such narratives may be inclined to react to these legal claims, hence their backing for currency- and/or trade-related policies that may mitigate any advantage to be realized through copying. But are Korean firms succeeding only by copying and cost-based competition? Not according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In calendar year 2015 Samsung Electronics generated more patent documents (applications plus grants) in the USPTO than any other applicant, according to sources. This was the first time in many decades where a non-U.S. based firm actually had more USPTO activity than domestic entities such as IBM, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, Microsoft and Google. Another objective measure of native Korean inventiveness is the number of U.S. patent grants to Korea-based universities. USPTO data indicates KAIST and Yonsei University earned more U.S. patent grants than many top-tiered global research institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania and Yale from the Ivy League, Northwestern University (my own institution) and the University of Tokyo. Overall, four Korea-based universities were amongst the top 30 academic recipients of U.S. patent grants in 2015. While counting U.S. patent activity is an approach to measure inventiveness, more scientific, objective measures of patent quality have emerged over the past 10 years. By aggregating multinational patent statistics, firms like PatentSight in Germany are generating robust, global measures of invention quality. The uniqueness of their approach leverages the judgment of patent examiners, unaligned third parties who make assessments regarding the relevance of patents. The PatentSight approach also measures the size of markets covered by patent families. This objective methodology, vetted in the scientific literature, facilitates the indexing of individual inventions through measures such as Competitive Impact. The overall relative value of patent portfolios may be benchmarked through measures such as the Patent Asset Index. R&D-intensive multinational firms such as BASF, Siemens, Phillips, Caterpillar, Dow, Novartis and Sumitomo Chemical are already using the power of such patent analytics to improve their internal decision-making and, importantly, to advance their standing in the capital markets. Government authorities such as the European Competition Commission are also adopting these analysis tools to better understand competitive advantage in their own markets. So how do Korean inventors stack up against those from other nations? Since 2006 the average Competitive Impact for inventors residing in Korea has improved 94 percent, outgrowing its Asian neighbors. Interestingly, U.S.- and German-based inventors have seen a decline in average quality of their inventions over the same period. Overall, however, the U.S. and Germany remain powerhouses of innovation in terms of high-quality patent portfolios. Back to the storyline about Korea's intangible advantage. High-quality patents like those being granted to Koreans as per above have strong litigation power. That means they do well in court. An excellent place to bring competitive pressures to bear against U.S. firms is the U.S. legal system. Note that the Mexican government is considering how they may use the U.S. immigration courts to confound current U.S. immigration enforcement plans. If Koreans so decided, they could use the U.S. legal system (judicial infrastructure paid for by U.S. taxpayer) to add competitive pressures to U.S. firms both large and small. As the quality of Korean patent activities across the world improves, the negotiating power associated with owning such U.S.-based intellectual property rights may enter into currency- and trade-related conversations and bring the inventiveness of Koreans out of the shadows.

Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on February 15, 2017 at 6:30 AM, updated February 15, 2017 at 10:07 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that President Trump took "immediate, decisive" action in demanding the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.  Spicer insisted the resignation was demanded because Trump lost trust in Flynn after he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his having spoken to the Russian ambassador about sanctions.    Spicer, and the administration he speaks for, are not to be believed, once again. Trump took "immediate, decisive" action in removing Flynn, more than two-weeks after he was informed by the Department of Justice that Flynn misled Pence about his five phone calls with the Russian Ambassador and that Flynn may be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. If "eroding trust" was truly the reason for Flynn's removal, President Trump should resign for failing to inform Pence that Flynn misled him until last Thursday, weeks after Trump was informed.     The New York Times reports that Trump only acted because the story that Flynn mislead Pence leaked to the press.  "Aides privately said that Mr. Trump, while annoyed at Mr. Flynn, might not have pushed him out had the situation not attracted such attention from the news media.  Instead, according to three people close to Mr. Trump, the president made the decision to cast aside Mr. Flynn in a flash, the catalyst being a news alert of a coming article about the matter.  'Yeah, it's time', Mr. Trump told one of his advisers." If Trump was acting decisively and it was really about eroding trust, Flynn would have been removed the week of January 26 when acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed Trump's counsel Donald McGahn that wire taps had shown Flynn mislead Pence and talked about sanctions with the Russian Ambassador.  McGahn immediately informed Trump and a small group of advisors.   Pence was not among them.    The DOJ and US Intel picked up the Flynn-Russian phone calls while doing routine surveillance of Russian officials.    The calls sent up a red flag because their timing coincided with Obama booting-out Russian diplomats, Putin's out-of-character passive response and Trump's fawning tweet about Putin's response. "Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"  Trump had tweeted. As part of their ongoing investigation into Russian hacking of the DNC and connections to the Trump campaign, the FBI interviewed Flynn about the five phone calls he had made in a single day to the Russian Ambassador.   They reportedly came away thinking Flynn had not been fully forthcoming.  Flynn wasn't fit to be NSA to begin with. In 2015 Flynn took a paid trip to Russia to speak at a gala for Russia's state-run media company RT.  At the gala he dined with Putin.   It seems like he picked up some propaganda tips from RT to pass along to the Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer. General Colin Powell, who served under three presidents, blasted Flynn in email exchanges to his son and another associate.  Here are some excerpts from the emails. "Flynn got fired as head of DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency)  I asked why Flynn got fired.  Abusive with staff, didn't listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc.  He has been and was right-wing nutty every(sic) since." "Pattern of behavior which is why he was fired, real question is how he got that far in the Army." "Gen. Flynn is a jerk. Got canned of DIA." During the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Flynn led the crowd in chants for Hillary Clinton to be "locked up". Flynn's son was fired from the NSA staff by the Trump administration after tweeting a fake news story that the Clinton campaign was running a child-sex ring from the basement of Washington D.C. pizza parlor. Flynn himself had been known to tweet links to false stories about Clinton. It's imperative that the Senate Committee investigating the Russian hacks call Flynn to testify.    That possibility is another reason why Trump really didn't want to fire Flynn.   If Flynn was still part of the administration, he would have some protection against  testifying.  He no longer has that, he knows a lot, and no longer has a reason to be loyal to Trump. What did Trump know and when did he know it? Spicer said Trump didn't care about the nature of Flynn's call with the Russian Amb.  That I can believe, because talking about sanctions fits with Trump's policy towards Russia, which is complete capitulation  to Russia's agenda. The New York Times reports that Trump's presidential campaign and Trump associates "had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election", based on phone records and intercepted calls. There has been an ongoing joint investigation by the FBI and intelligence agencies into connections between the Trump campaign and associates, and Russia. Counter terrorism and intel expert analyst, Malcom Nnce, said on MNSBC ,"This is very, very serious stuff.  The FISA warrant authorized the NSA to turn on the full collection power of the United States.  There is nothing that will escape that.  These people (in the Trump administration) need to start getting lawyers and cutting deals." "We need to know whom Trump owes and who might own him" Three-time Pulitzer Prize winning New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman asks the question Congress should demand the answer to for the sake of national security. "Every action, tweet and declaration by Trump throughout thus campaign, his transition and his early presidency screams that he is compromised when it comes to the Russians. I don't know whether Russian oligarchs own him financially or whether Russian spies own him personally because of alleged indiscreet behavior during his trips to Moscow. But Trump's willingness to attack allies like Australia, bluster at rivals like China, threaten enemies like Iran and North Korea and bully neighbors like Mexico -- while consistently blowing kisses to Russian President Vladimir Putin- cannot be explained away by his mere desire to improve relations with Moscow to defeat the Islamic State.  We need to know whom Trump owes and who might own him, and we need to know it now."

News World Americas Congressman demands investigation of Donald Trump and Michael Flynn over Russia links amid fears secrets were traded Member of powerful Oversight Committee says 'unprecedented' scandal 'has added fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories' Jon di Paolo Wednesday 15 February 2017 10:32 GMT Click to follow The Independent US Then National Security Adviser Michael Flynn speaking during the daily news briefing at the White House earlier this month (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) An urgent investigation into whether the Trump administration has compromised the US and UK through its links with Russia has been demanded by a member of the Oversight Committee in the House of Representatives. Democrat congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said Michael Flynn's resignation as National Security Adviser following revelations he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the US before Donald Trump took office raised major concerns secrets may have been traded with the Kremlin. "There are several serious significant unanswered questions," Mr Krishnamoorthi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  "The biggest is quite simply was General Flynn, in Donald Trump's parlance, one bad hombre who went rogue, or was he directed by someone else to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? What was discussed exactly, and why, and... what do the Russians know about our national secrets? Because at the end of the day we need to protect ourselves and of course our allies like the United Kingdom, and in order to do so we need to understand whether any of our secrets were compromised in the balance." Republican Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the powerful Oversight Committee, has said his panel won't investigate the circumstances that led to Mr Flynn's resignation, instead deferring to the House Intelligence Committee, which is already probing Russian links with the Trump campaign and administration.  "I think that situation has taken care of itself. I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue," Mr Chaffetz told reporters on Tuesday. However, Mr Krishnamoorthi said cross-party momentum was building for greater transparency on all the dealings the Trump team has had with the Kremlin. Read more Trump knew for weeks that Flynn withheld truth on his call with Russia "This is not a partisan issue. I'm very heartened that Republican senators such as John McCain, Lindsey Graham and others have also called for a full investigation within the US Senate. We need to do the exact same thing in Congress," he said. "Half the country at this point has serious questions about the relationship between the Government and the Russian Government. We need to have full and open proceedings in order to answer all the questions that the public has, because this revelation as regards Mr Flynn has added fuel to the fire with regard to all the various conspiracy theories that are out there right now. "This is unprecedented. I cannot recollect a time recently when a national security advisor lasted all of 25 days, who had discussions with the Russian government, one of our primary adversaries today in the world, with regard to lifting sanctions. Was there a quid pro quo? 'If Russia did X, we will lift sanctions'? What is that 'X'? That's what people are asking. "We must re-evaluate what the Russians know about our national secrets and how we protect ourselves, and then move on from there." Meanwhile fellow Democrat congressman Seth Moulton told CNN that if it were confirmed Trump's team had been "conspiring" with the Kremlin, "that's the very definition of treason". “I mean, let’s not lose perspective on exactly who we’re talking about here,” he said in comments reported by The Hill. "Russia is the number one enemy of the United States of America.” “If members of the administration are essentially conspiring with Russia – either through the [2016 presidential] campaign earlier or now in the administration itself – I mean, look, Wolf, that’s the very definition of treason,” Mr Moulton told host Wolf Blitzer. “This is a very, very serious affair. The definition of treason is putting our enemy’s interests ahead of our own. That’s what the definition is."

The giant trade show in Barcelona is where all the latest models get shown off first  Share  Comments BySophie Curtis 09:57, 15 FEB 2017 Technology (Photo: GSMA)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email If you're planning to upgrade your mobile phone this year, then you'll want to pay attention to Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017. Every year, in February, technology companies from around the globe descend on Barcelona to showcase their latest smartphones, tablets and wearable gadgets, and offer a glimpse into our digital future. This year, big name brands including Sony, LG and Huawei are expected to unveil their new flagship smartphones, while other companies show off innovations in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and virtual reality. "Over the past three decades, mobile has evolved from an emerging communications technology to a phenomenon that is now at the foundation of everything we do," said Michael O’Hara, chief marketing officer at the GSMA, which runs MWC. Big name brands traditionally unveil their new flagship smartphones at MWC (Photo: GSMA) "It has inextricably changed how we communicate, interact, work and play as individuals, and it’s transforming entire industries, bringing new levels of productivity and efficiency to enterprises. "The 2017 edition of Mobile World Congress will highlight just how elemental mobile has become in our everyday lives and the positive impact it is having for billions of people around the world." Here's everything you need to know about MWC 2017: Where is it? Barcelona has long been the home of MWC, with the Fira Gran Via acting as the focal point. Events will also take place at Fira Montjuïc. MWC takes place at the Fira Gran Via, Barcelona (Photo: GSMA) When is it? MWC 2017 officially runs from Monday February 27 to Thursday March 2. However, products will start to be unveiled from Sunday February 26, with many of the big product announcements being made before the event starts. Who will be there? More than 2,200 companies will exhibit at Mobile World Congress 2017, including major tech brands such as Google, HTC, Huawei, Intel, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Nokia, Samsung and Sony. Mobile operators such as O2 and Vodafone will also be there, as well as a number of car companies such as Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen. The GSMA expects that more than 101,000 attendees at MWC this year (Photo: MOBILE WORLD CONGRESS) As well as the halls filled with technology, MWC hosts a series of lectures, keynote speeches and round-table discussions with industry bigwigs. Keynote speakers at this year's show include John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic, which makes Pokemon Go , Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix , and Rajeev Suri, President and CEO of Nokia. The GSMA expects that more than 101,000 professionals from across the mobile industry and adjacent sectors will attend MWC 2017. What should you expect? A few of the big companies have already released teasers for their new mobile handsets, while others have confirmed that they won't be announcing new products at the show. Virtual reality and augmented reality are expected to feature heavily at the show (Photo: GSMA) Here's a rundown of what we know so far: Samsung often unveils its new flagship smartphone at MWC, including last year's Galaxy S7 , but the company’s mobile head DJ Koh has told Reuters that the Galaxy S8 won't be making an appearance at this year's show. However, the company has sent out invitations to a press conference on February 26, where it is widely expected to unveil its latest iPad rival, the Galaxy Tab S3. At the other end of the spectrum, Sony is reportedly planning to unveil a bumper crop of five new smartphones at MWC, including a new flagship with a 5.5-inch 4K display, optimised for virtual reality. LG has already sent out invitations for its press event LG has already sent out invitations to an event on 26 February, where it is expected to unveil the G6 smartphone, which is rumoured to feature a display with an 18:9 aspect ratio and a bezel-free edge-to-edge display. The company is said to have abandoned its efforts with modular smartphones, after the G5 handset failed to ignite consumer interest. Huawei is said to be preparing to unveil its P10 handset - a successor to the P9 with a Leica dual camera system. Leaked images seem to show that the new device will have a curved-edge display, similar to that found on the Galaxy S7 edge. The pictures, obtained by Tech2, also show the famous Leica dual-lens camera that debuted with the P9 last year. As with most other smartphones these days, the P10 appears to be coming in two different sizes. There will be a larger (and probably more expensive) P10 Plus launched at the same time. Read More Huawei P10 pictures leak gives a glimpse at the next Chinese smartphone to rival Apple and Samsung Having insisted that the U Ultra , unveiled a few weeks ago, is not its flagship device, many assumed that HTC was saving its follow-up to the One M10 for MWC. HTC recently unveiled the U Ultra smartphone - but insisted this is not its flagship (Photo: PA) However, the HTC's president of smartphones, Chialin Chang, appears to have thrown cold water on the theory, claiming that the company won't be unveiling any devices featuring Qualcomm's latest top-of-the-range processor, the Snapdragon 835. Nokia recently heralded its return to the mobile market with the launch of its first Android phone, the Nokia 6 , in China. The brand is now owned by Finnish company HMD Global , which outsources its manufacturing to Chinese consumer electronics company FIH Mobile. Nokia is supposedly set to reveal its biggest product ever at MWC 2017 - a new tablet with an 18.4-inch screen, powered by Android Nougat - as well as several smartphones. However, people are most excited about rumours that HMD could resurrect one of Nokia's most beloved handsets, the "indestructible" 3310. As usual, Apple won't be attending MWC. The iPhone maker prefers to hold its own launch events, so don't expect to see anything sporting the familiar Apple logo at MWC. Apple will not be attending MWC 2017 (Photo: GSMA) Anything else? Despite what the name might suggest, MWC is about much more than just mobile phones. Expect to see gadgets covering a whole range of technology trends, including artificial intelligence, drones, the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, virtual reality and augmented reality. In the Drone Zone, attendees can learn about the latest developments in drone technology, including live demonstrations in the “flying cage”, while the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Zone will be dedicated to the evolution and advancement of robot technology.

This Microsoft Surface Killer Costs $369 and Can Also Run Ubuntu GO Chuwi Hi13 will be available for pre-order on February 20 Feb 15, 2017 09:54 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  The number of alternatives to Microsoft’s own Surface 2-in-1 is constantly increasing, and now Chinese manufacturer Chuwi is getting ready to introduce its own such device. Presented at CES earlier this year, the Chuwi Hi13 will be launched on February 20 and will be available for pre-order the same day, coming with a price that really makes it an intriguing product for those looking for a 2-in-1 running Windows 10. The Hi13 will sell for $369, and in addition to Windows 10, the device will also come with support for Ubuntu, with Chuwi making quite a big deal about this, as it’s one of the few 2-in-1 models on the market that can run the open-source operating system with no additional tweaks or modifications. Technical specs The Chuwi Hi13 comes with a 13.5-inch display with 3000x2000 resolution and is powered by an Intel Apollo Lake Celeron N3450 processor clocked at 2.2 GHz. It features Intel HD Gen9 Graphics 500 and 4GB RAM, with 64GB eMMC storage. Made of metal and with a fanless design, the Hi13 also boasts one USB Type-C port and one microHDMI input. It comes with support for a detachable keyboard, just like Microsoft’s own Surface, and also includes a pen called HiPen H3 that can be attached to the screen, as you can see in the photos here. The HiPen H3, however, won’t be available at launch, but Chuwi says the existing HiPen H1 stylus already works with this device. Other features include four-speaker audio, 5-megapixel camera on the back and 2-megapixel camera on the front, Wi-Fi, 10,000 mAh battery with fast charging, and two USB 2.0 ports that are integrated into the keyboard. On paper this device looks like a pretty good alternative to Microsoft’s Surface, so it’ll be interesting to see how it performs in real-life too. And the simple fact that it comes with Ubuntu support from the very beginning makes it twice more compelling for those who were looking for a 2-in-1 device that offers super portability.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Asus Zenbook 3 Review The convergence of technology has led to many beautiful innovations in terms of gadgets. While smartphones have come a long way in terms of providing almost everything that a user needs to get their work done, there are times that you still need a laptop to get things done just that much quicker and better. However, up until the introduction of the original Macbook Air, laptops were definitely a big deal to carry around. They were thick, bulky and at the end of the day could potentially give you severe backache. The Macbook Air changed all that. It showed how easy and effortless it can be to carry around a laptop. This brought about the Ultrabook era with most manufacturers pushing for thinner and lighter designs while trying to increase functionality. Despite all this, it would be difficult to say that Windows offering have been superior because they weren’t. Apple broke barriers again with the new Macbook that did everything the original Air promised to do and more in a smaller form factor which was considered to be near impossible. Since then, many manufacturers have been trying to play catch up and now with the Asus Zenbook 3, we possibly have one that can not just catch up but also lead the race. Let’s take a look at how far we’ve come with compact computing. Configuration This is the configuration of the Zenbook 3 that we tested: 12.5″ IPS 1080p Panel with 60Hz Refresh Rate Intel Core i7 – 7500U 2.7GHz 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 RAM 51GB PCIE Gen3X4 SSD 6 Cell (40 Whrs) Battery Windows 10 Home Design, Materials and Build Quality It doesn’t take a genius to know that the Zenbook 3 was inspired by the Macbook design. In fact, there are a lot of similarities between the two. However, that’s fine and it is almost impossible to create something that is totally unlike the other especially when it comes to technology. Most smartphones are large gadgets with a lot of glass and at the end of the day no matter how many customizations or minor changes you make, there is only a certain limit of differentiation that you can achieve. In fact, standardization of technology is a good thing in a way and allows you to move forward together. The entire automotive industry works in similar way too. If one accused the other of copying the steering wheel and prohibited the other from doing so, then we wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. Despite the similarity, the Zenbook 3 does have its own unique identity. For starters, the Zenbook is both thinner as well as lighter than the Macbook but the difference is only marginal and doesn’t have any real implications on day-to-day usage. Both of them are splendidly thin and are a breeze to carry around. The Zenbook is a tad bit longer and shorter than the Macbook too. It uses a special 6013 aluminium alloy that is 50% stronger than regular aluminium. Asus has carried over their design characteristic of concentric circles on the outer lid of the Zenbook that looks good and sets it apart from the tons of monotones that most other notebooks are available in. The Blue colour variant that we have with us also has Golden edges and highlights including the logo, keyboard letting etc that gives a nice contrast as well as a premium look. The outer lid has a glossy finish while the rest of the Zenbook has a matte finish to it. On paper this may seem to be out-of-place but in reality, it doesn’t look so. The Zenbook also comes in a Rose Gold and Quartz Grey colour for those who think that the Royal Blue maybe a tad bit too much. I personally think that the Blue is the most unique and attractive colour on offer. The Zenbook is light but quite sturdy at the same time. In fact, even the display unit doesn’t wobble as such like some laptops do and this could be accounted to the usage of strong hinges as well as good weight distribution. The chamfered edges too give it a beautiful finish and premium feel. The subtle finishing touches such as the Zenbook Series logo on the outer potion of the hinge too really make a difference when it comes to the end-user experience. Asus also gives a beautiful stitches puch with a magnetic clasp. It has fabric lining on the inside and a rexin sort of material on the outside. Display The display can be lifted open using the small cutout at the front of the Zenbook. It closes and opens with just about the right amount of resistance. The Zenbook 3 has the same 12 inch display size as the Macbook albeit with different resolution and aspect ratio. The 16:9 aspect ratio of the Zenbook is in fact what gives it the more elongated design. The Zenbook 3 display packs in a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels while Macbook has 2304×1440 pixels. While there certainly is a big difference in the pixel density, it doesn’t create a world of a difference in real life due to the smaller screen size. It also would amount to a better battery life which already is something that Windows machines trail behind on. So this will definitely help in that aspect which we shall discuss in depth later. The  Macbook does have an edge when it comes to the screen as it is brighter and sharper (even though the difference isn’t as tangible). The Zenbook screen however is more vibrant and supports a wider colour gamut of 111% sRGB while Macbook can only manage 107%. However, I still like the Zenbook display quite a lot. One of the reasons for that being the deeper contrast levels and perhaps the aspect ratio itself that I prefer to the one on the Macbook. The viewing angles on the Zenbook 3 are really good too. The display is quite reflective though and you’ll have to crank up the brightness when you are working against the light or outdoors. Luckily, the contrast levels and brightness are high enough to facilitate a trouble-free experience even in such instances. The display supports a refresh rate of 60Hz and has Intel HD graphics. Note that it doesn’t have a touchscreen but that’s a feature that I find to be pretty gimmicky at this point of time so I personally think thats a positive in fact. Keyboard and Trackpad The island style keyboard on the Zenbook 3 provides quite a lot of feedback despite having so little room to work with. I find it superior to the Butterfly switches on the Macbook which also offer lesser key travel. The higher key travel makes it less prone to mistypes which was an issue on the Macbook. The Zenbook keyboard feels more cushioned as well and I quite like it. The keys are a bit elongated though and that will take sometime to get used to but once you do, typing is a breeze. Again, the aspect ratio of the display and the resulting dimensions of the product did give more room to the designers to work with. The trackpad too is quite good and is miles ahead of most of the ultrabooks or notebooks that I have tested in the recent past. It does not feel as smooth as the one on the Macbook but I wouldn’t mind using it on a daily basis. Most other Windows machines that I have carried around needed to be used with a mouse to prevent you from losing you sanity. The trackpad has a fingerprint sensor that is present at the upper right corner. While at first glance, you may think that it would interfere with your usage, it actually doesn’t. There is enough travel to prevent you from accidentally running your fingers off the trackpad and onto the sensor itself. Fingerprint Sensor The Zenbook 3 fingerprint sensor is located on the trackpad as we mentioned earlier. Despite the unusual positioning, the trackpad does not interfere with the trackpad functions. It works well and is quick to authenticate your fingerprint. While typing passwords and logging in isn’t that cumbersome, it still is easier to just unlock the device by placing your finger on the sensor. You need to set a password first before setting up fingerprints and you also need to choose a backup PIN to allow you to sign in case Windows Hello isn’t available. All you need to do is just tap the sensor and you get logged in. Storage, Connectivity and Performance The Zenbook 3 comes with a 512GB Toshiba SSD with around 476GB of usable space. By default, there are two partitions, one for the OS and the other for the user’s personal or work related files. We performed speed tests using CrystalDiskMark and here are the results. The Zenbook 3 is about as barebones as it gets when it comes to wired connectivity. There is just a USB Type-C 3.1 port on the right side as well as a headphone jack on the left side. This is very similar to the situation on the Macbook as well which shares a similar number of ports or lack of ports thereof. However, I believe this to be a fair tradeoff. Any consumer who is even considering to get himself a Zenbook should very well be aware of what he wants. This is a machine that will help you extract as much productivity on the go as possible while being as small and portable as possible too. If he/she is looking for something to connect multiple peripherals to or play hardcore games on then they are clearly looking in the wrong direction. However, with that said, Asus does provide a mini dock in the box that converts your single USB Type-C port and gives you a USB Type-C port, USB Type-A port and a HDMI output. You can also buy a full-sized dock that will add a VGA port and Ethernet port to the mix. But that would defeat the purpose of having such a portable and small machine. The mini dock makes sense especially since we are yet to reach a phase where USB Type-C has become the industry standard method for wired connections. The universal dock on the other hand I feel is a bit of an overkill. While I did say that ground breaking performance isn’t something that one should expect when getting the Zenbook 3, it is still one of the best Ultrabooks that I have tried. It can definitely eat the Macbook for breakfast when it comes to computing power and the performance was flawless. It can handle multi-tasking with ease and while you can’t play hardcore games since there only is shared Intel graphics on board, you still can play some of the older less graphic intensive games on this if you want to. Since it comes with an i7 processor, cooling is definitely needed and it has a fan inside that takes care of the cooling. The fan does a good job at keeping the heat at bay but it does get a fair bit loud especially for a device of such a small size. The heat gets dissipated through the opening between the bottom half and the display unit. Music The acoustic experience on the Zenbook 3 is really something great. Combine the great speakers with Asus’s SonicMaster technology and you have a winner. The speaker not just provides really loud volume output but also manages to provide a great deal of clarity through the  speakers. The system consists of 4 Harman Kardon speakers that provide great sound especially considering how thing and small the laptop is. Camera The web camera on the Zenbook 3 is easily one of the worst that I have tried in recent past. Not just that the VGA resolution is really poor. But also add to the fact that the artifacts and facial tones are rendered really poorly. The field of view is also really narrow which takes family Skyping out of the equation. The only silver lining being that it is quite bright even in environments that aren’t well-lit. Battery Life This is one aspect where Windows machines have come a long way but still trail behind Macs at the end of the day. Apple optimizes their laptops better and also has better battery technology. In this particular case, the Macbook has an Intel Core M processor as well instead of the powerful i7 ticking inside the Zenbook. Nonetheless, the Zenbook 3 is definitely a solid performer when it comes to battery life especially considering the i7 processor. The 1080p resolution and optimization too play an important role in making sure that is the case since the battery capacity itself isn’t that big either. Do note that when performing heavy tasks, the battery life will take a hit but when doing regular tasks, it lasts pretty long and I have managed to get around 5 hours on a single charge. Another good thing is that the standby time is great and even without shutting down the PC, it can last a few weeks on a single charge. You do need to use the bundled charger to get the fast charging abilities. Funnily enough, we did try charging the PC using a regular mobile phone charger and USB type-C but that didn’t work. We would have expected it to charge even if it was a slow rate as that is one of the advantages of having a USB Type-C port. Even the more powerful and bigger 2016 Macbook Pro 15″ with Touch Bar managed to charge on the same charger and cable so its weird why the Zenbook didn’t. Conclusion The Zenbook 3 was a product that really interested me when I saw it at Computex 2016. Finally after having given it a run through the usual process of reviewing, I have to say that I really like it. It is probably the closest thing to having a Windows version of a Macbook in today’s world. It even goes to the extent of one upping the Macbook in a few areas and overall I think that the final decision will really depend on what OS you would prefer. If you don’t mind either, then its a question about paying the price as the Zenbook 3 is no cheap buy either. The Zenbook 3 retails at a price of Rs 1,47,990 which is a good 8000 rupees higher than the 512GB Macbook. However if you are looking for something with more processing power while still having a similar footprint and portability, the Zenbook 3 is your best bet. Pros Beautiful Design and Solid Build Quality Compact and Ultra Portable Good Battery Life Powerful Performance Bright and Sharp Display Brilliant Audio Output Fingerprint Sensor Cons Price Noisy Fan Glossy Display Horrible Camera Quality "Asus Zenbook 3 Review", 1 out of 5 based on 12 ratings.

[Rumor] EVGA Partnering With AMD On Vega & Radeon RX 500 Series Graphics Cards The Ryzen 7 1700X and 1700 have been subject to multiple performance benchmark leaks, all of which have painted a very positive picture of Ryzen’s multi-core and single-core performance. In fact, these sub $400 chips have competed favorably with Intel’s $1000+ i7 5960X and i7 6900K 8 core Haswell-E and Broadwell-E CPUs. Both the Ryzen 7 1800X and Ryzen 7 1700X have two listings each with a 20 Euro price difference and slightly different product IDs. We have seen product listings of both chips before at $499 and $389, where the chips were listed without a boxed stock cooler. This indicates that AMD could be launching these CPUs with and without stock coolers. Users who plan to overclock their Ryzen 7 1800X or Ryzen 7 1700X can pick up the same processors without a boxed cooling unit and save twenty bucks that they could spend towards purchasing a high-end cooling unit instead. Three New Ryzen Coolers With RGB Lighting This segues us neatly into talking about Ryzen’s two brand new boxed coolers in addition to what appears to be an aesthetic update to the beloved Wraith cooler which debuted last year. The first of the three will come with 65W rated Ryzen CPUs, the second is for 95W CPUs and the third will likely be paired with Ryzen Black Editions. Black Editions are said to have the letter X at the end of their model numbers, like the 1800X and the 1700X for example.This is merely educated conjecture at this point. We won’t know for sure until the end of the month. The Wraith cooler features four copper heatpipes, the largest thermal mass by far of any stock processor heatsink that we’ve seen and a near silent fan that’s considerably larger and more more effective than any of AMD’s previous stock CPU cooling solutions. In fact, you wouldn’t be able to guess that the Wraith unit is a stock CPU heatsink rather than a high-end aftermarket low profile unit had it not been for the AMD branding on the shroud. Senior Vice President & Radeon Technologies Group Chief Architect Raja Koduri having a “special moment” with his new Ryzen PC If the above photo of Radeon Technologies Group Chief Graphics Architect Raja Koduri is anything to go by, all three new coolers will feature LED lighting. Perhaps even customizable RGB lighting. Seeing how magenta is not AMD’s corporate or brand color, it’s likely that Raja chose that custom color. It also appears from the rendering that the two smaller coolers actually have the same 92mm fan that comes with the Wraith, which is very good news. The new fan is significantly quieter than its small noisy predecessor.

ASUS AM4 X370 Crosshair VI Hero ASUS AM4 motherboards for AMD’s upcoming Ryzen CPUs have been listed online for pre-order with their specs, prices & launch dates made public a couple of days ago. The motherboards include two medium-range models featuring the B350 chipset and two high-end models featuring the X370 chipset. The specific models are the ASUS Prime B350M-A, Prime B350-PLUS, Prime X370-PRO and the Crosshair VI Hero. According to the product pages of all four boards, they’re slated for release on the 24th of February. Advertisement Let’s start with the Crosshair VI Hero, one of the company’s highest end motherboards that will be available on day one. The Crosshair VI Hero feature a monochromatic color scheme to match any custom color scheme builders are going for. Power delivery is provided by an ROG exclusive high quality 8+4 phase digital VRM design. We can see a beefy 12 phase Digi+ PWM design. In terms of storage, the motherboard comes with 8 SATA 6 Gb/s ports and a single M.2 slot. ASUS AM4 X370 Crosshair VI Hero Features: Isolated DAC & AMP 8-channel audio design featuring the latest S1220A Codec and ROG exclusive SupremeFX audio. One M.2 SSD slot. 8 USB 3.1 Ports (rear I/O). 4 USB 2 Ports (rear I/O). Front USB 3.1 header. 8 SATA 3 6Gb/s. Customizable RGB Lighting with 2 LED headers 2 way SLI and 3 way CrossFire Auto and manual overclocking support Built in AC Wi-Fi Asus AM4 Prime X370-PRO The Pro series boards from ASUS have become staples in the company’s lineup over the past several years. This is ASUS’s sweet-spot board for gamers and professionals alike, coming in at a more affordable price point while sacrificing very little in terms of features and functionality. ASUS AM4 Prime X370-PRO Features : Isolated DAC & AMP 8-channel audio design featuring the latest S1220A Codec One M.2 SSD slot 8 SATA 3 6Gb/s. 4 USB 3.1 ports (rear I/O). 4 USB 2 Ports (rear I/O). Front USB 3.1 header. RGB Lighting with 1 LED header 2 Way SLI and 3 way CrossFire Auto and manual overclocking support ASUS AM4 Prime B350-PLUS & Prime B350M-A At the more mainstream and entry level end of the market ASUS will be introducing two Ryzen compatible AM4 motherboards on day one. Both of these boards are based on AMD’s mainstream B350 chipset and as such support overclocking. Both boards feature an isolated audio design, 4 DDR4 DIMMs and six SATA 3 6Gb/s ports. The Prime B350-PLUS is a standard ATX board with two full length PCIe slots, two x1 PCIe slots and two legacy PCI slots. The Prime B350M-A is a Micro-ATX form factor board with one full length PCIe slot and two x1 PCIe slots. It’s difficult to discern how many USB 3 and USB 2 ports each of these boards has but one thing that’s immediately noticeable is that the B350-PLUS is equipped with VRM heatsinks while the B350M-A lacks any kind of VRM cooling. So even though the B350M-A board does support overclocking, it would be ill-advised to attempt any significant clock speed increases or high voltage adjustments. AMD Ryzen Asus AM4 Motherboards - Specs & Prices Wccftech Asus Crosshair VI Hero Asus Prime X370-PRO Asus Prime B350-PLUS Asus Prime B350M-A Chipset X370 X370 B350 B350 Overclocking Yes Yes Yes Yes CrossfireX/SLI Yes Yes TBC* TBC* PCIe 3 (Graphics) x16 Lanes x16 Lanes x16 Lanes x16 Lanes PCIe 3 (Storage + I/O) x8 Lanes x8 Lanes x8 Lanes x8 Lanes PCIe 2 x8 Lanes x8 Lanes x6 Lanes x6 Lanes USB 10 USB 3.1 Gen1, 2 USB 3.1 Gen2, 6 USB 2 6 USB 3.1 Gen1, 2 USB 3.1 Gen2, 6 USB 2 MSRP TBA TBA TBA TBA TBC : To be confirmed. TBA : To be announced. In theory B350 boards are capable of supporting CFX & SLI via two x8 PCIe 3 slots. AMD's initial statements -- which the company said were subject to change -- indicated that B350 boards will only be configured with a single x16 PCIe 3 slot. However, several B350 motherboards have been pictured featuring two or more full-length PCIe slots which suggests that the company may have changed its position on B350 multi-GPU support.       Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Veteran of the Week Lew McCreary� JOHN MICHAEL LEWIS, Navasota, TX Pastor Lewis was born the son of a carpenter in Lafayette, LA., and he is 70. In 1966 and Galveston, he volunteered (Marines) and completed basic at Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Oceanside, CA., already promoted as PFC. He also trained at Camp Lejuenes various schools in weapons, guerilla warfare and Vietnamese. He also qualified as an Ontos crewman (light tank) that had truly awesome firepower and accuracy. A cruise to Spain on a navy LSD followedthen early in 67 to Vietnam for a tour lasting eleven months because of medi-vacking out. During his in country assignment locally he was in charge of psychological operations (sarcastically known as beans, bullets and bandages and keeping villages pacified. His responsibilities included monetarily compensatingscript money for family members that suffered losses resulting from US military combatas well as recon and self help assistance to villagers who no longer could farm. With his corpsman, medical assistance was available and interrogation carried out...as John was also S-5Intel gathering. Soon he recognized the local terrain lent itself strategically to set up a defensive perimeter upon nearby Marble Mountain, elevated 450 above and between three villages below. With this strategy he and his 17 band of brothers spent four months consistently resisting Viet Cong encroachment. Previously Marine casualties had been discouraging but under Johns management, winning had become the norm. Fortunately he had a relationship with a field hospital and bartered for building materials that enabled them to avoid spending days of monsoon downpours with only a poncho for coverand built hoochs. A distinct advantage for their detachment was personal oversight by a three star general who quickly responded to efficacious combat suggestions. Their routine became daily rest and card games, then fighting the VC (black pajamas) at nightwhen the VC attempted to eject their unit and capture their mountain. Fortunately they were confident, battle savvy and professional. However on occasion close combat became so desperate they called in US artillery rounds that often landed too close for comfort. Then unexpectedly John experienced an inguinal hernia requiring medi-vacking out, and on to Yakuska, Japan for attention and Manila for surgery. He preferred returning to Marble Mountain but ended up in Oceanside, CA where as a sergeant he would teach guerilla warfare and survival until his three year commitment was complete in late 69. As a civilian John began a sales/marketing careerfor two years with a west coast marketing outfitthence to Houston where he managed a Tenneco retail service station for a season, then sold cars for a half dozen agencies for eleven years. He was also temporarily a realtorand still dabbles in this field locally. Then one day he donated blood and they determined he had Hepatitis C caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam. Fortunately he never imbibed alcoholic beverages and it hadnt progressed. In 2004 Agent Orange struck again, this time as type 2 diabetesbut the good Lord kept him active and alive. He began successfully teaching real estate but experienced other diabetic symptoms (failing eyesight and high sugar numbers. Once again God intervened and sent John an angelic lady, then began experiencing powerful divine interventions by the merciful God of heaven. He had found the truth in 2002 through an evangelist that began a new phase in his life so he attended the Houston branch of Charis Bible College. Then eight months ago he began substituting as pastor at a church in Washington, TX., then was asked to become pastor. John also started a prison outreach in nearby Anderson (TDCJ) along with assorted assisted living appearances. Today he still depends upon the Holy Spirit to lead, guide and direct his ministries. Spiritually hes come a long distance since that day in Vietnam when their aircraft was forced to land and lacked verification of repairs to a strip earlier destroyed by VC rockets. The pilot shouted If anybody can pray, start right nowand John did. He soon kissed the tarmac and promised God he no longer feared deathbut it wasnt until 1975 he received the Holy Spirit and ultimately became a full gospel preacher.

Intels had alleged that NPA was owing it $840 million and has subsequently pursued the payment petitioning the National Assembly. But NPA is now claiming that Intel has been sitting on its revenue amounting to about $952 million and another N3.3 billion. In a letter to the Chairman, House Committee on Marine Transport, a copy of which Vanguard has, the Managing Director of NPA, Ms Hadiza Bala Usman, said Intels is indebted to the NPA in the Onne and Warri ports in respect of rents, lease and throughput fees. She stated: “Intels has been collecting dues and charges on behalf of the agency since 2010. It is Intels that is rather indebted to NPA in respects of rents at its Onne base which currently stands at N3.3 billion.” The letter also stated: “The total agency commission to Intels computed in line with the executed agreement was $353 million for the period under review. This amount was deemed to have been deducted electronically from service boat revenue by Intels in accordance with subsisting agreement. The total sum of $68million is currently in Intels custody, pending the issuance of credit notes for project and finance costs.” Meanwhile, efforts to get the NPA to comment yielded no fruit as at the time of filing this report. Its General Manager, Public Affairs, Mr Mike Ajayi, who promised to get back never did. Also, efforts to get comments from Intels failed as its media consultant, Bolaji Akiola, could not get back with a response after a telephone contact with Vanguard.

Chromebooks. MacBooks. 2-in-1 hybrid tablets. Buying a laptop is more confusing than ever. But we're here to help. Laptops by Dan Ackerman February 14, 2017 2:02 PM PST @danackerman Laptop Buying Guide: What to look for when laptop shopping CNET's Dan Ackerman, who's been reviewing laptops since 2005, tells you what features and technologies matter most, and which ones you can ignore. by Dan Ackerman 2:56 Close Drag Choosing a new laptop is a lot harder than it should be. Every major brand has multiple product lines with overlapping prices and features, and every description is filled with jargon about processors, types of storage, graphics capabilities, screen resolutions and a laundry list of ports and connections. And don't even get me started on names. Good luck figuring out the meaning behind a Pavilion/Inspiron/XPS/Latitude/Spectre/Envy/ZenBook/Odyssey or any of the others. It's enough to make you go back to a no. 2 pencil and a composition book. That's why we test and review dozens of traditional laptops every year, plus Windows tablets and 2-in-1 hybrids, and even Chromebooks. This handy buying guide will give you the basic background info you need to add context to those reviews and to make a smart purchase. Of course, if you're looking to just jump right in, I've preselected a handful of my favorite current laptops to highlight. If you ran into me on the street, I'd probably steer you towards one of these as a starting point. Our top picks A big investment that will last for years: Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016)MacBooks, especially the latest Pro models with Apple's Touch Bar, cost a bundle, but they remain the most universally useful laptops you can buy. >More affordable: Apple MacBook Pro (without Touch ID and Touch Bar) >Cheaper, lighter but less powerful: Apple MacBook (12-inch) Sarah Tew/CNET Inexpensive, without feeling cheap: Samsung Chromebook Pro A budget-priced Chromebook, running Google's Chrome OS, is going to feel speedier than a similarly priced Windows laptop. Now that Chromebooks can run Android apps as well, they're more useful than ever. >A bigger, better Windows 10 alternative: HP Spectre x360 >A mainstream Windows 10 laptop that's cool but affordable: Dell XPS 13 Sarah Tew/CNET A perfectly balanced gaming laptop: Dell Alienware 13 R3 (OLED) I've always wanted a gaming laptop that's portable but powerful. Add to that support for virtual reality headsets and a brilliant OLED screen, and this hits almost every gaming checkbox I have. >Custom components and hands-on service: Origin PC Evo-15S >Over-the-top gaming excess: MSI GT83VR Most buying guides and shopping advice features tend to get bogged down in the specs, mechanically listing subcategories within subcategories. Instead, I'll break out the most important things to know when looking for a new laptop, starting with my three cardinal rules. Three rules for buying a laptop 1. Don't buy too much laptop Not too many years ago, $1,000 was considered a good price for a boring, run-of-the-mill laptop. Today, some of the most advanced designs, from the Dell XPS 13 to the HP Spectre sell for less. Apple is the one computer maker that regularly gets away with charging significantly more (the mainstream MacBook Pro starts at $1,500). Fully functional Windows 10 laptops can be found for as little as $200, though they're not good for much beyond basic web surfing. Chromebooks, which run a limited set of software in Google's Chrome OS (instead of Windows), are easy to find for $300 to $500, and can feel very speedy, even for budget-minded machines. Some new ones even have touch screens and run Android apps, which gives you a lot more flexibility. Even gamers can spend less than you might expect. Laptops with Nvidia's very good GeForce 1050 GPU can be found for $800, although if you're interested in virtual reality, the cost of entry rises considerably. 2. Travel light The first question I have when someone asks, "What kind of laptop should I buy?" is this: How many days per week do you plan on carrying your laptop around with you? Daily or near-daily commutes mean you want something with a 13-inch or smaller display, that weighs under three pounds and is at most around 15mm thick. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro just hits those specs, while systems like the HP Spectre and Acer Swift 7 both dip below 10mm thick. Some very, very thin laptops. Sarah Tew/CNET Those superslim systems usually trade a little power and battery life for portability (there's only so much room in a 10mm thick laptop for a battery or cooling fans for a fast CPU, after all), but trust me, carrying a 15-inch midsize laptop through an airport even once a month is going to get old real fast. 3. Design is king Do you want a U-series Intel Core i5 Processor or a Y-series one? Do you need a standard SSD hard drive or a faster PCI-e version? Is the same full HD resolution as your big-screen TV enough, or do you need a 4K laptop display? For most of what we do on our laptops today -- websurfing, streaming video from Netflix, YouTube or Amazon, posting on social media, sending email or using office apps like Office or Google Docs -- budget laptops will work fine. And with laptops that share similar processors, graphics cards or other components, our decade-plus of testing data shows that they perform, well, similarly. That means what you're really investing in is a design you like. That can include weight, thickness and screen size, but also covers the layout of the keyboard, how large the touchpad is, how thick the bezel around the screen is, metal versus plastic, or even the color or pattern on the back of the lid. Dell's XPS 13 family has only a very thin bezel around the display. Sarah Tew/CNET And there's nothing wrong with making design choices your no. 1 deciding factor. A laptop is not only hefty investment, it's also a visual extension of your personality. You may carry it around with you all day, or even all over the country. Of course you want something that's both comfortable to use and pleasing to look at. It's as much a personal accessory as a jacket or a pair of glasses. That's what Apple nails really well -- the parts inside of a MacBook are not that different from other laptops (although the operating system is another story), but the human interface tools are fantastic, and the design has become a standard for what a lot of people think a laptop should look like. FAQ What's better, Windows or MacOS? I'm not touching that one with a 10-foot pole. There are no online commenters angrier than Mac fans bashing Windows, or Windows fans bashing Macs. That said, there are a few general rules of thumb that can help determine which side of the fence is right for you. MacBooks, which run Apple's MacOS operating system (formerly known as OS X), have a higher cost of entry. The least-expensive MacBook right now is the 13-inch MacBook Air, which starts at $1,000, while the latest MacBook Pro starts at $1,500. However, you get an amazingly seamless partnership of hardware and software, which is especially evident in how the multitouch gestures beat any Windows laptop, and how it's so easy to preview almost any file just by tapping the space bar. That said, there's a lot less software you can install on a Mac, and games are pretty much out of the question. Under the latest version of MacOS, you have to go digging around in the settings menus to even install any software from what Apple calls "unidentified developers," which is anyone without its stamp of approval. Apple's MacBook Pro comes in 13-inch and 15-inch versions. Sarah Tew/CNET With Microsoft's OS, now up to Windows 10 (where did Windows 9 go? Don't ask...), you get a lot more flexibility in price, hardware and software. Windows 10 laptops dip as low as $200, and I've also reviewed configurations that top $5,000. You can get a 10mm thick ultraslim system, or a giant 12-pound-plus monster. You can get gaming rigs, hybrids that split into a separate tablet and keyboard, and just a generic-looking $600 plastic clamshell. Windows is great if you like to tinker with registries and drivers, you want more direct control over what your software and operating system are doing, or if you want a touch-based OS, as most Windows laptops have at least a touch option now. On top of that, Windows 10 is much easier for a beginner to use than any previous version, and "running Windows" is no longer considered a knock against a PC. The tl:dr version: choosing between Windows 10 and MacOS depends on what style of laptop hardware you want, and how much you want to spend. How about a Chromebook? Not too long ago, these stripped-down laptops running Google's Chrome OS were basically just big web browsers with few other features. They were cheap, they went online, and that was about all you could say about them. Now that we're in the third or fourth major generation of Chromebooks, they've evolved to such a degree that there's really no reason a Chromebook can't be your main laptop. New models have basic filing system and media management tools, and nearly everything you'd want to do is browser-based, anyway. Gmail is probably your main mail app. Music comes from Spotify or another online streaming source, video comes from Netflix, Amazon or YouTube, and for office work, there's either Google Docs and its related tools, or the free online version of Microsoft Office. The Acer Chromebook R13. Josh Miller/CNET Beyond that, new Chromebooks are adding Android app compatibility. So now, in systems such as the Samsung Chromebook Pro, you can download, install and run a ton of new apps. Only a handful are optimized for Chrome OS so far, but more will follow. The upshot is that a cheap Chromebook feels faster and more responsive than a similarly cheap Windows laptop. For about $500 or less, unless you really need a Windows-only feature, just get a Chromebook. What ports do I need? We're in the midst of a big change in laptop ports. USB-C, which is a smaller, reversible version of the standard USB port (which is technically called USB-A) is becoming the default port on many new laptops. USB-C can handle data, video output, power and more, at USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt speeds. The problem is, to connect to a TV or monitor or use any of your existing accessories, from memory sticks to external hard drives, an adapter is required. USB-C is the future, but for a while at least, most of us will be taking a detour to dongle-town. But if you're not ready for a mono-port future, a couple of standard USB 3.0 ports are good to have, as is an HDMI output. Fewer and fewer laptops have Ethernet jacks for wired internet connections (gaming laptops still do, however), and even SD card slots are fading away. Frankly, between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, we use ports a lot less than we used to, so don't get obsessed about them unless you need something specific. A good example of something specific is using a virtual-reality headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. For those, you'll need an HDMI output and sometimes up to three or four USB ports. How much storage do I need? Old-fashioned spinning platter hard drives (often called HDDs) get up to a terabyte or two easily. But the increasingly common solid state drives (SSD), sometimes called flash drives, are usually found in 128 or 256GB sizes, or 512GB as an expensive add-on. Since most of us store photos, music and video in the cloud now, and use web-based apps instead of installed local software, you can get away with less storage. Gamers are, again, the exception, you'll need 500GB or more of HDD space for big game files, which can run from 25GB to 50GB per game. But for the rest of us, 256GB is a good middle ground. Chromebooks and super-cheap Windows laptops often have virtually no storage, just between 16GB and 32GB, much of which goes to operating system files. On those machines, you're meant to do pretty much everything online and retain only very minimal local files. Do I need a graphics card/optical drive/touchscreen/etc.? Except for the least-expensive configurations, a Windows laptop should include a touchscreen by default. It's not completely necessary, but there are a few things in Windows 10, like accessing the right side tool bar, connecting to Wi-Fi networks, scrolling down long pages, etc., that just work better with touch. These days, even gaming laptops can support VR. Sarah Tew/CNET A graphics card, from Nvidia or AMD, is really only needed if you're playing PC games, or if you're editing very high-res photos or videos regularly. Even 4K video playback works just fine with the default Intel graphics capabilities in nearly any new laptop. You don't need an optical drive. It's time to donate those old DVDs to Housing Works. Should I buy now, or wait for the next update/upgrade/CPU/etc.? That's the million-dollar question, and it applies to nearly every technology category. Every new piece of hardware is a step closer to obsolescence with each passing day, and there's always a new version coming at some point in the not-too-distant future. Once you accept that, it's a lot easier to just relax and buy a product you'll enjoy using, without succumbing to upgrade envy. Where can I find the latest laptop and hybrid reviews?

The final touch was an image, but I needed to edit it and didn't want to reach for my normal work machine. So I popped it open in the Adobe Lightroom Android app, flipped the screen around so the computer was in tablet mode, and pulled the stylus out from its holster in the side of the computer. I had my image edited and ready to go in less than two minutes. It felt completely natural, saved me a little bit of time, and hinted at exactly what the future of the Chromebook could be — genuinely good alternative to the fussiness of Windows and the priciness of MacOS. All images: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo AU Editor's Note: Samsung doesn't sell Chromebooks in Australia, but an enthusiast like yourself might want to purchase it internationally. — Cam In January, Samsung announced two new Chromebooks: a cheap Plus model (powered by an ARM OP1 CPU) and the pricier Pro — it's only difference being an additional colour option (black) and a more powerful processor (Intel M3 CPU). Both were designed with considerable input from Google itself, and the two companies are hoping that all the careful engineering and a neat stylus will convince you that this device is worth spending $US450 to $US550. You can get a reasonably not garbage Windows machine for the same price, so Samsung's newest Chromebook has to be damn great. Especially to surpass the trials of its predecessors. Google thinks it really has something going for it in this souped up OS version of it's popular web browser. Unfortunately, unless your needs are excruciatingly simple, the Chromebook has not been very good. It's been bereft with compromise. You can spend half of what you would on a Windows laptop, but the build quality would be cheap and the display ugly. Or you could throw down the money for a premium device, and feel hampered due to Chrome OS's inability to do more than browse the web. Samsung's new Chromebook Pro is nearly perfect (I reviewed the Pro, but most of this review applies to the Plus as well). For the price. And for the compromises demanded of Chrome OS. This still isn't — and will never be — the OS for the hardcore. If you're normally glued to your PC making major photo or video edits, or coding a new app, Samsung's Chromebook isn't for you. This is for budding digital artists who want a cheap hybrid laptop with a built-in stylus. Or kids and college students who need the 10 to 12 hours of battery life the device can get in daily use. And it's for people who like a pretty display that somehow found its way onto a $US550 device. It is one of the best looking displays you'll find on something this cheap, with blacks so dark they blend into the bezel and beautiful vibrant colours. Though Samsung did decide to go with the iPad-like 30cm, 2400 x 1600 display with a 3:2 ratio instead of a more popular 16:9 found in other laptops. It also charges via one of 2 USB-C ports, packs in a MicroSD card reader, has a keyboard that's a dream to type on, and a continues Samsung's trend of having one of the best trackpads in the business. But Samsung's new devices also add a new feature: the ability to convert into a great tablet. The 360-hinge and touch display aren't new — the wonderfully cheap Asus Flip let you go into tablet mode too. Yet that was back in 2015, before Chrome OS began optimising for our fingers. Now Chrome OS, because of the inclusion of Android apps, lets you read comics, jot down notes, or even draw. Photoshop Mix, Lightroom, and popular Android drawing apps like Sketchbook by Autodesk all open easily and work nearly identically to how they should on a much more expensive Android tablet or iPad. The included stylus even has a roughed up nub, so it doesn't skate across the glass of the display like Apple's $US100 Pencil. That tweak to the stylus is part of Google's plan to make this device as easy to write on as pricier tablets. It can't compete on hardware without increasing the cost, so instead Google relies on minor alterations to the stylus and on software, using machine learning to create an algorithm to anticipate your next pen stroke. The idea behind it is that it should make writing on the device feel more realistic without the telltale lag you'd expect from something with such a low-powered processor. Drawing on the devices is still laggy. As much as I adore the Chromebook Plus, it's damn sluggish when you first press the stylus to the screen. In the video above you can clearly see when writing the Pro is sometimes an entire letter behind the pen. The problem persists in traditional drawing scenarios, too — but in both cases your brain quickly adjusts to the lag, and after about five minutes, if your co-workers aren't looking over your shoulder shouting, "THAT THING IS SLOW," you won't even notice. Unfortunately the lag isn't just present when writing on display. I tested the premium "Pro" version of the device, and after having it choke up on me a few times when messing with Android apps, I can't even imagine how painfully slow the Plus might be. It's especially sluggish when I try to have multiple Android apps open. In fact, Android apps ran so slowly I had to go uninstall a lot of them, including Slack, Twitter, Trello, and Plex. The only apps that didn't cause the computer to slow down like a ten-year-old laptop dragged out of the bottom of the closet were ones specifically optimised for Chrome OS — like the Adobe apps. And the Adobe apps speak to the future of what this device, and Chrome OS, could be. An affordable hybrid that doesn't demand you compromise quality for price. This is a true competitor to Windows and MacOS that sacrifices bells and whistles for lean, smooth operation. It is the perfect device for people who only have $US550 to spend, and it's a fantastic secondary device for people who have a lot more. If more app makers start optimising for Chrome and more computer makers start building hardware this good, then the new Samsung Chromebook Pro could be the future of Google operating systems. The Samsung Chromebook Plus is currently available in stores for $US450. As it has the slower ARM processor, I'd be wary of buying it if you plan to take advantage of beefier Android apps. Instead, wait for the $US550 Samsung Chromebook Pro, which will be available in early April in either silver or black. README Tiny Samsung stylus fits directly into the computer when not in use. It has a rough nub, so it's more pleasant to use on a glass surface than competitors Android apps can slow the Chromebook Pro way down, so pick and choose what you leave open carefully Photoshop and Lightroom actually work pretty nicely thanks to some optimization efforts by Adobe The keyboard and trackpad continue to build Samsung's reputation for really nice input devices Battery lasts 10-12 hours on a charge You will be hard pressed to find a display that looks this good at this price Build quality is a major step above most other devices that retail for $US550 or under. Comments devmac @devmac Feb 15, 2017, 2:10pm Another review of the same device: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/02/10/samsung_chromebook_pro_review/ The Gizmodo article seems to have a title that talks the device up, while The Register article has a title that talks the device down. The content of the reviews seem similar, however. "Photoshop and Lightroom actually work pretty nicely thanks to some optimization efforts by Adobe" Nice work Adobe, not the Chromebook.

Price $2999 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel 6th Gen Core i7-6700 CPU • 16GB 2133MHz DDR4 memory • 2TB HDD • Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Small, sexy, and super-fast… but no SSD as standard? Lenovo might be better known for its office and productivity PCs, but it’s being making a go of the gaming market in recent times. Their latest shot at gaming greatness is the Y710 Cube, an almost-mini-PC that packs some decent hardware into a very small box. It’s not quite small enough to tuck away behind your TV, but it’s a far-cry from the tall towers most gamers are used to.  As you can see, it’s certainly a stylish creation, with the angular lines and accented LED lighting systems that set gaming rigs apart from boring black towers. Yet it’s not over the top in our humble opinion – you won’t mistake your gaming room for a nightclub when all of the LEDs are illuminated. The actual dimensions are 393mm by 315mm by 252mm, but that also includes the 625W PSU; there’s no need for a separate power brick. At the top of the case is a handle that makes lugging it around to LAN events a breeze. A couple of high-speed USB ports and mic-in/headphone out adorn the top of the front, while the rear has many more connection options. These consist of four USB 3.0, twin USB 2.0, VGA, HDMI, Ethernet and a single PS/2 connection. There’s also Killer Wireless AC 1535 802.11ac Wi-Fi built in, using a 2x2 antennae configuration. In addition to this are the video outputs offered by the graphics card, which consist of a single HDMI 2.0b, DVI-I and triple DisplayPort 1.3/4 ready.  Removing the side panel reveals an extremely cramped interior – there’s very little room to move if you want to do any major customisation. The motherboard appears to be a Mini-ITX board, and it’s based on Intel’s H170 chipset. As expected, the machine is available in a huge variety of configurations, and the model we reviewed came in at a price of $2,999. For this you get Intel’s 6th Gen Core i7-6700 CPU, and that’s the only option for the CPU. Given the recent release of the 7th Gen CPU we’d expect to see an updated model in the near future; currently this machine is limited to the 4GHz Turbo of this quad-cored, Hyper-threaded chip, which is more than enough for today’s games. Alongside this is 16GB of 2133MHz DDR4 memory. The main horsepower, however, is delivered via Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080, which appears to be a basic Nvidia-branded model. As we all know, this delivers oodles of performance, and makes up a good third of the price of the review unit. If that’s overkill, you can opt for a Radeon R9-370X or Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 instead, which will shave a big chunk of change off the price. Our machine game with a single 2TB mechanical hard drive for your long-term storage needs, yet there wasn’t any sign of an SSD, which is an optional extra. At this price even a small 256GB SSD should be a given, and we really noticed the performance difference when it came to desktop operation and game loading times.  Given the fact that the case sides are all basically giant grills, we were pleasantly surprised by the lack of fan noise, which came in at 44dB. However, there is a slightly high whine emitted by one of the cooling fans. Given the level of hardware within, the performance was top-notch, even delivering playable 4K performance in Shadow of Mordor.  There’s no denying that there are slightly better value systems on the market, but they’re substantially bigger and louder than the Y710. If you value a smaller gaming system that is easy to lug around, and doesn’t sound like a hair-dryer, Lenovo has delivered the goods, although the lack of an SSD is a bummer.  Related Reviews Review: Shuttle DX30 Barebones mini-PC Review: Next Thing Co CHIP computer Review: Acer Spin 7 convertible laptop Review: WD Blue SATA 1TB PC SSD breaks new ground Review: Hitman: The Complete First Season Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Of course More like this Malware Chips Security Javascript Security ASLR-security-busting JavaScript hack demo'd by university boffins Amster-damn, that's a hell of a vulnerability to make browser bug exploitation easier Gamble! ... Operating system ASLR isn't that far off this, to be honest 14 Feb 2017 at 23:15, Shaun Nichols Researchers in Europe have developed a way to exploit a common computer processor feature to bypass a crucial security defense provided by modern operating systems. By abusing the way today's CPUs manage system memory, an attacker can discover where software components, such as libraries and RAM-mapped files, are located in virtual memory. With these locations in hand, malicious code can find and use particular instructions and data within these components to start hijacking a computer system. Specifically, the researchers have shown how to defeat address space layout randomization (ASLR). This is a mechanism provided by operating systems – from Windows and Linux to macOS and the BSDs – that randomly places each application's dependencies in their virtual memory spaces. This makes it tough for attackers to run exploit code that expects widgets of code and data in specific spots in memory. Without the base addresses for these components, attackers are blindfolded and their hack attempts usually fail. If naughty code – such as JavaScript running on a malicious webpage – can discern where these libraries and other objects are positioned at runtime, a follow-up exploit on the page can use this leaked information to reliably attack browser bugs and move onto the next stage of the intrusion: usually this involves performing system calls to spawn new processes, download payloads, and gain control of the host system. Dutch researchers Ben Gras, Kaveh Razavi, Erik Bosman, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida of Vrije Universiteit (VU) in Amsterdam have come up with clever JavaScript that, while running silently on a webpage, can observe the processor's memory management unit (MMU) in operation by measuring precise timings between memory accesses, work out where key data and code is mapped in memory, and render ASLR protections ineffective. The MMU – present in desktop, mobile and server chips – is programmed by the operating system kernel to control where objects in virtual memory are held in physical memory. The time it takes for the unit to look up a physical address from a virtual memory access can be used, when performed over and over, to gradually leak the location of components. The team has been able to write a proof-of-concept demonstration of the security weakness entirely in JS, and they say the code works on multiple architectures – including Intel and AMD x86 chips, and ARM-compatible cores. "The memory management unit of modern processors uses the cache hierarchy of the processor in order to improve the performance of page table walks. This is fundamental to efficient code execution in modern processors," the team explained today. "Unfortunately, this cache hierarchy is also shared by untrusted applications, such as JavaScript code running in the browser." This, the VU team says, is what makes this vulnerability so significant. An attacker could embed the malicious JavaScript code in a webpage, and then run the assault without any user notification or interaction. Because the assault does not rely on any special access or application flaws, it works on most browsers and operating systems. The researchers say that when tested on up-to-date web browsers, the exploit could fully unravel ASLR protections on 64-bit machines in about 90 seconds. Infecting a system does not end there, of course: it just means ASLR has been defeated. The next step is to use this memory location information to launch a viable and reliable attack on bugs within the browser. Without this location information, the follow-up exploit would be fumbling in the dark. With the information, it's easier to fully exploit the browser bugs. Below is a video of the JS code working in Firefox on a 64-bit Linux machine. Youtube Video The researchers conclude that developers should not rely on ASLR as a strong security protection, and they should implement other measures to harden their browsers against exploits. Apple has already done just that, and acknowledged the VU researchers in its latest WebKit update – see the final note on that page. For normal folk, the VU team suggests the best defense for now is to block untrusted JavaScript from executing with the use of a browser plugin such as NoScript. Future editions of browsers could come with builtin measures to potentially thwart MMU timing attacks. Fully eliminating the vulnerability, however, will be difficult, and the group suggests effective protections may not be feasible until next-generation processors feature hardware mechanisms to defeat MMU side-channel snooping. The vulnerability is similar to the jump-over-ASLR technique we reported on in October. We asked the Amsterdam team if their MMU timing vulnerability, dubbed AnC, is, honestly, practical to exploit. A lot of these types of flaws can be leveraged easily in a research lab, where conditions are quiet, controlled and ideal for attackers. However, in the real world, computer systems are far more noisy, with CPU cores accessing all kinds of patterns of data, and processes being switched in and out of context as the user does their thing. That randomness tends to mess up timing-based attacks by introducing unexpectedly large latencies. "There is no doubt that this side channel attack works and is practical on everyday browsers," Gras told The Register. He continued: Most previous work on side-channel attacks assumes that the attacker is running in a different process or virtual machine but on the same machine. Further, they usually attack cryptographic operations, something that the average Internet user does not usually do. The difference with AnC is that it runs from JavaScript and targets something that every Internet user relies on for security, namely ASLR. The attack is also quite practical: it runs on any architecture that we tried and can quickly break 27 bits of entropy within a few seconds. As a reference, Microsoft Windows only provides 24 bits of entropy for its heap. The prototype implementation was implemented it on normal browsers on normal Linuxes. The video on the AnC projects page visualizing the attack in Firefox is real and not cherry-picked. Just for completeness sake however, this does not mean the prototype is ready to be deployed as an in-the-wild attack – our goal is to prove that it is possible to use this work in a realistic attack, not to actually do it. The Chrome version relies on a feature that is still being standardized and not enabled by default (Javascript Shared memory), but is on schedule to be in the future. Also, the scope of this work is that we are breaking ASLR and therefore an additional memory corruption bug is needed to complete an exploit chain. This greatly reduces the burden on the attacker however, who would normally need another bug to leak ASLR information. "We are confident that with additional engineering effort, this work can be part of a realistic attack," Gras concluded. ® Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Inspur inspires DDN to be its HPC reseller Sitting in a tree, K I S S I N G Judge orders FBI to reveal whether White House launched 'Tor pedo' torpedo exploits Alleged Playpen perverts win a concession 22 Comments NetApp rehires former exec Thurlow to run UK biz Five years in the wilds and away from storage is enough for any man White House flushes away court-ordered decryption like it was a stinky dead goldfish Forthcoming legislation looks dead in the water 24 Comments White House to bung electric car industry $4.5bn in loans Before you buy that Tesla though… 30 Comments Snitches get stitches: Little Snitch bugs were a blessing for malware DEF CON Now-patched kernel-level flaw in OS X app firewall will be revealed this week 3 Comments Whitepapers Faster Applications with Predictive Flash Interactive tool outlining the benefits of Predictive Flash to remove the app-data gap.

But such a high-profile resignation just 24 days into the new administration is unlikely to be the end of the story. After all, Flynn's conversations with the Russian government go to the heart of a controversy that has dogged Trump since the campaign: whether Trump is too close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who intelligence agencies suspect of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn resigned after he lost the president's confidence for misleading Vice President Pence about his contacts with Russia. Pence had denied that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador on Dec. 29. The Justice Department, which is responsible for counterintelligence, told the White House last month that Flynn did discuss the issue. Ever since Sen. Howard Baker asked the question in a Watergate hearing, the central question in any Washington scandal is, "What did the president know and when did he know it?" White House press secretary Sean Spicer answered those questions Tuesday. Did the president-elect ask Flynn to talk to Russia about sanctions? "Absolutely not," Spicer said. When did the Justice Department notify the White House that it knew Flynn had lied? "January 26," he said. But as with many such Washington stories, every answered question leads to new unanswered ones. Here are some: What did Flynn tell the Russian ambassador? Flynn's conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak came the same day the Obama administration announced a new round of sanctions against Russia for its computer hacking during the 2016 presidential election. It's unclear whether Flynn would have been privy to non-public information about those sanctions, or whether he made any promises about what the Trump policy would be. At the same time, the Obama administration also expelled Russian agents from the United States — a move that Russia conspicuously failed to respond to. In his CBS interview. Pence ruled out any discussion about that subject as well: “They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia." Did Flynn discuss that issue? At Tuesday's briefing, Spicer was asked if the White House would declassify and release transcripts of those calls. "It is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time." What are Flynn's connections to Russia? As a retired Army general in 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow to speak at the 10th anniversary gala for Russia Today in an event also attended by Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid for the visit, which — if not approved by the secretaries of Defense and State — would violate federal law. He has not said how much he was paid or whether it was approved. Russia Today was identified in an intelligence assessment as one of the Kremlin's top purveyors of propaganda and misinformation in the 2016 presidential election, leading to a heightened sensitivity over Flynn's participation in the event, which Flynn said was arranged by a speaker's bureau. House Democrats have called for an investigation into those connections. Was anyone else involved? "Was Gen. Flynn directed or authorized to do what he did?" asked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday. "Who else from the Trump administration, transition or campaign had contact with the Russians?" And it's not just Democrats asking those questions. "I'd like to know, did he just do this as a rogue? Gen. Flynn just decided to call the Russians up one day and say we're gonna have a different view on sanctions, don't worry about it? Or did it come from somebody else in the White House?" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News. Where was the Justice Department? At the White House briefing Tuesday, Spicer had his own questions: "I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this?" he said. "We were making statements based on what Gen. Flynn was telling us starting on Jan. 13. The vice president went out on the 15th, right? They didn't notify the White House Counsel's office until Jan. 26." At the time, the acting attorney general was Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who was fired Jan. 30 for refusing to defend a Trump executive order instituting a travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries. Why are there so many leaks? The Flynn saga was brought to a head by two stories in the Washington Post: One last week that reported that nine current and former intelligence officials had refuted Flynn's denials that he had discussed sanctions with Russia, and another on Monday about on the Justice Department concerns about Flynn's phone calls. To Trump, those are the biggest questions. "The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?" he tweeted Tuesday. But as with many such Washington stories, every answered question leads to new unanswered ones.

Mike McCurry worked for President Bill Clinton, and Ari Fleischer for President George W. Bush. They also weigh in on whether the president and the reporters who cover him should be toasting one another at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Comments have been edited for length and clarity. On White House turmoil McCurry: There is always this kind of period at the beginning of a new administration where there’s upheaval, there’s change. A new president coming in, new staff. But partly because Donald Trump elected to be thoroughly anti-establishment, all of the establishment procedures at the White House are kind of upended at the moment, so they’re going through I think an unusual amount of turmoil in this transition. Fleischer: Donald Trump was not elected to be a smooth operator. He was not elected to be an established, well-known Washington hand. If people wanted to have calm, they would have elected Hillary, a Washington insider who would have known how to make the appointments, etc. but the country wants people to have Washington change. ... Ultimately, Donald Trump is going to rise or fail on the big changes he makes — whether the economy gets strong, whether wages go up, whether jobs come back to America. McCurry: You referenced the Clinton experience, and yes, there was this kind of period of turmoil in the beginning. It took a full two years before Leon Panetta came in as chief of staff to get things kind of established as a more regular order. The problem is in the world we’re in now with everything instantaneously available, you don’t get two years to sort it all out. He’s got maybe like another two months at best I think to sort of get things on before people begin to say, what’s this presidency about at the end of the day? Fleischer: I’ll go back to your old boss. If there’s anything he proved in the late 1990s, it’s that a roaring economy solves a lot of personal foibles. On the press as 'the opposition party' McCurry: There has not been a president since George Washington that thought the press was fair and balanced. ... But this is particularly belligerent, and it comes at a time when the accountability mechanisms of how we really hold power to truth, they are fragile right now. And that is the traditional role of the fourth estate. The presidents don’t like them all the time, but they usually have recognized that there’s an indispensable role there for them to be a way in which we kind of measure and hold accountable the people who are responsible for executive action. But this president doesn’t seem to honor that tradition, and that is a troubling thing to me. Fleischer: He regularly does sit down with the top-notch, mainstream reporters — the people he decries — and he sits down with them and does the interviews. But he’ll also go around them, which of course he should. The technology of today, why wouldn’t you? Any president who doesn’t do that would be committing malpractice, from a communications standpoint. Capital Download - Conversations with Washington's biggest newsmakers The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Aide: President Trump lost trust in Michael Flynn and asked him to quit McCurry: Most presidents have at the end of the day acknowledged the vital role the press plays in protecting the interests of the American people, and that remains to be stated clearly and unambiguously by this president, and I think that is something that we should be concerned about. Fleischer: The First Amendment is so much bigger and more powerful than the temporary words of the president acknowledging the role of the press. The press doesn’t need a president to acknowledge it; the press has it. It’s called the First Amendment, and it’s inviolate. And the press just has to do its job, whether the president likes it or not. The press just has to be neutral, and fair, and accurate and call it as they see it. On Trump and Twitter McCurry: It would be in most cases for a White House reporter absolute bliss to be able to wake up at 6 in the morning and see the innermost thoughts of the president on your smartphone at that time in the morning. Fleischer: Here you have unfiltered — it’s not running through a staffing process. There’s nobody substituting their words for his. You are hearing and seeing what the president of the United States is thinking and why he’s thinking it. McCurry: For better or worse.

I just don’t see why you need government officials to go to a press dinner. McCurry: It would be disingenuous for President Trump to go given his belligerence towards ‘the dishonest media.’ I mean, why would he want to be in the company of these dishonest people who he constantly every day disrespects? Fleischer: Everybody wants the president to go because it helps sell tickets, makes for a more glamorous event. And in that sense the media is no different from any other organization in Washington that wants to have a dinner or a convention and have the biggest, best speaker they can find. The press should not be in that business of seeking governmental speakers. On 'Saturday Night Live' McCurry: Did you ever get lampooned on Saturday Night Live? Fleischer: No. Jon Stewart went after me a bunch of times. McCurry: I think on the Weekend Update part of the program, I might have gotten skewered a couple of times. Fleischer: I got my name in a crossword puzzle a few times, but that’s about the extent of my fame.

Andy Greenberg Security Date of Publication: 02.14.17. 02.14.17 Time of Publication: 7:30 pm. 7:30 pm A Chip Flaw Strips Away Hacking Protections for Millions of Devices Getty Images For the last decade or so, hackers have faced a daunting challenge when they try to break into a computer: Even when they get malicious code running on a victim’s machine, they have to figure out where in the computer’s memory that code has ended up. That’s because a security protection used in Windows, Android, and every other modern operating system randomizes where programs run in a device’s memory. It turns the process of digital intrusion into something like an attempt to burglarize a house in total darkness. But now a team of Dutch researchers has found a technique that undermines that so-called address space layout randomization, creating the You Are Here arrow that hackers need to orient themselves inside a stranger’s computer. That means any of the common memory corruption bugs found in software applications on a daily basis could lead to a much deeper takeover of a target PC or smartphone. And because the attack exploits not software but hardware, it leaves millions of devices at risk regardless of their operating system—and it can’t be fully fixed with any mere software update. Back in the ASLR “Bugs are everywhere, but ASLR is a mitigation that makes bugs hard to exploit,” says Ben Gras, a researcher at the Free University of Amsterdam who developed the attack along with his colleague Kaveh Razavi. “This technique makes bugs that weren’t exploitable exploitable again. In some sense, it takes us back to the ’90s in terms of security.” Their attack is particularly serious because attackers can pull it off with javascript alone, meaning that simply visiting a malicious website can trigger it; the research team, known as VUSec, released a demonstration video showing it running in a Firefox browser. “Nobody has done this before from the context of a web page,” says Yossi Oren, a researcher at Ben Gurion University who specializes in microarchitecture security. “It’s a very insidious and clever example of this class of attack.” It may also be as difficult to fix as it is easy to deploy. The VUSec technique exploits the deepest properties of the computer’s hardware, the microprocessors made by companies including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and Samsung. Making ASLR fully effective again, the researchers say, could require not just a quick operating system or browser update but also redesigning and replacing those chips. Cracking the Safe The attack exploits the way microprocessors and memory interact: Processors have a component called a memory management unit that maps where a computer stores programs in its memory. To keep track of those addresses, the MMU constantly checks a directory called a page table. The key to the VUSec hack is that devices usually store the page table in the processor’s cache—a small chunk of memory that keeps frequently accessed information close to its computing cores. That makes the chip speedier and more efficient. But a piece of malicious javascript code running on a website can write to that cache too. And, crucially, it can simultaneously watch how quickly the MMU is working. “By monitoring the MMU very closely, the javascript can find out about its own addresses, which it’s not supposed to do,” Gras says. The VUSec researchers’ attack turns the MMU’s speed into a revealing clue. The attacking code overwrites the cache, one unit of memory at a time, until it sees the MMU slowing down. That’s a sign that whatever part of the cache got overwritten was a chunk of the page table the MMU was looking for—the MMU slows down because it has to go back to a copy of the page table in normal random-access memory instead of in the processor’s cache. The MMU has to perform four separate page table checks to find the physical address of any given piece of code. So the attack overwrites the cache four times, ferreting out four places in the cache that have a piece of the page table. Each time, the malicious program notes the moment of the MMU’s slowdown. Just how long the MMU takes to hit that slowdown provides a hint as to the malicious code’s own address in the cache and therefore its location in RAM, when the device copies the hack from the cache to that other memory—the exact information that ASLR tries to hide from a hacker. Think of the attack as an old-fashioned safecracker, listening with a stethoscope for telltale clicks while slowly turning a safe’s dial. “The cache is like the cogs in the safe that produce those little clicks that allow you to crack it,” Gras says. A Deep Bug to Fix Gras says VUSec reached out to the Netherlands’ National Cybersecurity Center, which contacted all the affected chipmakers and software companies—including Intel, AMD, Samsung, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Mozilla—more than three months ago, but the researchers are only now going public with their findings after giving the companies a standard window to address them. The researchers aren’t releasing any code to demonstrate the attack. But they warn that skilled hackers could reverse-engineer the technique from what they’ve revealed in a matter of weeks. Meanwhile, Gras suggests some band-aids. You can enable plug-ins, like NoScript for Firefox or ScriptSafe for Chrome, to block javascript on web pages. And browser-makers could conceivably reduce the exactness of the timing measurements they allow scripts to make, preventing them from monitoring the MMU’s speed. At least one company has already worked to mitigate the dangers; Apple published a software update designed to “harden” Safari but didn’t reveal exactly what that update does. An Apple spokesperson says the company also distributed a plan of action to other affected vendors—likely the companies that build the chips it uses. A full fix will ultimately require replacing hardware, not software. Devices will need new chips with new architectures that separate the MMU and its page table from the processor’s cache. “Because it’s at such a fundamental layer, the layers of software above can make it harder to exploit, but they can’t make it go away,” Gras says. Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla, meanwhile, downplayed the issue. “We’ve determined it does not represent a security issue,” says a statement Microsoft PR emailed to WIRED. Intel writes that the research “doesn’t represent a significant change in the security of Intel Architecture–based systems.” Spokespeople from all three companies point out that the attack alone only represents a threat in combination with another memory corruption bug. Samsung, Nvidia, AMD, and Google didn’t respond to WIRED’s request for comment. It’s little comfort, however, for Microsoft and Intel to point out that defeating ASLR alone doesn’t allow someone to hack an operating system, Oren says. With ASLR broken, hackers will go back to hunting the kind of commonplace memory corruption bugs that ASLR rendered useless. Old bugs could learn new tricks. The result, if tech firms don’t take the ASLR attack seriously, could soon be a bounty of new ways to hack millions of innocent users unlucky enough to click on the wrong web page. “Attackers are always getting smarter,” Oren says. “If computers are getting dumber, attackers will have the advantage.” Go Back to Top.

Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) questions Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen during a hearing in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill September 21, 2016 in Washington, DC. Despite the lack of evidence against him, Koskinen is facing impeachment threats from conservatives in the House of Representatives for his role in the destruction of computer backups containing thousands of emails sought by Congress in its investigation of political targeting. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) 72 Follow Share Tweet Calls for investigations into former White House National Security adviser Michael Flynn erupted after it was revealed that Flynn had “inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information” in phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. However, if Republicans are hoping House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) will take up the investigation, they will be sorely disappointed. According to The Hill, Chaffetz has stated that he has no intention of having his committee look into Flynn, and instead will leave it up to the House Intelligence Committee. Chaffetz believes that Flynn stepping down has caused the situation to take care of itself, and that this investigation is more within the bounds of the Intelligence Committee anyway, seeing as how they are already looking into the Russian hacks. “It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation-state like that. It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee,” Chaffetz said. However, CNN’s Manu Raju has reported that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) will not be launching a separate investigation into Flynn, citing executive privilege as the reason. Rep. Devin Nunes says the Intelligence Committee won't look into discussions between Trump and Flynn, citing executive privilege — Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 14, 2017 Among those in the GOP who also believe investigating Flynn to be a waste of time is Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky) who said that looking into Flynn would be “excessive,” and would “make no sense.” Rate this story 90% 1% 0% 2% 7% Recommended from the Web Other Must-Read Stories 72 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill in this Sept. 21, 2016, file photo.  (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, sent a letter to the White House on Tuesday seeking explanations for "widespread reports that sensitive information may have been shared or discussed in a common area at Mar-a-Lago" by President Trump last weekend. The letter, sent to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, came in the wake of reports that Trump may have been receiving sensitive information via his cellphone about North Korea's testing of a ballistic missile while eating dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a public room at Trump's club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday night. "Accounts and photographs from other diners seem to indicate these communications occurred in the presence of other guests," Chaffetz wrote. "Reportedly, documents were provided by what appeared to be White House staff for the President's review while the dinner proceeded." "During this time, according to reports, the President made telephone calls to staff in Washington, D.C.," Chaffetz continued. "These reports and social media accounts have suggested White House staff used their own cell phones to provide illumination for reviewing documents. Separately, one Mar-a-Lago guest posted to his Facebook page a photograph with a man described to be the holder of the 'nuclear football.' " Chaffez noted that White House press secretary Sean Spicer has said no classified information was present in the Mar-a-Lago dining room and that Trump was briefed in a "Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF)" both before and after the dinner. "Nevertheless, discussions with foreign leaders regarding international missile tests, and documents used to support those discussions, are presumptively sensitive," Chaffetz wrote. "While the President is always on duty, and cannot dictate the timing of when he needs to receive sensitive information about urgent matters, we hope the White House will cooperate in providing the Committee with additional information."

"He went and with his national security team, they briefed him on a situation in North Korea," Spicer told reporters. "Subsequently he had a dinner, which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about." Spicer added that, after the dinner, the president went back to the secure location to get an update from his aides. "So I'm not really sure where people jump to conclusions," Spicer said. "There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President, by his national security team, the situation in North Korea and then the President subsequently stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware."

CST February 14, 2017 Jalisco Gov. Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz Sandoval is visiting Silicon Valley next week to woo tech companies to bring jobs to Mexico. (Photo: Jalisco government, for USA TODAY) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — The governor of Mexico's state of Jalisco is visiting more than 40 U.S. tech companies with the message that it's a great place for high tech, the latest cross-border recruitment effort to respond to U.S. immigration policy. Jalisco Gov. Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz will meet with California Gov. Jerry Brown, 13 large tech companies including Facebook and Google, and 30 startups beginning this week in California. It's an annual trip for officials from Jalisco, birthplace of tequila, synonymous with hot sauce, and sometimes called Mexico's Silicon Valley for its already thriving tech scene. This year, the trip has an added purpose: to talk to Brown about a bi-lateral agenda to support Mexican citizens to remain in the U.S. And, Sandoval will promote capital city Guadalajara and the rest of Jalisco as a friendly environment for skilled workers that may have trouble getting hired by U.S. tech firms if the Trump administration passes more restrictions on H-1B visas, as a draft order indicated. "We want tech companies to know there is a huge opportunity in Jalisco for them to grow," Sandoval, who has created a cabinet-level Innovation Department, told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday. "Jalisco has many advantages" — a close time zone to Silicon Valley, talent, strong university system, government support and infrastructure, Sandoval said. The Trump administration's policies, in particular the possibility of an executive order that could curtail H-1B work visas, also work in Jalisco's favor, he said. The pitch is hardly a slam-dunk. Some tech companies remain reluctant to expand in Mexico, with a threatened 35% tariff from Trump on goods made there looming as large as his much-heralded wall. (Trump floated the idea of a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said it was one of several proposals.) There are also lingering questions about Jalisco's overall tech talent, poor broadband access in some areas and costs related to opening operations offshore. Nonetheless, Sandoval's push to raise awareness about Jalisco comes at a time when the U.S.'s northern neighbor, Canada, is also attempting to recruit tech workers as the U.S. halts entries of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations and threatens to further limit H-1Bs, which offer a pipeline of talent from abroad. Canadian venture firms and companies are enticing U.S. start-ups with funding, sparkling new work spaces, broadband access and a relatively affordable cost of living. Jalisco's pitch is similar. The state  on the western coast of central Mexico has blossomed into a thriving tech hub worth $21 billion. Guadalajara or coastal Puerto Vallarta are home to manufacturing, design and research-and-development operations for Intel, Hewlett Packard and Oracle, among others. Oracle and Intel house innovation centers in Guadalajara, and a 940-acre media-business center is under construction. Technology goods represent about 55% of Jalisco's exports, and account for 25,000 jobs in the state. Nearly a third of Mexico's tech business comes from Jalisco, according to a spokesman for Sandoval. "The Jalisco government is 100% focused on technology," says Bismarck Lepe, CEO of San Francisco-based tech services firm Wizeline. "It's an ideal region for intellectual property, and not cheap manufacturing." Lepe has deep ties to Mexico. His parents are from there, but left for the U.S. for a better economic opportunity. Lepe, who studied at Stanford University and worked at Google, decided to return in 2010 after a third-party analysis determined Guadalajara was fertile ground for tech talent. Half of Wizeline's 270 employees are in Guadalajara, most of them engineers. The close proximity of Mexico and Canada could offer concerned American companies — and workers — an option should Trump issue executive orders on a revised travel ban, curtail H-1Bs and revise the NAFTA trade accord. Job seekers are likely to choose Canada as a backup. It was the most popular second destination, at 43%, followed by Australia (12%) and the United Kingdom (5%), based on 1,200 people tracked last week by Indeed, a job-search engine. Mexico was No. 12 on the list. 'Not an ideal solution' Mexico is at a disadvantage when it comes to talent, say tech executives. Its engineering pool isn't as bountiful in Mexico as it is in India and China, and salaries for Mexican engineers are significantly higher because competition for them is so fierce, says Stephen Stokols, CEO of FreedomPop, a wireless Internet and mobile virtual network operator. "Mexico is a primary market for us, but it's not an ideal solution," Stokols says. His Los Angeles-based company has 20 people — about 10% of its worldwide workforce — in Mexico City, mostly engineers. "We would have more people there, if the engineering talent were available." It can also be expensive to open operations south of the border and establish a payment system, says Jesus Hoyos, managing director at Solvis Consulting, which resells tech products in Mexico. Still, Mexico might offer as compelling a case for job seekers turned away by the U.S. It is a huge trade partner with the U.S. — trade between the two companies totaled $583.6 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative — and the home to  more than 1million Americans, the largest community for expatriates. (Nearly 40,000 American and Canadian expats are among Jalisco's population of seven million.)

But the questions they raise are critically important,” says the Australian, one of a number of global experts at a world leading forum on what is possible with vastly underutilised computing processing power now available. “Not many look at critical questions such as ‘What happens when self-driving vehicles cause unemployment, when medical expert systems work on behalf of insurance agencies rather than patients, and weapon platforms make their own lethal decisions,” he says. Conference Director Nicolas Erdody says MW17 is much more than a talk-fest. Erdody says that 90% of all the data in the world has been generated in the past two years; a pattern that will keep repeating. “How on earth will we process these massive amounts of data, and actually make meaningful sense and use of it,” he asks? Among some of the industry, academic and research experts is Prof Michelle Simmons. She is an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow and Director at the Centre for Quantum Computation & Communication Technology, UNSW. She will describe “the emerging field of quantum information, a response to the fact that device miniaturization will soon reach the atomic limit, set by the discreteness of matter, leading to intensified research in alternative approaches for creating logic devices of the future”. Prof Satoshi Matsuoka (Japan) will present his keynote “Flops to Bytes: Accelerating Beyond Moore’s Law” and Dr John Gustafson (former Director of Intel Labs, now Visiting Professor at the National University of Singapore) will reveal a new data type called “posit”, that provide a better solution for “approximate computing”. In this context, New Zealander Prof Michael Kelly, Prince Philip Professor of Technology from the University of Cambridge (UK) will ask in his keynote “How Might the Manufacturability of the Hardware at Device Level Impact on Exascale Computing?” Dr Nathan DeBardeleben from Los Alamos National Labs (US) will discuss how “supercomputer resilience and fault-tolerance are increasingly challenging areas of extreme-scale computer research as agencies and companies strive to solve the most critical problems.” In his talk he will “discuss how data analytics and machine learning techniques are being applied to influence the design, procurement, and operation of some of the world’s largest supercomputers” “The assemblage of big brains around multicore computing and parallel programming will pose questions and answers as the world moves towards exascale computing in the next decade. Being part of such discussions can position New Zealand technologists, entrepreneurs and scientists at the intersection of two massive global markets that will benefit this country’s future growth: Decision-Making (estimated in $2 Trillion) and Food and Agriculture (estimated in $5 Trillion)”, says Nicolas Erdody, Open Parallel CEO and MW17 Conference Organiser The 6th annual Multicore World, to be held at Shed 6 will discuss these and other Big Questions. MW17 will be three days of intensive talks, panels and discussion in a ‘think-tank’ format that allows plenty of time for one on one meetings.

Samsung 960 Pro NVMe SSD review: Ludicrously fast PC storage This 2TB rocket of an M.2 NVMe drive is the fastest storage available for your PC. Jon L. Jacobi (PC World (US online)) on 17 December, 2016 02:00 0 - - - - print email When I was testing Samsung’s new 960 Pro M.2/NVMe SSD, a coworker looking over my shoulder at the results declared, “That’s sick!” High praise in today’s parlance, and a direct response to this drive’s incredible speed. It’s a phrase I continued to voice silently as I saw read and write numbers of 2.7GBps and 1.7GBps, respectively, pop up. And that was from the super-conservative AS SSD benchmark with non-compressible data; CrystalDiskMark 5 boasted reads and writes of 3.5GBps and 2.17GBps, respectively, with a 2GB data set. Whoa. Price and capacity At the time of this writing, the 960 Pro is priced around 63 to 72 cents per gigabyte on Amazon: $372 for the 512GB version, $630 for the 1TB model, and $1,299 for the 2TB version. That’s right, there’s a 2TB model thanks to the Samsung 3D/stacked-layer NAND employed on the drives. If you’ve been holding off on M.2/NVMe because of the relatively low capacity (1TB isn’t enough?) then the 960 Pro should eliminate that argument, if not the cost issue. The warranty for the 960 Pro is basically five years, or 400TBW (terabytes written) for the 512GB drive, 800TBW for the 1TB model, and 1,200TBW for the 2TB version. Yes, less of a warranty for your $1,300. Go figure. Our best guess is that getting to 2TB required using less over-provisioning, i.e. NAND set aside to replace failed cells. Regardless, all three ratings are far more than most users will hit over the warranty period, and probably a lot longer. Samsung Samsung’s scintillatingly fast 960 Pro M.2, PCIe/NVMe SSD. Testing, retesting... The write numbers I quoted above are absolutely real, but it took a bit of effort plus a retest to get them. My first test with AS SSD, which uses the FUA (Force Unit Access) command to bypass all caching (for Windows and the drive), saw only 170MBps writing. Not unexpected. What was unexpected was 170MBps in our real-world write tests, which don’t force access. It was puzzling, but I’m guessing that by running these tests immediately following AS SSD, the early 960 firmware was still obeying the FUA command. Other oddities ensued, and then the drive itself died (this happens from time to time with review hardware). The replacement drive I received performed more as advertised. Even in AS SSD, where it really shouldn’t have, given bypassed caching. I’m still investigating, but Samsung hasn’t chimed in at the time of this writing. The upshot is, you should get the numbers I quote as long as you don’t turn off write caching for the drive (Device Manager>Disk Drives>Drive Properties>Policies). The 960 Pro ships with 1MB of DRAM cache for every 1GB of NAND. If the 960 Pro is like other SSDs, a relatively small percentage of that is used for write or read caching, with the majority used for data allocation tables (copied from the NAND). But with the speeds I saw, I’m guessing DRAM caching might play a bigger part than with, say, a SATA SSD. Whatever Samsung is doing, it works. The 1TB 960 Pro we tested is a beast in the very best sense of the word. Peep the purple bars below. Impressive. When it comes to benchmarks, the 960 Pro blows away the competition. And the benchmarks generally are indicative of the impact on everyday Windows performance. On the other hand, the real-world copy tests shown below displayed some mild improvement in sustained throughput, but also revealed the practical limits of what a “faster” NVMe SSD can do for you. While the benchmarks above show drastic improvement, real-world copy performance and hands-on, subjective Windows performance don’t mirror them. That’s of course comparing the 960 Pro to other NVMe SSDs, the slowest of which eliminates most storage lag. Compared to SATA hard drives or SSDs? We’re talking light years better. For sustained throughput, the 960 Pro shows significant improvement over the 950 Pro and is quite a bit better than Intel’s 750. But the smaller file and folder write numbers (at the top) are actually a bit worse than the previous generation. As you can also see, the Intel 750, which is a PCIe card SSD and not suitable for laptops, is very fast with the 20GB folder of smaller files. Intel has previously informed us that the company’s SSDs are tuned specifically for servers with their high volume of I/O requests for smaller bits of data, and closely interact with the company’s Rapid Storage Technology (RST) to some benefit. That’s my guess about the drive’s dominance in that test. The 960 Pro turned in great numbers. What do they mean? So much of what makes Windows and applications seem slow is storage-related, so switching to any NVMe can make a system seem sensationally faster. As for the 960 Pro in particular, it’s easily the best consumer NVMe SSD for those who deal regularly with large files. The only caveat is that your system must support booting from NVMe to make the best use of it (i.e. make the operating system faster). Many PCs do not. Note: The 512MB version of the 960 Pro is a bit slower due to fewer chips and channels to distribute the data over. Conclusion and buying advice If your laptop or desktop supports the 960 Pro, then it’s the consumer-grade NVMe SSD you want. Assuming the price is competitive, that is. If you find others at substantial savings, you’ll be nearly as impressed. Copying 20GB in 11 seconds as opposed to 12 isn’t an earthshaking difference, and the 960 Pro is merely average for an NVMe drive when it comes to smaller data requests. Where the 960 Pro is truly unique is in offering 2TB of storage on a single 2,280mm stick—a huge plus for deep-pocket users dealing with lots of data. But for PCs, or laptops with two drive bays, it’s nearly as effective to get a smaller NVMe SSD for your OS, and use a larger SATA SSD or hard drive for auxiliary storage. I run my work system that way and rarely notice the difference. That said, if someone dropped a 2TB 960 Pro in my lap, I’d gladly alter my setup to accommodate it.

Senate Democrats held an emergency caucus meeting on the issue Wednesday. The Hill's Alexander Bolton has the dispatch: Following an emergency Democratic caucus meeting Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerPerez interrupted by progressive protesters Overnight Cybersecurity: Trump defends Flynn, blasts leaks | Yahoo fears further breach Overnight Finance: Trump's Labor pick withdraws | Ryan tries to save tax plan | Trump pushes tax reform with retailers MORE (N.Y.) warned that Trump officials might try to cover up improper contacts with Russian intelligence. Schumer said there is legitimate concern that President Trump's circle of advisers may try to destroy evidence that could shed light on the substance of reported conversations with Russian agents. ADVERTISEMENT "There is real concern that administration, transition and campaign officials may try to cover up ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts and other records that could shine a light on those connections," Schumer said at a press conference outside the Senate chamber following the meeting. Read the rest here. AND IN THE HOUSE: Meanwhile, House Democrats say they've lost faith in House Republican leaders to investigate Flynn's ties to Russia. From The Hill's Mike Lillis: The Democrats are pointing in particular at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who said he won't investigate Flynn's discussion with a Russian diplomat, citing executive privilege, but wants to probe the leaks that led to Flynn's ouster. "Our colleague from California has said he doesn't plan on doing an investigation, so I think to turn to the chairman who has already said he doesn't want to do it is crazy," Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday. Read more here. House Democrats also unveiled a bill Wednesday that would require congressional auto lift sanctions on Russia. The bill had a couple Republican co-sponsors, too. Again, from The Hill's Lillis: The legislation is designed "to ensure that Russia receives no sanctions relief until it earns it," in the words of Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), a sponsor of the bill. "Clearly, there has been some confusion as to exactly the status of sanctions that exist," Hoyer said. Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffPresident rekindles feud with intelligence agencies Intel Dem: House GOP now open to investigating Flynn Overnight Defense: Dems raise pressure for Flynn probe | Trump blames leaks for ouster | Mattis pushes NATO on spending MORE (Calif.), senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the recent resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn over discussions he had with the Russian ambassador have only heightened the need for Congress to empower itself to monitor the administration's sanctions approach. Read more here. TRUMP BLAMES MEDIA AND LEAKS: Meanwhile, Trump came to Flynn's defense, saying he was treated badly by "fake media." The Hill's Jordan Fabian and Lisa Hagen have the story: "I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media -- as I call it, the fake media, in many cases," Trump said at a press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "I think it's really a sad thing he was treated so badly." Trump's first in-person reaction to Flynn's exit appeared to contradict the account of his top spokesman, who said Tuesday that the president demanded the aide's resignation because of an "eroding level of trust" over his conversations with Russia. Trump called Flynn a "wonderful man" and doubled down on his condemnation of the leaks from the intelligence community that exposed Flynn misled senior officials in the White House about his conversations with Russia's ambassador. Those conversations took place the day that then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election. Read the rest here. MATTIS PUTS NATO ON NOTICE: As the Russia controversy raged stateside, Defense Secretary James Mattis was at his first meeting at NATO as Pentagon chief, where he gave the alliance a stern warning: Pay more or the U.S. will "moderate its commitment." "I owe it to you all to give you clarity on the political reality in the United States, and to state the fair demand from my country's people in concrete terms," Mattis said during the closed-door meeting, according to reporters in Brussels who were given the prepared remarks. "America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to the alliance, each of your capitals needs to show its support for our common defense." Mattis's comments come shortly after he called the alliance a "fundamental bedrock" for the U.S. in public remarks before the meeting. Read more here.

They have been married since 1947, and they have a lot of great stories to tell. (Published Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017) Love is standing the test of time for a Massachusetts couple celebrating their 70th marriage anniversary on Wednesday.

It’s a criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on,” Trump said during a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  “People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonChaffetz asks DOJ inspector general to investigate Flynn leaks Report: Intelligence officials withhold information from Trump Clinton receives standing ovation from Broadway audience MORE,” he continued. Trump’s comments followed a string of tweets Wednesday morning, in which he sought to shift attention from the contents of Flynn’s conversations with Russia’s U.S. envoy toward the leaking of classified information. “The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy. Very un-American!” he tweeted.   Trump’s decision to pin the blame for Flynn’s fall on spy agencies raises the stakes on his long-running dispute with the intelligence community.   And it comes as those same agencies probe links between Russia and several former Trump campaign officials and advisers, adding to the tumult surrounding the White House during the president’s first month in power.  Reports from The New York Times and CNN have asserted that intercepted phone calls and phone records showed that several Trump allies, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were frequently in contact with Russian intelligence operatives. There is no evidence that those officials collaborated with Russia on its hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign officials. Manafort has denied knowingly communicating with Russian intelligence. Trump has not commented personally on the reports. He ignored shouted questions about them after his news conference with Netanyahu. Hours later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer sought to tamp down the significance of the reports, noting the investigation was first revealed months ago. “I have yet to hear anything new in that story, or whatever you want to call it, that came out last night that wasn’t reported last summer,” he told reporters.  Trump lambasted the “fake media” for separate reports based on leaks regarding Flynn’s talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But when asked what was fake about those reports, Spicer said, “I’ll get back to you on that.” Flynn’s sudden exit just 24 days into Trump’s presidency has added new urgency to a separate Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russia’s election interference.  Sen. Marco RubioMarco RubioPresident rekindles feud with intelligence agencies Trump calls for Venezuela to release political prisoner 'immediately' GOP senators unveil bill to give Congress control of consumer bureau budget MORE (R-Fla.), who is dining with Trump at the White House Wednesday night, told reporters he wants Flynn to testify before the panel about the probe.  Top lawmakers have said Trump’s focus on intelligence leaks is only adding to the confusion surrounding his team’s Russia ties.  “Somehow, the media is responsible for treating Flynn unfairly, but the president was the one who fired him,” Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffPresident rekindles feud with intelligence agencies Intel Dem: House GOP now open to investigating Flynn Overnight Defense: Dems raise pressure for Flynn probe | Trump blames leaks for ouster | Mattis pushes NATO on spending MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on MSNBC.  “He was OK with Flynn being dishonest,” he continued. “He wasn’t even going to correct the record for the public until this was leaked to The Washington Post. And I suppose what bothers him is being forced to act.” Trump’s reaction to Flynn’s exit also appeared to contradict the account of his top spokesman, who said Tuesday that the president demanded the aide’s resignation because of an “eroding level of trust” over his conversations with Russia. But Spicer said there was no difference between his comments and Trump’s.  “I don’t think there’s any contradiction there,” he said. “There’s a clear difference between [Flynn’s] commitment to caring about this country and the trust the president had [in him] to do the job.”  Trump’s decision to up his feud with the intelligence community isn’t exactly surprising. Before his inauguration, Trump repeatedly attacked spy agencies for their leaks about Russian meddling in the presidential election.  “Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public,” Trump tweeted last month. “One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?” Those attacks prompted concerns of a major rift that could hamper his ability to carry out military campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and other crises overseas.  Trump tried to reset the relationship one day after he was sworn in, when he traveled to the CIA and told staff, “I am with you 1,000 percent.” But instead of reckoning with his past statements, he blamed the media for spreading the notion of his split with the intelligence community. “I have a running war with the media,” he said. “They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you’re the No. 1 stop is exactly the opposite.” Tags Hillary Clinton, Adam Schiff, Marco Rubio   View the discussion thread.
