European automakers today joined forces with Qualcomm, Intel, and several mobile phone manufacturers in a bid to define how 5G cellular networks will talk to cars. The companies created the 5G Automotive Association, whose members include Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, and Qualcomm. Noticeably absent are Apple and Google, which have been working on their own versions of autonomous vehicles and in-car communications, like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The 5G association will look primarily outside the vehicle, to "address society's connected mobility and road safety needs with applications such as connected automated driving, ubiquitous access to services and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation" as Intel put it in a press release. Faster and more robust networks are the foundation of all those efforts, and the association's members have already been clamoring to define standards for 5G networks, on their own and via other partnerships. But today's announcement appears to offer a roadmap for technological details. //Related Articles What Is 5G? The association will work on defining standards for what's referred to in the connected auto industry as "vehicle-to-everything" communication. It will also address how cars and phones will work together. "The creation of this association demonstrates the clear need for a cross-sector-collaboration between mobile industry and car industry for joint innovation, and to establish a platform to align on timeline and priorities and solution road maps," Huawei research director Li Yingtao said in a statement. The association is also unique because it includes Intel and Qualcomm, which until now have mostly been arch rivals in the race to develop 5G standards. Qualcomm, whose modems and other components are already in a vast number of connected devices, is working with manufacturers and telecom operators on testing 5G. At its developers conference in August, Intel said it would begin the bulk of its 5G trials in 2018.

Nasdaq recently released the latest short interest data for the August 15 settlement date, and several prominent semiconductor stocks saw significant gains in bearish bets. The largest semiconductor company in the world, Intel Corp. (INTC), saw its short interest rise increase to 75.47 million shares, up from a prior level of 66.39 million. That 13.67% rise in short interest was the highest gain among all semiconductor names in the latest period. Intel represents nearly 16% of the total holdings within SMH, so an INTC pullback would have a large effect on the ETF. SMH – Top Holdings Symbol Company % of Total INTC Intel Corp 15.79% TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 15.04% QCOM QUALCOMM Inc 8.7% AVGO Avago Technologies Ltd 5.55% TXN Texas Instruments Inc 4.93% NVDA NVIDIA Corp 4.66% ASML ASML Holding NV 4.56% AMAT Applied Materials Inc 4.43% NXPI NXP Semiconductors NV 4.33% MU Micron Technology Inc 4.02% QUALCOMM, Inc. (QCOM), which is SMH’s third largest holding at 8.7%, also saw its short interest grow to 21.43 million shares in the latest period, up from 20.92 million. Other semiconductor names to see short interest grow recently were Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) (14.62 million shares vs. 12.86 million) and Micron Technology (MU) (77.14 million shares vs. 74.12 million). It remains to be seen if the elevated short interest in these names will put downside pressure on their share prices, but investors in these individual stocks — as well as ETFs that have large exposure to them — might find it useful to monitor the situation. So far today, the higher short interest in semi stocks isn’t affecting SMH. Those shares rose $0.63 (+0.95%) to $67.00 in Tuesday morning trading. The largest semiconductor-focused ETF currently has about $567 million in assets under management, and is the fourth best performing fund in the Technology Equities category this year.

Intel Core i5 vs. Core i7: Which processor should you buy? By Joel Hruska on September 27, 2016 at 11:26 am Comment Whether you’re building your next PC or shopping for a new computer online, one of the questions that comes up from time to time is whether the Intel Core i5 or Core i7 is a better bargain. The short answer, “It depends,” isn’t all that helpful, so we’ve broken the data out in more detail and for both mobile and desktop processors. Here’s what you need to know. Desktop Core i5 vs. Desktop Core i7 Intel’s Skylake (6th generation) differentiation and feature sets haven’t really changed much since Haswell (4th generation). The Core i7 features quad-cores with Hyper-Threading enabled and Intel’s HD Graphics 530 solution. The Core i5 family offers quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, and either HD Graphics 530 or 510 GPUs. Most people, including gamers, should be fine with a Core i5 desktop CPU. Core i7 chips tend to help more with engineering, video editing, audio post-production, and other tasks that require as many processor threads as possible. For graphics, the HD Graphics 510 has 12 execution units (EUs), while the 530 has 24. Avoid the 510 in any case where you intend to do anything substantial with the GPU. But the long-standing rule of thumb remains true: No Intel chip is particularly strong in the graphics department, apart from the EDRAM-equipped Iris Pro variants (none of which exist in socketed consumer hardware). Enthusiast gamers should always opt for a discrete GPU. One significant difference between the desktop and mobile markets (the latter of which we’ll get to below) is how Intel positions Hyper-Threading. Almost all of  Intel’s desktop Core i5 chips across the last six desktop product generations are all quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, while its Core i7 family consists of quad-cores with Hyper-Threading. (Intel’s Core i5-4570T is the single exception to this — it’s a dual-core + Hyper-Threading chip.) Older Core i5 / Core i7 chips top out at 32GB of RAM, but Skylake raises this to 64GB for both types of processor. What about desktop PC performance? To compare performance between the Core i5 and Core i7 families, I turned to Anandtech’s excellent CPU Bench database. While AT doesn’t have records on every chip released by Intel or AMD, they’ve got a solid selection of comparable parts. I opted to check the Core i5-4690K versus the Core i7-4770K. The 4770K has Hyper-Threading, a base frequency of 3.5GHz, can Turbo up to 3.9GHz, and has 8MB of L3 cache. The Core i5-4690K has the same clock speed, but no Hyper-Threading and just 6MB of L3 cache. That’s about as perfect a match-up as you can ask for. The graph below was generated by comparing Core i5 and Core i7 in each and every benchmark and taking the geometric mean of the results. This diminishes the impact of outliers, though in this case, the arithmetic and geometric means are quite close to each other. I’ve split the data into three sections — general compute, gaming performance with 1x GTX 770, and gaming performance with the GTX 770 in SLI. Aggregate performance between the Core i5-4690K and Core i7-4770K. Data from Anandtech CPU bench There are some differences in the data sets that we need to discuss. The aggregate General Purpose ratio doesn’t reflect the impact Hyper-Threading can have on various applications. There are a number of applications where Hyper-Threading makes no difference, a handful where it decreases performance (though never by more than 8 percent) and a several benchmarks that show gains of 10-30%. If we set a 3% threshold for a tying score, Hyper-Threading gives the Core i7 a win in 21 out of 36 tests. It ties the Core i5 in 14 tests, and loses to it outright in just a single benchmark (x264). In workstation and consumer CPU workloads, Hyper-Threading sometimes helps a lot, sometimes doesn’t help much, but almost never hurts. Gaming, however, is a different animal. In gaming, Hyper-Threading never offers a single performance boost, while it impacted BioShock Infinite’s minimum FPS by 11% (meaning the Core i5 outscored the i7). The net effect is a 2% performance decrease for Hyper-Threading. In SLI gaming, we see a similar pattern, though this time it’s different games that take performance hits. The minimum frame rate for Sleeping Dogs was 10% faster on the Core i5 (56 vs. 61.8) and 5% faster in BF4 (86.4 vs. 82.9). What this means, in aggregate, is that while Hyper-Threading probably doesn’t hurt gaming in most titles, you can’t depend on it to offer a significant performance boost, either. While the above comparison uses older data from Haswell, there’s nothing about Skylake or Broadwell that changed the Core i5 / i7 comparison point. You can assume that the same metrics hold true for these chips as well — namely, that the Core i5 offers an equivalent level of performance. What about AMD? AMD isn’t a formal part of this article, but since I know people will ask, I took a look at how the FX-9590 compares against the Core i5-4690K. The news is not particularly good. There are a few well-threaded benchmarks where AMD can shine, including WinRAR, x265 encoding, multi-threaded Cinebench (both 11.5 and R15) and 7zip. The FX-9590 is utterly incapable of matching the 4690K’s single-threaded performance, which means AMD loses every test that can’t scale to eight cores or is single-threaded to start with. The gap between AMD and Intel in game benchmarks is much smaller than in general CPU performance. AMD’s FX-8350 and FX-9590 are capable of pushing perfectly acceptable frame rates. But the FX-9590 never outclasses the Core i5-4690K in any test. If you’re building a gaming box and you want to go AMD, you absolutely can — but pound for pound and watt for watt, the Core i5 wins this competition. Mobile Core i5 vs. Mobile Core i7  (Skylake, Kaby Lake) Mobile users now have three distinct choices to make, which clouds the issue a bit. There are previous-generation Core M chips as well as new Core i7 and i5 processors. The Core M chips are now limited to the m3 family — Intel has taken what used to be a distinct brand and folded it into the Core i7 and Core i5 families instead. This creates situations like the one shown below. These two chips look similar, with the same cache, almost the same clock speed, and similar GPUs — but they have different operating TDPs and hence offer different user experiences. Exactly how different isn’t something we can speak to without test hardware, but past systems showed marked variation depending on OEM design and thermal limits. To date, Core M hasn’t done particularly well — OEMs often saddled the processors with aggressive high-resolution displays and extremely thin chassis, leading to mediocre battery life. The Core i5 is in a similar situation: If you’re looking at the Core M-branded Core i5, we strongly recommend doing your homework and checking reviews of specific systems. Core M systems can deliver better battery life than their i5/i7 counterparts, but this will depend on the specifics of the manufacturer. Remember, high-resolution screens and ultra-thin systems with limited battery life will cost you just as much in power savings as you can get with a lower-TDP CPU — possibly more these days, since high-end chips account for a decreasing amount of power consumption. The other major difference we want to discuss is the newfound gap between Core i7 and i5 core counts on mobile. Prior to Skylake (6th gen), almost all Intel chips on mobile were dual-core below the Core i7 level. Now, there’s a group of Core i5 mobile parts that offer quad cores without Hyper-Threading support, as shown below: The difference between these three cores is that one of them supports Intel’s Iris Pro Graphics, while the other two are Intel HD Graphics-only. The Iris Pro 580 is Intel’s only EDRAM-equipped 128MB  Core i5. If you want a mobile processor with top-end graphics and a quad-core CPU, this is the Core i5 you want to purchase. Outside of these three cores, the general rule does still follow. Most mobile Core i5 and all Core i3 processors are dual-core with Hyper-Threading. Here are the features that separate mobile Core i5 and Core i7 processors: More cores: Many of Intel’s Core i7 processors are quad-core chips with Hyper-Threading enabled. This isn’t universal, however, and the company does offer a few dual-core + Hyper-Threading SKUs. Higher clocks: Intel’s dual-core mobile Core i7 chips typically have higher clock speeds than their Core i5 counterparts, even at the same TDP. More cache: Core i7 chips carry either 6MB or 4MB of cache. Core i5 chips run the gamut here. Older chips (pre-Broadwell) often carry 3MB, while Skylake and Kaby Lake chips are sometimes 4-6MB. The extra cache has only a small impact on performance. More addressable memory: Many older mobile Core i7 and i5 processors are limited to 16GB of memory, but there are Skylake (6th-gen) chips that support 32GB and even 64GB on some late Core i5 / i7 models. 16GB of RAM is fine for the vast majority of users. But if you think you might need more, check what your CPU is capable of at Intel’s database. How much performance you get out of a mobile Core i5 versus a Core i7 will depend a great deal on your laptop’s cooling solution and whether the chip can handle its own heat output. We’ve previously discussed how Intel gave OEMs more freedom to define their own TDP targets and skin temperatures. But this creates scenarios in which buying a faster Core M can actually result in worse performance, as the chip hits its thermal trip point and down-throttles to keep cool. Intel’s highest-end Iris Pro graphics are available in both Core i5 and Core i7 mobile SKUs We can’t point to specific instances where this has tilted performance between Core i5 and Core i7 chips, but it’s likely to create at least a little “slosh” between the two core families. Generally speaking, if you truly want to emphasize low power, pick the CPU that has lower base and turbo clocks. Intel historically defined TDP as “The CPU’s average power consumption when running typical workloads over a period of time.” A chip with more headroom is a chip that’ll hit its throttle point faster. Which chip should you buy? Right now at Newegg, Core i5 chips are running as low as $185 for the Haswell-based Core i5-4430, while the cheapest Skylake is $189 for the Core i5-6400. The Haswell is the better buy, with a 3GHz base clock, but the platform is older and you won’t be able to upgrade to a faster chip at a later date — assuming anyone still bothers. It’s a little surprising to see how much Haswell hardware is still in-channel. It’s been a year since Skylake launched and Intel normally turns its stock over fairly quickly. The cheapest Core i7 chip, in contrast, is $295 at Newegg for the Core i7-4770S, and there’s not much to recommend the Core i7 over the Core i5 family if you want to play games or do basic desktop work. The Core i7 can be faster, but many consumer applications top out around four threads. Many have hoped that AMD’s Zen will reinvigorate this market, but until that chip formally launches we’re stuck with the product roadmap Intel offers, and the Core i5 is the better deal for most people. Over a year ago, I wrote that DirectX 12 could offer the Core i7 a chance to prove itself, but we have yet to see that happen in the titles that have shipped to date. DirectX 11 and DX9 will remain important APIs for years to come, which means we have to wait and see which titles offer DX12 support and how it changes the Core i5-versus-Core i7 comparison. It’s harder to make this call on mobile. Poor cooling will cripple any laptop, and some of the boutique laptops on the market are sold with CPUs that they can’t possibly keep cool. I tend to favor the Core i5 over the Core i7 for mobile gaming because it helps preserve battery life and still offers good overall performance. CPU choice is just one element of a laptop — just be aware that higher-end CPUs may not deliver much of their expected performance if the chassis isn’t well designed for the chip it’s carrying. If you’re considering a laptop with a Kaby Lake or Skylake chip, as opposed to something older, I’d tend to go for the platform with the newest components and lower-resolution display if you want to maximize battery life, and the strongest GPU if you want to maximize gaming performance. The gap between Haswell and Skylake is irrelevant as far as gaming is concerned, while the difference between a GTX 970M and 960M is much larger.

Jeffrey Sickels I3’s do deliver. I’m still using a Sandy Bridge i3 2120 (3.3ghz) even for modern gaming. It’s been flying since early 2012. Kawaii Kurumi I agree i also have the i3 – 2100 but it does face some trouble when playing some games such as Far Cry 4 and all that and the PCI.E. is limited to generation 2 VirtualMark i7 if you can afford it. /article. close Even if you afford it it’s a waste of money if you don’t *need* it. You’re paying for something that you’re not using. Yes, you could argue that maybe you’ll need it in the future when it will spare you another upgrade and you may be right. But there are people using their computers in fixed scenarios and their performance needs won’t change until the next major OS upgrade which will come in the form of a new PC with new OEM license. Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it? Or would you stick to an i3-i5 because it’s already more than they’ll ever need? Crunchy005 Yep. For basic computer usage I would not buy anything over an i5 and I feel i3s are fine for that stuff, assuming a decent clock speed. Or even an AMD APU for that matter. The Hyperthreading is always nice but most gamers won’t use it that’s true, but lets be real here, gamers want the big core for benchmark numbers. I game and have the 4790k but I also have a minecraft server running in the background while I game and stuff so the extra threads are not a bad thing. Also the HT is really nice when i encode videos as well. Sunset Rider For basic computer usage you don’t even need anything above a Celeron, that’s what they’re for, basic computer usage. Buying an i5 would be overkill for basic usage, and it’s a waste of money because you don’t *need* it. MetusBatmanV3 You don’t need a large house, right? You don’t use every room in your house every moment of the day, right? You’re just wasting money because you don’t need the extra room, right? Why not build a house so the space is used all the time? Exactly, it makes zero sense because sometimes you need to do activities inside your house that requires more room than normal. Living in a tiny house isn’t the same as living in a house bigger than needed, right? That is why I buy a processor that can handle anything I’ll ever use it for, because I want to know that when the time comes I can complete the task in the least amount of time possible. Time is money, right? Lonnie Veal On point! But a lot of people, even techies, have unconsciously been co-opted by the Marketing Depts. i3 is slower than i5 is slower than i7 which is the best…because it costs the mostest? I regularly have arguments with staffers who insist they need an i7…even though all they are doing is regular office work…(I smile and tell them that if I Blocked all the Shopping websites, their i3 machine would operate even FASTER, BTW ;-) Paul Franklin Well said. Lonnie. I wish the Hardware industry had to abide by the same rules the canned food industry does… that is provide the price in terms of price/unit of speed. Not that I cant do the math. Usually the 80 20 rule applies, so buying the second tier product will provide the biggest ROI. MetusBatmanV3 Do you need a large house? No? So why are you complaining? Why not build a single room to live in? You can hush now. VirtualMark “Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it?” I’d tell them to buy the best CPU they can afford, it’s a fairly simple approach. The more powerful the system, the better the future proofing. Newer software tends to run slower on older systems, so I always like to get the best CPU for my budget. spoffle Afford and need aren’t the same thing. A lot of people could “afford” to go down the x99 route, but wouldn’t ever derive any benefit from doing so because they don’t push their hardware enough to make it a sensible choice. VirtualMark Nobody needs a computer for survival, all we need is oxygen, water and food. So what’s your point exactly? spoffle You know full well what my point is, don’t play dumb. Sunset Rider No he makes a good point, you don’t *need* anything faster than an 8 year old Core 2 Duo for basic web-browsing and Office. Actually you could get away with something even less powerful. spoffle This is exactly the point I’m making. VirtualMark You don’t have a point as far as I’m concerned. I could use DOS on an 80s computer if I wanted, but I work for a living and can afford a much more powerful machine. So I like to get the best CPU as I like to be able to run present and future software as smoothly as possible. spoffle You aren’t concerned at all, relative to my point, because you aren’t being sensible. There is a ratio of cost versus benefits, and for that vast majority of people who do very basic stuff with their PCs, by the time they actually needed the performance that a high end i7 offers, something new will be out that’s so much better that their i7 is long irrelevant in terms of the performance it offers. For example, look at how long a Q6600 stayed relevant in terms of the level of performance it offered versus what was necessary to perform basic tasks. With your method, most people are going to be wasting money. Joel Hruska The Q6600 was a damned good chip. Meaningfully good for years thanks to solid single-threading and fairly good scaling. I got one of the later G0 steppings and took it up to 3GHz. It wasn’t quite as fast as the Extreme Editions of the day, but it also cost a lot less. spoffle Most definitely, I ended up with a really good one that I could get to 4ghz. I actually got 5 years of use out of mine before I managed to sell it for a third of the price I bought it at. I’ve never known a CPU to deprecate so slowly. Matt Menezes My wife’s computer gets my hand-me-downs, and she has a Q6600 @ 2.8ghz (just because I didn’t want to raise voltage), 8GB DDR2, and a Radeon 6950 2GB. It can maintain 30FPS at 1080P with medium-high settings in most RPG games she likes (no ultra settings, no AA). Honestly, I can’t believe the legs the Q6600 has had – and to think that was the first quad-core CPU for consumers!! Joel Hruska I mean, there are now much faster CPUs — the Q6600 is probably about half the speed of a modern high-end Intel processor. But as far as longevity, yeah, that core was hard to beat. :) Matt Menezes Exactly. I could have spent hundreds upgrading the CPU, mobo, and RAM, but instead I jacked a bit of memory from a decommissioned computer at work and gave her decent hand-me-down GPUs whenever I upgraded mine. I didn’t want to spend money, I wanted to build a box for her with spare parts on a solid platform, and I’m just amazed that the thing is even relevant all these years later. cr1swell I’m still using my G0 Q6600, got it up to 3.915Ghz cpu-z validated as well. I’m still running my golden chip, but it’s finally showing it’s age. But for 175 bucks, this thing has done way more than I have paid for it. Maverick Leo I have 2 desktop that runs on Core 2 Quad 8600 on Intel board with 8Gb DDR2. It’s almost a decade old. When I bought it, it was for Photoshoping, Corel, Vegas other stuff, sans gaming. It already underwent several VCard, HDD and PSU replacement. And still working. I bought it for its power, and it never fails. My point here, future proofing can be relative, gladly I am already taking advantage of it. Four (4) years into service, Memory and CPU technology have gone too, far. There’s not much we can do. VCard might be upgraded but only few applications can took advantage of CUDA power that I USE in my shop. (e.g. CS6, Nero, MSO13, AutoCAD, Vegas, and a few free apps, thanx to Linux community). So, yes, you’re right. Buy computers for its intended purpose. Think a decade ahead, consider what module that will last into the future, and what needs replacement that will still be supported by then. Think SATA, PCI-E, etc. MetusBatmanV3 “benefits” is subjective, you clown. Get off your high horse and stop trying to dictate how other people spend their money. Spoffle Well you’ve completely misunderstood what I’ve said, so yeah, no. Huhster “but I work for a living and can afford” And yes we all get your point, but Spoffle still makes a very good point and you are just being childish and snarky in return. VirtualMark He makes the same tired point over and over again, and it all comes down to cost. Which was exactly my point – if you can afford the i7 then buy it. A faster computer is better than a slower one, end of story. And the rest of your comments don’t even deserve a reply, so I’d suggest that you conduct yourself like an adult if you wish to continue this discussion. Phobos I don’t know how can you be such a troll magnet yet it’s hilarious how you crush them with an ease . VirtualMark Lol it’s quite funny really. They all act smart, then start talking about cost, which just goes back to my original point. close Ok, maybe you weren’t the best example. I was thinking more of a person who can actually answer the question :). So it’s basically like you asking “what should I do to solve this problem” and getting the answer “whatever you can”. VirtualMark As you haven’t made any relevant points, your tacit concession on the matter is accepted. close Well the educational system isn’t what it used to. Come on, I don’t expect you to know anything about CPUs but not even language? Tacit? Concession? This is what you gather from me telling you that you know sh|t? Sarcasm won’t help you, I feed on the tears of people like you :)). That’s because every time you try to feel good about yourself with a witty remark I just pop up with some facts (hope you don’t need a thesaurus for this one) to put you down. I also bore pretty easily so try to keep up. Your “one-line” idea is plain wrong no matter how you put it. “The most expensive CPU you can afford” is not necessarily the fastest or best so you just cost you parents an extra $60 (or 80 pounds which is worse) and got them a weaker CPU. Way to go son. Also it implies that your parents understand that there will be higher costs in the rest of the platform (like a dedicated graphics card, more powerful PSU, more expensive motherboard, more expensive RAM, more expensive cooling system) and also operational costs (like more power consumption). You just cost your parents another $1000 just so they can get that slower CPU that is already more than they need, plus a few bucks extra each month on electricity and a noisier PC. They just wanted a browsing machine son and they gave you the best they had all your life. Why couldn’t you give them proper advice so they don’t end up spending that money with no tangible benefit? They could have gone on a nice trip with the money you let them spend for nothing because you didn’t care enough to send them to someone who knows this stuff, you ungrateful… So no matter how you put it, it’s either dumb or ignorant and any person spending their own money would confirm this ;). Just ask you parents and maybe they’ll give you a smarter answer than the one you were prepared to give them. VirtualMark Wow, now I see that you’re just plain stupid. I would have thought that it was obvious that a higher powered CPU would require more power and better cooling, and that the cost would be higher, and didn’t really feel the need to spoon feed the obvious to you. Honestly I don’t know why the hell you’re even mentioning it, it’s laughable. And you’re still banging on about cost, which just goes back to my original point – if you can afford an i7 buy it. So thanks for proving my point. Anyhow, I’m bored of you now. Go away please and play with your i5, you little cheapskate. Huhster “you little cheapskate.” You are so obviously a teenage pro-troll using a “rig” your daddy bought you. close Ok Mr. DJ then how’s this: If somebody comes asking a washed up “DJ” for CPU advice (yeah, I know what you are, a 20 something guy who tries to imitate the big names in music, who sometimes calls himself a producer without actually producing anything original and plays around on his ripped off Ableton – best you can afford, right? ;)), if someone doesn’t know what CPU they need, they probably also know nothing about this and don’t realize that a better CPU needs more power, better cooling. They might also not realize that choosing a better CPU comes with a different socket so a much more expensive platform overall (MoBo, RAM, discrete GPU as the MoBo doesn’t have video output, even bigger PSU because of this). But you also don’t know this ;). So how are you expected to give someone else this info? You didn’t pay for your DAW so I guess now I know how you tricked your parents into paying for it: the most expensive they could afford. So, you keep it up. It’s no shame knowing shit in some areas. Well, it is when you try to sound smart and fail. But you keep it up ;). If you got over sucking in your field you can get over anything. But enough about this. The point was made. You can pay extra for nothing, or you can read the article and pay for what you need. To each his own. VirtualMark Lol what a nonsensical rant. You shouldn’t have edited your post, as your first one was better. Namely: “sometimes the more expensive CPU is not the fastest” Sometimes being the key word there, well done, you’re learning. Usually it is faster, but occasionally it isn’t. So the i7 is still the better processor. Anyhow, the rest of your post is entirely irrelevant, and as such, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. close Oh joy. You’re a glutton for punishment. No, the keywords here are “ignorant/dumb/uninformed” ;). If you pay for the most expensive thing you can afford and only ever use a fraction of that because you have no idea what you need or what you buy then you are ignorant at best. And to prove it I showed you that there are cases when not only do you not get to get more than you need, you actually get even less than you would have with the cheaper part. So you pay more for less. Does that sound like something a smart person would recommend? Not really, eh? It’s about as smart as buying 10 loaves of bread every day just for yourself (and implicitly throwing away 9) just because you can afford it. You’re still determined that more expensive is better but I think it’s pretty clear that you lack both common sense and knowledge. As for the “tacit concession”, you’re getting repetitive with stuff you don’t seem to understand. It’s probably what you have to do when you’re reminded that you tricked your parents into buying the most expensive computer they could afford for you just so you can play with knobs and sliders and call yourself a “producer”. Tacit enough? :)) VirtualMark Lol your angry rants are getting longer and longer, you appear to be repeating yourself, and as you havent brought up any further points, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. And I now consider the discussion closed, and probably won’t be replying any further. But please, keep ranting, I’m sure someone will read it. close You read it, pissed you off, came back for more. You looked like an eager beaver until you realized I nailed your description. So to quote the only thing you managed to say in the last few days in trembling “voice” while having the horrible revelation that you suck even at trolling: your tacit admission that you’re a DJ wannabe who knows shit about CPUs is noted. Sleep on that ;). Huhster OHHHHHH! OH NO SHE DIDN’T. claudette.musser = Randall Snoddy back in 2007 i went for gold and got a q6600 still using it so if i had to do it again i would go for gold again and use it for many years again Kawaii Kurumi Yep agreed, why the heck would parents who just browse the web and watch a bunch of movies require an i7 to do the work??? An i3 is more that enough to handle all of that in todays world, just grab the 6th gen i3 and plug it and go play 4K movies its more than enough MetusBatmanV3 I guess since you make $8 an hour you don’t understand what it means to make six figures a year. Spending a few thousand on a computer is nothing. Mooki What a stupid remark to make after a article that actually shows you that that is certaintly not the case and that a i7 only Potentially could be faster in a end users specific situation. Unless you just throw money at anything that has a higher number and then simply trust it was the best performance you were buying based on that. These sort of articles are nothing new so for my game PC i bought a 2500K and OC’s it to 4.6Ghz. The money i saved by not buying a i7 has been been spend on better components elsewhere. VirtualMark You say it’s a stupid remark, then go on to say about money you saved. Don’t you see the irony in your statement? Lol… clearly money was your concern, so my comment still stands. close VirtualMark, it’s already pretty clear that you confuse price with performance and you can’t establish a usage baseline in order to correctly size your computer for your needs. You throw money at something you don’t need or use. You’re still free to do it just don’t expect it to be considered normal or best solution by any smart person. Ignorance is bliss but comes at a price. So your parents will end up buying a bulky, hot, power hungry $2500 computer thinking that they *need* it when a $500 NUC would have been enough. Coming back to performance and price: i7 4910MQ 3.9GHz, 8MB cache – $570. i7 4950HQ 3.6GHz, 6MB cache + better GPU and TSX-NI – $630. So… You may never use/benefit from TSX-NI instructions, you may never use an integrated GPU, but you can afford the extra $50-60 so you pay more to get a CPU that’s slower. Smart advice… VirtualMark Nice essay, and a cute attempt to appear intelligent. But it doesn’t change my opinion, I’ll still buy top end CPUs. And I’ll always recommend to my friends and family to buy the best system they can afford. Obviously if their budget was small, then the i5 would be the better option, but if they could afford more, then go for the i7. It’s simple enough really, which part don’t you get? As for making use of the full CPU features, generally newer software will make use of those, so it’s good to future proof. For example, I use a lot of VSTs, and some of them have recently been patched to make use of newer instruction sets, and run a lot faster for it. close Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion (you know the saying, they’re like as*holes, everybody’s got one). I just enjoy bringing some people down to earth the second they try throwing crappy sarcasm along with their crappy opinions in an attempt to give them some weight. Since your opinion revolves around price tags we can all assume your advice was totally crap, being free and all. I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower. And your only argument is that “generally… at some point… maybe… my VST software will be improved by a better integrated GPU and TSX-NI instructions”. Also, TSX-NI is permanently disabled through BIOS in most motherboards (you wouldn’t know that, you only know price tags). So that’s what you get for asking a guy who knows little to nothing about a field. It’s ok if you like throwing money at something you’re not using or if your friends have to come to you (of all people) to get such advice. But that will never make it “best option”. It just means that you cannot add any value to such a discussion or properly answer this question, that’s all. You’re the guy who knows next to nothing about whatever domain but tries to look informed: “What car should I buy? The most expensive you can afford.” or “What should I eat? The most expensive thing you can afford.” Etc. VirtualMark “Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion” Clearly you’re trying your damned hardest, and failing badly. “I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower.” No you haven’t. close That’s because your parents didn’t spend enough time to educate you in reading and now you just want to get back at them by telling them to buy more expensive, slower stuff. It;s pretty simple. And I have shown you, you just weren’t able to understand even when I gave you specific product names and official prices. It’s common among the more ignorant population. Paul Nelson I agree they should always buy the best system that they can afford. But, the best system is not necessarily one with an i7. Benchmarks have proven that, in some scenarios, the i5 is as capable or more capable than the i7 and therefore the i5 would be the better system. Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved on using an i5 on installing better graphics, faster storage or a more efficient power supply. VirtualMark Lol, you just proved my point again. Hint: “Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved” Paul Nelson Not at all. Your original statement was “i7 if you can afford it. /article.” My point is that the i7 is not always the faster processor and therefore not worthy of the extra money. Just because you can afford it, does not make it the correct choice. Spending extra on an i7 hoping that it will last longer is a false economy. Chip technology changes. Take the change from Power PC to Intel in Apple Computers. You could have bought the best G4 machine available in 2004, because you could afford it, yet in 2005 the change to Intel wiped out that generation of processors and they soon became obsolete. But it’s fine, I could afford it. Didn’t make it the right choice though did it? VirtualMark Sorry but your incoherent rant proves nothing. You said that the i5 could be faster if you spent extra money on a graphics card, clearly you have no concept of how a PC works. A CPU is not a graphics card, nor is it faster storage. They are completely different parts, you utter fool. Paul Nelson Oh no, you called me a fool whilst completely misunderstanding what I wrote. That actually made me laugh out loud. VirtualMark That’s an interesting story. Tell me another one – what did you hope to achieve here? Did you expect to be able to convince me and change my opinion? Can’t you see that it was a year ago and that I’ve moved on? Can’t you see that I don’t care about a thing that you have to say? Go away please, no need to embarrass yourself any further. MetusBatmanV3 i7 has hyper-threading, if you can afford it, yes, it is the best processor. MetusBatmanV3 Really, so what exactly will be wiping out the i7 next year? MetusBatmanV3 i5 doesn’t have hyper-threading except for one i5 CPU. Which means if you want to take advantage of that technology i7 would be the way to go and if you can afford it what is the issue? Speed isn’t the only thing to consider. Huhster Back under your bridge, please stop feeding him. spoffle An article, an end, an i7. There’s more, but they’re the most obvious. tetriminos http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png some dude I kinda hope there’s benchmark where they test multiple application at the same time, and see if HT have any effect or not. most of people run multiple application, heck I play game and watch youtube at the same time. Lagittaja This is kind of relevant, Linustechtips video “CPU Cores for Gaming, Streaming, & Rendering Simultaneously – Is More Actually Better?” He used 5960X to simulate other CPUs. Scenario was gaming Far Cry 4 with rendering video, Twitch streaming, stream capture, AV scan in the background. It’s not a perfect test but pretty damn good showcasing the difference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgDZKGA89I I personally have a i7-3770K@4.7Ghz and I chose it over the i5 as I am a heavy multitasker. Plex media server so gf might be watching TV show while I’m gaming and server is doing transcoding. And I backup all my movies/TV shows and shove them through Handbrake with my own best quality/low filesize profile. Gaming/streaming. Multiple VM’s running in Workstation 11 in the backgroun. And so on. I so much want a 8c16t CPU :( GranFaloSentado Obviously i7 was the smartest choice for you. But for the 99% of the population, an i3 or even an AMD APU is more than enough, since they won’t use virtualization or they won’t be streaming video while having a heavily queried DDBB or a webserver. Lagittaja Well that’s the thing. You choose the CPU based on your needs! And for 99% of the population, a modern dual core Celeron/Pentium is more than enough. Even an i3 is overkill.. Heck, if I didn’t do any transcoding/streaming or running multiple VM’s at the same time > a lowly dual core would be enough for me. And I’ve been there and done that.. Purchased a Celeron G530 after I sold my OC’d 2500K as a placeholder before I purchased the 3770K, this was before IVB had even launched. Had it for quite a few months (edit: actually 7½) and it’s crazy how much you get for so little money nowadays. Joel Hruska I don’t think 99% is true. I’ve used the dual-core chips you’re talking about, and while they’re faster than Atom, they’re not that fast. If I had to choose between a dual core Pentium/Celeron and an AMD chip, I’d take the AMD core. Much better graphics performance and better overall multi-threaded perf. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1497 (As an example). Lagittaja So you’re comparing a ~63€ Pentium to a top of the line APU costing 136€, or ~85$ vs 150$. Good job. Since you did that I might as well just go and do this since it’s pretty much the same price difference. http://anandtech.com/show/9320/intel-broadwell-review-i7-5775c-i5-5675c/7 hue hue hue And if you’d compare in similar price brackets your “better overall multi-threaded perf.” doesn’t hold true even the slightest. A6-7400K is almost the same price as the G3420 and the Pentium pretty much rapes that A6. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1492 Or A10-7870K vs i3-4330 http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1192?vs=1497 Joel Hruska You’re right, I should’ve made my point more clear. I would not buy a low-end dual-core chip of any flavor. Between the Core i3 and the A10, it entirely depends on how much GPU perf you want. If you want the fastest integrated GPU you can buy at that price point, I’d buy the A10-7850K. If you care more about power consumption and want a strong CPU core, I’d buy the Core i3. Vice Squeezer I got a I5 and play on steam and play pandora at the same time.. never a conflict between the two.. youtube I’ve done that too.. but on pandora the music never stops.. Arian Hajiakbar How is I7-4500? Recommended? Joel Hruska It’s not clear to me why the i7-4500U is considered an i7 at all. It’s a dual-core chip with HT, and its clock speed (1.8GHz base, 3GHz top) is not unusual. It can’t address more than 16GB of RAM and its onboard GPU is an Intel Graphics 4400, not the HD Graphics 4600 that most i7’s carry. (The difference between the two isn’t huge, but I’d expect 4600 on an i7.) I think I’d look for something else. happycube lie7’s annoy the heck out of me. Matt Menezes Haha, lie7…that got me… :-) Naum Rusomarov From my experience, the i7 is better on the desktop if you’re planning on running more than two processing tasks concurrently. If the opposite is true then the i5 is perfectly capable for day to day work. You could even go with the i3 and you will still be fine. Mooki a i7 will only be better in such a case if at least one of those programs benefits from HT. As you can see it could even lower performance. Naum Rusomarov As far as I know the i7 processors have four physical cores, with HT enabled you get 8 cores in total. The i5’s have two physical cores plus 2 virtual cores due to HT, so in total you have four cores detected by the OS. p.s. This is on the desktop. The mobile i5 and i7 are a different story. UPDATE: I was wrong. The i5 have 4 physical cores, but no HT enabled. Thanks to the comments below. :) Sunset Rider No, desktop i5’s have 4 physical cores = 4 logical cores, desktop i7’s have 4 physical cores + HT = 8 logical cores. Eduardo Larios i5 have 4 cores, not 2+ hyper threading. Matt Menezes I see what you’re saying, but that could be misunderstood. An i5 could easily handle Outlook, Word, Chrome w/ 10 tabs, Visual Studio, multiple Explorer windows, SQL Server Management Studio, and YouTube playing music in the background. I say this because my work machine is an i3 (3.4GHz, 2C/4T) and it handles all those tasks just fine. As long as you have a decent IO subsystem (enough memory and an SSD) so the CPU isn’t constantly waiting, you can multitask all day long with a CPU that can address 4 threads like an i5. Now, if you are talking about applications that soak up every bit that a core provides and spawn threads left and right, then you might want to step up to an i7. That being said, even if you are only running 3-4 single-threaded apps that each peg an entire core, the only thing an i7 will give over an i5 is the tiny clock speed advantage (since HT won’t help). thepaintsaint In short, to figure it out for yourself and learn more, go to ark.intel.com. bob lebart If the user/builder wanted to save some $, and was mostly gaming, or just doing one main task, an overclocked i5 is great value. As the article said, for a multi-purpose machine, more threads are always better. My pc serves as a trading station (6 monitors, 2 different heavy market-steaming trading programs running, incl CNBC, 2 chats, multiple browsers up!!) and at other times it’s a gaming machine- a non-overclocked i7 Haswell, 16 gb ram, nVidia SLI system, and handles it all with plenty of headroom. Oh, and how could I forget: Photoshop…sometimes with all the above stuff running! Vice Squeezer I have thinking of upgrading to a I7 but my I5 is still fricking fast.. but to have 32 gigs of ram is very tempting.. games in the future will be more and more demanding for power and speed.. Mooki I would not do that if i where you it is simply not worth it unless you have some specific aplications that would benefit of that and are important enough for you. If not you will be way better off upgrading your videocard or SSD or anything else you think you might need. Vice Squeezer I just did that getting a 980.. but feel I still need to up my ram from 8 to 16 also wanting an upgrade on my mother board that supports blueray and wi fi, my ausus is four years old. I tried one of those blueray usb plugs still doesn’t see my speakers which are plugged directly to my sound card. Wanting a prettier tower.. a see thru one.. because both video and sound cards lite up.. jimv1983 What does having an i5 have to do with having 32GB RAM? With a 64-bit CPU the theoretical limit is like 2 million TB of RAM. I thought the only thing that limits that is the motherboard. Joel Hruska No. Intel and AMD chips have limits on maximum addressable RAM due to memory controller limitations and market segmentation. Right now, top end Xeons can address up to 1,536GB of RAM per chip, but that requires ECC RAM. jimv1983 Interesting. I didn’t know that. Are there any motherboards out there that have enough RAM slots to have 1,536GB of RAM? The biggest RAM sticks I have seen are 16GB and the most slots I’ve seen on a motherboard is 24 for a max of 384GB. Joel Hruska 32GB sticks are on the market. A high-end Xeon, according to Intel, can support 6TB of RAM in a dual-socket solution and 12TB in a quad-socket. However, this doesn’t square with the listed spec sheet on Intel’s own website. SuperMicro makes a motherboard that it claims can support up to 6TB of RAM using riser cards and Jordan Creek technology. Given that the largest server DIMMs I see are 32GB, that only works out to 3TB of RAM. Presumably the other 3TB will be available once 64GB DIMMs are out. Tim Tian ECC, not Buffered? Joel Hruska The spec sheet just said ECC. I’m not sure how much registered memory is still in use. Didn’t Intel phase out its fully-buffered DIMMs? Tim Tian FB-DIMMs, yeah, but I think you still need the RDIMMs for the full load out with RAM. Can’t find any half decent info though. Tim Tian Looks like disqus ate my reply again. Pretty sure FB DIMMs are being replaced by LR DIMMs, but R DIMMs (or LR DIMMs) are still required for more than 3 or 4 per channel. jimv1983 It would all depend on what the uses are. If I was building a computer to do simple browsing, media viewing, very light simple games, etc then I’d get the i5. If I was building a computer to play high end games, professional video editing or 3D graphics rendering I’d get an i7. This question is like asking would you buy a compact sedan or a huge truck. It all depends on your uses. Idiot Inside, Moron Outside Sum it up. i5 for gaming and i7 for more CPU intensive tasks using programs that can utililse the cores and threads. DecksUpMySleeve If it’s a workstation of any sort, 4-6MB cache all the way for me. Other than that I seek the wattage to performance G-spot for the i7 series. For example the i7-860 had the best performance per watt at it’s time. As will the i7-6920HQ right around the corner. For a gamer a high i5 will feel similar to any i7, but if you do rendering, digital art or video processing a low i7 will shine. spoffle Performance per watt isn’t a very good metric, with how far a lot of i5 and i7 chips will overclock, performance per dollar with a typical overclock added into the equation is the more sensible metric. Joel Hruska Most workstation users *don’t* overclock. Unless you’re buying from a vendor that guarantees it, like BOXX. spoffle Maybe they don’t, but I’m one of the ones that do, else I’m missing out on a level of performance that I otherwise wouldn’t see for a number of years. My current workstation has a 4930K that comfortably overclocks to 4.6ghz. Nothing would come close to that for raw performance at stock except those mental 18 core $4500 Xeon you can get on 2011-3. DecksUpMySleeve Sensible for the willfully wasteful. spoffle In what sort of context? DecksUpMySleeve Overclocking in general drops the processing per watt while upping the frequency, the processing may go up 5% for a 9% power hike. They optimize the default base clocks for a reason, and that 5% gain usually only translates to a very marginal difference unless the system is already near cap. I myself ran my i7-860(years back) at 2.7 instead of the 2.86 base clock and left the turbo to deal with demand hikes, ran cooler and therein never throttled due to temp under load. Everything I threw at it ran like butter. I find a 1/2-2/3rds full SSD to make a larger difference than clock speed ever could. When friends came over and played on my rig they went home sad to log on elsewhere. But back to my initial point the means doesn’t justify the ends in most cases for OCing, modern CPUs aren’t that much of a bottleneck in most applications. One less background process comes to the same effect, it’s better to keep those well managed than to ever OC. I myself know nearly every process and either use Msconfig to take them off startup or manually kill them through task manager. Works like a charm, in effect a ghz saved is a ghz earned. From what I read of your post though you hiked a hex core 3.9 to a 4.6ghz so a 17% clock increase translating to probly a 11% processing gain. I’m guessing your workload is hefty enough to possibly require such beastliness(12mb cache) but most overclockers are simply overkilling it, hampering overall performance and stability. On a side note; Broadwell-E with Turbo boost 2 technology may be something of interest to you in Q1 2016, though replacing your current system might not be all that rational, but none the less interesting. Skylake-E’s X models may be your next reasonable purchase. spoffle You’re looking at it very narrowly though, and your scope of overclocking is, well pretty weak. I’m talking a decent overclock, not a weak one that’s barely over single digits. Any PC I’ve had for the last 10 years, I’ve managed a hefty overclock. I’m talking in the 30-50% range. A few percent is a waste of time and effort. Also, I’m not sure why you’re comparing an SSD to an overclock. They aren’t comparable. When you’re doing light tasks, an overclocked CPU will still step down its clock speed to match the demand, so you’re not going to notice an overclock much doing light menial tasks where you’re going to notice the big SSD improvements. I’m talking heavy demand situations, as I use my system as a workstation, by applying a hefty overclock, I get a level of performance I’d otherwise be waiting years for. Unless I went down the multi Xeon route, and not at all if we’re talking single threaded performance. On top of that, the power consumption increase is vastly overstated, and the reason why CPUs are clocked conservatively is because they want to sell people who don’t overclock, new chips that are faster. There have been IPC (instructions per clock) improvements over the last few years, but they’ve been fairly conservative. Each new Intel CPU range that comes out is clocked about 5% faster on average, and they’ve been consistently upping the clock speed at that sort of rate whilst making the above IPC improvents too, so in reality they’re being held back for a few reasons, to give lay people an upgrade path (profit, and why they keep changing sockets) and cooling, the semi professional hardware like x79 and x99 already run hotter anyway, and have got loads of headroom. That’s why they sell unlocked K variety chips. DecksUpMySleeve I’m not understating the gains of OC, just practical advisories for the everyday workstation. Also I’m not sure you read the most recent edit of my post. I agreed that in specific cases the gains were more practical. I’m also very aware of the IPC clock gains, but with Skylake really being the end of the road for a couple years it’ll be a decent investment on arrival not soon outmoded. VirtualMark I find it’s better to undervolt modern chips, as it allows them to run cooler and thus run at their turbo frequency more often. I’ve tested my 4700HQ and it can run constantly at turbo now, even though it’s a mobile chip. Tim Tian Hmm. Interesting. Did you use the limited unlock overclock as well? And how much were you able to undervolt (I’d like a ballpark for my 4770MQ so I don’t need to reboot that often)? VirtualMark I used the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, and was able to set the multipliers for 1-4 active cores. The undervolt I’m currently running is -94mV, although this will vary from chip to chip. I undervolted my Core 2 Duo laptop too a few years back, and found that it ran about 10°C cooler. Tim Tian Now I’m curious whether you have Win Vista/7/8 on your laptop, or a old version that runs on XP. anyway, sue to unrelated issues, my big laptop is dead with a “BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO” every time. Think I messed something up with MSConfig.exe. Nothings helped so far :/ Dustymack Thats like asking if you would like a Ford Edge or a Mustang. Sunset Rider Two years ago when I built my last PC, I debated between the i5-4670k and the i7-4770k. I ended up going with the 4770k because I reasoned, “This PC is going to last me the next 4-6 years before I need to upgrade again. How much is $100 worth to me througout 4-6 years? How much is a faster CPU worth to me throughout 4-6 years?” Seeing as how I was already spending near $1500 on a new PC, i figured spending another $100 on the processor wasn’t such a bad idea for the next 4-6 years. It’s been two years and my usage pattern has varied wildy, from simple web-browsing, to playing the latest vidya games, to encoding raw 32 GB videos. I haven’t once said to myself, “Darn, I wish I had bought an i5 and saved $100.” lopo Future proof is still i5 for gaming. If you do lots of video editing, then i7 is for you. Actually even i3 can play every game you want to play without any problems. You just need good graphics card but you wont need i7 if you dont do video editing and stuff that needs more power from cpu and less power from gpu. Mike kizaberg I have a I7 4700hq for graphics design and gaming to be honest, i also do a lot of benchmarking, while watching very high res videos online to. It does the job that i want it to do, while for those who are looking to do the very basic on computers should not even get a i3 or i5, they should just go with a celeron in that case. Robert Foy I had a i5 that someone gave me for a gift, 3 months later ran into some money and bought a i7 3770k, and boy what a difference it made with games, especially Planetside 2 and others. If you can afford it, get an i7, i5 min. i3 or any dual core would be a waste. This is coming from a gamer’s POV btw, if your not a gamer, then go with whats the most efficient performance/cost wise. But if a gamer, go with i7, you won’t be disappointed. AlbiteTwins That’s odd. Most benchmarks show that a desktop i5 or i7 from the same generation don’t make too much difference for most games, Planetside 2 included. http://www.hardwarepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/planetside-2-benchmark.jpg Was the i5 you replaced one of the those low power consumption models (i5-3xxxS or i5-3xxxT) ? BenjaminShade Xeon E3-1231 V3 you can pick up one of these for $210 from microcenter or $250 reatail, and I believe it is the same basic chip as the i7 4770. It isn’t overclock-able but with hyper-threading a 3.8gHz turbo and 32gb addressable memory i doubt you will care. Plus it is built to higher specs being enterprise class so the silicon will physically last longer. It also allows for ECC memory in case you are one of those crazies that want’s to run your computer 24/7 for something like i dunno mining of crypto currency’s. Last but not least you can drop it in any standard lga 1150 mobo. Conservative411 90% of people only NEED i5. vision33r Sandy Bridge i7 is a good bargain right now, pair with a nice solid ASUS mobo it can last forever and still competitive today. Philip Du Toit I came for the comments. *Grabs popcorn* J.L. Cannot but wonder why no compiler guru has yet come up with a technique to virtualize threading so a single thread application can benefit from AMD multi-threading capabilities. Kind of inverse Hyper-Threading. Let’s hope HSA will bring something similar to the market, similar to hot-air for now that is, indeed. okay well not ever …. http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/07/7263-2/ tetriminos the reality is, things haven’t changed much since sandy bridge see this graph of the difference between i5 2500K and i7 4790 http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png KB Kingsberry I’m not a Gamer, however, I will be working with 4k video editing. Would the core i5 do just as well as an i7? I learned that I need at least a core i5 processor just to be able to work. TKosh So it is dual core now again???? What happened to duo core? dual core used to be the chips before the duo cores. Dora Hi, I need a laptop for software engineering and GAME engineering.

News & Analysis Allied with Intel, CEA-Leti Shoots for Moon Junko Yoshida 9/27/2016 10:38 AM EDT 3 comments Login to Rate Tweet GRENOBLE, France — With the inexorable rise of apps and software driven by Google, Facebook and Apple, Silicon Valley has long since ceased to be about the substrate that made its name. Hardware is passé and, to the chagrin of many chip designers, it doesn’t get the credit it deserves. Furthermore, unless you’re Intel, the last giant still standing in the valley, a constant M&A cycle engulfing semiconductor companies one after another doesn’t give you the time you need to ponder long-term issues — like what comes next after CMOS. This transition, however, poses a possible opening for a Grenoble-based French laboratories called CEA-Leti, which is promoting itself as an important partner to Silicon Valley. As one of the world’s largest organizations for applied research in microelectronics and nanotechnology, CEA-Leti is exploring the future of semiconductors. With a team of research experts and leading-edge industrial equipment, the French institute is going after breakthroughs in microelectronics for which most medium to small Silicon Valley companies have neither the will, resources nor bandwidth. During an interview with EE Times last week here, Marie-Noëlle Semeria, CEO at CEA Leti, told us, in unequivocal terms: “Innovation still is in hardware.” She said, “You can tune software [that runs on chips] but software isn’t enough” to develop key differentiating technologies. Semeria, a soft-spoken CEO who got the top job two years ago, is on a mission. Quietly but doggedly, she is punching holes in the almost 50-year old French laboratory institute. Marie-Noëlle Semeria, CEA-Leti CEO Semeria, physicist by training, has made it her task to bring out the best of the CEA-Leti’s expertise, find partners to take Leti’s breakthrough technologies all the way to “solutions” or “products on the market,” and get its own researchers engaged in “moonshot” projects that matter to the whole world, as she explained. Moonshot The best example of the ongoing efforts at CEA-Leti is a new R&D agreement with Intel — signed last May. Semeria calls the five-year contract with Intel a “moonshot.” Included in the new research framework is a plan for Leti to provide technologies that enable next-generation communication for the Internet of Things. “Nobody — other than Intel — has asked us to do such ambitious research,” said Semeria. For Intel, CEA-Leti researchers must go beyond incremental improvements in IoT, she noted. “They are asking us to develop technology whose speed is much faster — by one order of magnitude,” meaning 10 times faster. Central to the cooperation is the development of “technology enabling future of communication,” described Semeria. The research includes wireless communication systems and faster exchanges, the integration of connected objects and the study of low-consumption communication technologies. CEA-Leti will also work on security technologies and 3D displays. Semeria said that Intel screened all the scientific reports and papers and recognized CEA-Leti’s competence in a variety of fields including RF, security, high-speed, low-power communications and others. The contract with Intel is too big a deal for CEA-Leti to under-deliver. Semeria acknowledges that developing “demonstrators” on each of those new technologies won’t be easy. But “that’s why this is a ‘moon shot’ for us,” said Semeria. It “challenges all of us.” She added that the collaboration with Intel forces everyone – both at CEA-Leti and Intel – to work in a much more interdisciplinary manner. While disclosing the exact results of each technology development will be left to Intel, Semeria said, “We can still share what we’ve learned along with way with other medium to small companies in France or Europe, who can neither drive nor pay for such an ambitious project.” Next Page: Adding horizontal dimension Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > More Related Links IoT Networks Start to Sprout Smartphone-Bound VR/AR to Be Boosted by Lasers Parc: IoT To Be Self-Powered, Flexible, Transparent Smart Homes & IoT: What About Bob?

Never thought of the IoT as a robot before. A novel thought. Your statement on Intel gave me pause as I think Intel has been doing a fine job of staying current and moving out of just being a server-class kind of company. They have not just been taking in other people's laundry (ARM) to keep its IC plants chugging along but the company has also made two very strategic purchases that has positioned the company to keep current with the changing times. In doing, Intel has made some brilliant moves and has effectively changed its (IA) Intel Architecture-centric view of the world - which demonstrates a huge leap forward, shedding past constraints; something other giants have stumbled over in the past - and instead has come to see itself for what it is: the world leader in IC manufacturing technologies. But really its even better than that. Intel can now choose between three different roles: it can be the architect (using it's own IA, or its new acquisition IP), or architect/builder (once again using it's own IA, or its new acquisition IP), or simply act as the builder. About a year ago it bought an FPGA company called Altera and just recently acquired another company called Nervana for its machine-learning technology. Intel didn't throw out the baby with proverbial bath water by thinking to replace the default ARM processors with its own IA. This was a smart move for a couple of different reasons: 1) going to IA would have been expensive and demonstrated that Intel couldn't think beyond using its own architecture, and 2) sticking with the ARM cores kept the existing Altera customer base happy. Intel acquired Nervana not specifically for its machine-learning ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) but more so for its machine-learning algorithms and tools. An interesting note is both FPGAs and ASICs are custom silicon that lend themselves – via the programmable logic blocks – into being engines optimized for running machine-learning algorithms. The way I understand it, machine-learning at a high level is about things like pattern recognition by being able to dynamically model complex statistical relationships among phenomena. More importantly stated, machine-learning is a precursor to artificial intelligence (AI). And everyone these days are building their own custom silicon – Google, IBM, Facebook, Amazon, and now Intel. Why? Because application specific processing engines gets the job done quicker, smarter, and in the long run cheaper. So in my humble opinion, this new relationship w/ CEA-Leti is just another explicit example of Intel's technology investment prowess.

What's needed most is very low power high BW.   It would all tie together if they wouldn't focus too much on what partners think as their vision is often distorted by empty hope and financial needs. Intel, for example, needs to sell servers and that distorts their vision. Glasses- very low power everything and neuromorphic fit well -maybe CoolCube and very low power high bandwidth connectivity. Glasses are by far the most demanding form factor and that makes it the most important as everything can trickle down to other segments. Robots-  the core technologies enabling glasses can be put to great use but a few more things are needed. Server- anything that's very efficient can be applied here. IoT is everything and nothing but one can look at IoT as a type of robot.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board Most Recent Comments                 11/18/2016 12:39:51 PM realjjj Lots of options for electric bikes and pedelecs but prices are not great.

At the time of the announcement, Intel CEO Bryan Krzanich said, “Intel’s growth strategy is to expand our core assets into profitable, complementary market segments. With this acquisition, we will harness the power of Moore’s Law to make the next generation of solutions not just better, but able to do more.” That’s a nebulous way of saying Intel had plans to leverage Altera technology to boost its own profits, which is typically the point of acquisitions such as this. How Altera’s technology would be used, however, wasn’t fully explained at the time, but it is becoming more clear by the day. Intel has already disclosed that it has plans to integrate FPGAs into Xeon processors, which will leverage Altera technology. Those processors are due to arrive later this year and they should allow Intel to market more specialized, configurable hardware for accelerating a multitude of different workloads. FPGAs feature an array of logic gates that can be programmed to perform a myriad of tasks, and they can be optimized and re-programmed on the fly, as new workloads emerge or compute demands and algorithms change. The flexibility inherent to FPGAs is also at the core of Microsoft’s Project Catapult, which is a code-name for the technology behind Microsoft’s hyperscale acceleration fabric. Microsoft explains that Project Catapult “is at the center of a comprehensive set of investments Microsoft is making to build a supercomputing substrate that can accelerate our efforts in networking, security, cloud services and artificial intelligence.” Efficiently accelerating all of those different workloads is not something easily done with an ASIC – there isn’t some one-size-fits all chip out there to address the specific needs of each use case and data set. An FPGA, however, can be programmed to accelerate the algorithms associated with the specialized workloads and data sets of each specific application.  Altera Stratix V5 FPGA On A Project Catapult Accelerator Board For the past few years, Project Catapult has been evolving within Microsoft. At first, FPGAs were used to accelerate Bing’s Indexserve engine. A number of servers – over 1600 – were initially outfitted with FPGAs that were connected via a secondary network. The FPGAs were programmed to accelerate specific search-related algorithms, and the end result was in improvement in latency and a 50% reduction in the number of servers required to process workloads. Subsequently, Microsoft decided to put Project Catapult into production. A v2 architecture that enabled configurable clouds was eventually laid out and last year Microsoft ramped-up to large-scale production in Bing and Azure. However, Microsoft now also plans to employ Project Catapult FPGA accelerator boards in “nearly every new production server” and use the technology for virtually all of its services. In the future, these services could also encompass forward-looking AI-assisted, contextually aware computing and search models, similar to what was detailed in a recent Microsoft patent filing.   We’re speculating a bit, but with Intel putting FPGAs on Xeon processors, it should be able to reduce latency even further, since off-chip communications will be minimized due to the coherently attached in-socket FPGA adjacent to the central host processor. Density should be increased as well, and there may be power and efficiency benefits too. Should Microsoft’s Configurable Cloud architecture be adopted by others, and Intel’s future Xeons address the needs of Project Catapult, it could mean very good things for Intel in the lucrative, high-margin enterprise server platform space.

September 27, 2016 09:00 ET Harmonic Transforms Cable Access Market With Industry's First Software-Based CCAP Solution New CableOS™ End-to-End Offering Enables Groundbreaking Scalability, Agility and Cost Efficiency SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - September 27, 2016) - Harmonic (NASDAQ: HLIT), the worldwide leader in video delivery infrastructure, today introduced the CableOS™ system, the industry's first software-based CCAP solution. Fundamentally changing the economics of operating a cable access network, the game-changing CableOS solution enables the migration to gigabit capacity and resolves operators' space and power constraints in the headend and hub. The end-to-end solution provides unprecedented scalability, agility and cost savings, and enables fast deployment of new IP-based data, video and voice services. The CableOS solution will make its public debut this week during SCTE Cable-Tec Expo, booth 1948. "Today's cable operators have a remarkable opportunity when it comes to rolling out next-generation gigabit broadband services," said Patrick Harshman, president and CEO at Harmonic. "The software-based CableOS solution provides the tools to take advantage of that opportunity, as well as gain the benefits associated with distributed access architecture. Leveraging the full extent of Harmonic expertise in developing software-based technologies, CableOS helps our customers simplify operations, generate new revenue streams and reduce TCO." Featuring the industry's first software-based CMTS Core server and full-spectrum DOCSIS 3.1 Remote PHY systems, CableOS Core software runs on 1-RU COTS Intel® processor-based servers in a headend, hub or data center. "As we continue to evolve our network and products to deliver leading-edge speed and performance to our customers, it's exciting to see the continuing wave of innovation being driven by our valued partners," said Tony Werner, president of technology and product for Comcast Cable. "Innovation in this space is particularly timely as our industry increasingly leverages software to deliver smart, simple and scalable infrastructure." A single CableOS Core server offers a quantum leap forward in its ability to support tens of gigs of capacity and multiple service groups in fewer rack units when compared with traditional hardware CMTS implementations. With CableOS, operators can cut space and power by up to 75 percent in a centralized CCAP deployment, or by more than 90 percent in a Remote PHY deployment. "Cable delivery infrastructure has traditionally been based on purpose-built silicon platforms," said Dan Rodriguez, general manager, Communication Infrastructure Division at Intel Corporation. "Scaling hardware-centric infrastructure to meet new services and IP demand growth leads to capacity, space and power challenges. The move to a software-based model that uses standard servers with Intel® processors offers cost and time-to-market advantages to cable operators by delivering more computing at the edge of the network to improve service agility and quality of experience." Beyond streamlining the migration to the new DOCSIS 3.1 specification over existing cable access infrastructure, the CableOS solution offers breakthrough RF port density for centralized architectures, affording operators dramatic cost savings over traditional cable access architectures.

The first rule of car club is, presumably, to talk incessantly about car club. The three German car companies that bought HERE from Nokia have got together with the three big kit vendors and the two biggest chip vendors to push the connected car industry as we move towards the 5G era. Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Intel, and Qualcomm have reasoned that 5G will be the moment of truth for the connected car. The lower latency will enable things like remote control, instant emergency support and realtime services such as contextual navigation. The group seems keen on the term C-V2X, which stands for cellular vehicle-to-everything and seems like a needlessly convoluted way of saying connected car. As is so often the way when these consortia are unveiled, the rest of the announcement is heavy on buzzwords and lofty aspiration but light on specifics. Here are some of those aspirations: Defining and harmonizing use cases, technical requirements and implementation strategies. Supporting standardization and regulatory bodies, certification and approval processes. Addressing vehicle-to-everything technology requirements, such as wireless connectivity, security, privacy, authentication, distributed cloud architectures and more. Running joint innovation and development projects leading to integrated solutions, interoperability testing, large scale pilots and trial deployments. Needless to say everyone provided a canned quote, here are the least generic of them: Sajjad Khan, Director Digital Vehicle & Mobility, Daimler “The connected car enables us to offer our customers services, both inside and outside the vehicle, which make their daily routine tasks easier, increase comfort and safety and thus create considerable added value. The fundamental basis for this is a reliable and fast connectivity technology whose standards have global validity. Together with the other founding members of the 5G Automotive Association, we as Daimler AG are working on precisely that – with the aim of raising car connectivity as well to a new level with the advent of the next generation of mobile phone technology.” Ulf Ewaldsson, CTO, Ericsson “The success of 5G is dependent on cross-industry work in new eco systems to digitalize industries. With the creation of this Association we will leverage our latest technology, 5G, and work closely together with the car industry to jointly develop solutions as well as provide input to regulation, certification and standardization. We are excited to be co-founder and to work with leading automotive companies shaping the connected car solutions for the future.” Doug Davis, GM of the IoT Group, Intel “Intel’s leadership work in 5G technology development, long–term commitment to open standards, and collaboration with leaders in the automotive industry will drive an accelerated path to adoption of 5G in automotive and transportation. Partnering together with other industry leaders will ensure 5G can support the use cases that will deliver on breakthroughs in safety and services for automated driving, smart city and intelligent transportation solutions around the world.” That’s it really. The announcement seems timed to coincide with the Paris motor show, which starts in a few days and at which there is likely to be a fair bit of connected car action. Yesterday Here, the navigation company spun out from Nokia’s massive Navteq acquisition and bought by Audi, BMW and Daimler last year, announced ‘next generation vehicle-sourced data services’, which seems to mean big data for cars. In practice this will mean loads of sensors generating loads of data which is then processed by loads of processors to generate loads of decisions. A sort of miniature version of the IoT vision. All this cleverness will allow drivers, or perhaps the cars themselves, to make smarter decisions on things like traffic conditions, potential road hazards, traffic signage and on-street parking. The ultimate stated aim of Here is for as many car makers as possible to use it and thus generate a definitive flow of realtime data. Google might have something to say about that. “What we are seeing today is the technology and automotive industries coming together to create services that will elevate the driving experience for billions,” said Here CEO Edzard Overbeek. “This is also an important milestone for our Open Location Platform, which is ready to serve as the nerve center for future autonomous vehicles, smart cities and intelligent transportation systems.” It’s hard to argue with the conclusion that a major feature of the 5G/IoT era will be these smart/connected/autonomous cars. Car makers are desperate to differentiate through technology but the promised marriage between phones and cars has been a long time coming. It remains to be seen just how much real value having all these connected sensors will add to the driving experience but what is undeniable is that momentum is building. The second rule of car club is to bang on about it constantly, as we’re about find out.

Finally adding native PCIe 3.0 support in addition to native USB3 & 3.1 functionality. The new desktop platform features dual channel DDR4 memory support for a total of four DDR4 memory modules & speeds up to 3200Mhz. The socket can support up to 24 PCIe lanes, depending on the chipset. AM4s Key Features - DDR4 Memory - PCIe Gen 3 - USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbps - NVMe - SATA Express AMD Zen Press Release "From 7th Gen APUs to upcoming Zen-based Summit Ridge desktop processors, the future-ready AM4 platform features the newest I/O standards and an AMD commitment to support it into the future. The initial Zen cores for Summit Ridge-powered desktops will utilize the AMD AM4 socket, a new unified socket infrastructure that is compatible with 7th Generation AMD A-Series desktop processors. With dedicated PCIe® lanes for cutting-edge USB, graphics, data and other I/O, the AMD AM4 platform will not steal lanes from other devices and components. This allows users to enjoy systems with improved responsiveness and the future looking technologies that the AM4 platform provides, resulting in a powerful, scalable and reliable computing solution for all their needs." 40%+ More Pins Than AM3+ & New Mounting Hole Spacing Just like previous generation AMD sockets AM4 is a Pin Grid Array socket with zero insertion force. It maintains the same locking mechanism as the previous generation and takes up exactly the same area as AM3+, measuring in at 40x40mm. One of the most significant changes however is the number of pins. AM4 supports 1331 pins which is a very significant increase over the 942 of AM3+ and quite a bit more than Intels LGA1151. In fact this makes it the first PGA socket that weve seen from AMD to accommodate more contact pins than Intels LGA. All AM4 APUs & CPUs featured integrated southbridges and natively support significantly more PCIe lanes & USB devices than before.That in addition to AM4s cross-compatibility feature have been the primary drivers of the hefty 40%+ growth in pin contacts from AM3+ to AM4. To accommodate this the number of traces going in and out of the socket has also increased dramatically. This has unfortunately necessitated and adjustment of the sockets cooler/heatsink mounting holes. Effectively breaking compatibility with all previous generation coolers for AM2, AM2+, AM3 & AM3+.  Click to show spoiler Backside of AMD AM4 Zen Summit Ridge & Bristol Ridge Processors: Noctua have already announced that they will be offering free upgrade kits to their customers. Allowing them to use their existing Noctua coolers on upcoming AM4 motherboards. ============================ AMD X370 Chipset For High-End AM4 Boards Detailed  Summit Ridge and Overclocking Support ! Details regarding the AMD X370 chipset have leaked out over at Planet3dnow. The details confirm that X370 will be the high-end chip designed to support the upcoming Summit Ridge processors. These processors will be designed using the next-gen Zen core architecture that offers up to 40% IPC increase over Excavator and higher efficiency. The chipset stack is known as Promontory and consists of four SKUs. While majority of these SKUs were detailed along side the Bristol Ridge launch, theres one that has been kept under wraps. This is the high-end X370 chipset which will be aimed at the enthusiast market. AMD Zen features a new design built from the ground up on the 14nm FinFET process node. For starters, the AM4 platform is only currently available through OEMs. The general public launch will be coming in a few months later, around CES 2017. Motherboards built by various AIBs will be aimed at the PC DIY market with loads of CPU and I/O features. General availability of the high-end boards is expected around February 2017 as detailed before. Lets take a in-depth look at all of the chipsets: AMD X370 For Enthusiast AM4 Motherboards: First up, we have X370, a high-end chipset for overclockers and tweakers who need robust platforms. This chip provides the ultimate low-level control to its users and delivers ultimate graphics card bandwidth. By bandwidth, AMD is referring to max PCI-Express lanes as this is the only chip in the stack that supports multi-GPU functionality. The chipset supports both, CFX (CrossFire) and SLI. AMD Feature AMD X370 and Summit Ridge processors will be aimed at enthusiasts, delivering the best overclocking performance. AMD has mentioned two full x16 (Gen3) lanes for GPUs. AIBs can add additional lanes through a PLX chip but that would add to the cost. X370 features full overclocking support with a very sophisticated GUI that will allow the best overclock tools and experiences. Since all AM4 CPUs have an unlocked multiplier, record breakers will definitely put X370 boards to the test on liquid and LN2 setups.  Click to show spoiler =========================== AMD After hours AMD Has Plans To Create The Starship Processor With 48 Cores / 96 Threads On The 7nm Node ! "Fudzilla reported on something pretty interesting a while back  and we never got around to covering it because it was about something that was pretty far out into the horizon. However, in light of recent announcements from AMD regarding the amended WSA agreement, I thought now would be a good time to finally go over it. I am talking, of course, about AMDs plans for a 48 core processor based on the 7nm process that has been code named Starship. Since all of this is basically just leaked paperwork at the moment. AMD possibly planning to skip the 10nm process  7nm Server processor codenamed Starship planned for 2018 AMD is currently working on its 14nm based Zen architecture and the showcase product on the server side will be the 32 core Naples processor. However, they already have plans for a 48 core chip that will be based on the 7nm process  and since the company will continue to use an SMT (Simultaneous Multi Threading) based approach to its architecture  we are looking at a very impressive count of 96 threads. Considering the fact that Starship will be based on the 7nm process not only will it be more economically viable (in terms of cost effectiveness and $ per transistor) than the 14nm implementation of Zen but it will also be much more power efficient. If AMD continues its value philosophy forward with Starship, then it can eventually go on to pose a significant challenge to Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi chips. The Xeon Phi co-processors will be the only offerings from Intel which will out strip the Starship in terms of the raw core count. As is usually the case with chips from the Blue giant however, they are very pricey and when it comes down to it, the use cases that these chips are targeting can be achieved just as easily by employing more than one processor as long as it is cost effective and power effective. Now this leak as well as AMDs recent WSA announcement has one very interesting implication. It would appear that the company is going to be skipping the 10nm process. The amended agreement covers only 14nm and also 7nm chips and the fact that Starship is thought to be coming soon after the Naples platform both suggest the chip designer will be skipping the 10nm node. It also lends credence to this starship leak since AMD has already included 7nm processors in its amended WSA agreement. Meaning, it plans to roll them out sometime before the amendment expires  probably around the late 2018 to 2019 time frame. It is worth adding at this point, that this could turn out to be completely inaccurate and simply a matter of omission due to 10nm node being not part of the contract  that said however, I must admit that the evidence currently points to AMD moving directly to 7nm. As is usually the case with such large processors, there will be smaller versions of the same (yield theory dictates that) and according to the source the TDP should vary between 35W and 180W for the entire range of servers. It is also not clear at this point whether AMD will be be using the Zen architecture for the Starship processor or whether it will be a new revision. One thing is clear though, the 2018 time frame is probably a best case scenario. As the process node is shrinking in size  it is getting harder and harder to beat physics. If the 7nm FinFET process is anything like past nodes, it will be based on a 10nm backbone, and EUV lithography (which is technically good till 5nm) should be able to take us that far. Even then, late 2018 is the earliest we can expect any working x86 processor on the 7nm node to materialize otherwise we are looking at the same 2019 estimates for 7nm chips." ====================== AMD and Lenovo donate AMD-based ThinkPad E-series notebooks to The Jamaica Positive Foundation It's not everyday that companies like AMD and Lenovo donate a bunch of laptops, so when the news that they donated some AMD-based Lenovo ThinkPad E-series notebooks to The Jamaica Positive Foundation - but it was when I discovered it all happened thanks to a simple Facebook post. Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness posted on Facebook, where he donated a notebook to a student in his constituency. Lenovo GAM VP David Bennett followed Holness on Facebook, and together with his Jamaican heritage, noticed that the Lenovo laptop Holness was giving away in Jamaica was an AMD-powered one. AMD and Lenovo were then in contact with the Jamaican PM, who agreed to talk with the companies and over a courtesy call, PM Holness gave his gratitude for the donation saying that there was a digital divide in the country, so the notebooks would make some rather large differences in students lives. The local community weren't the only ones to benefit, as it opened a new avenue for opportunities for AMD in the Central America & Caribbean area, working with Lenovo US boss Emilio Ghilardi. It's great to see AMD getting out there and pushing their notebooks into the hands of more people, especially in areas of need. ============ AMD : Zen Outperforms Intels High-End Broadwell-E CPUs Zen Performance Demo vs Intels $1000 Broadwell-E i7 6900X During the event AMD treated the audience to the very first public, real-world performance showdown featuring Zen and a contemporary competing Intel high-end enthusiast class CPU. The demo involved two similarly specced PCs one configured with an eight core, 16 thread Zen engineering sample clocked at 3.0Ghz and the other configured a with an eight core, 16 thread Intel Broadwell-E processor also clocked at 3.0Ghz. Both systems started the same Blender render session at the same time and the Zen CPU was actually able to finish first. This marks the very first time that we have seen an AMD CPU outshine an Intel CPU in instructions per clock in more than a decade. Outperforming the Intel CPU core for core, and clock for clock. That demo represents a truly historic moment for AMD. The key takeaways here are  Zen has better or equivalent IPC to Intels highest performing desktop CPUs yet, Broadwell-E.  AMD states that 8 core, 16 thread Zen CPUs will scale to frequencies beyond 3.0Ghz. All New AM4 Socket & Platform AMD is finally bringing all of its desktop products under one roof. The next generation AM4 socket will be compatibel with both desktop APUs and CPUs. This includes the upcoming Excavator based Bristol Ridge APUs which are set to arrive some time during the next four months. As well as the brand new Summit Ridge family of high-performance Zen CPUs. All CPUs inside the Summit Ridge family will include the companys new platform security processor, PCIe 3.0 support, dual channel DDR4 memory controllers, copious amounts of L3 cache and updated storage features. Including USB3.1 and NVMe. AMD Desktop Platform Evolution AM4 AMD AM4 platform key technology features include: # DDR4 Memory # PCIe Gen 3 # USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbps # NVMe # SATA Express Availablity & Closing Comments AMD confirmed that AM4 motherboards will begin shipping throughout the next number of months. The first processors to be available on the new socket are Bristol Ridge APUs, which will begin shipping some time before the Holiday season. The multi-core enthusiast Zen CPUs that have been the subject of most of this article will be available en mass in early 2017 CEO Lisa Su has confirmed. There were some hints that Zen could launch around CES, so January 2017 would be a good bet. It seems that all the stars are lining up for AMD, which has seen its fair share of struggles over the past several years. All the components are there to make Zen a successful product. It has taken more than a decade, but its finally here. An AMD product that can actually challenge Intels highest performing Extreme Edition CPUs. Its almost unfathomable at first thought, after all we all grew accustomed to seeing Intels enthusiast CPUs go uncontested for the longest time.

Es geht um die Zukunft. 27.09.2016 © dpa Der 5G-Standard ist extrem wichtig für das Autonome Fahren. © dpa Der 5G-Standard ist extrem wichtig für das Autonome Fahren. Deutsche Autobauer wollen gemeinsam mit IT- und Telekommunikationsfirmen die Technik für vernetzte und selbst fahrende Autos vorantreiben. Audi, BMW und Daimler schließen sich dazu mit den Netzwerkanbietern Ericsson, Huawei und Nokia sowie den Chipherstellern Intel und Qualcomm zur „5G Automotive Association“ zusammen, wie die Unternehmen an diesem Dienstag mitteilten. Der Verein wolle dafür sorgen, die Möglichkeiten des künftigen Mobilfunkstandards 5G bestmöglich auszuschöpfen und Fahrzeuge optimal zu vernetzen. „In der Automobilindustrie ist 5G von besonderer Bedeutung für die Digitalisierung und auf dem Weg hin zum autonomen Fahren“, erklärte Christoph Grote, Bereichsleiter Elektronik von BMW. Die Allianz sei für weitere Partner offen. 5G ist der Fortschritt Die Mobilfunkanbieter wie Telekom und Vodafone sind zum Startschuss der Initiative nicht dabei. Doch es gebe bereits Gespräche mit weiteren Mitgliedern, erklärte ein Audi-Sprecher, wollte jedoch keine Namen nennen. Die künftigen 5G-Nutzer wollen technische Anforderungen festlegen, Pilotprojekte dazu aufsetzen und auf die gesetzliche Standardisierung Einfluss nehmen. So weit ist die Mobilfunkindustrie aber noch nicht. 5G ist noch in der Versuchsphase, eine weltweite Übereinkunft über Details fehlt noch. Bundesverkehrsminister Dobrindt will Deutschland als erster Land überhaupt flächendeckend mit 5G ausstatten - bis zum Jahr 2025, wie die Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung berichtet. Mehr zum Thema Dobrindt will ultraschnelles Internet bis 2025 Der Mobilfunkturbo soll Daten zehn Mal so schnell wie der gerade schnellste Standard 4G/LTE transportieren. Die Reaktionszeit bei Eingaben soll gegen Null gehen. Das ist eine Voraussetzung dafür, dass Autos vollkommen autonom fahren können und ein sekundenweiser Ausfall des Netzes keinen Unfall verursacht. Die Allianz ist ein weiterer gemeinsamer Schritt der drei deutschen Premium-Autobauer, die im vergangenen Jahr zusammen schon den Navigationskartendienst Here von Nokia kauften.

Pradeep Nair Comment   ·   print   ·   T  T   T+  ·   T- Tweet V Geetanath » B Rishikesh Bahadurdesai » Zahid Rafiq » TOPICS Karnataka Bangalore Businesses, especially startups, that are working in the Internet of Things and the wearable segments can look forward to bringing their products to market much faster, with the global player NXP Semiconductors launching two new platforms. Typically in product manufacture, building the basic elements takes up six to nine months and costs a huge amount of money. These elements are common in most cases. “With our products, entrepreneurs need not keep reinventing the wheel and wasting time and money,” said Ashok Chandak, Senior Director, Global Sales and Marketing, NXP Semiconductors. “They can instead focus on their creative ideas and the go-to-market strategy, and start working right from day one, as our products have all the desired hardware blocks and electronic chips already interconnected, and the software blocks already ported.” He said the NXP products, WaRP7 and Hexiwear Reference Platform, are one of its kind, though some other players are also looking at providing similar solutions, “But the extent to which we have gone is unique,” said Mr Chandak, adding that the solutions will be especially beneficial to entrepreneurs, product design labs and R&D organizations, besides startups. He said the company has partnered with two e-commerce portals. “The customers will get a complete working unit, along with all the software files, the design files, the build-up material information etc. It is up to them to make use of all of that or some of it, and build their ideas on top of it,” he said. Intel launches Xeon Phi With volume of data mounting in geometric proportions and Artificial Intelligence going mainstream, the focus is shifting to processors that can cope with not only the load but also dive deep into data and come out with accurate insights without latency. Intel last week launched its Xeon Phi processor that is faster, scalable and easily deployable. It also helps data scientists to run neural networks and training models much faster. This is important because high-performance computing is coming out of scientific labs to more mainstream applications. This is Intel’s first bootable host processor that is designed for highly parallel workloads. Free of dependence on GPU accelerators, it scales efficiently, and can handle a wider portfolio of workloads and configurations than accelerator products, said a company release. Intel is hoping to partner more closely with the automotive, manufacturing and aerospace industries. DriveU partners with Zoomcar DriveU, a fast-growing on-demand chauffeur aggregator for private car owners, is partnering with leading self-drive car rental firm Zoomcar. This means Zoomcar customers will get their vehicle delivered and picked up by DriveU’s trained and uniformed drivers. DriveU started the doorstep delivery service for Zoomcar in Bengaluru and has since expanded the service in Mumbai, Delhi NCR and Pune. In the next few months, the company plans to expand the service to other cities where Zoomcar is operational, said a DriveU release. Internet grows Around 79 lakh domain name registrations were added to the internet in the second quarter of this year. According to VeriSign, this brings the total number of domain name registrations to approximately 33.46 crore across all top-level domains (TLDs) as of June 30, 2016. It also marks a growth of 2.4 per cent over the first quarter of this year. Domain name registrations have grown by 3.82 crore or 12.9 per cent year over year. As of June 30, 2016, there were as many as 12.75 crore .com domain name registrations and 1.58 crore .net domain name registrations. Track company budget in real time Happay, a Bengaluru-based fin-tech company that offers expense management solution for companies, has launched pre-paid card designed to track, monitor and control marketing spends and conversions on daily, weekly and monthly basis. The Digital Marketing Expense Card, tailored to requirements of a marketing team, also monitors the marketing budget and expense on real-time basis. New solution to cut power consumption ROHM Semiconductor, the Bengaluru-headquartered Indian arm of Japanese ROHM Group, has come up a solution to bring down electricity consumption of home appliances and industrial equipment. The solution, specially tailored for the Brushless Direct Current motors India, has features that will reduce the design time and hence enable customers to take their products faster to market. Considering the Indian conditions, the new solution, which can be applied to ceiling fans, ACs, air coolers, and air purifiers, has been designed to withstand the harshest of the voltage fluctuations, said a company release.

As it turns out, Microsoft played a key role in Intel’s decision to make the purchase. A recent feature from Wired explains how, in late 2012, engineers within Microsoft attempted to sell then-CEO Steve Ballmer on an idea called Project Catapult. Doug Burger explained that in the near future, the world’s top Internet giants would be running web-based services so complex that they’d require a whole new architecture to run them. Project Catapult, which would use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), was Microsoft’s answer to that as-yet-realized conundrum. FPGAs, which have been around for decades, are programmable chips that engineers only recently realized could be useful in accelerating online services as they can be programmed to perform a very specific job and be very efficient about it. Ballmer reportedly wasn’t buying it but little did he know, Burger and the team that runs Bing had already started work on it. They’d have to go through three prototypes to finally find a solution that also worked for Microsoft’s other massive online services – Office 365 and Azure. Programming at the hardware level is a “nightmare,” according to former Microsoft Principal Researcher Jim Larus but in the end, it proves to be worth the hassle as Catapult hardware costs less than 30 percent of everything else in a server, consumes less than 10 percent of the power and processes data twice as fast as would be possible without it. Microsoft’s FPGAs come from Altera, the company Intel purchased last year. In fact, Microsoft is the reason Intel bought Altera but not the only reason. According to Intel executive vice president Diane Bryant, a third of all servers used by major cloud providers will utilize FPGAs by 2020.

The fundraising comes three years after the VC firm, which was led by partners Michael Eisenberg, Eden Shochat and Aaron Rosenson, raised its initial $140 million just three years ago and has since made 10 investments with it. Aleph focuses on early-stage investments. Aleph I’s portfolio includes Windward, which provides real-time data on global shipping; Colu, which is developing blockchain technology for the financial markets; Freightos, a platform for managing and pricing freighting shipments; and WeWork, which operates office space mostly for high-tech startups. One of the ideas behind Aleph is its focus on building big high-tech companies in Israel. “It was never an objective problem to build a $10 billion company in Israel. It was a problem of attitude. People believe in it now,” Eisenberg said in an interview in July. (Eliran Rubin) Intel lays cornerstone for smart building in Petah Tikva Intel laid the cornerstone for a new research and development center Monday in Petah Tikva, which is housed in a so-called smart building that supposedly will learn the personal habits of each of its 2,500 occupants who volunteer to share the information and create a personalized work environment. Among other things, Intel’s smart office will reportedly know what kind of coffee to prepare for them in the morning, remind them it’s time to get a haircut and recommend where to park their car in the company garage. Company officials claimed the building not only creates a friendlier environment for staff but also serves as a showcase for Intel’s internet of things technology. “Erecting the campus underlines the importance of our presence in Israel and reflects our values of innovation, technology and green construction,” alleged Maxine Fassberg, CEO of Intel Israel. The new 34,000 square meter building will be occupied by Intel staff from 13 different office sites around Israel. (TheMarker Staff) BioLine licenses liver treatment from Ben-Gurion, Hadassah Just two days after the drug giant Allergan said it would pay $1.7 billion for Tobira Therapeutics, which is developing treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. The tiny Israeli biotech company BioLine said it was also getting into the action, reporting on Friday that it had signed a licensing agreement with BGN Technologies and Hadasit, the technology-commercialization arms of Ben-Gurion University and Hadassah Medical Center, to pursue a similar drug. BioLIne said it was buying their BL-1220 drug for treating NASH, a common, often “silent” liver disease. Developed by Prof. Smadar Cohen of Ben-Gurion and Prof. Yaron Ilan of Hadassah, pre-clinical results in animal models show that BL-1220 is able to restore liver function. The technology could be directed toward rapid regeneration of normal liver in both acute and chronic conditions of liver injury, said BioLine, whose shares jumped 22% to 4.60 shekels ($1.23) on the news Sunday. (Uri Tomer) Anodot raises $8 million for online-anomaly technology Anodot, which helps companies detect online anomalies in things like payments and e-commerce data, last week said it raised $8 million in funding. The round was led by the Israeli venture capital fund Aleph, joined by Disruptive Technologies and brings total funding for the company to $12.5 million. The proceeds will be used to expand global sales and operations and meet demand for its service. Based in Sunnyvale, California and Ra’anana, Anodot was co-founded by David Drai, the former chief technology officer of GetTaxi and cofounder of Contendo, a startup acquired by Akamai; Shay Lang, former vice president of engineering at Trustwave; and Dr. Ira Cohen, former chief data scientist at HP. Anodot brings machine learning and real-time streaming data together to identify, report and visualize business incidents as they occur, enabling its customers – often Business Intelligence analysts serving all aspects of a company’s operations – to quickly and effectively manage crises and uncover business opportunities.

DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Twitter Facebook Instagram Google+ RSS Feed DreamHost.com Domains Web Hosting WordPress Hosting Cloud Hosting Cloud How DreamHost Builds Its Cloud: Selecting Microprocessors September 26, 2016 Written by Luke Odom This is post No. 2 in a series of posts about how DreamHost builds its Cloud products. Written by Luke Odom straight from data center operations.  In this post, we are going to be looking at what processor we are using in the new DreamCompute cluster, and how we picked it! A processor is one of the most crucial components of a machine. The processor, also known as the CPU, is the metaphorical brain of the computer. It does all the “thinking” for the computer. A CPU can have one or more cores. A core is the part of the processor that does the actual computing. The first thing to consider is the instruction set. This is the language that the processor speaks. The popular instruction sets for use in servers are Sparc, ARM, and x86-64. Processors using the Sparc instruction set are made by Oracle. While Linux can run on them, the processors are designed to run Solaris, an operating system that is also made by Oracle. ARM is an instruction set that has been around for 30 years and had primarily been used in embedded devices. Cell phones, TVs, and tablets are some of the many places you will find ARM processors. Recently, we’ve been testing some servers with ARM processors. The advantage of these servers is they use very little power and have many low-power cores, which is useful in environments where you have many processes running at the same time. The most common instruction set you will find in a data center is x86-64. This is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set that has been in use since 1978. Almost all consumer laptop, desktop, and enterprise servers are made using processors based on x86-64. Because of this, we decided to use a processor based on x86-64. Source: Flickr The server x86-64 processor manufacturers are AMD and Intel. AMD, which we used in our beta cluster, last released a major x86-64 server processor in 2012. Since that release, AMD has been working on Zen, a new architecture. Unfortunately, Zen has not yet been released. Because of this, the AMD processors currently for sale are much higher wattage and slower than others on the market. In the time since the last major AMD update, Intel has released three new generations of chips, each faster and more power efficient. This makes Intel the best choice right now, so we decided to use them. Every year or so, Intel releases a new “generation” of processors. With each generation, Intel does one of two things. They either change the transistor size, making the processor smaller and more power efficient, or they keep the transistor size the same and focus on adding features. Within the server line of processors, there are four generations currently being produced. Ivy Bridge, which was released in 2012, is a upgrade of the older Sandy Bridge processors with smaller transistors and is denoted with a v2 at the end of the processor name for most server processors. Haswell, released in 2013, is a refinement of Ivy Bridge and uses the same transistor size. For servers, it is denoted as v3. Broadwell, released in 2014, was a refinement of the Haswell processor with smaller transistors and is denoted with a v4. Finally, SkyLake, released last year, is a refinement of Broadwell at the same transistor size and is denoted with a v5. Individual product lines within the server category are upgraded at different times. Even though a generation has been released, it may be years before a certain product line begins using that generation, and certain product lines may skip over entire generations. The five current product lines within the server category are Atom, Xeon D, Xeon E3, Xeon E5, and Xeon E7. The Atom line is an ultra-low power line. These aren’t really powerful enough to use in our hypervisors, and the low number of cores would significantly limit the size of virtual machine we could offer. The next line is Xeon D. These are higher wattage and faster than the Atom processors, but still not quite the power we wanted to be able to give our customers. The next line is the E3. The E3 line is the only server based line that has been upgraded to SkyLake. It has plenty of power, but you are limited to a single processor per system and four cores per processor. The E3 line lacks the density that would make it usable. At the time we were designing the new DreamCompute cluster, the E5 was Haswell-based but we knew Broadwell was coming soon. As we can only use what is currently being produced, we only looked at the Haswell line. The E5 line is marketed to data centers. Within the E5 line, you have both single, dual, and quad processor options with many choices within each of those. The E5 line just might work! The E7 line is last line we looked at. The E7 line was, at the time, Ivy Bridge-based, though we knew Haswell was coming soon. The E7 line is focused on density. E7s have both quad and octo processor options with up to 18 cores per processor. They are primarily used in environments where you need a single computer to be able to do a lot of work. That made E7s a possible, but not ideal, fit for DreamCompute as we probably don’t want that much density. Now that we knew what processor lines would work, we needed to consider two more factors. We needed to figure how many processors we wanted in each system and how many cores each processor should have. Originally, processors had a single core, but modern x86-64 processors can have up to 22 cores on a single processor. This is especially useful in a shared resource environment (like DreamCompute) where you don’t want the processes of one user to affect everyone else on that hypervisor. Intel also has a technology called “hyperthreading,” where it presents each core to the operating system twice to allow for more efficient use of each core. You can also put multiple processors in each server. You can have up to eight 18-core processors in a system for a total of 144 cores or 288 threads. Though, as we know from our previous cluster, density isn’t everything. We wanted to be able to balance power and density, and limit the single points of failure. Based on the RAM-to-core ratio we wanted and the maximum density we were willing to have, we decided to test dual and quad processor systems with eight to 14 cores in each system. We tested both the E5 dual and quad processor lines as well as the E7 quad processor line. To pick the processor we wanted to use, we needed to take into consideration a few other factors. But… more on that in another post coming soon!

The fingerprint scanning technology is implemented in Lenovo’s latest Yoga 910 laptop, which is one of those consumer 2-in-1 convertible gizmos with a fold-back screen that lets it be used like a laptop. It relies on some hardware security features implemented in Intel’s 7th-gen Core processors, but also uses biometric fingerprint sensor technology from Synaptics and payment processing from PayPal to deliver a FIDO-compliant solution. The goal, according to Lenovo, is to help reduce online fraud and increase security, while making authentication “nearly frictionless" with biometrics secured by hardware-level protection replacing those so-easily stolen passwords. In actual fact, Intel, Lenovo, PayPal and Synaptics are all members of the FIDO Alliance, the industry body setup several years ago to address the lack of interoperability among authentication devices. While this has enjoyed some take up in the mobile world, the Yoga 910 brings FIDO authentication to PC users for the first time, according to Lenovo. As well as offering greater security than passwords, the technology is also intended to be more convenient. Once the user has registered with a FIDO-compliant website, they no longer need to enter a password to be authenticated, but simply swipe their finger over the built-in sensor and are instantly logged in. And according to the FIDO Alliance, this is just the start of the FIDO effort to bring password-free authentication to PC users, although it remains to be seen whether the standard has any teeth (geddit?) “The W3C is working to make FIDO web APIs a formal web standard, which will bring FIDO authentication to web browsers across all platforms, said a statement on the organization’s website. In addition, Microsoft is said to have made a “strong commitment” to implementing FIDO compatibility with Windows Hello, the biometric security features in Windows 10, and Google has already FIDO-enabled its Chrome browser with support for second factor authentication via its Security Key program. Lenovo’s Yoga 910 was announced at the end of August, and is due for availability in October. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 26 Comments More from The Register Peccant pwners post 670,000 Pokémon punter MD5 passwords Peek-a-boo to fans of Pikachu 23 Comments Epic Games forums breached, salted passwords nabbed Unreal Engine chathaus had unbelievably bad security 12 Comments Microsoft bans common passwords that appear in breach lists Azure Active Directory no longer allows the likes of 'M!cr0$0ft' to gain entry 35 Comments Dropbox: Leaked DB of 68 million account passwords is real Login details are strongly hashed and date back to 2012 28 Comments 98.1 million CLEARTEXT passwords pasted as Rambler.ru rumbled 'Яussian Yahoo!' may just have become world's biggest breach 28 Comments Pwner pwns Pwnedlist pwnage property, pours pwned passwords Site offering checks of your email among mega-breach hauls to close 2 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Judging by the promo video from Intel, the building will also be a horrible nag that micromanages employees’ sleep, work commute, exercise, and even what they have for lunch. It’s a bureaucrat’s dream and a regular human’s nightmare. In classic dystopian surveillance fashion, Intel's future ultra-smart building begins with face recognition. No need for ID badges when the walls know who and where you are at all times. Thousands of sensors scattered throughout the facility will "fit your needs, optimize your day, and ultimately help you live your best life." If you're often tardy for work, the building will nudge you toward carpooling with more punctual coworkers. And at lunchtime, it will let you know when the cafeteria is busiest — because all your colleagues are closely tracked too — and recommend / force you to eat something healthier. Should you find yourself lacking motivation to exercise, the building will also politely remind you to take the stairs now and again. Actually, when you think about it, this isn't too far from the experience of wearing a present-day smartwatch. The only difference with Intel's new Israel campus will be that it's integrated into your surroundings. And probably has a crimson-red all-seeing eye somewhere observing your every step. Update: Since publication of this article, Intel has pulled the amusingly dystopian video of its future office building from both Facebook and YouTube.

Intel Core i7 6800K Benchmarks On Ubuntu + Linux 4.8 Written by Michael Larabel in Processors on 26 September 2016. Page 1 of 6. 18 Comments While the Core i7 6800K has been available for a few months now, there hadn't been any review on it since Intel hadn't sent out any Broadwell-E samples for Linux testing this time around. However, I did end up finally buying a Core i7 6800K now that the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support is finally coming together (at first, Intel PR said it wouldn't even be supported on Linux) so that I can run some benchmarks there plus some other interesting items on the horizon for benchmarking. Here are some benchmarks of the i7-6800K from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Linux 4.8 kernel. The Core i7-6800K is a six-core CPU plus has Hyper Threading to provide 12 logical cores. The i7-6800K has a 3.4GHz base frequency, 3.6GHz turbo frequency, and with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 can hit up to 3.8GHz for a core. The TDP on this higher-end CPU is 140 Watts and supports DDR4-2400/2133MHz memory and is suited for LGA-2011 v3 X99 motherboards. I picked up the Core i7 6800K last week for $430 USD. It's well supported under Linux but with the main limitation being no support for Turbo Boost Max 3.0. Those patches have yet to be merged to the mainline kernel nor is it clear as of writing if that support will be merged for Linux 4.9. Thus for the testing today off the Linux 4.8 kernel it's without the TBM 3.0 support, but in a follow-up article I will be testing this out-of-tree code. I'll also run some other i7-6800K follow-up Linux tests; if any Phoronix Premium readers have any particular test requests, please let me know. For the Core i7 6800K Linux benchmarking I was using the recently-reviewed MSI X99A Workstation motherboard, which I would recommend for Linux/BSD users looking to utilize new v4 Broadwell processors and are looking for a nice motherboard. From this MSI X99 system with 4 x 4GB of RAM, GeForce GTX TITAN X, and OCZ Trion 150 SSD storage was a comparison to the Core i7 5960X, Xeon E5-2609 v4, and Xeon E5-2687W v3 CPUs as my other available LGA-2011 v3 processors. I also tested an AMD FX-8370 for some comparison on the red side. Given the i7-5960X tops out at DDR4-2133, I tested the i7-6800K when running at the common DDR4-2133 speed as well as DDR4-2400MHz using the supported G.SKILL memory. DDR4-2400 is the highest stock rated frequency for this Broadwell-E CPU. All tests for this initial i7-6800K Linux benchmarking was carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the Phoronix Test Suite software. Following these initial LGA-2011 v3 and AMD FX results are the CPU thermal and power consumption data.

By Ian Allison September 26, 2016 15:56 BST R3 CEV logoR3 CEV Financial innovation company R3, Intel and eight R3 consortium member banks have successfully tested a distributed ledger prototype for bond transactions using Intel technology. The trial used US treasury bonds to demonstrate how distributed ledger technology can support trading in real-world financial markets, delivering the necessary scalability and supporting throughput of more than 100,000 transactions per day, said a statement. R3 and its consortium members built and used an implementation of Sawtooth Lake, Intel's proprietary distributed ledger platform, along with Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), a technology that enables developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. The trial was carried out in R3's lab environment, the R3 Lab and Research Centre, which has quickly become a centre of gravity for collaborative research andtesting of distributed and shared-ledger inspired technologies. R3, Intel and each of the banks used physical, non-cloud-based nodes hosted globally across the US, Canada, Asia, Australia and Europe to interact and simulate US treasurytrading on the ledger. The platform featured advanced smart contract functionality, enabling trading, matching and settlement of US treasury bonds on-chain, as well as automated coupon payments and redemption based on network time and third-party data sources. Additional features included an on-chain identity registry to facilitate the permissioning of validators and transactors, and the association of those roles to different organisations. Jerry Bautista, VP of the New Business Group at Intel, said: "We believe collaborative exploration of blockchain usages is key to the development of this emerging technology. We are excited to show how Intel technologies such as Software Guard Extensions can improve the security and scalability of blockchain deployments." Tim Grant, CEO of R3's Lab and Research Centre, said: "Our goal at R3 is to bring our members together with the strongest technology players and work collaboratively to evaluate and accelerate this groundbreaking technology to production using real-world use cases. We are delighted to build on our strong relationship with Intel to demonstrate how distributed and shared ledgers can deliver material efficiencies throughout the full trading lifecycle of an asset." R3 consortium members involved in this project included CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. Intel will be donating the bond-related transaction families (software code written to simulate the behaviour of bonds on an exchange) developed for this project to the Hyperledger Project. It will be running live demos of the platform at the Hyperledger booth (C90) at Sibos this week. R3 and Intel are premier members of the Hyperledger effort, and State Street is a general member.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor AMD’s Zen Processor Might Power Next-Generation Apple MacBook Pro – Custom SOC Design With HBM2 Memory System By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 months ago 95Shares Share Tweet Submit The next generation of Apple MacBook Pro products are rumored to feature an AMD chip inside them. Bits and Chips reports that due to tech stagnation in regards to Intel’s mobility processors, Apple might jump ship over to camp AMD and use their latest Zen based processors to power off the MacBook Pro lineup. Next-Generation Apple MacBook Pro Might Feature a Custom AMD Zen Chip For a long time, Apple MacBook Pro series has been featuring a mix of U and H series processors. Usually, both tiers get their graphics updated with performance enhancements around the same time but with Kaby Lake, the high-performance models might be looking elsewhere for that extra horsepower. The latest Intel mobility processor roadmap shows that after Skylake, Intel would be shifting to a new CPU family known as Kaby Lake. This family will be available in several variants. However, MacBook Pro’s have relied on faster graphics performance and that doesn’t seem to be the case in the upcoming generation of Intel processors. Intel’s 14nm Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake CPU roadmap leaks out. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) The U-series models in this family are going to be available in Q1 2017 with GT3e graphics. The faster H-series processors will rely on a slower GT2 graphics chip. This problem is with GT2 parts as Apple has a major focus on graphics performance from Integrated GPUs. While 13″ models of the MacBook Pro can utilize the U-series chips, the high-performance aimed, 15″ models will not be a major graphics update if Apple decides to go with new Kaby Lake or even the Coffee Lake parts available in mid 2018. The only high-performance variant that Intel has in their H-series line is based on Skylake and has GT4e graphics. This model is fast but comes at a high cost. The GT3e graphics chips are only offered in sub-45W variants with either Kaby Lake or Coffee Lake chips. It’s possible that Intel could offer enough GPU updates with Kaby Lake that it somewhat matches the GT3e tier level performance but there’s another solution. Advertisement AMD’s Custom Zen Based SOC Could Be A Potential Candidate For Apple MacBook Pro AMD is known to offer custom chips based on their latest Zen architecture in 2018. Apple could go that route if Intel is unable to meet their requirements in the graphics department. AMD can exploit this situation and round up a custom Zen based SOC featuring their latest GCN cores and a couple of HBM (cache/system subsystem) for Apple. Recently leaked details show AMD’s next generation APU solutions with power as low as 10W and base models with 35-45W TDP. That matches Intel’s H-series processors in terms of power consumption and added graphics performance from the GCN cores sounds like a potential candidate for the latest MacBook Pro models. Such a custom chip could be a big win for AMD’s custom-SOC division. By 2018, such a chip would be very feasible to produce in terms of cost and volume as FinFET process would have matured enough and HBM2 yields would be ideal to supply to mass market. Of course, we aren’t setting this in stone as if Apple is indeed going to feature a AMD chip inside their next gen laptop solution. But the possibility of it happening is high given the latest Intel roadmap leak. Intel is known for changing roadmaps from time to time so we might just see them slipping in a GT3 graphics chip under the H-series lineup.

Minyanville SP 500 Weekly Earnings Update: Bullish for Next 2 Quarters, Election Notwithstanding By Scutify Sep 26, 2016 7:59 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Let's take a quick look at revisions within the SP 500. fc-eps-estimate-revisions Hopefully this spreadsheet, which has been updated weekly for years, is helpful to readers. Note how just within the last week, 412 of the SP 500 companies have seen their estimates changed/tweaked/adjusted by Street analyst's. The fact that over 80% of the SP 500 saw estimate revisions this past week was surprising, but the takeaway for readers is that Street consensus is CONSTANTLY changing to reflect competitor disclosure, economic data change, and a host of other variables. (Intel's raised guidance could have something to do with this - note with the week of June '14, what Intel's raised guidance did to the percentages). Conclusion: what's unusual about the last 4 weeks data is that normally - within a quiet period of earnings reporting since 499 of the SP 500 have reported their Q2 '16 results - the negative revisions far outweigh the positive revisions, except for this Q3 '16, where the last 4 weeks, positive revisions have improved steadily. Look at the above spreadsheet again and note how positive revisions as a percentage keep ticking higher. This is an important trend change and it's been in evidence for a while (and bears repeating), and speaks to what was written prior to this weekend's posthere and here. So Why the Optimism For the Next 6 Months ? The SP 500 is lapping easier comp's from late 2015: the yuan devaluation in August, 2015, led to a 2-month, sharp correction in August, September, 2015, which then led to a sharp rally starting in early October '15 lasting until late November '15, and then the SP 500 saw a 12% decline from late November '15 through mid-February '16. Commodity returns were at the bottom of the asset-class return table for the last 4 years culminating in the sharp drop in crude and commodity prices in late 2015 (crude oil, gold, silver, copper, grain prices, etc.) which then led to spread-widening in the high yield bond market, which in my opinion is what caused the decline in the SP 500 last December '15 through mid-February '16. The Energy and Basic Material's sector's high yield debt outstanding is far greater as a percentage of the high yield bond market than the stocks are as a percentage of the SP 500. While Energy and Basic Mat stocks comprise roughly 8% - 9% of the SP 500 by market cap, I suspect that the debt outstanding is probably closer to 15% - 20% of the total junk bond market. The point is that even if commodity prices remain stable, there should be year-over-year growth in the next 6 months, for commodities that fell even further after the China devaluation. JP Morgan's Dr. David Kelly made an interesting point this week on one of JP Morgan's occasional economic calls, where David and his team talk about econ data and it's implications for the market. Dr. Kelly noted that inflation could be influenced by the year-over-year change in crude oil in Q1 '16 since crude will be lapping the $28 print it saw in Q1 '15. Basically for the Energy sector, net income was completely wiped out in Q1 '16 given the drop in crude oil in late Q4 '15 and early '16. The typical weak period in terms of SP 500 returns that is typically seen from August 1 through early October every year, never materialized. Per Bespoke, "this is the first year since 2010 where average prices have traded up between Labor Day and 9/22." The cumulative advance / decline (A/D) line made a new bull market high per Bespoke. Here is a chart from Josh Brown's The Reformed Broker as of mid-August '16, highlighting same. Market breadth has been consistently positive through the bull market, thus hitting an all-time high this week is a positive. Where is the Risk ? The election and the possible ascension of Mr. Trump is the Rumsfeld-ian, "Known Unknown". However, In Bespoke's Weekly Report that comes out every Friday afternoon and remains a wonderful source of great information on the broad asset classes that comprise the investable market, Bespoke notes that "the betting markets are still heavily favoring Clinton by 2 - 1 margin." Bespoke also noted that Clinton's lead over Trump today is almost identical to Obama's lead over Romney at this time in 2012. Monday night's first debate could be a pivotal event. (Please, the above is not a political statement in the least. As an advisor, my job is to assess portfolio risk and market risk for clients, and to try and discern if the US capital markets are more comfortable with one candidate over the other.) Jeff Miller's weekly "Weighing the Week Ahead" gives some excellent thoughts on the election cycle. It will be interesting to see how polling results change (if they change at all on Tuesday and next week) and how the market responds, if it does at all. --------------------------- Thomson Reuters SP 500 earnings Data (by the numbers): 499 of the SP 500 have reported their Q2 '16 results Forward 4-quarter estimate: $125.13 versus last week's $125.54 P.E ratio: 17.3(x) PEG ratio: 8.5(x) SP 500 earnings yield: 5.78% down from last week's 5.87% Year-over-year change in forward 4-quarter estimate: +2.03% vs last week's +2.08%. Conclusion: Sentiment data - at least AAII (American Association of Individual Investor) data - continues to indicate a lack of real optimism and even downright pessimism towards expected, future, stock returns, which in and of itself, should be good reason to be long or overweight the SP 500 within balanced portfolios. Per AAII directly, bullish sentiment has been below it's historical long-term average of 38.5% for 79 of 81 weeks. I'm expecting the next 6 months - from October through early April '17 to be pretty decent for the SP 500. Technology should be the clear sector winner although it is now overbought. For readers, be prepared - risk comes on quickly. This article was written by Brian Gilmartin for Trinity Asset Management on Sep 25, 2016.

Home Technology Health Environment Design People Social Awareness Breaking News Contact Us About Us NoCamels Israeli Innovation News Aiming High: Intel Israel Creates ‘World’s Smartest Office Building’ Design News ,Technology News Einat Paz-Frankel, NoCamels | Sep, 26 2016 Intel Israel broke ground yesterday on what it claims will be the world’s smartest building. Being constructed in Petach Tikva, Israel, this 34,000-square-meter research and development center will join half a dozen Intel locations in Israel, including two manufacturing facilities. Thousands of smart sensors scattered around the building will use cutting-edge information technologies to gather relevant data and provide what employees need in order to do their work. “The smart building will make the work environment work for you,” says Kobi Bor, Intel Israel’s smart campus project manager. According to Intel, this energy-saving building, which will be home to some 2,500 employees, will recognize employees’ faces, so they won’t need a badge; turn the lights on and off; offer carpools to employees based on estimated arrival times to the office; and even direct employees to vacant parking spots. SEE ALSO: Report: Apple Israel Could Be Behind Company’s Smart Home Breakthrough If you’re having a meeting, the smart building will turn on the lights for you, set the temperature, the computer and the projector, and even upload the relevant files for you. It can help you navigate the campus, and even tell you when you can squeeze a haircut into your schedule! SEE ALSO: Why The World’s Largest Tech Companies All Want A Piece Of The Israeli Pie Hungry? The smart building will tell you how long the line is at the cafeteria and, if it’s packed, will provide more convenient lunch times. It can even tell you the nutritional value of the dishes served and what the most popular dish of the day is. Intel stresses that its smart building will only learn the habits of employees who choose to share their information, and will adjust its recommendations accordingly. The employees who choose to opt in will enjoy a unique mobile app that will cater to their needs, including ordering the cup of coffee they like in the morning. The new building, which is expected to be completed in 2019, will be LEED-certified (a green building certification), with emphasis on energy conservation and water recycling. “Building this new campus highlights the importance of our presence in Israel, and reflects our values of innovation, technology and green building,” Intel Israel CEO Maxine Fassberg said in a statement. Her statement comes on the heels of a reorganization that led to the furlough of hundreds of Intel Israel employees, and thousands in other Intel locations around the world. 10,000 employees in the Holy Land  With roughly 10,000 employees in Israel, Intel is the largest multinational high-tech company in the country. It has four development centers in Haifa, Yakum, Petach Tikva and Jerusalem, as well as manufacturing facilities in Kiryat Gat and Jerusalem. Recent statistics show that Intel exports account for roughly 9 percent of the total goods exported from Israel. Intel picked Israel for its first R&D center outside the US 40 years ago. Since the chipmaker set up shop in Israel, it has developed a series of breakthrough computer processors and has evolved beyond hardware. Photos and video: Courtesy Facebook Comments

Judging by the promo video from Intel, the building will also be a horrible nag that micromanages employees’ sleep, work commute, exercise, and even what they have for lunch. It’s a bureaucrat’s dream and a regular human’s nightmare. In classic dystopian surveillance fashion, Intel's future ultra-smart building begins with face recognition. No need for ID badges when the walls know who and where you are at all times. Thousands of sensors scattered throughout the facility will "fit your needs, optimize your day, and ultimately help you live your best life." If you're often tardy for work, the building will nudge you toward carpooling with more punctual coworkers. And at lunchtime, it will let you know when the cafeteria is busiest — because all your colleagues are closely tracked too — and recommend / force you to eat something healthier. Should you find yourself lacking motivation to exercise, the building will also politely remind you to take the stairs now and again. Actually, when you think about it, this isn't too far from the experience of wearing a present-day smartwatch. The only difference with Intel's new Israel campus will be that it's integrated into your surroundings. And probably has a crimson-red all-seeing eye somewhere observing your every step. Update: Since publication of this article, Intel has pulled the amusingly dystopian video of its future office building from both Facebook and YouTube.

Initially rejected by EA, the publisher eventually relented and a gem was born in Mirror's Edge, albeit one that was too innovative and unique for most to appreciate. Since then, there's been a struggle regarding which direction a sequel should take, but the pieces eventually came together to form Mirror's Edge Catalyst, a semi-open world game with messenger missions and traditional cut scenes (as opposed to the animated ones seen in the previous title).     On the technical side, the game is pretty well optimized, as is always the case with DICE games. But whether you're on a low-end laptop or just looking to get things running butter smooth on your mid-range rig, this guide will help you get the best balance between image quality and performance.     Test Setup and System Requirements     Our Test System   OS: Windows 10 64-bit Processor: Intel Core i5 3570K 3.4GHz (Stock) Memory: Corsair XMS3 8GB DDR3-1600 (Stock) Storage: Crucial BX200 2.5'' 480GB 6GB/s SSD Video Card: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290X 4GB (Stock) Driver: Radeon Software Version 16.9.1 Resolution: 1920x1080 Input: Logitech G400 mouse, Hermes RGB mechanical keyboard     System Requirements   Minimum:   OS: Windows® 7 64-Bit Processor: Intel i3-3250 / AMD FX-6350 Memory: 6 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 650 Ti 2GB or better / AMD Radeon™ R9 270x or better Storage: 25 GB available space   Recommended:   OS: Windows® 10 64-Bit Processor: Intel Core i7-3770 at 3.4GHz / AMD FX-8350 at 4.0GHz Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 970 4GB or better / AMD Radeon™ R9 280x 3GB or better Storage: 25 GB available space Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find Mirror's Edge Catalyst for sale below.

The SPARC S7 is closely related to the SPARC M7, unveiled in October 2015. Both are used within Oracle’s engineered systems and RISC servers, which power Oracle Cloud and many other clouds. In this Profit interview, John Fowler, executive vice president of systems at Oracle, explains how the SPARC S7 brings new levels of performance, efficiency, and security to the cloud. Profit: How is Oracle’s new SPARC S7 different from the SPARC M7? Fowler: The SPARC M7 had breakthrough technology. What we were trying to do was really improve security with Silicon Secured Memory and encryption, and greatly improve the efficiency of analytics applications by putting some logic in the processor design that helped with analyzing and scanning data. We think that’s really the next 10 years of processor evolution. It’s not just cores and performance, but putting in more specific features to help software. What we decided to do in the SPARC S7 is take those same core technologies and bring them to horizontal scale and highly scale-out price points. Profit: Why does Oracle, a cloud company, continue to invest in creating the world’s most advanced microprocessors? Fowler: We are working to build the world’s best infrastructure for customers, and we want them to be able to use x86 and also RISC microprocessors. In the case of SPARC, we’re able to put in unique features based on our understanding of software. So for example, we’ve incorporated security features and integrated data-analytics acceleration. Profit: Why and how does Oracle remain such a good partner with Intel? Fowler: We partner with Intel to make all of our software work and build a full family of hardware products around Intel. It’s not either/or. It’s really an and strategy. x86 and SPARC give customers choice. Profit: At the SPARC S7 launch, you emphasized three themes: security, efficiency, and simplicity. Why those three things? Fowler: Cloud computing exacerbates many of the technical challenges people have in enterprise computing. By its very nature, you’re sharing resources, so security becomes even more important. The second thing is, since you’re sharing resources and infrastructure, you want to be as efficient as possible because that’s a basic cost equation. And finally, what people expect of the cloud is the ability to rapidly provision new services and go compete by moving quickly. Profit: How do the new SPARC processors make these environments more secure? We are working to build the world’s best infrastructure for customers, and we want them to be able to use x86 and also RISC microprocessors. John Fowler, Executive Vice President, Systems, Oracle Fowler: We built in a very wide capability of encryption of the chip, but more importantly, we built in dedicated processor resources to handle encryption. What this means is your application can run at virtually the same performance encrypted as unencrypted. The second big area we worked on was protecting memory. Since an application can access any memory it’s entitled to, we added a technical capability so an application can’t do that unless it has a matching key for all types of memory. Profit: What are the benefits of using the new SPARC processors in Oracle’s own cloud environment? Fowler: We deploy both x86 and SPARC in our cloud. Customers can choose to use SPARC, and what they gain are advanced security—the encryption and memory protection—as well as very high performance and efficiency per core. Profit: Oracle also recently released a SPARC-based Oracle Compute Cloud service. How is it different from other cloud infrastructure services? Fowler: It’s different because it offers SPARC. From Oracle, you can get both x86 and SPARC infrastructure as a service. They’re priced identically. We expect to see customers that are interested in higher levels of mission-critical security or doing data-analytics type applications, because that is where SPARC is differentiated. Profit: What is the Data Analytics Accelerator in SPARC processors? Fowler: The Data Analytics Accelerator is able to scan very large amounts of data for strings and filter and decompress data from memory, and it does it at an enormous rate. The software support for this is integrated into Oracle Database 12c today. We’ve opened up the programming interface and created a developer community around this. Profit: What about the need for interoperability between on-premises and public clouds? Fowler: We believe the next decade is about enterprises making choices between using cloud services, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and on-premises computing. We’ve linked the management tools and the provisioning tools so that if you want to straddle these worlds—move workloads back and forth—you can.

Several tech vendors are partnering with three automakers to create an association that is aimed at accelerating the development of 5G technologies for self-driving cars. The companies on Sept. 27 announced the 5G Automotive Association, which will work to develop, test and promote technologies that will form the basis of the next-generation infrastructure that will be needed to make autonomous vehicles a reality. Networking vendors Ericsson, Huawei Technologies and Nokia and chip makers Intel and Qualcomm are being joined by automakers Audi, BMW and Daimler in the initiative, which officials with the companies said is an example of the need for partnerships to speed the development of the necessary technologies. "The success of 5G is dependent on cross-industry work in new ecosystems to digitalize industries," Ericsson CTO Ulf Ewaldsson said in a statement. "With the creation of this association, we will leverage our latest technology, 5G, and work closely together with the car industry to jointly develop solutions as well as provide input to regulation, certification and standardization." Li Yintao, president of Huawei's 2012 Labs, said in a statement that the association "demonstrates the clear need for a cross-sector collaboration between the mobile industry and car industry for joint innovation, and to establish a platform to align on timeline and priorities and solution roadmaps." The group will be able to drive everything from worldwide regulations and certification to standardization efforts for autonomous cars and 5G technologies, he said. The burgeoning self-driving car market is getting a lot of attention from many corners. Tech vendors and component makers are rapidly building up their portfolios of products aimed at the space, and companies from Google and to Uber are running tests with such vehicles. Car manufacturers are teaming with tech companies—as illustrated by the partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye to get autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021—to drive their efforts. In addition, governments also are pushing efforts. The Obama administration in January unveiled plans to spend almost $4 billion over 10 years to fund pilot projects in hopes of accelerating autonomous car efforts in the United States. 5G is seen as a key enabling technology. Though standards for the next-generation connectivity technology aren't expected to be finalized until 2020, tech companies are rolling out pre-standard 5G technologies and products. 5G promises data transfer speeds that will be 10 to 100 times faster than current 4G LTE, as well as significantly lower latency and the ability to support many more devices and systems. All this will be important for the car-to-car and car-to-cloud communications (or V2X—vehicle-to-everything) that will be crucial in enabling vehicles to operate without human intervention. The vehicles will need to communicate with each other as well as other intelligent environments—such as smart cities—to navigate from one point to another and to avoid obstacles from other cars to pedestrians. "We expect 5G to become the worldwide dominating mobile communications standard of the next decade," Christoph Grote, senior vice president of electronics for BMW, said in a statement. "For the automotive industry it is essential that 5G fulfills the challenges of the era of digitalization and autonomous driving." The new association will address technical and regulatory issues, and will look at such tasks as defining and meshing use cases, technical requirements and implementation strategies as well as giving support to standardization and regulatory groups, officials said. Members also will address a range of V2X technologies, from wireless connectivity to security, privacy and distributed cloud architectures. They also will jointly run development projects that lead to the creation of integrated offerings, interoperability testing, and large-scale pilots and trials. Group members said the association is open to other companies joining.           LATEST NETWORKING ARTICLES   Cisco Posts Modestly Good Quarter, but Outlook is Soft Nutanix Brings Networking Into Its Enterprise Cloud Platform Cypress Adds Connectivity Option to WICED IoT Platform BT, CA Make Deeper Pushes Into Growing SD-WAN Space Cisco Brings Flexible Payments, App Site to Spark Collaboration Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Promontory, my dear Watson Microsoft boasts its cloudy Hadoop big data mill's faster than yours Amazon: Students, we'll give you $2.5m for a chat-up, AI? Microsoft’s self-installing Windows 10 operating system has reached the 400 million mark, the firm announced at its Ignite conference in Atlanta this week, up from the previous high of 350 million in August. This adoption rate means the firm’s self-imposed target of a billion devices by mid-2018 looks increasingly unlikely, but the Redmond giant can take some consolation in the fact that business enthusiasm seems to be growing. The latest version of Windows hit its one-year anniversary on July 29, a date that also marked the ending of the free upgrade offer period for users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. As El Reg pointed out at the time, this meant that Microsoft now faces the challenge of trying to get people to pay for Windows 10, which is tough if users weren’t convinced enough of its merits to upgrade for free already. Nevertheless, 350 million devices in one year is better than where previous versions of Windows were at the same point in their lifecycle, helped no doubt by Microsoft’s helpful approach of automatically downloading it and upgrading your PC without you having to bother doing this yourself. But there are signs that businesses and professional users at least are keen on Windows 10, with European IT market research outfit Context reporting that Windows 10 Pro adoption is on the rise. Context said that Windows 10 Pro accounted for a quarter (24 percent) of Windows Business PCs sold through distributors in Western Europe during August, up from 18 percent in July and 16 percent in June. However, this means that Windows 7 still remains the business platform of choice, and August’s figures from NetMarketShare show that Windows 7 is still the largest operating system in use overall, accounting for just over 47 percent of computers accessing the web. But the researchers expect that European business spending on Windows 10 could pick up even further towards the end of this year, helping to drive “a modest improvement” in overall PC sales for the second half of 2016, compared to that seen in the first half of the year. Windows 10 Pro is a step up from the basic Windows 10 Home that many consumer PCs ship with, and includes key added capabilities such as the ability to be joined to a corporate Active Directory Windows domain. However, Redmond cheesed off many business users earlier this year when it retroactively removed from Windows 10 Pro a feature that enabled admins to restrict access to the Windows Store, and thus control what apps users can install. The move was portrayed by many as an attempt to upsell businesses to the Windows 10 Enterprise edition, which is only available through volume licensing deals. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 115 Comments More from The Register Microsoft Azure sets up shop in France Bonjour, mes fluffy white amis 22 Comments What strange madness is this?

Consider Intel Corporation (INTC), a firm in the Semiconductor General industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat. This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, INTC has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations. Intel’s Earnings in Focus: A Recent Surprise for Investors Two quarters ago, INTC expected to post earnings of 49 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 54 cents per share, a beat of 10.2%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver earnings of 53 cents per share, when it actually reported earnings of 59 cents per share instead, representing a 11.3% positive surprise. Intel Price and EPS Surprise Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation Quote Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Intel. 7 High-Dividend Stocks to Buy ASAP In fact, the Earnings ESP for INTC is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat. After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for INTC, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.82%, so another beat could be around the corner. This is particularly true when you consider that INTC has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that INTC could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.

Ageing fans of 1980s home computer games will soon be able to get their hands on Sir Clive Sinclair’s rebooted ZX Spectrum device, which is now set to be launched in October and available just in time for Christmas. The eagerly awaited Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega+, which was bankrolled via crowdfunding site Indiegogo, is to get an official launch on October 20th, as detailed in an official release from Sir Clive’s Retro Computers outfit. Andy Maddock, chief executive of SMS Electronics, the firm manufacturing the Vega+, enthused that “we are excited that the project is going ahead and will soon be in volume manufacture.” The firm said that the device will be available in “selected online retail sites in time for Christmas 2016.” The Vega+ takes the form of a hand-held games console with a colour LCD screen so it can be used anywhere, but can be connected to a TV for home use, just like its predecessor. It is claimed to be compatible with “every Spectrum game that exists,” and will ship with 1,000 licensed games pre-installed. Official pricing for the Vega+ has yet to be disclosed, but Retro Computers said that it isn’t too late for eager contributors to pledge on Indiegogo to secure a classic black Vega+ while the crowdfunding campaign is in the InDemand phase. Earlier limited edition versions in red, white or blue are no longer available. The hardware and software for the Vega+ have been designed and developed by a team of techies led by a former ZX Spectrum games developer. The team has focused on delivering maximum compatibility with previous generations of the Speccy. However, it is based on modern hardware, and includes features such as support for micro SD cards to enable preferences, and game-saves to be stored for later recall, as well as future firmware upgrades to be delivered. It also features switchable Kempston or cursor key joystick emulation, plus access to programming mode via the familiar BASIC commands. Here at The Reg, we’re hoping that the ZX Spectrum Vega+ lives up to its promise, as we are looking forward to picking up where we left off with Manic Miner and other 80s classics like Elite and Chuckie Egg. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 41 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

News & Analysis Baidu Releases AI Benchmark Intel, Nvidia post results training neural nets Rick Merritt 9/26/2016 04:30 PM EDT 2 comments Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Calling for 100x faster processors, China Web giant Baidu released DeepBench, an open source benchmark for how fast processors train neural networks for machine learning. DeepBench is available online along with first results from Intel and Nvidia processors running it. The benchmark tests low-level operations such as matrix multiplication, convolutions, handing recurrent layers and the time it takes for data to be shared with all processors in a cluster. Machine learning has emerged as a critical workload for Web giants such as Baidu, Google, Facebook and others. The workloads come in many flavors serving applications such as speech, object and video recognition and automatic language translation. Today the job of training machine learning models “is limited by compute, if we had faster processors we’d run bigger models…in practice we train on a reasonable subset of data that can finish in a matter of months,” said Greg Diamos, a senior researcher at Baidu’s Silicon Valley AI Lab. The lab has found, for example, it can reduce by 40% errors in automatic language translation for every order-of-magnitude performance improvement in computing. “We could use improvements of several orders of magnitude--100x or greater,” said Diamos. No striking results emerged from initial tests on NVidia TitanX, TitanX Pascal and M40 GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi processors, according to the Baidu researchers. “Even for the same type of operations like matrix multiplies, depending on the sizes of the models and the ways they are used, performance varies even on the same processor,” said Diamos. “We aren’t as concerned about minor differences between these processors--we want both to be 10 times faster,” he said. Nevertheless, one executive took occasion to claim bragging rights. Baidus DeepBench results clearly highlight Pascal as the performance leader across all deep learning workloads, said Ian Buck, vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia. When full applications are benchmarked, such as Caffe AlexNet or Caffe VGG-19, our internal testing shows Pascal is up to 6x faster than [Intel's] Knights Landing, he added. The Baidu researchers also hope other processor vendors and data center operators contribute to expanding and running chips on the benchmark. “I’d be personally interested in results on AMD GPUs and ASICs from startups with custom hardware for whom it may be difficult to run full models -- this might be an easier way to for them to get their capabilities out there,” Diamos said, noting the lab currently uses systems with eight Nvidia TitanX processors to run its speech recognition models. DeepBench tests low-level hardware libraries, not higher level AI frameworks the data centers create such as Baidu’s PaddlePaddle and Google’s TensorFlow. “At the framework level, there’s a huge amount of difference in the models, and different models for different apps, but below the frameworks they use a few common operations,” said Sharan Narang a software engineer in Baidu’s AI lab. “The hope is we can find the core common operations that are more actionable for hardware makers,” he said. The researchers are considering whether they need a benchmark for inferencing, the separate job of using the models to find patterns in data. Today Baidu and Microsoft use FPGAs on servers to accelerate that less compute-intensive work. Whether competing data center operators collaborate on DeepBench remains to be seen. To date, Google has made its TensorFlow framework open source and created an ASIC to accelerate inferencing jobs on its servers. For its part, Facebook released an open source server using multiple Nvidia GPUs for training neural networks. A handful of startups are working on processors optimized for training neural networks including Wave Computing which presents its work at an event this week and Nervana which Intel recently acquired. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Google Designing AI Processors Facebook Preps Open GPU Server Intel to Acquire Deep Learning Nervana AI Drives Startup to Map Deep Learning Computer Email This Print Comment More Related Links Intels Nervana Attacks GPUs Virtual Reality Will Stay Hot Samsung Makes 10nm Qcomm SoC Taming erratic cellular latency with "extreme asynchronous" IoT firmware design Electronica Settles into Automotive, Industrial, IoT Roles Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Rookie Need more than benchmarks WaveJin   9/27/2016 5:04:54 PM Login to Rate Great article Rick. At Wave we welcome the goals of DeepBench. Although in its current form, it is useful mainly for comparing GPUs and CPUs, we are looking forward to contributing to this effort to enable fair comparison of non-GPU architectures. More fundamental to Baidu's goal of achieving 100x improvement in compute power, we believe this can only be met through discontinuous versus continuous innovation. If we only focus on incremental improvements of low-level operations such as matrix multiplications or convolutions, we will miss out on opportunities for key innovations. Wave's CTO, Dr. Chris Nicol, recently wrote an interesting blog about the need for discontinuous innovation in computing architectures to achieve real and game-changing improvements in computing systems for deep learning rather than being constrained by certain types of benchmarks and associated designs. http://wavecomp.com/blog/benchmarks-can-either-encourage-or-constrain-innovation While the initial work on DeepBench is very useful, it needs to be complemented with the willingness to think out-of-the-box and innovate at all levels to meet the 100x challenge posed by Baidu. Thank you again for a really insightful article and we are looking forward to continuing discussions on this topic.

The platform featured advanced smart contract technology that enabled trading, matching, and settlement of U.S. Treasury bonds, as well as automated coupon payments and redemption, R3 said in a statement. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin, enabling data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its perceived usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. "Our goal at R3 is to bring our members together with the strongest technology players and work collaboratively to evaluate and accelerate this technology to production using real-world use cases," said Tim Grant, chief executive officer of R3's Lab and Research Center. R3 is leading a consortium of more than 60 of the world's largest financial institutions created to develop commercial applications of blockchain technology for the financial services industry. The R3 consortium members involved in U.S. Treasury debt project included CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. The blockchain trial was undertaken at R3's Lab and Research Center. R3, Intel and each of the banks used physical, "non-cloud-based nodes" hosted across the U.S., Canada, Asia, Australia and Europe to interact and simulate U.S. Treasury trading on the blockchain.

For the rest of us, we are under constant surveillance, to the point where Homeland Security will fly a whole team into Detroit airport for what they thought was going to be a treasure trove of Intel, via their five-hour grilling of Gordon Duff. All they got is the opportunity to go through all of his German vacation photos and videos, hundreds of them, all time- and date-stamped, which prove he was not training IS snipers in Syria or Afghanistan. And of course, the taxpayers footed the labor bill on this fiasco. Boko Haram is miraculously able to secure the use of satellite phones — very hard to get without major ID and a traceable payment schedule — normally leaving behind a bread crumb trail that should have drones raining down on them, to the extent that getting a satellite phone would technically be deemed a form of suicide. Yet, VT does not find anyone in Intelligence, investigative media, or politics who is the slightest bit curious about such anomalies, despite their being the flashing neon light kind. When we query professionals about this, we can tell with rare exceptions that the issue has never entered their minds before. It’s like they have a DNA-activated “no go” survival instinct that renders them dumb, blind and stupid, whenever it’s in their best interest. This orchestrated failure of not asking the right questions is carved in stone in the history of the War of Terror; and what a hoax it has been, as to who has primarily been running it and why. Gordon will tell you the rest, in his own special way, his good deed for the day… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ This is the result of Western-backed “Jihadi adventure tourism” – First published … September 26, 2016 – The game is called chaos theory. The goal is destabilization, putting the world “in play.” The tool is sexual frustration driven by cultural bias and economic hardship, put in play by the CIA to move literal armies of young Islamic males around the world. Executed Syrian soldiers Those not being sent as jihadists for ISIS or the oft rebranded “moderate” mercenary surrogate armies, now flood the cities of the world where carefully orchestrated press, staged incidents, false flag terrorism and a very real social disaster is radicalizing fearful Americans and Europeans, driving them to political suicide. None of this is an accident. To the CIA and other agencies that are run by social scientists with excessive moral flexibility, all conflict is good, an agent for change and all change can be controlled, directed and managed. Agents of change are typically terrorism, political strife, poverty and, less well known, sex. You see, the current agent of chaos, the one dominating the world scene is testosterone, the drive for “coupling” by the endless population of young males willing to uproot themselves from hopeless lives and go wherever they are directed for whatever task is put in front of them. All that is required is the promise of sex and maybe hope for a life of some kind even if the work is tyranny and beheadings. The author of these migrations, mostly Islamic males, is the CIA, MI6 and the Mossad along with France’s DGSE. Intelligence agencies are agents of change “on the cheap” and operate best when governments fall, when alliances crumble and when social unrest festers and erupts into open conflict. Here, the “masters of the universe,” the Washington and Tel Aviv think tanks, the self-proclaimed geniuses of Whitehall, themselves no more than jackals serving an unseen master, manipulate the world with Twitter and Facebook. There is a wonderful efficiency to social media, anonymous, deniable, cheap and dirty, oh so very dirty. In America, it is done from Ft. Huachuca, Arizona, the US Army Intelligence School. There every Arabic dialect is known, every social network penetrated, the word is put out: “German women are all whores, you can simply rip their clothing off and have your way with them. German authorities are cowards, the German people weak and best of all, the German government will pay you to live like a king and you never have to work.” The Israelis, working closely with their Saudi and Turkish friends from centers staffed with unemployed housewives, have their own version, one that plays well from the Philippines to Africa’s Sahel, one that has brought a hundred thousand or more from obscure villages to the battlefronts of the Middle East: “Come to Syria and Iraq, join ISIS. Travel across the world, from airport to airport, no visa, no tickets, you will move across the world like magic, to a world where all is yours, any woman you want, any boy, protected by the US Air Force, paid by Saudi Arabia, rape, murder and steal and when you are done, you can live in Paris or Frankfurt or Stockholm.” And they do move as though by magic, some 8000 miles or more, through the most secure airports of the world, across impenetrable borders, fed, clothed and protected, paid, armed and furnished with wives from among the tens of thousands of sex slaves who live in agony and thrall to the CIA and her sister terror groups who, as more and more accept, are ISIS and every other terror group on the planet. They are called “Non-State Actors,” typically armed (ANSA) and are cataloged by Geneva Call, a Swiss group that lives in heady denial of the reality of our time, that ANSA’s are surrogate armies that act as agents for destabilization on behalf of world organized crime, also known as the “global economy.” What we are addressing today is the sexual component of “war on the cheap” and how human biology makes this all so easy. It is no secret that young men are vulnerable to bad decision making. In males, or so we are told by social scientists, the cerebral cortex doesn’t develop properly until well into the 30s. When you add to this certain tenets of Islam, the seemingly overt demonization of sexuality outside marriage and the many controversial interpretations of the Koran that allow rape, then you have created a powerful message. Further exacerbating the issue is the high birthrate, always inside legal marriage mind you unlike in the West, that Islamic countries enjoy, that and the crumbling economies. Place this is a social subtext of sex within marriage only when the population is entirely Islamic, as is so often the case, and little hope of achieving the required economic status that would allow sex within marriage and a certain desperation ensues. Place a few I-Phones around, load up social media with tales of sex parties in Manjib and Mosul, of fat Saudi paychecks sent home to needy families, of heroic war against the West and recruiting jihadists is an ease. Little do they know they are working for Israel or Washington or London or Paris, as they are all the same anyway. Behind this put a supporting mechanism that controls the world’s airports through companies like Israel’s ICTS and the global terror databases that seem to allow only terrorists to travel without being questioned, and it all comes together. Aiding it all is the United Nations and an endless number of Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide training, transportation, medical care, food and, of course, the finest high technology weapons possible, the best missiles, sniper rifles, satellite intelligence, F16s flying air cover and Western diplomats providing needed subterfuge. There would be no terrorism, no “war on the cheap” without phony charities, and most charities are just that. Google Idea Groups Then you have the world press, the Reuters news agency, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, BBC and Guardian, all secretly bought by drug profits from Afghanistan, fed by CIA contracting companies like Booz Allen Hamilton and Google Idea Groups, and it all starts to come together. It isn’t just Syria and Iraq, not just Africa. The refugee crisis in Europe, the crisis that has already destroyed Europe as more and more admit each day, is just another stage. In the US, the current election process, a purely theatrical expression with no democratic aspects whatsoever, now is heavily backdropped with “Islamization” scare tactics. Each day every American receives emails linking to YouTube videos showing gang rapes across Europe and promising that this will come to America unless the right candidate is supported. The emails all trace down to Washington think tanks closely aligned with the Israel lobby of course, but few look and fewer care. Who are the victims? Who are the winners? Add to this an endless stream of carefully staged events, shopping center knifings, school shootings, car bombings, too many to be believable, often with perpetrators whose history leads back to intelligence agency contacts or suspicious psychiatric treatments, but this is another subject for another time. Can you hire an army with a handful of “tweets?” Sure you can. Can you uproot millions with the promise of sex? We’ve seen it done? Is it all part of a plan? We know it is.

A few cultural/historical observations, (1) This is nothing new, historically speaking. At the battle of Uhud, fought between the polytheist Meccans and the Muslim Medinans, Abu Sufyan, the commander of the Meccans, brought some of the finest young ladies from Mecca. They were singing, dancing, and taunting the Meccan soldiers, so as to inspire them to combat and violence; who would want (especially in the world of 1400 years ago) to pass up the opportunity to bed one of Mecca’s most attractive women after battle?? Sociologists have also pointed out that the early Jamestown colony was one of the most violent societies in history, with constant duels and fights. The reason: the strenuous early colonial lifestyle was mostly suited to men. Only the richest could afford to bring their wives from the homeland. The rest were a bunch of single males, too much testosterone. Log in to Reply FrigidInferno  September 27, 2016 at 12:06 pm (2) I always had a (very mistaken) impression that Islam was sexually repressive (though some modern variants certainly are!). In the purview of its original context, Islam’s attitude toward sex was relatively liberal. While Muhammad (pbuh) warned of the sins and pitfalls of sex, he also proclaimed its blessing when done correctly (i.e. in marriage, with the perspective/attitude of serving the OTHER person). He encouraged people to marry early, encouraged people to be open to having sex (again in the “right”, Islamic way), and even expounded the detrimental impacts of abstinence on those who were not married. And for Shias, Islam even sanctioned a form of temporary marriage. Done properly, maturely, and sincerely, it’s a classical, Islamic parallel to the concept of “boyfriend”/”girlfriend.” It’s mind-numbing how this early, advanced understanding has been lost to a large degree in the modern Muslim world. FrigidInferno  September 27, 2016 at 12:06 pm (3) Sex isn’t just being used in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia to engineer hordes of sexually frustrated jihadis. Sex is also a driving factor in the control of the West. So many of the trends and fashions that are pushed on the public, generation after generation, are driven through by sexual frustration/repression/anticipation. Many people adopt their identity, lifestyle, and image wanting to feel connected with the masses, and this is, I believe, subconsciously (or even consciously) driven by sexual desires, sexual frustrations, and sexual programming via the media. Isn’t it amazing how so much human dysfunctionality is being driven by sex? Nasir  September 27, 2016 at 9:58 am Gordon, about you travel problems. This is the second time I reading about your personal problems. As a grown man who does not tow the party line, you should expect it an take it as a compliment. Why do you whine about your own personal problems? Do you think others get a break? That is quite a bit of whining from person who should know better. Sincerely, Nasir Log in to Reply Nasir  September 27, 2016 at 9:46 am A side bar: Commenters in the Facebook section; Some of you claim to divine Gordon’s intent from his ramblings; so you being prescient and all, answer this: Would not you agree that the reason rape is so rampant in India (pop. 1.3 Billion), is due to pron watching and perception of western women as portrayed by west itself, not because Indian men don’t any–they seem to be getting it quite a bit, look at the population? Or would you say that women are asking for it? does it have to do anything with religion? What kind of numbskulls are reading VT these days, there used to be pretty sane people around. Perhaps my friend Jonas can explain this, after all this is a social and cultural issue. Log in to Reply Nasir  September 27, 2016 at 9:36 am Gordon, with all due respect, please stop writing. If you need to share something with people just talk, or talk to someone who can then write it down for you. I have no idea what is the relationship of sex and Intelligence agencies. Are you saying that young men don’t get to tap any? If they don’t, how do you explain the population explosion in the Muslim world? Someone is definitely having sex and having babies, and I am not sure it is your local fertilization doctor. How do you reconcile it? Now if you are saying that they hunger for extreme depravity,as shown by our western porn, which at the minimum involves oral, vaginal, and anal sex: you might be on to something. Probably they don’t get to hammer throats and double penetrate. But is that normal? You and I both know that this demand was created by our porn industry, just like McDonald’s heart attack giving hamburgers. You can not blame young people outside the west for thinking that all white women like this type of treatment and are fond of being humiliated. This is the only thing they have ever seen, thanks to our porn industry and our Hollywood: we have marketed our women like a piece of meat just like those hamburger patties. Sincerely, Nasir Log in to Reply the truth please  September 27, 2016 at 7:25 am I now know what NGO stands for, Non Governmental Organization , we live and learn. Log in to Reply the truth please  September 27, 2016 at 3:09 am Excellent article Mr Duff, but I need to ask a few question so please excuse my ignorance. Could you please tell me what “ET“ NGO stands for ? because when I first saw `ET` my mind went to Extraterrestrial like it would with most people but I`m stuck on `NGO`. Also I find it interesting that you emphasized those abbreviations at the beginning of your article as though you want us to get something into our heads without actually saying it. This brings me to a radio interview you did sometime back where you indicated that there was a group on this world looking for land areas on Earth to house an incoming Extraterrestrial Alien race and one of those countries was Africa. Since that interview all hell has broken loose in Africa and the East, so I ask is it all connected ? is this terraforming ? total disruption and destruction to make room for this nomadic race of Aliens, or have I got it all wrong, I apologize for my ignorance if I have.

I have suspected this for a long time. But good luck convincing the mainstream of this. I have been dropped like a hot potato by several “friends” for saying things far milder.

Being flown around the world, given a little cash, and sex of your choice. Sounds better than the $96 per month, and the $26, or $27 (bonus bucks) combat pay given to me in ’68. Only to come home after 13 months to find I couldn’t get laid unless I had a fist full of $20s. About a week before my discharge date in ’69, I was offered the prize. $3,000, and choice of duty station. All I had to do was re up, visit ft. Benning’s famous jump school, train to be a door gunner, and 1 more tour in country, and after that the world was mine. Of course I turned it down. Gordon, the odd thing about this is, to this day, at times I feel guilt for refusing. What’s that about? Brainwashing? Remember back in the day, every assignment had a “life expectancy”? 15 minutes is my recollection. It wasn’t openly talked about, more like whispered, voices from the grave. I picture the mercs, who make up ISIL, and others, as poor, few options for a decent life. Young, dumb, and full of …..! How did the song go? “….the new boss, same as the old boss….we won’t get fooled again….” Right?

Just trust us, says Microsoft executive Microsoft releases Server 2016, complete with commercial Docker engine Microsoft inserts 'new kind of computer ... into our cloud' for speedier Azure services Ignite Microsoft is using Intel Altera Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) chips to speed up Azure services, according to an announcement at the Ignite event under way in Atlanta. FPGA chips aim to combine the performance advantage of hardware with the flexibility of software. They are integrated circuits that can be reconfigured by downloading a new hardware configuration after manufacture, hence "Field Programmable". Initiated in 2010, Microsoft's Project Catapult is an effort to accelerate cloud computing through a network of FPGAs in the company's datacenters. Now the company has announced what it says is the world's largest deployment of FPGAs. For three years or so, Microsoft has been including an Altera FPGA in every server it installs. Altera, a specialist FPGA vendor, was acquired by Intel in 2015. This FPGA network will be used to accelerate artificial intelligence services, among other things. Microsoft says the current rollout is in 15 countries over five continents, though there is no detail available. Newer data centres, such as those recently opened in the UK, are likely to be suitably equipped. “The really important thing is how we’ve architected the system,” Microsoft Distinguished Engineer Doug Burger told The Reg. “The FPGA sits directly between the server and the network, so all the traffic goes through. The CPU can also talk to it over PCIe, but the FPGAs can talk to one another over the network as well. So in some sense it’s a new kind of computer that’s been inserted into our cloud. That layer can do networking, it can do AI, it can do other things. It is a major architectural change." The fact that all the network traffic goes through the FPGAs is what enables Microsoft to use the FPGAs somewhat independently of the servers, rather than always going via the host servers. At the same time, this design introduces new risks, since a bug or fault impacts the whole system. That, said Burger, has been the key challenge. "You are putting an alien technology into a very mature system. All of the network traffic runs through this thing. You screw it up, you can do some real damage. You think about reliability at scale, failure diagnostics, health monitoring, debugging, version management, package management, all of that needs to be built into the platform. No one has gone large scale like this." The benefit though is huge speed-up for certain specialist tasks. "When you have a successful FPGA deployment, the speed-ups you get tend to range between 10 and 1000 times. Usually it’s in the low 10s," said Burger. Might Microsoft allow developers to upload their own FPGA images to run on Azure? "That is a potential business," says Burger. "We haven't announced any plans or schedule to do that." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Microsoft boffins: Who needs Intel CPUs when you've got FPGAs?

MSI’s GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Notebook Receives Drivers for Windows 10 All files required to provide maximum performance Sep 26, 2016 11:43 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  MSI has made available all the drivers required by its GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii notebook in order to provide maximum performance, stability, and usability while running the 64-bit variant of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system. When it comes to the downloadable packages, MSI provides a new BIOS that fixes VBIOS version display in BSU, as well as updates the device’s MicroCode. These files might come in handy in case future updates turn up faulty. As for other components, Rivet Networks, Atheros, and Intel provide the Ethernet, Wireless, and Bluetooth drivers, while Realtek ensures the well-functioning of the card reader and audio feature through the appropriate files. In addition to that, while Intel provides Chipset, RST (Rapid Storage Technology), RST Preinstall, ME (Management Engine), and Thunderbolt files. Synaptics makes sure all touch-related functions work perfectly. Last but not least, Intel also takes care of the video chipset, as well as all of its available features through its graphics package, and NVIDIA enables the full power of the notebook’s dedicated video card. That said, if you intend to apply these packages, simply save all files on your computer’s internal storage, extract them if necessary, and run the appropriate setup files one by one. Also, upon completion, it would be a good idea to perform a system reboot to ensure all changes take effect. Therefore, download MSI GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Drivers, take into account all aspects described above, and check our website as often as possible to be up to speed with the latest news.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (5 Images) #GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii#MSI#Notebook#GT72S Dominator G Tobii#Drivers reddit it! flip it share it tweet it MSI GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Notebook (5 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Download Drivers for MSI GT72VR 6RD Dominator Tobii Notebook Download Drivers for GT73VR TITAN and TITAN SLI Notebooks Download Drivers for MSI’s New X99A TOMAHAWK Motherboard Download New BIOS for MSI H110M PRO Series Motherboards Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 AMD Releases Radeon Crimson Edition 16.11.4 Hotfix - Download and Apply Now New Firmware Is Available for Sony PlayStation 4 Consoles - Get Version 4.06 Amazon Adds Alexa to Its Fire, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 - Get Firmware 5.6.0 5 photos    MSI GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii New Apps WinSent Innocenti: Simple tool that helps you receive messages, notifications and alerts via Windows Messenger Service, and copy the messages to the clipboard or delete them Reflector: This easy to use application allows you to easily connect your iOS or Android device to the PC and use the AirPlay feature to stream content to your desktop Dbvisit Replicate: Create a duplicate for your Oracle database for backup or migration purpose with the help of this advanced and effective program Gwyddion: An efficient and reliable modular application designed specifically for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data visualization and analysis Gus Tools: Turn ESD images of Windows 10 to ISO format, so that you may upgrade your computer to this operating system using a USB or a DVD Avira System SpeedUp: Clean junk files, repair registry errors, delete invalid keys, clean computer activity traces, and defragment your drives using this all-in-one tool POPcon PRO: Advanced program that helps you retrieve messages from POP3 mailboxes and deliver them to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes using antispam, archive, antivirus engine, rule-based distribution and scheduled tasks Reader comments NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 more on: 375.95 Hotfix i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Hackers discovered the issues, saying that Apple weakened backup security with iOS 10. But Apple is already on the case and plans to issue fixes for it. DON’T MISS: iPhone 7 review According to Forbes, well-known Russian forensic company, Elcomsoft said that cracking the logins for backups stored on a Mac or PC is considerably easier now. If that name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s believed that Elcomsoft helped hackers crack the Apple ID accounts of several celebrities in 2014, just a few days ahead of Apple’s iPhone 6 announcement. The company found that Apple was using a weaker password protection mechanism for manual backups via iTunes on Mac and PC. Using CPU acceleration, Elcomsoft could potentially guess backup passwords 40 times faster when compared to cracking iOS 9 with a speedier GPU tool. Using an Intel i5 CPU, the task was incredibly faster – an “astonishing 2,500 times faster,” as Forbes puts it. The computer would try 6 million passwords per second compared to 2,400. That lowers significantly the amount of time you have to wait for a computer to guess the correct password and access a backup data file. “We discovered an alternative password verification mechanism added to iOS 10 backups,” Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin wrote in a blog post on Friday. “We looked into it and found out that the new mechanism skips certain security checks, allowing us to try passwords approximately 2500 times faster compared to the old mechanism used in iOS 9 and older.” Apple, meanwhile, issued a statement acknowledging the problem. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC,” a spokesperson said. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” And yes, you totally should protect the iTunes backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with a password. That’s the only way to encrypt the iTunes backup.

Others need a push to get them more involved in the sport. Running and biking has proven to be the best method for rapid and consistent fat loss, and it’s great for your heart and body. But whether you’re running or biking, cardio can be somewhat of a lonely pursuit, and if you don’t have adequate encouragement, it’s more than tempting to give up on your workouts altogether. Oakley and Intel have teamed up to bring you the perfect solution for your solitary, difficult cardio workouts: known as the Oakley Radar Pace, this eye/ear device acts as an excellent coach and personal trainer, whispering directly into your ear. It monitors a variety of things, including distance traveled and your heart rate. Like all wearable devices, the Radar Pace syncs to your smartphone using Bluetooth. To measure distance traveled, it will hijack your phone’s GPS. Through the integrated smartphone tool, it can keep track of your progress as well as measure your stride rate, which is all part of a progress report. The stride rate will be calculated using personal details about your height and leg length as well as your MPH. To get the full Radar Pace experience, it’s recommended that you monitor your heart rate as well. You can do this with a third-party heart rate monitor. You can purchase a Bluetooth-enabled device with the sole purpose of monitoring your heart or you can sync to another fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or Apple watch. When you ask Pace for a progress report, it will factor in your heart rate and let you know when you need to move faster or slow down in order to get the best workout without overextending yourself. As you run, you can either ask Radar Pace how you’re doing, or it will tell you without any prompting after a certain distance covered. It will update you on your mileage, heart rate, and stride rate, all while offering some cardio tips for improving your progress. Pace was designed with the user in mind. Just in case you ask a question at the same time that Pace tells you something else, it will log your questions and answer them in order. After you’ve finished your workout, you can tell Pace to end the workout. Or, if you need to pause the workout for any reason, just let the computer know. The Pace app also offers a variety of cardio workouts recommended specifically for you. If you don’t like the workouts provided, you can make your own and have Pace monitor your progress according to those. The tech side of the glasses is impressive, and the design isn’t too bad either. The shades are lightweight with some basic features like Bluetooth, music playback, Siri or Cortana control, a three-mic array, and a tiny embedded computer system. Because most of the glasses’ functions are performed through your smartphone, you don’t have to worry about being weighed down by heavy glasses. The adjustable earbuds attach to the sunglasses’ ear pieces. They can be bent to fit into your ear or shifted parallel to the ear pieces when you don’t need them. They can also be removed entirely. Users report that the glasses and the earbuds are comfortable, of high quality, and stylish. There are other fitness wearables that perform similar functions as the Oakley Radar Pace, but Oakley and Intel are the first to successfully pair sunglasses and ear pieces. It’s a unique device that could change fitness for a lot of people. At $449 a pop, it’s an expensive investment, but it may be entirely worth it if it helps you improve your progress, and will be available for order at the beginning of October.

The H-series VMs will be available in six different sizes, based on Intel E5-2667 V3 3.2 GHz (with turbo up to 3.5 GHz) processor technology, utilizing DDR4 memory and SSD-based local storage.  The H-series VMs also include a dedicated RDMA backend network enabled by FDR InfiniBand network, capable of delivering ultra-low latency.  RDMA networking is dedicated for MPI (Message Passing Interface) traffic when running coupled applications. Microsoft see a large number of enterprise customers embracing Microsoft Azure for their enterprise HPC workloads. Enterprise customers bursting their HPC jobs to Azure for additional compute power helping to solve complex design of experiments (DOE), optimizations, and other critical projects. One of its premier partners, Altair Engineering, with its suite of enterprise computing products is a current example of integration between customers’ on-premises environment and H-series VMs in Azure. “We are excited about the introduction of new non hyper-threaded compute and network optimized H-series VMs in Azure, we worked closely with the Microsoft Team to test our solutions for performance and scaling on the H Series VMs,” said Sam Mahalingam, CTO Altair Engineering. “Based on the testing we are confident not only to deliver high performance to our customers but also provide deep integration with the Azure environment to enable HPC cloud environments.” H-series VMs can deliver great performance running a variety of applications, helping businesses around the world reducing their product development cycle and bring products faster to market. “We are pleased to see the launch of the new Azure high performance H series VMs with InfiniBand and Linux RDMA technology. This performance accelerates the pace of product design cycles using simulation and helps engineers discover better designs, faster,” said Keith Foston, product manager at CD-adapco, a Siemens Business. H-series virtual machines provide on demand compute capacity for our customers that want to solve complex automotive crash simulation problems.  Through partners like d3View we can bring large scale computing capabilities to customers when needed. “We see a great need for the best-in-class compute power and capacity. With the introduction of Azure’s new H-Series with E5-2667 processor and RDMA InfiniBand network, running large-scale simulations across hundreds of cores will offer reduced turn-around time for simulation engineers and scientists,” said Suri Bala, CEO d3View. “Multi-physics simulation software like LS-DYNA is designed to scale to thousands of processors and with the H-Series, we look forward to helping our customers in evaluating designs quickly.” The low-latency RDMA network enabled by FDR InfiniBand in the H-series VMs, particularly using the H16r and H16mr sizes, make up an ideal combination for delivering the necessary scale and performance for very large CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations. “The RDMA technology in the new H series VMs is critical when running large scale-out jobs on the cloud,” said Rod Mach, CEO TotalCAE. “With clock frequencies flattening out the last few years, RDMA technology enables jobs to scale out to large number of nodes. Our testing of CFD codes with the TotalCAE Portal enabled us to achieve reduced runtimes at large core counts that would not be possible without RDMA technology in Azure.” Non-RDMA-enabled H-series sizes can be deployed with various Linux distributions and Windows Server OS images available in the Azure Marketplace.  RDMA-enabled H-series VM sizes can be deployed using Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and CentOS-based 7.1 HPC and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1 HPC images. The H-series sizes are initially available in the South Central US Azure region, and will be rolled out across other regions in the near future.

UPDATE: 5pm ET: Today, in a letter sent to clients and first reported by VRM Intel, the company said it is shutting up shop. “While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations…. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off” (See reader comment, below, for the full letter.) LeisureLink’s closure strands several resort/hotel type managers as well as traditional vacation rental managers. Back to our original story: Earlier this year, the company said it had received a $17 million round of funding, with investors Clearstone Ventures, Kinderhook Industries and Escalate Capital Partners participating. Since its founding in 2007, it has raised more than $34 million. On Friday, SoCal Tech reported that the company has been sending email messages to clients that say: “We’ve been working aggressively to complete a corporate transaction. Regardless of what you may have heard we are still in that process and anticipate a positive outcome.” Tnooz’s voice and email messages to top-level executives this morning have not been returned, as of this afternoon. The only executive we could reach on the phone has declined to comment. In August, Utah-based LeisureLink sold several of its consumer-facing websites to Aspen-based Ski.com. Earlier this year, an official had told Tnooz that the company was working on releasing new, public APIs for distributors and suppliers. The goal was to enable LeisureLink rates and inventory to be passed over to Airbnb, HomeAway’s Escapia software, and Seekda’s Regatta booking engine. In 2014, LeisureLink was bought by VacationRoost, which changed its group name to LeisureLink. LeisureLink’s online chat system for customer service was closed today. When Tnooz contacted an account manager by phone, he was telling customers that all he could say was that “the company is going through a corporate transaction and they are hoping to get the business details resolved quickly.” Apparently any such potential deal fell through.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Jeffery Hill I am trying to figure out if this fall under Utah or California. The address was Utah. I just left a message with the Atty General’s office. I believe that under the law notices were suppose to have been sent to all creditors within 30 days of the closure which I believe was Sept 23rd. So it’s possible that those have been sent but I have not received anything yet. In the long run, I’m sure no one will see any money. This is essentially a bankruptcy and I’m sure the assets will not cover what it owed. If anything is paid out it will be pennies on the dollar. If anyone knows anything else, please post Reply 3 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I did get a letter from the Utah Atty General’s office, they said it falls under California law. They suggested contacting an attorney there. Reply 3 weeks ago   Geri Hauck We have yet to receive any forms or paperwork as stipulated in their notice of closure. Reply 1 week ago   Former LL Client Odd how Leisure Link still has its ties to Homeaway and VRBO has anyone heard back from the Utah attorneys office? Reply 4 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I heard back from the Utah Attorney Generals office, they said to file a complaint with California, which I did. They also suggested contacting an attorney. I think there needs to be a class action suit. I know there are places that suffered must larger losses then me and wonder if any of them have started anything? Reply 4 weeks ago   Peter in Colorado Every vacation rental manager should know that Advance Deposits paid by guests must be kept in separate bank accounts until those funds are earned. How was LL able to bypass this basic obligation and use Advance Deposit payments to fund their operations without committing fraud? If fraud has been committed, who is being held culpable? I would like to be able to tell my staff and my clients (who are all losing money on this!) that someone is being held to account for this fiasco! Reply 1 month ago   Cote Property Management So, since there are so many of us who have lost substantial funds due to the mismanagement of Leisure Link, aren’t there legal steps that can be taken? I have sent a message to the Attorney General’s office in California and Utah but wonder what we can do as a group. Perhaps if everyone sends a complaint to the Utah Attorney Generals office, it’s online, easy to fill out, maybe someone will look at the seriousness of this issue. Reply 1 month ago   Matthew Gurley Have you reached out to the channels directly? I’m happy to make an intro. matt@mybookingpal.com Reply 1 month ago   Peter Burns Our company is in the last minute discounts for luxury vacation villa properties. We recently started a financing arm of our company, http://www.hlvillas.com/financing/, that may be helpful to those Property Management Companies suffering because of lost revenue due to Leisurelink’s bk. We offer working capital loans and additional debt products that are from non-bank sources. Let us know if we can assist. Reply 1 month ago   Rhonda Vinje I’m sorry for those that have lost their jobs over this fiasco, however you can find work again. How does one go about getting their money refunded? Who can we contact? Shame on those that robbed us of our hard earned money.That was my 1st vacation in FORTY YEARS!! I can only hope that Karma bites you in the A$$! Reply 1 month ago   Matthew Gurley Hey Rhonda, If you file a chargeback on your credit card it should be refunded by the credit card company. Reply 1 month ago   Rhonda Vinje Hey there…. That’s a negative, we tried that, Chase declined it. But thank you for responding. We paid in good faith & in full using our debit card. I should clarify, we got our vacation, but not our security deposit back. I was thankful the house existed & the key worked in the door knowing now what was going on behind-the-scenes! I will be VERY Leary next time around. Who can you trust today, there’s a scammer on every corner. Reply 1 month ago   Kristen Cherry The difficult part of the merchant of record solution is no OTA has a great system for managing payment or declined cards, which for some of the OTA channels can be a significant percentage, add in the process of making changes and modifications to existing reservations and the business of “handing this over” becomes the easy and necessary solution. Nobody could have foreseen this ending….the theory and vision were there…the execution fell flat. Property managers already have 10 jobs from managing homeowner expectations, wowing guests, maintenance -you name it. Managing the OTA channels from allotment, content, pricing, payments, and promos is just to daunting and unrealistic. Other intermediaries will gain market share – but established infrastructure will be critical. Reply 1 month ago   Displaced Worker from LL Please forgive me as I shamelessly use this platform to solicit employment. Desperate times call for desperate measures! I am among the many blindsided employees of LeisureLink who were left jobless. Are any of you competitors hiring? I was with Hawaiian Beach Rentals before VacationRoost bought them out, then worked with VacationRoost prior to their acquisition of LeisureLink, finally settling in a comfortable position with LeisureLink. Therefore, I have experience in many different sectors of the business. I worked remotely for my entire time with the company- over 5 years in total. I am located in Southern California (Inland Empire). I see that many of you are outside the US. Maybe a remote US employee is just what you need! 😉 However, I have come to terms with the unlikelihood of finding another remote position, so hopefully some of you are local enough to utilize my eagerness to work with you. If at all possible, I would love to stay within the same (or similar) industry. Thanks for your consideration. Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin Send me your resume. We are hiring. Reply 1 month ago   Richard Vaughton I have to follow up on Alex’s comment here and is a common discussion point amongst managers and is well placed. Offering up full cash management to a third party is a risky situation. Managers are responsible to owners and this third party cash managament can cascade problems significantly. Look at Vacasol another “mid agent” sitting between contratctors, self marketing and creative channel distribution, now in bankcruptcy procedings and with clients possibly out of pocket. Any technology partner should be that, a conduit to booking success, with a means of transacting money seamlessly through secure, ring fenced bank accounts. Even UK banks will only secure £75K, so collect direct and manage efficiently. Its also not just the question of the being way out of pocket, its the lack of dynamic access to OTA’s on which many now rely. As for the $17m or $34m of however much was involved, it would be interesting to see the full story at some point.. Reply 2 months ago   Leisurelink Employee Alex if Leisurelink posed such a credit risk why did you try to buy them? Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin I think any company’s greatest assets is their employees. Leisurelink had very good, hard working and dedicated staff. It is a shame that they ended up in this situation. Reply 2 months ago   Former LL Employee It is a shame @AlexAydin. We busted our humps and it’s sad and disappointing that it ended like this. No severance either unfortunately. I don’t hold any grudges though. I’m grateful for the opportunity and the experience. Any former competitors out there that are looking to hire, I’d love to send you my resume! I have 3+ years experience working for an Online Travel Distributor as an Account Support Specialist troubleshooting software and listing issues for out clients. I would be a very worthy addition to your team ! Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin Send us your resume. We are looking to expand our support team. https://www.mybookingpal.com/sub-careers/applyform?id=2 2 months ago   Alex Aydin Lesson to be learned from Leisurelink   With the situation that former LeisureLink clinets and suppliers find themselves in, it can be a frightening time for property managers. We are hoping that all LeisureLink suppliers receive some, if not all, of the funds that are still owed to them. If, and when, suppliers receive their funds, they are still dealt with the daunting task of searching for another channel manager while the risk of another LeisureLink situation looms in their mind. To avert another LeisureLink situation, property managers must first understand why the situation occurred in the first place. The epicenter of the LeisureLink failure revolved around credit risk and business continuity. Credit risk was due to the model LeisureLink used where they operated as Merchant of Record. In that model, LeisureLink collected the funds given from guests and OTAs and would then transfer the funds owed to the supplier typically after guest departure from the property. This is where the property management risk comes into play. If the channel manager, as the Merchant of Record fails, then the supplier runs the risk of not getting paid. To avoid this as a supplier of properties, choose a channel manager that allows the property manager to act as Merchant of Record. This will allow property managers to receive payments directly from guests or OTAs. As Merchant of Record, property manager eliminates any possibility of credit risk on behalf of the channel manager. Reply 2 months ago   Steve Sherlock @Sean – perhaps Tnooz can discuss this internally, though for those folks making pretty serious accusations and who aren’t prepared to put their name to the accusation, then perhaps those comments should be removed. For all you know those making the accusations are competitors of those they accuse. Bit of a sordid affair all round. Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley This is completely incorrect. I would truly appreciate it if you would stop trolling our company online. This is completely unprofessional and considered defamation. BookingPal is a separate entity and competitor of LeisureLink. If you took 20 minutes with me to look at our platform you would realize it’s completely different. Contact me for more details. Reply 2 months ago   BookingPAL is not your pal All the way at the top, the former President of Leisurelink, Richard Barajas, is now an adviser for BookingPal. I dont believe I would want anyone that helped steer a company into despair advising me on a damn thing. whether he was a current executive or not is irrelevant. A company doesn’t go down in five minutes…its an evolution of piss poor decision making and that very well goes back to the tenure of Richard Barajas and many other idiotic people. He was the President in December 2013 Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley Again. Defamation and incorrect. I advice Tnooz admins to please remove this user from your pages. Our board of directors can be found directly on our website. 1 member used to work with LeisureLink. We are an American built company and only 3 years old in the space, and completely different from LeisureLink. Do some research. Our integrations are different, products are different, channel support is different. BookingPal only supports a fraction of channels LeisureLink did. If this was remotely true we would have the exact same connections right? Please act professional and join us to help LeisureLink users regain access to distribution in a way where they cannot possibly lose money. A key difference between us and Leisurelink is the ability to allow the PM to be merchant of record (something LeisureLink tried and failed to repeat consistently). This way a PM can use us, remain merchant of record, and not have the chance to lose funds in a situation like LeisureLink’s ever again. Reply 2 months ago   Richard Barajas I hesitate to respond to a nameless, non-specific post but I feel compelled to do so until Tnooz recognizes this as defamation and a defenseless position that should be removed. The most important things I’d like to communicate are 1) I’m saddened to see this outcome for LeisureLink. All the employees, including myself, worked hard and did our best for our customers and our company. 2) BookingPal is a top-notch, professional organization with great technology and people. They have built a solid integrated infrastructure from day 1 targeted to serve the Vacation Rental marketplace. I encourage you to contact them and decide for yourself. Reply 2 months ago   Erica We are customers of a property that got screwed over by Leisure Link and guess what? When we arrived to the property they made us pay twice for the room we had already paid for in full, because Leisure Link hadn’t paid them. So guess who really got screwed here? Me the guest and you know what? $500 extra is a lot to me whereas I’m guessing it’s nothing to you Richard Barajas. So now we have paid twice for a room because you and your company. I plan to contact news agencies in Colorado to get the word out about your sham-full business practices. Reply 1 month ago   martin alletson Dear Sir. I realize no one ever wants to go out of business unless there is no other way.

I can loop you in with Expedia and AirBnB. If there are any funds that they were still holding and had not sent to leisurelink already, they can send the funds directly to you. Reply 2 months ago   Former LL Employee I was with LeisureLink for 3+ years and I’m disappointed that it ended like this. How did we come to this point? I believe we should’ve put more energy, focus, and capital on our Technology instead of going out and signing up new clients first and foremost, which I believe caused issues with scalability and ultimately led to our downfall. Any contemporaries out there hiring? I’m located in Los Angeles, CA. Reply 2 months ago   Wendy And where does this leave us, the individuals that booked and paid thru .com sites, who have upcoming reservations but the hotel has not received payment (and probably won’t receive) Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley We are very sad to see LeisureLink go and to see the effect it has had on property managers in our industry. BookingPal is the leading platform the industry, allowing you to reach these OTA’s with a full integration and be merchant of record. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. We are here to help you through a smooth transition.

I am aware of another sales organization/channel that went of out business who also owed their suppliers thousands, and I believe the credit card companies were able to help to some degree. Also going forward look hard at who is merchant of record, are there options or structures to help avoid this in the future.

Reply 2 months ago   Colorado PM This is so unfortunate but you wonder how a Harvard MBA and a board of directors that include executives from publicly traded companies waste $30+ millions. LeisureLink was known for big parties at MTS, expensive dinners and over promising. Some account managers were great and feel bad for them. They owe us $200K so many will be unemployed before ski season thanks to an inept management team and board members. Reply 2 months ago   Julie Hightower They haven’t paid our hotel for people who stayed in June, July, August & September. In speaking with Expedia today, they actually invoiced them for all reservation up to and including September 24th. You can’t invoice Expedia until the day of the reservation. So just before they close, they decided to screw us one last time. They currently owe $65,000. We have 45 reservations still on the books for the next six weeks, unfortunately if Expedia can not assure us payment for these, we will be forced to cancel them.

Reply 2 months ago   Jane Doe Just received this from them: Dear Valued Partner, LeisureLink has been helping suppliers of vacation rentals generate bookings through third party channels for over nine years, and has experienced accelerated growth for the past several quarters. Supporting this growth and building the technology solutions for the industry has been a capital intensive process. LeisureLink is privately-owned and has historically met these capital needs with investments from its owners. For the last 12 months, LeisureLink has been working with an investment bank to raise additional equity capital to fund the Company’s growth for the future. The Company expected this process would yield an infusion of needed capital this summer. While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations. As a result, we have no choice but to stop operations and not process any new bookings as of September 27, 2016. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off. LeisureLink values the working relationships built over these last 9 years and appreciates the loyalty of its employees, vendors, customers and partners and is trying to cease operations as smoothly and orderly as possible, given the circumstances. To that end, the Company has agreed to undertake an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors (“Assignment”), which is a process designed to manage an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets and to distribute those proceeds to creditors according to their legal rights and priorities. As required by law, the Assignee will be mailing notices of the Assignment to all creditors in the next 30 days, providing further information about the Assignment and providing creditors with a proof of claim form through which creditors can file a claim for any obligations due.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology Programmable chips turning Azure into a supercomputing powerhouse Chips are boosting network speeds, slashing latency, and accelerating Bing. by Peter Bright - Sep 27, 2016 7:15 pm UTC Login to bookmark 135 An Altera Stratix V developer board, which uses the same kind of FPGA as Microsoft is deploying in Azure. Altera Microsoft is embarking on a major upgrade of its Azure systems. New hardware the company is installing in its 34 datacenters around the world still contains the mix of processors, RAM, storage, and networking hardware that you'll find in any cloud system, but to these Microsoft is adding something new: field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), highly configurable processors that can be rewired using software in order to provide hardware accelerated implementations of software algorithms. The company first investigated using FPGAs to accelerate the Bing search engine. In "Project Catapult," Microsoft added off-the-shelf FPGAs on PCIe cards from Altera (now owned by Intel) to some Bing servers and programmed those FPGAs to perform parts of the Bing ranking algorithm in hardware. The result was a 40-fold speed-up compared to a software implementation running on a regular CPU. A common next step after achieving success with an FPGA is to then create an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to make a dedicated, hardcoded equivalent to the FPGA. This is what Microsoft did with the Holographic Processing Unit in its HoloLens headset, for example, because the ASIC has greatly reduced power consumption and size. But the Bing team stuck with FPGAs because their algorithms change dozens of times a year. An ASIC would take many months to produce, meaning that by the time it arrived, it would already be obsolete. With this pilot program successful, the company then looked at ways to use FPGAs more widely across not just Bing but Azure and Office 365 as well. Azure's acute problem wasn't search engine algorithms; Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told us it was network traffic. Azure runs a vast number of virtual machines on a substantial number of physical servers, using a close relative of Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor to manage the virtualization of the physical hardware. Virtual machines have one or more virtual network adaptors through which they send and receive network traffic. The hypervisor handles the physical network adaptors that are actually connected to Azure's networking infrastructure. Moving traffic to and from the virtual adaptors, while simultaneously applying rules to handle load-balancing, traffic routing, and so on, incurs a CPU cost. This cost is negligible at low data rates, but when pushing multiple gigabits of traffic per second to a VM, Microsoft was finding that the CPU burden was considerable. Entire processor cores had to be dedicated to this network workload, meaning that they couldn't be used to run VMs. The Bing team didn't have this network use case, so the way they used FPGAs wasn't immediately suitable. The solution that Microsoft came up with to handle both Bing and Azure was to add a second connection to the FPGAs. In addition to their PCIe connection to each hardware server, the FPGA boards were also plumbed directly into the Azure network, enabling them to send and receive network traffic without needing to pass it through the host system's network interface. That PCIe interface is shared with the virtual machines directly, giving the virtual machines the power to send and receive network traffic without having to bounce it through the host first. The result? Azure virtual machines can push 25 gigabits per second of network traffic, with a latency of 25-50 microseconds. That's a tenfold latency improvement and can be done without demanding any host CPU resources. Technically, something similar could be achieved with a suitable network card; higher-end network cards can similarly be shared and directly assigned to virtual machines, allowing the host to be bypassed. But this process is usually subject to limitations (for example, a given card may only be assignable to 4 VMs simultaneously), and it doesn't offer the same flexibility. When programming the FPGAs for Azure's networking, Microsoft can build the load balancing and other rules directly into the FPGA. With a shared network card, these rules would still have to be handled on the host processor within a device driver. This flexibility means that for Azure, just as with Bing before it, FPGAs are a better solution than ASICs. This solution of network-connected FPGAs works as well for Azure as it does for Bing, and Microsoft is now rolling it out to its data centers. Bing can use the FPGAs for workloads such as ranking, feature extraction from photos, and machine learning. Azure can use them for accelerated networking. Currently, the FPGA networking is in preview; once it's widespread enough across Microsoft's datacenters, it will become standard, with the long-term goal being to use FPGA networking for every Azure virtual machine. Networking is the first workload in Azure, but it's not going to be the only one. In principle, Microsoft could offer a menu of FPGA-accelerated algorithms (pattern matching, machine learning, and certain kinds of large-scale number crunching would all be good candidates) that virtual machine users could opt into, and longer term custom programming of the FPGAs could be an option. Microsoft gave a demonstration at its Ignite conference this week of just what this power could be used for. Distinguished engineer Doug Burger, who had led the Project Catapult work, demonstrated a machine translation of all 3 billion words of English Wikipedia on thousands of FPGAs simultaneously, crunching through the entire set of data in just a tenth of a second. The total processing power of all those FPGAs together was estimated at about 1 exa-operations—one billion billion, 1018 operations—per second, working on an artificial intelligence-style workload. While not a primary target for the company, the scale of cloud compute power—combined with the increasingly high performance interconnects that FPGAs and other technology enable—mean that cloud-scale systems are in time likely to be competitive with and eventually surpass the supercomputers used for high-performance computing workloads. With this kind of processing power on tap, it won't be too long before Azure becomes a collection of supercomputers available to anyone to rent by the hour.

Along with Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm, the German automakers announced the formation of the "5G Automotive Association," which will develop, test and standardize the fifth generation of high-speed wireless communication. Audi Audi's traffic light information system is the first step in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) integration, set to launch in select smart cities this fall in the U.S. "The goal is to address society's connected mobility and road safety needs with applications such as connected automated driving, ubiquitous access to services and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation," the companies said in a statement. The next-generation mobile network, also known as 5G, would involve not only cellular bandwidth improvements but also Internet connection speeds that are faster than the current 4G, or Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard. The Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance, a non-profit industry group working on new cellular communication standards, has said 5G would enable data rates up to 1Gbps second, allow for a vast increase in the number of devices that could simultaneously be connected on the same network and offer more efficient mobile networks for a lower investment cost. Self-driving cars not only rely on cameras and sensors to navigate, but also up-to date GPS and map data that can be used to identify the immediate location. In the future, autonomous vehicles will also be able to communicate with other vehicles and the infrastructure around them, known as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. DOT For example, Audi recently announced that ts 2017 vehicles will be able to communicate with traffic lights in order to inform drivers when they will switch from red to green. Next-generation 5G mobile networks will include Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, which shifts the focus of information and communication technologies towards the Internet of Things, the 5G Automotive Association said. "As an evolution to today's networks, next generation mobile networks are expected to handle much more data volume, connect many more devices, significantly reduce latency and bring new levels of reliability," the group said. "For example, 5G can better support mission-critical communications for safer driving and will further support enhanced [V2X] communications and connected mobility solutions." The 5G Automotive Association said it will address key technical and regulatory issues, the integration of vehicle platforms with 5G connectivity, privacy and security, a distributed cloud infrastructure and onboard vehicle computing systems. The group plans to run joint innovation and development projects and interoperability testing, as well large scale pilots and trial deployments. "It will facilitate global regulation, certification and standardization efforts for autonomous driving and future car services based on 5G technologies," Li Yingtao, president of a Huawei's 2012 Labs business.

The unprecedented collaboration between the three German premium brands is linked to their joint acquisition of Nokia’s HERE Maps, and the trio will join Huawei, Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, and the Finnish brand in the cross-industry partnership. Few projects of this kind have linked so many big corporations, so their results will be interesting to follow. The association has the goal of developing communication solutions and support standardization of protocols that will enable car-to-car connectivity, along with intelligent transportation solutions like car-to-infrastructure technologies. As BMW explains in a press release, the 5G Automotive Association wants to solve society’s connected mobility needs and road safety problems with advanced technology. The partnership will employ the next generation of mobile networks, which will operate on the 5G standard, an evolution of the LTE technology. Thanks to the tech, the 5G Automotive Association will employ Cellular Vehicle-to-everything communication, abbreviated by the C-V2X term. In layman’s terms, the idea behind this partnership is to place a reliable Internet connection in every car on the road, and to let vehicles “talk” to each other. Because the automakers involved five serious players of the communication and technology industry, they are sure that the models that will benefit from this technology will employ the latest developments in these systems. With 5G speeds, cars will be able to connect to more devices than ever, and the generated network will be able to handle an unprecedented data volume, while also reducing latency. Evidently, the association must be sure that the formed network will ensure a new level of reliability. Nobody wants to live in fear that his or her self-driving car, connected to the Internet, will ever suffer from lag or a connection that has timed out. Employing multiple solutions from several players in the telecom industry should provide a level of redundancy that will adequately support the network.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles Forza Horizon 3 PC What does it take to run Forza Horizon 3 at 1080p60? A lot of horsepower. By Richard Leadbetter Published 27/09/2016 Last weekend, we showcased the PC port of Playground Games' Forza Horizon 3, running at close to its absolute best at 4K resolution with a silky smooth 60 frames per second. It took an overclocked Core i7 and Nvidia's Titan X Pascal to get the job done, but typically, impressive performance at ultra HD tends to scale down nicely to less capable graphics hardware running at 1080p. However, Forza Horizon 3 appears to be something of an exception. Reports of inconsistent, stuttering performance are far and wide, even using PC hardware that far outstrips both the CPU and GPU power of the Xbox One, so we went back to the game to see the extent to which the issues could be replicated on our test system. The results are bizarre to say the least - using an Intel Skylake-based system, some of the performance issues and inconsistencies almost defy belief. Typically, a game that runs flawlessly at 4K on the new Titan X should run perfectly with performance to spare on Nvidia's GTX 1060 - but not Forza Horizon 3, which actually runs significantly more slowly. The GTX 970 - quite possibly the most popular enthusiast-level GPU installed in the most PCs today - shows a huge performance deficit compared to the 1060, but its shortfalls are nowhere near as pronounced as the R9 390 compared to the new RX 480, with a gap often in excess of 20fps (!). Bearing in mind that the R9 390 outperforms the RX 480 in many titles, this differential is remarkable. The list of WTF-level performance issues just continue to stack up the more hardware we tested: Nvidia's mighty Titan X Pascal cannot run this game smoothly at 1080p on ultra settings with the default 4x MSAA in effect - even though it runs smoothly at 4K with multi-sampling disabled. And this leads us on to the first key revelation in optimising Forza Horizon 3 to run at anything like a smooth 60fps: utilising MSAA simply murders any chance of flawless performance. We take an extended look at Forza Horizon 3's puzzling performance profile, testing out Titan X Pascal, GTX 1060, RX 480, GTX 970 and R9 390. We also look at how weaker CPUs have issues streaming the game world. Turning off MSAA removes many of the frequent coughs and splutters the game possesses, but it's far from a cure-all. Frame-rate dips appear to be either background streaming related or purely graphics related. Minimising the latter isn't super-difficult. Dropping shadows and world car detail level from ultra to high claws back a lot of performance, while paring back the reflection settings can improve frame-rate with no real substantial impact on image quality during the heat of gameplay. This can help to address the more sustained drops to frame-rate, but the fact is that the game still has severe streaming issues that requires sheer CPU brute force to overcome. Our Core i7 6700K overclocked to 4.6GHz and paired with 3000MHz DDR4 appears to power past most of the issues, but swapping out the i7 for a Core i5 6500 3.2GHz - similar in performance terms to a fully overclocked Core i5 2500K based on our previous tests - shows the stuttering issue in full effect. Adjusting settings to trim back draw distance could help here, but it's a Hobson's Choice of a situation - even on ultra settings, pop-in is noticeable and scaling back the dynamic geometry setting causes the pop-in to occur closer to the player position. Dropping back from ultra textures is also worth experimentation - there's not a great deal to differentiate high and ultra. Even medium looks presentable. When everything goes right and your PC powers past Forza Horizon 3's performance shortcomings, the end result is simply breathtaking. Here, we're playing the game at 4K, 60fps. LOD settings on Xbox One appear to be somewhat dynamic, which may explain its excellent consistency level. The PC version does have a dynamic load-levelling system too - just like Forza Motorsport 6 Apex - but the issue here is that at high and ultra settings, MSAA is forced on and you can't turn it off, meaning that stutter is never too far away. All of which makes it sound as though Forza Horizon 3 is a nuclear disaster of a PC port - but this is not the case. While it is clear that some fairly profound optimisation is required - plus a good deal of driver attention from both Nvidia and AMD - the fact is that a beautiful, smooth experience at full ultra settings and 8x MSAA is relatively easy to attain, even with a slower i5 and GTX 970. However, it involves making a compromise that many PC owners won't be happy with: engaging the 30fps limit. To its credit, the 30fps cap doesn't just limit frame-rate, it also enforces proper frame-pacing, meaning that each frame persists for 33ms - something we confirmed for both AMD and Nvidia hardware, and absolutely crucial in making what is a relatively low frame-rate for PC gaming actually work out. Combined with the excellent quality motion blur, this is a viable way forward for enjoying the game in its current state. Xbox One's 30fps experience is still beautifully solid - it's an excellent console racer. Right now, the bottom line is that while a smooth 60fps is possible, the raw brute force required to get the job done on the higher presets is likely beyond the reach of most mainstream gaming PCs, and that's a shame, because the experience clearly benefits immensely. Disabling MSAA is the first step on the journey to a smoother ride, but even doing that comes with some reservations - Xbox One runs with 4x MSAA and it looks great. Even at 4K, no multi-sampling can lead to some intrusive visual artefacts - especially on pixel break-up on power lines. Obviously, these become more of an issue as you scale down resolution. Quite why MSAA is an issue at all - and why enabling it even causes performance issues at 1080p with the fastest single-chip GPU money can buy - is something of a mystery. There is a Witcher School and I've been It's not for the faint-hearted. We can't help but think that this game needs some work - enough to warrant perhaps holding fire on a Windows Store purchase. While the issues we've encountered are by turns frustrating and even at times inexplicable, at least we're able to physically play the game. Colleagues at Eurogamer Portugal report that the game instantly crashes whenever a race is started, while Eurogamer Germany tells us that the game crashes every couple of minutes. User reports also show a number of issues relating to basic stability. Clearly, something needs to be done - and hopefully it will be, because when this game is running smoothly at 60fps with all the dials turned up to the maximum, the end result is simply glorious. Resolution, frame-rate, effects and art quality all scale beautifully to provide a premium, top-tier experience. But it shouldn't require a stupendously expensive rig to get the job done - fingers crossed that Playground Games is taking a good, long, hard look at getting Forza Horizon 3 into shape.

The three companies, which are among the leaders in 5G research and development, on Tuesday joined major European car makers BMW, Audi and Daimler, as well as US semiconductor technology giants Intel and Qualcomm to form the “5G Automotive Association”. In a joint media announcement from Munich, where BMW is headquartered, the association members said their goal was to address society’s mobility and road safety needs, with applications such as connected automated driving, while ensuring ubiquitous access to services, and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation. ZTE, Huawei push 5G-ready gear for SoftBank deployment in Japan “The creation of this association demonstrates the clear need for cross sector collaboration,” said Li Yingtao, the president of Huawei’s innovation engine called 2012 Labs. “It will facilitate global regulation, certification and standardisation efforts for autonomous driving and future car services based on 5G technologies.” Alfons Pfaller, the head of infotainment development at Audi, added that connected cars “will shape the future of individual mobility, and next generation mobile networks will take car-to-x connectivity to a new level”. The association said it would welcome more partners from the automotive and broader information and communications technology industry. “Chinese smart car start-ups like us would definitely want to join this new 5G automotive group, so that we can understand potential 5G-related solutions,” said Shen Haiyi, the founder of Beijing-based Zhiche Auto. “We expect the association’s founding companies to help deliver major innovations in vehicle-to-vehicle as well as vehicle-to-everything communications.” ZTE first to complete all key technology tests for China’s national 5G network Shenzhen-based ZTE, which is China’s largest listed telecommunications equipment manufacturer and a leading 5G proponent, offered no comments when asked by the South China Morning Post about not participating in the new 5G association. ZTE and Huawei are both currently involved in the deployment of advanced 5G-ready mobile infrastructure in Japan by SoftBank Corp, the domestic telecommunications subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. The newly formed 5G alliance followed Facebook’s establishment of the Telecom Infra Project in February. This initiative has signed up more than 300 members, including Intel and Nokia to help step up 5G standardisation and global adoption. “The wireless industry has always put a strong emphasis on standardisation,” Bernstein Research senior analyst Pierre Ferragu said in a report. He pointed out that complete 5G standardisation was still many years away, but deployment could happen earlier on a small scale. Initiatives like the 5G Automotive Association and the Telecom Infra Project appear to be a new approach to speeding up international standardisation efforts.

Most of the Macs currently shipping use either integrated graphics from Intel or discreet AMD chips, but that could change in the coming years. As first spotted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Nvidia is seeking software engineers tasked with helping produce “the next revolutionary Apple products.” According to the job post, the role would require “working in partnership with Apple” and writing code that will “define and shape the future” of graphics-related software on Macs. Gurman writes: There are three current job listings on Nvidia’s database referencing Apple, with the latest one appearing last week. All three job listings for the Santa Clara, California-based company cite software development for the Mac, while one specifies an Nvidia Mac graphics driver team, pointing to the potential of Nvidia chipsets returning to the Apple computers. Nvidia and Apple both declined to comment. One of the ads is for a Metal and OpenCL software engineer who will be working within a team of exceptional and passionate engineers to implement and extend Metal Compute and OpenCL on the Mac. As Gurman hinted, Nvidia most likely needs these GPU experts and software engineers for developing macOS graphics drivers for some of its GPUs that could end up in future Mac models. Macs have always been dissed for slow and poorly supported graphics. indeedI, most of the high-end graphics cards are unavailable to Mac owners who crave graphics power and performance. Apple itself does not write its own graphics drivers and is reluctant to officially support the latest and greatest graphics cards for gaming. Here’s Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang discussing GPU technology’s capability and its role in artificial intelligent applications at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference 2016 which kicked off on September 21 in Taiwan. While discreet Nvidia chips are unlikely to end up in future Mac notebooks due to space constraints, it would make sense to use them in a future Mac Pro model, higher-end iMacs and it could also make a nice fit for a next-generation 5K Thunderbolt Display with integrated graphics that the rumor-mill thought Apple was building at some point. Nvidia’s latest Pascal-based Tesla P4 and P40 GPUs feature improved performance and response time and can detect and sense images, texts and voices. These GPUs will begin shipping next month.

REUTERS/Fabian BimmerMore FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German car makers Audi, BMW and Daimler on Tuesday launched an alliance with mobile telecoms network equipment firms Ericsson , Huawei [HWT.UL], Intel , Nokia and Qualcomm to accelerate development of the infrastructure needed for self-driving cars. The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber [UBER.UL] and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardization and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($3.15 billion) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles.

Performance-Boosting HiZ Patches Revised For Intel's Vulkan Linux Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 27 September 2016 at 06:39 AM EDT. 3 Comments A revised set of 11 patches were published this week for implementing basic HiZ (Hierarchical Z) support within Intel's open-source Vulkan "ANV" Mesa driver. These patches don't yet enable HiZ for all cases, but currently just for basic ones. With this basic support, enabling rendering to HiZ increases the FPS by about ~15% on basic triangle and multi-sampling demos. When enabling fast depth clears, it's about an additional 30% frame-rate gains for these triangle and multi-sampling Vulkan demos. These patches are a great start but not until the rest of the HiZ support is squared away will we probably see any significant benefit in the Vulkan Linux games like Dota 2 and Talos Principle. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardisation and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($3.15 billion) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles. ($1 = 0.8892 euros) (Reporting by Harro ten Wolde and Ilona Wissenbach; Editing by Greg Mahlich) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Image: wang song/Shutterstock Some of the world’s biggest telecoms and automotive companies have agreed to join the 5G Automotive Association, to integrate 5G technology into future connected and autonomous vehicles. Once two very separate industries, telecoms and vehicle manufacturers are now rapidly merging together with the advent of connected and future autonomous vehicles. This culmination has resulted in the forming of a new organisation, one that will include the biggest names in the automotive and telecoms industries, known as the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA). Ahead of a 5G future The new association includes AUDI, BMW and Daimler from the automotive side; and Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm from the telecoms industry. The ultra-fast mobile broadband platform remains experimental in many places, but governmental organisations like the EU have put in place plans to roll out 5G into 28 European cities by 2020. Referred to as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, 5G in vehicles will better support mission-critical communications for safer driving. It will do so by handling much greater quantities of data across many devices. The association has said that its formation will iron out all the regulatory work involved with bringing a new 5G standard into play in these companies’ vehicles, as well as the technical issues that need to be overcome. One of the biggest issues, the organisation said, will be to ensure data privacy, authentication and distributed cloud architectures are secured in all partnering vehicles. Daimler and BMW in particular made headlines for this subject earlier this year, after their discussions with Apple to potentially develop the tech giant’s autonomous vehicle project. Essential for autonomous driving However, talks between the parties broke down over Apple’s insistence that the car’s data be uploaded to its own iCloud service. Led by Audi’s Christoph Voigt, the 5GAA has issued a call for other automotive and telecoms industry players to join the group, having already confirmed that several companies have expressed an interest to join in the future. Speaking on what the founding of the 5GAA means for the participating companies, Dr Christoph Grote of BMW said: “We expect 5G to become the worldwide dominating mobile communications standard of the next decade. “For the automotive industry it is essential that 5G fulfils the challenges of the era of digitalisation and autonomous driving.” Related: telecoms, mobile networks, internet of things, internet, autotech Colm Gorey is a journalist with Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Comms Are telecoms companies just paying lip service to ‘going green’? 6 Oct 201623 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Working at the leading edge of IoT Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Comms EU sets out plans for free public Wi-Fi and 5G minimum by 2020 16 Sep 201626 Shares Machines What will the industrial internet of things mean for you? 17 Aug 2016110 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Image: Route66/Shutterstock Reports of a new Huawei Nexus tablet and Pixel 3 laptop released by Google next year could herald the true convergence of Chrome OS and Android. Andromeda is on the way. Last October, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google’s vision of future operating systems was all mobile. Chrome OS was becoming a relic of the past, and Android was the future. Billing it as a 2017 plan, little else was known at the time, although a combined Andromeda OS did make sense. Now, fresh reports of a new Huawei Nexus tablet and Pixel 3 convertible laptop released next year could prove the showcase for Google’s new Andromeda OS. Android Police reported on Pixel 3 yesterday, detailing a planned “ultra-thin” 12.3in display that can support both a tablet mode and a laptop. “Powering it will be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM,” according to the report. It will have notable inclusions of numerous sensors, stylus support, quad microphones, fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports and a 3.5mm jack. Perhaps Apple’s enthusiasm for a jack-less device isn’t catching on in the short term, but given that this rumoured laptop is a good year from completion, this could all change. 9to5Google separately reports a new Huawei Nexus tablet, citing sources close to the project, much like Android Police. The new Andromeda OS is the suggested platform for both devices, with the Huawei tablet expected as early as the new year. It’s a busy time for Google. It’s pinning plenty of its hopes on what many perceive as the next stage of instant messaging: conversational commerce. Google bought API.AI, a natural language and speech recognition company earlier this month. Google’s answer to Amazon Echo due out on 4 October, signals a speeding up of the impending smart home push. Indeed, 4 October could provide an early look at Andromeda. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 A change of operating systems – just as the number of connected devices skyrockets, as the internet of things push hits speed –will perhaps be the biggest Google shift of all.

Adobe adds machine learning and design tool to Creative Cloud First look at Windows Server 2016: 'Cloud for the masses'? We'll be the judge of that Windows updates? Just trust us, says Microsoft executive Ignite Microsoft announced the release of Windows Server 2016 and System Center 2016 at its Ignite event in Atlanta. The commercially supported edition of the Docker engine is included at no extra cost. Server 2016 and System Center 2016 are available for download this week and will be on sale from October 1 2016. A key feature of Server 2016 is its support for Windows containers, a lightweight virtual machine designed for the deployment of microservices. This has enabled the open source Docker engine, already widely used on Linux, to be ported to Windows. Docker has been in preview on Windows for some time, but the release of Server 2016 means that it is now generally available. “There’s a commercial relationship now between Microsoft and Docker,” said Scott Johnston, Docker COO. “We provide the commercially supported Docker Engine, which is the hardened, validated, patched version of the open source product, as part of the Windows Server 2016 SKU. Microsoft will provide Enterprise support for that. We’ll have Docker datacenter support as well, to manage these workloads.” Despite this relationship, the Docker Engine is not integrated into Windows Server setup, nor is it serviced via Windows Update. "There’s a PowerShell [script] to install," said Johnston. Docker was keen to extend its business to Windows, said Johnston. “Sixty-three per cent of the Intel server workloads are run on Windows. Most of the workloads in the enterprise are Windows workloads, not Linux. In Silicon Valley startups it’s easy to think the world has gone 100 per cent Linux and it’s just not true. And on the dev side, 8 million .NET developers.” Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told the Reg that Docker Windows work started two years ago. “We had our own internal container-type technology, but it made sense to leverage the open ecosystem that Docker had pioneered. That 63 per cent of server workloads on Windows, those same companies are also using Linux some place, so it makes sense to have a common technology.” In order to make Docker work, Microsoft had to build new container primitives into the Windows kernel. However it also made many contributions to the Docker Engine itself. “One of our kernel developers, John Howard, is a maintainer with committer rights,” said Russinovich. What about the Azure Container Service, currently Linux-only, will that now have a Windows option? “We don’t have a timeline yet, but I did demonstrate it at DockerCon,” Russinovich said. Some types of applications, such as those using Java or even the cross-platform .NET Core, can be run on either Windows or Linux; but Johnston and Russinovich will not be drawn on performance comparisons. “It’s a technology choice,” says Johnston. “But very soon we’ll see mixed application stacks and you’ll have native Windows and Java or Linux applications in the same application, each taking a role that’s optimal for them.” “That’s our use case, says Tyco CTO Daryll Fogal, a Microsoft customer. “We have a bunch of .NET developers, and we’ve got to try and get scalabilty of platforms. With the tools chain it’s very easy for .NET developers to get going. Second, when you get out of individual VMs and into Docker containers, you get a certain amount of scalability by choosing to be in that environment. We can do a little bit of refactoring and get it running in Docker containers, and then we’ve got time to go do the proper refactoring with a microservices architecture.” “The other part is this hybrid environment. We acquire a company, they’ve got Java developers. We have to have a hybrid solution.” Is Microsoft using Docker internally? “It’s hot off the press, we don’t have anything in production,” says Russinovich. “But we strongly believe that every new application should be run in containers. This applies to all Microsoft services as well. You’re going to see integration of Docker containers on Linux and Windows for all our services everywhere, in the fullness of time.” Why use Docker? “It boils down the fundamental benefits you get out of containers, which is the ecosystem of images, the developer experience, the reliability of the experience, so you can take something that worked in one environment, you move it to another one and it works, the efficiency you get by leveraging shared resources, and the resource isolation that controls what resources these applications are getting. Then you layer on microservices on top, and that’s what we view as cloud native,” said Russinovich.® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register Microsoft sets date for SQL Server on Linux Be patient: first code won't land until 2017 21 Comments Windows Server 2016: Leg up or lock in?

Andromeda to Be Featured on Google-Huawei Nexus Tablet and Pixel 3 GO Andromeda OS could be previewed next month Sep 27, 2016 07:53 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  A few days ago, an official from Google hinted that the October 4 event would have historical significance, similar to the launch of Android eight years ago. The comment set tongues wagging and some say that Google might preview Andromeda, a hybrid between Android and Chrome OS, during next month's event. A report by Android Police reveals that Google might feature Andromeda OS on an upcoming Pixel 2-in-1 laptop in Q3 2017. Apparently, the laptop that turns into a tablet is dubbed Pixel 3 and would run the new Andromeda OS, which is a version of Chrome OS baked into an Android-based OS. The Pixel 3 is also internally known as Bison and might come with a 12.3-inch touch display, an Intel m3 or Core i5 processor, 8 or 16GB of RAM, and a 10-hour battery life. Dual USB Type-C ports, stylus support and multiple sensors might be featured on the laptop that turns into a tablet. The price of the upcoming Pixel 3 could start at $799. Andromeda could debut on a Google-Huawei Nexus tablet Another report by 9to5Google shows that Andromeda would also launch on a 7-inch Google-Huawei Nexus tablet. There have been some reports about a new Nexus tablet in the past few months, but it seems that Google has been keeping the secret pretty well. Back in June, a Huawei executive said the company was working on another Nexus device, but not much on the upcoming tablet has been heard since then. So Google's big surprise for the October 4 event could be a Nexus tablet running Andromeda OS. The report suggests that the tablet could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820, 4GB of RAM, and a 13MP rear camera. 9to5Google also confirms that Google is testing the upcoming Andromeda OS on a Nexus 9 tablet, but that consumers won't be able to see the OS on this tablet model. Google is also expected to unveil the Pixel and Pixel XL soon. October 4 is exactly one week away, so expect more information to surface until the official event. #Google#Andromeda#Huawei Nexus#Pixel 3#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel Leaks in New Image Showing Off the Pixel Launcher Google Is Testing Andromeda Android-Chrome OS on Nexus 9 Google Official Builds Up Hype Around October 4 Event Specs for Google and Huawei's Rumored Nexus 7P Tablet Leaked Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Nokia's Return to Smartphone Business Confirmed for 2017 HTC 10 Evo to Be Announced on November 22 Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Goes on Sale at Sprint and Verizon Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update    Google's Andromeda OS could come soon New Android APKs Google Play Store APK: Updated November 18th, 16:08 GMT Google Spotlight Stories APK: Updated November 18th, 13:53 GMT YouTube Kids APK: Updated November 18th, 13:49 GMT WB Movies All Access APK: Updated November 18th, 13:29 GMT WWE SuperCard APK: Updated November 18th, 13:21 GMT The Guardian APK: Updated November 18th, 12:57 GMT Apple Music APK: Updated November 18th, 12:48 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   Qualcomm Announces Snapdragon 835, World's Fastest Mobile Processor more on: Qualcomm Snapdragon i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Which is a very good thing because the software will cost a lot of users more than they paid for Windows Server 2012, especially if they're slow to talk to Microsoft about their upgrade. Microsoft revealed its Windows Server 2016 licensing plan in December 2015, explaining that it wanted per-core licensing rather than the per-CPU licensing it had used in the past and revealing that costs would rise with the following table. Don't say you weren't warned: Microsoft flagged Windows Server 2016 would cost more than Windows Server 2012 in December 2015 It's not hard to see why Microsoft wants to make the change: newer CPUs in more powerful servers can run more virtual machines than ever before. Moving to per-core licensing therefore gives Microsoft a way to charge for the amount of computing power you tap. But moving to per-core licensing also means Microsoft benefits from the fact that new Xeons just have more cores these days. Take a look at Intel's list of fourth-gen Xeon E7s, for example, and you'll find just one model with fewer than eight cores. It's going to be hard to avoid extra costs when you buy new servers. So while Microsoft shareholders will like this change, analyst firm Gartner's view of the new regime is titled Changes to Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Licensing Will Increase Your Costs for Higher-Powered Servers.. Which is a pretty self-explanatory title. The document explains the situation with the following table. What Windows Server 2016 will cost, based on core count inside your servers The good news is there are still chances to avoid some of the extra costs. Gartner advises that if you talk to Microsoft well ahead of renewing software assurance, you may be able to “remain under the current per-processor model for another three years, thereby delaying the change to per core.” If that's not possible, the firm recommends planning your next round of server purchases sooner rather than later, to give yourself more time for budgeting. If you intend to roll over an existing agreement, you still have work to do because Microsoft is making “core grants” to help those on per-CPU licences move to the per-core world. But as the Windows Server 2016 licensing datasheet (PDF) explains, you need to conduct an inventory of your servers to get Microsoft's best offer when renewing licences. If you don't conduct that inventory, Microsoft will default to “8 core licenses per processor and 16 cores per server for each Standard and Enterprise edition license for servers they currently own.” Don't forget, too, that System Centre has also moved to per-core licensing. So there's another tab needed on your calculation spreadsheet. Cloud-herding A significant enterprise Windows Server user of The Register's acquaintance, who asked to remain anonymous, said he doesn't feel the price rise is justified by the new features in Windows Server 2016. “People are already paying software assurance, that's already the shiny new stuff tax,” he said. The user does have some sympathy for Microsoft, saying “I do understand it's tricky - but they should have just upped the Datacentre license as a whole, or put a mid tier license in that does something like allowing 16 VMs max per host to allow people to continue on if they wanted.” He's also concerned about the cost and complexity of the new regime, as more than one licence will be needed once you reach 16 cores on a machine. One last thing: Microsoft is also running a deal called the “Azure Hybrid Use Benefit” that “lets those using Windows Server with Software Assurance bring their on-premises licenses to Azure.” If you take up this offer, “Rather than paying the full price for new Windows Server virtual machines in Azure, you only pay for the base compute rate.” Microsoft says that can save 41 per cent. “For each Windows Server 2 processor license with Software Assurance, customers may run two virtual machines with up to 8 cores each, or one virtual machine with up to 16 cores, at the lower price.” Windows Server 2016's being billed as “Cloud-ready”. It looks like its licensing regime may also be readying you for using more cloud. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 20 Comments More from The Register VMware flings vCenter Server away from Windows, if you want vSphere update adds vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server Appliance migration tool 13 Comments Windows 7, Server 2008 'Convenience' update is anything but – it breaks VMware networking Virtualized VMXNet3 NICs borked by Microsoft install 26 Comments Windows Server-as-a-service: Microsoft lays out Server 2016's future Want to use Nano Server?

One of the biggest surprises comes from Romania, where the market is going through a rapid growth compared with the other countries and the with previous years. For ABC Data, Romania had one of the highest revenue growth, which means more than 79% in the first half of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The actual figures are consistent with the company’s strategy to strengthen the position and the build of a strong portofolio of  partners in Romania. The dynamic growth in the first half of 2016 has resulted from investments and activities undertaken on the Romanian market and the CEE region. In Romania, ABC Data Distribution has signed contracts with local key suppliers such as Lenovo, BenQ, TPVision (for Philips TVs), ASUS Components and Networking, Synology and Eaton. At the same time, the company completed some regional agreements with  3D Pixelio or Navitel (before the contract was signed with Intel). Such an approach has enabled the dynamic development of the ABC Data Distribution offer in Romania. So today it provides access to the local resellers in over 1,000 brands and approximately 220,000 products (a few months ago the offer was 180,000). No other vendor offers a portfolio so rich and diverse like this. “The rapid development of ABC Data can be explained better by the main product categories. The largest increase was driven by notebooks, desktops, networking, PC and gaming components. The Customers also were interested in buying wearable, those small and easy to use devices that connect to the smartphone. We note, however, an increase in the demand for Apple products and networking. These indicators show that our market is maturing from year to year. There is an undeniable need for the better equipment of high-speed connections to the Internet and to be integrated with the mobile devices” , said Alexander Gheorghiu (photo), ABC Data Distribution commercial director. “In our competitive domain it is impossible to stand still. We need to constantly develop. This is why, in addition to the strong strengthening of the Group, we will put a great emphasis on the regional diversification” , said Andrzej Kuźniak, vice president of the administration board of ABC Data. “We are the only distributor, in this part of Europe, which operates directly in eight European countries. The top traders appreciate that they have us as a partner and we can cooperate effectively not just in one or two countries but in the whole region “, said Andrzej Kuźniak. According to IDC and PMR, until 2018, the IT distribution revenues in Western Europe should increase from 95 billion dollars to around 100 billion, which means an increase of 5%. At the same time, in the EEC, the increase will be from 15 to 18 billion, more exactly of 20%.   About ABC Data   With over 25 years of experience, ABC Data is the only regional distributor of IT and electronics that operates directly on eight markets in Central and Eastern Europe: Romania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary.

English Cafe > Tech > Samsung Samsung ups ante in 3-D NAND war   Published : 2016-09-27 16:31 Updated : 2016-09-27 22:48 [THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest memory chipmaker, will reportedly start to install manufacturing tools for the 3-D NAND flash memory next month at its manufacturing complex being constructed in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The installation of the chip equipment is in line with Samsung’s efforts to speed up the launch of the manufacturing complex amid the neck-and-neck competition among global chip companies to secure an upper hand. Samsung aims to launch the manufacturing park in December or next January, several months earlier than previously scheduled, local business news outlet Chosun Biz reported.  The manufacturing complex will then be fully operational as early as March next year after completing a series of test runs in January. “As more semiconductor companies, including Intel and Toshiba, are increasing their bets on the memory chip business, Samsung seems to be trying to advance the launch of the complex and further get ahead,” said an industry source who wished to be unnamed. Samsung has poured 15.6 trillion won (US$14.2 billion), as part of the first batch of investments, to build the Pyeongtaek complex, which will incorporate the four chip manufacturing lines, dorms and other facilities on the 2.8 million square meter land. The total amount of investment in completing the construction of the complex is estimated to reach 100 trillion won. Samsung had previously planned to roll out DRAM chips from the first of the four production lines at the complex, but recently decided to churn out 3-D NAND flash memories, which are in high demand in recent months. The first manufacturing line is expected to boast a monthly production capacity of 90,000 to 100,000 wafer sheets. The 3-D NAND flash memory is deployed in the solid-state drive, a storage system which is increasingly replacing the hard disk drive. Samsung is the world’s largest SSD maker with its market share accounting for 37 percent. The global DRAM sector, on the other hand, suffered from months-long price drops due to oversupply and market saturation.

Well, now there are rumors that Google will unveil an Andromeda-powered 'Pixel 3' laptop, which will hit the market in Q3 2017.     The purported Pixel 3 would arrive with a 12.3-inch display, with Google wanting its ultra-thin laptop to be used in 'tablet' mode, too. We could see a Lenovo Yoga-type of flexibility with the Pixel 3, especially as it is supposedly powered by an Intel Core m3 or i5 processor, 32/128GB of storage and 8/16GB of RAM. We should see two models of Pixel 3, one with the Intel m3/32GB storage/8GB RAM and the higher-end model with Core i3/128GB storage/16GB RAM.   Android Police reports that there should be a fingerprint scanner and more on the Pixel 3:   Intel Core m3/Core i5 processor 8/16GB RAM 32/128GB storage Fingerprint scanner 2 x USB Type-C 3.5mm audio jack Stylus support Stereo speakers 10-hour (or so) battery Backlit keyboard Glass trackpad w/haptic feedback Andromeda OS   Google is looking to directly fight against Microsoft and Apple, with the Surface and iPad/MacBook line of products with its next-gen Andromeda OS and Pixel 3 laptop. We have some respectable specs which I'm sure will change between now and Q3 2017, and an extensive nearly neverending list of Google services and products that will power the Pixel 3 (and any Andromeda-based device).   If we do see Andromeda and it's as good as the rumors suggest - and even more excitedly if it's better than the rumors - we could be looking at the future of Google and its operating systems.

Now Google seems to be planning a new OS combining Chrome and Android codenamed ‘Andromeda’. According to Android Police, Google is testing Andromeda on an ultra-thin laptop known internally as Bison, which will be known as Pixel 3 when it launches.  Since Sundar Pichai took over as Google CEO, he has been constantly talking about efforts to bring Android features like Google Play Store to Chrome OS and the new initiative to merge both the OS seems valid. Android Police further reports that Bison will run Android and not Chrome OS leading to culmination of a new platform altogether. The Android Police report also states that the new OS will be more than just running Android apps on Chromebooks.

The device reportedly features a 12.3-inch display and will be powered by Intel’s Core m series processor. With seventh generation processors, Intel has almost killed m series by keeping only m7 in the offering. So expect the processor to upgrade from Core m to Core i processor. The device is reported to come with 32 or 128GB storage and two variants offering 8 or 16GB RAM. Android Police notes Google’s Bison features a backlit keyboard and glass trackpad with force detection similar to Apple’s latest MacBook. Google aims to make the device less than 10 mm thick, which should undercut every other tablet offering in the market. Google is reportedly planning to launch this device in Q3 2017.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 09.25.16. 09.25.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 pm. 7:00 pm Microsoft Bets Its Future on a Reprogrammable Computer Chip Prototype hardware for Project Catapult, a six-year effort to rebuild Microsoft's online empire for the next wave of AI---and more. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED It was December 2012, and Doug Burger was standing in front of Steve Ballmer, trying to predict the future. Ballmer, the big, bald, boisterous CEO of Microsoft, sat in the lecture room on the ground floor of Building 99, home base for the company’s blue-sky R&D lab just outside Seattle. The tables curved around the outside of the room in a U-shape, and Ballmer was surrounded by his top lieutenants, his laptop open. Burger, a computer chip researcher who had joined the company four years earlier, was pitching a new idea to the execs. He called it Project Catapult. Doug Burger. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED The tech world, Burger explained, was moving into a new orbit. In the future, a few giant Internet companies would operate a few giant Internet services so complex and so different from what came before that these companies would have to build a whole new architecture to run them. They would create not just the software driving these services, but the hardware, including servers and networking gear. Project Catapult would equip all of Microsoft’s servers—millions of them—with specialized chips that the company could reprogram for particular tasks. But before Burger could even get to the part about the chips, Ballmer looked up from his laptop. When he visited Microsoft Research, Ballmer said, he expected updates on R&D, not a strategy briefing. “He just started grilling me,” Burger says. Microsoft had spent 40 years building PC software like Windows, Word, and Excel. It was only just finding its feet on the Internet. And it certainly didn’t have the tools and the engineers needed to program computer chips—a task that’s difficult, time consuming, expensive, and kind of weird. Microsoft programming computer chips was like Coca Cola making shark fin soup. The current incarnation of Project Catapult. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Burger—trim, only slightly bald, and calmly analytical, like so many good engineers—pushed back. He told Ballmer that companies like Google and Amazon were already moving in this direction. He said the world’s hardware makers wouldn’t provide what Microsoft needed to run its online services. He said that Microsoft would fall behind if it didn’t build its own hardware. Ballmer wasn’t buying it. But after awhile, another voice joined the discussion. This was Qi Lu, who runs Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Lu’s team had been talking to Burger about reprogrammable computer chips for almost two years. Project Catapult was more than possible, Lu said: His team had already started. Today, the programmable chips that Burger and Lu believed would transform the world—called field programmable gate arrays—are here. FPGAs already underpin Bing, and in the coming weeks, they will drive new search algorithms based on deep neural networks—artificial intelligence modeled on the structure of the human brain—executing this AI several orders of magnitude faster than ordinary chips could. As in, 23 milliseconds instead of four seconds of nothing on your screen. FPGAs also drive Azure, the company’s cloud computing service. And in the coming years, almost every new Microsoft server will include an FPGA. That’s millions of machines across the globe. “This gives us massive capacity and enormous flexibility, and the economics work,” Burger says. “This is now Microsoft’s standard, worldwide architecture.” Catapult team members Adrian Caulfield, Eric Chung, Doug Burger, and Andrew PutnamClayton Cotterell for WIRED This isn’t just Bing playing catch-up with Google. Project Catapult signals a change in how global systems will operate in the future. From Amazon in the US to Baidu in China, all the Internet giants are supplementing their standard server chips—central processing units, or CPUs—with alternative silicon that can keep pace with the rapid changes in AI. Microsoft now spends between $5 and $6 billion a year for the hardware needed to run its online empire. So this kind of work is “no longer just research,” says Satya Nadella, who took over as Microsoft’s CEO in 2014. “It’s an essential priority.” That’s what Burger was trying to explain in Building 99. And it’s what drove him and his team to overcome years of setbacks, redesigns, and institutional entropy to deliver a new kind of global supercomputer. A Brand New, Very Old Kind of Computer Chip In December of 2010, Microsoft researcher Andrew Putnam had left Seattle for the holidays and returned home to Colorado Springs. Two days before Christmas, he still hadn’t started shopping. As he drove to the mall, his phone rang. It was Burger, his boss. Burger was going to meet with Bing execs right after the holiday, and he needed a design for hardware that could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms on FPGAs. Putnam pulled into the nearest Starbucks and drew up the plans. It took him about five hours, and he still had time for shopping. Burger, 47, and Putnam, 39, are both former academics. Burger spent nine years as a professor of computer science at the University of Texas, Austin, where he specialized in microprocessors and designed a new kind of chip called EDGE. Putnam had worked for five years as a researcher at the University of Washington, where he experimented with FPGAs, programmable chips that had been around for decades but were mostly used as a way of prototyping other processors. Burger brought Putnam to Microsoft in 2009, where they started exploring the idea that these chips could actually accelerate online services. Project Catapult Version 1, or V1, the hardware that Doug Burger and team tested in a data center on Microsoft’s Seattle campus. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Even their boss didn’t buy it. “Every two years, FGPAs are ‘finally going to arrive,’” says Microsoft Research vice president Peter Lee, who oversees Burger’s group. “So, like any reasonable person, I kind of rolled my eyes when this was pitched.” But Burger and his team believed this old idea’s time had come, and Bing was the perfect test case. Microsoft’s search engine is a single online service that runs across thousands of machines. Each machine is driven by a CPU, and though companies like Intel continue to improve them, these chips aren’t keeping pace with advances in software, in large part because of the new wave in artificial intelligence. Services like Bing have outstripped Moore’s Law, the canonical notion that the number of transistors in a processor doubles every 18 months. Turns out, you can’t just throw more CPUs at the problem. But on the other hand, it’s generally too expensive to create specialized, purpose-built chips for every new problem. FPGAs bridge the gap. They let engineers build chips that are faster and less energy-hungry than an assembly-line, general-purpose CPU, but customizable so they handle the new problems of ever-shifting technologies and business models. At that post-holiday meeting, Burger pitched Bing’s execs on FPGAs as a low-power way of accelerating searches. The execs were noncommittal. So over the next several months, Burger and team took Putnam’s Christmas sketch and built a prototype, showing that it could run Bing’s machine learning algorithms about 100 times faster. “That’s when they really got interested,” says Jim Larus, another member of the team back then who’s now a dean at Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne. “They also started giving us a really hard time.” Tech Titan Architectures The Epic Story of Dropbox’s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire Netflix Isn’t Made for the US Anymore—It’s for the Whole World Intel Reinvents Itself to Stay King in a Changing World The prototype was a dedicated box with six FPGAs, shared by a rack full of servers. If the box went on the frizz, or if the machines needed more than six FPGAs—increasingly likely given the complexity of the machine learning models—all those machines were out of luck. Bing’s engineers hated it. “They were right,” Larus says. So Burger’s team spent many more months building a second prototype. This one was a circuit board that plugged into each server and included only one FPGA. But it also connected to all the other FPGA boards on all the other servers, creating a giant pool of programmable chips that any Bing machine could tap into. That was the prototype that got Qi Lu on board. He gave Burger the money to build and test over 1,600 servers equipped with FPGAs. The team spent six months building the hardware with help from manufacturers in China and Taiwan, and they installed the first rack in an experimental data center on the Microsoft campus. Then, one night, the fire suppression system went off by accident. They spent three days getting the rack back in shape—but it still worked. Over several months in 2013 and 2014, the test showed that Bing’s “decision tree” machine-learning algorithms ran about 40 times faster with the new chips. By the summer of 2014, Microsoft was publicly saying it would soon move this hardware into its live Bing data centers. And then the company put the brakes on. Searching for More Than Bing Bing dominated Microsoft’s online ambitions in the early part of the decade, but by 2015 the company had two other massive online services: the business productivity suite Office 365 and the cloud computing service Microsoft Azure. And like all of their competitors, Microsoft executives realized that the only efficient way of running a growing online empire is to run all services on the same foundation. If Project Catapult was going to transform Microsoft, it couldn’t be exclusive to Bing. It had to work inside Azure and Office 365, too. The problem was, Azure executives didn’t care about accelerating machine learning. They needed help with networking. The traffic bouncing around Azure’s data centers was growing so fast, the service’s CPUs couldn’t keep pace. Eventually, people like Mark Russinovich, the chief architect on Azure, saw that Catapult could help with this too—but not the way it was designed for Bing. His team needed programmable chips right where each server connected to the primary network, so they could process all that traffic before it even got to the server. The first prototype of the FPGA architecture was a single box shared by a rack of servers (Version 0). Then the team switched to giving individual servers their own FPGAs (Version 1). And then they put the chips between the servers and the overall network (Version 2).WIRED So the FPGA gang had to rebuild the hardware again. With this third prototype, the chips would sit at the edge of each server, plugging directly into the network, while still creating pool of FPGAs that was available for any machine to tap into. That started to look like something that would work for Office 365, too. Project Catapult was ready to go live at last. Larus describes the many redesigns as an extended nightmare—not because they had to build a new hardware, but because they had to reprogram the FPGAs every time. “That is just horrible, much worse than programming software,” he says. “Much more difficult to write. Much more difficult to get correct.” It’s finicky work, like trying to change tiny logic gates on the chip. Now that the final hardware is in place, Microsoft faces that same challenge every time it reprograms these chips. “It’s a very different way of seeing the world, of thinking about the world,” Larus says. But the Catapult hardware costs less than 30 percent of everything else in the server, consumes less than 10 percent of the power, and processes data twice as fast as the company could without it. The rollout is massive. Microsoft Azure uses these programmable chips to route data. On Bing, which an estimated 20 percent of the worldwide search market on desktop machines and about 6 percent on mobile phones, the chips are facilitating the move to the new breed of AI: deep neural nets. And according to one Microsoft employee, Office 365 is moving toward using FPGAs for encryption and compression as well as machine learning—for all of its 23.1 million users. Eventually, Burger says, these chips will power all Microsoft services. Wait—This Actually Works? “It still stuns me,” says Peter Lee, “that we got the company to do this.” Lee oversees an organization inside Microsoft Research called NExT, short for New Experiences and Technologies. After taking over as CEO, Nadella personally pushed for the creation of this new organization, and it represents a significant shift from the 10-year reign of Ballmer. It aims to foster research that can see the light of day sooner rather than later—that can change the course of Microsoft now rather than years from now. Project Catapult is a prime example. And it is part of a much larger change across the industry. “The leaps ahead,” Burger says, “are coming from non-CPU technologies.” Peter Lee. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED All the Internet giants, including Microsoft, now supplement their CPUs with graphics processing units, chips designed to render images for games and other highly visual applications. When these companies train their neural networks to, for example, recognize faces in photos—feeding in millions and millions of pictures—GPUs handle much of the calculation. Some giants like Microsoft are also using alternative silicon to execute their neural networks after training. And even though it’s crazily expensive to custom-build chips, Google has gone so far as to design its own processor for executing neural nets, the tensor processing unit. With its TPUs, Google sacrifices long-term flexibility for speed. It wants to, say, eliminate any delay when recognizing commands spoken into smartphones. The trouble is that if its neural networking models change, Google must build a new chip. But with FPGAs, Microsoft is playing a longer game. Though an FPGA isn’t as fast as Google’s custom build, Microsoft can reprogram the silicon as needs change. The company can reprogram not only for new AI models, but for just about any task. And if one of those designs seems likely to be useful for years to come, Microsoft can always take the FPGA programming and build a dedicated chip. A newer version of the final hardware, V2, a card that slots into the end of each Microsoft server and connects directly to the network. Clayton Cotterell for WIRED Microsoft’s services are so large, and they use so many FPGAs, that they’re shifting the worldwide chip market. The FPGAs come from a company called Altera, and Intel executive vice president Diane Bryant tells me that Microsoft is why Intel acquired Altera last summer—a deal worth $16.7 billion, the largest acquisition in the history of the largest chipmaker on Earth. By 2020, she says, a third of all servers inside all the major cloud computing companies will include FPGAs. It’s a typical tangle of tech acronyms. CPUs. GPUs. TPUs. FPGAs. But it’s the subtext that matters. With cloud computing, companies like Microsoft and Google and Amazon are driving so much of the world’s technology that those alternative chips will drive the wider universe of apps and online services. Lee says that Project Catapult will allow Microsoft to continue expanding the powers of its global supercomputer until the year 2030. After that, he says, the company can move toward quantum computing. Later, when we talk on the phone, Nadella tells me much the same thing. They’re reading from the same Microsoft script, touting a quantum-enabled future of ultrafast computers. Considering how hard it is to build a quantum machine, this seems like a pipe dream. But just a few years ago, so did Project Catapult. Correction: This story originally implied that the Hololens headset was part of Microsoft’s NExT organization. It was not. Go Back to Top.

Corrales Comment News Reporting as if Democracy Matters Home Welcome to Corrales Comment Publication Dates Subscribe CC Advertise! Ad Rates Archived Articles CALENDAR COP21 Reporting From Paris Upper Meadowlark Design Goes Out for Contract Details Published: 26 September 2016 A contract to design big changes for upper Meadowlark lane from Loma Larga to the Rio Rancho boundary has been advertised.Village Administrator John Avila said at the September 13 Village Council meeting that state officials have okayed the Village contracting for design and engineering for the trails project along Meadowlark without having to await final approval on right-of-way certification, “and that is around the corner as well.” The project funded through the Mid-Region Council of Governments and the N.M. Department of Transportation (NMDOT) will realign and rebuild upper Meadowlark to include bicycle paths and horse trails as well as improved drainage and traffic safety features. When funding was secured last year, the design work was to have been concluded by now, with early-stage construction to be under way by the end of this year. On-the-ground work is now expected next year. Months of delays resulted when NMDOT imposed new requirements for a variety of clearances and certifications. One of those requirements insisted that Village officials declare and certify that the work along upper Meadowlark would not conflict with any railroad crossing. This summer Avila reported that the highway department had relaxed its insistence that no work or expenditure be initiated until all certifications were submitted and approved. Those final clearances and issuance of a request for proposals could be done concurrently, he explained. But the right-of-way considerations will have to include whatever changes will be needed at the Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersections, he cautioned. Early in the planning process for upper Meadowlark, NMDOT and local officials conducted a traffic safety audit for that intersection. That 2014 exercise concluded with recommendations for improvements, one of which was to  build a traffic circle, or roundabout, there. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXXIII, No.4 April 5, 2014 “Traffic Circle for Meadowlark at Loma Larga?”) Even if the pending right-of-way certification for the Meadowlark-Loma Larga intersection does not include property for a traffic circle, it would likely include areas along Loma Larga for stormwater ponding and discharge. In September 2013, the consulting firm hired to suggest ways to improve upper Meadowlark Lane, Architectural Research Consultants, called for bike riders to use the same downhill driving lane as autos, or divert to the future pedestrian path along the south side of the re-configured roadway. Appearing before the mayor and Village Council at their September 10, 2013 meeting, the firm’s Steve Burstein presented a revised “Option A”  that showed a five-foot wide bike lane adjacent to the westbound driving lane, while eastbound bike riders would be expected to come down in the same regular traffic lane used by motor vehicles. If cyclists did not want to “take the lane” with regular traffic coming down  hill, they would be encouraged to  bike along the proposed pedestrian path along the south side of Meadowlark. The revision would basically shift the pavement approximately two feet to the north from where it is now, he explained. Among the advantages of the new plan, cyclists using the bike paths along the Rio Rancho section of Meadowlark Lane would have a continuous connection to designated routes coming down into Corrales. Downhill bike riders would be informed to merge with regular vehicle traffic, or veer off onto the pedestrian trail. Then-Mayor Phil Gasteyer said he thought the revised recommendation would be “much more acceptable to the whole neighborhood.” Some residents along the north side of upper Meadowlark had objected to routing both uphill and downhill bike riders to a future path on the north side of the road. They said they feared pulling into the path of fast bike riders as they left their driveways and tried to enter traffic. In the new plan, downhill cyclists would use the eastbound driving lane or  use the pedestrian path along the south side of the road. The change was endorsed by the Corrales Bicycle, Pedestrian Advisory Commission as well, following communications with Burstein and his planners. At that point, the plans were almost purely hypothetical since no funds had been allocated to tackle the re-make of upper Meadowlark, estimated subsequently at $1.18 million.  Recommendations from the planning sessions in summer 2013 produced a preferred alternative with provisions listed below.  The Village’s pending RFP may, or may not, call for all of these recommended features. The recommendations have four major themes: traffic-calming features; bicycle lanes and trails for pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians; drainage; and landscaping. Recommendations were as follows. Traffic-calming features. • Major traffic-calming features should be spaced along the street at a distance of approximately 500 feet. This is the approximate distance needed to moderate traffic at the 25 mph speed limit. The need for adequate turning radii into driveways resulted in spacing of traffic-calming features that varied from 500 feet in some segments. • Landscape islands and narrow lanes are the main thematic features for the street. The islands would typically be 10-feet wide, sufficient to grow significantly sized native bushes, if not irrigated, and to include infiltration galleries. The separated travel lanes would narrow down to 20-feet in width, and have ‘choker’ mini-rolled  curbs. The islands create horizontal shift somewhat similar to the chicane, while not creating a true weaving pattern. The 60-foot right-of-way constricts the opportunity for broad, sweeping chicanes, given the desire to also accommodate trails and landscaping (particularly in the steeper ares to the west), while leaving safe lines-of-sight for driveways. Public art can be placed in the landscape islands, subject to Village approval. The village should encourage neighbors and organized groups to adopt islands to help maintain them, thus building community and helping the village. • Speed tables should be installed in two locations where major traffic-calming features are needed, but too little space is available due to driveways. • Choker mini-rolled curbs should be installed to prevent vehicles from using the shoulder and avoiding the table. They are known to better accommodate emergency vehicles compared to speed humps. Each speed table extends 22 feet. At least one speed table needs to be staggered in order to allow drainage down the middle of the street, similar to the speed humps in place. This speed table will require design modification from a normal speed table to accommodate the inverted crown. A speed table can span the street continuously and function more effectively if a grate into a storm drain is located upstream from it. • Regular travel lanes should be reduced in width from the current 12 feet or 13 feet to 11 feet to slow traffic speed and make available additional space for trails and landscaping. The lanes should be demarcated with double yellow center paint linea and white outer paint lines. • While no curb and gutter is planned in this scheme, the vegetative strip adjacent to the street should contain native planting, using a native seed mix similar to what NMDOT routinely uses, and shrubs while leaving a few unplanted shoulder ares designated for use in case of accidents or emergencies. This outer vegetation strip narrows the drivers’ perspective and should help reduce speed. The Village must take care not to allow vegetation to grow too tall and block visibility of the roadway and trails. Some islands and strips should be far enough away from driveways to allow for large vegetation that does not limit needed sight distance. • The crosswalk island and gateway monument located at the Thompson Fence Line will constrict lane width to 10 feet, inform motorists that they are entering the village and caution them to slow down. Some of the crosswalk island extends into Rio Rancho, requiring the City of Rio Rancho’s cooperation. Commercial truck restrictions should be posted at this location. The structures provide safety for pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians who cross the street and enter the trailheads for the Intel Trail and Thompson Fence Line Trail. We recommend a traffic control feature to heighten motorists’ awareness of the trail crossings, such as a radar board. The aesthetic components of vegetation or artwork of these structures demonstrate pride in the Corrales character. Bicycle Lanes and Trails for Pedestrians, Bicyclists and Equestrians. • We propose a 5-foot wide west-bound bicycle lane. A bicycle lane is considered a safer facility than a side path on streets with numerous driveways or cross streets. Commuter and faster recreationist bicyclists prefer a bike lane over a shared pedestrian-bicycle trail.  The bicycle lane should be routed on the outside of the traffic island choker curbs. • We propose two trails: a paved 5--foot trail for pedestrians and bicyclists, and a natural soil horse trail. The south side is more suitable for the bicycle pedestrian and horse trails because it has fewer driveway crossings than the north side (8 compared to 14), is more level and will require less grading or additional retaining structures to accommodate a trail. Without the need to reconstruct the entire street, there is space for  vegetative strips to separate the bike, foot and horse traffic from motor vehicles. Optimally, the street would be moved several feet to the north. If the street would need to be reconstructed, we recommend shifting the centerline approximately two feet to the north. A 5-foot wide paved pedestrian and bicycle trail should be located on the south side of the street. The trail should accommodate walkers and slower, less experienced bicyclists. The pedestrian/ bike trail should comply with ADA, and be usable by wheelchairs as well as bicyclists, although planners expect trail users will be mostly pedestrians. To comply with ADA regulations, the trail should be paved and at least 5 feet wide. The trail will provide an off-street means for bicyclists to descend the hill if they do not want to share the eastbound lane with motorists. Bicyclists should ride slowly because the trail crosses driveways. Driveways will need to be demarcated on the trail with paint; both trail users and those pulling into and out of the driveways must be cautious in this ‘mutual yield’ situation. In some areas, property walls may need to be lowered to improve the light of sight of motorists pulling out of driveways. The paved trail will provide safe walking for residents of the street and accommodate all foot traffic to the Intel and Thompson Fence Line Trails. The equestrian trail can be successfully laid out in an interesting way in the Upper West Meadowlark Lane Charrette Report of September 2013, varying terrain on the north side of the street at places meandering away from the street, at other places steeper than the street. The equestrian trail would be closest to the north right-of-way edge, while generally leaving some vegetative space between the trail and private property lines. This trail would have the greatest variability in its layout within the terrain (steep in places, and possibly routed on terraces) with only one established route in order to retain vegetation and minimize erosion. Natural sand and gravel in the area, but mostly sand, are preferable to crusher fines because horses could churn up the crusher fines, which would not be as durable. This design aspect can be reconsidered. • We propose that both motorized vehicles and bicyclists share the eastbound travel lane with signage and ‘sharrow’ pavement markings. Bicyclists can travel at or near the 25 mile pre  hour speed limit down the hill, a comparable speed for motorized vehicles. Drainage. The inverted crown street design appears to adequately convey stormwater, with the primary exception of flooding one or more houses at the lowest area, which should be addressed site-specifically. Based on anecdotal information from the Village and most charrette participants about the success of this design, the ARC team recommends its retention. Some participants did express a preference for a curb and gutter system. As mentioned, there has been no hydrologic study of the street, so this critical design component could be reconsidered in a future engineering design project. • Infiltration galleries in the landscape island should be used in some landscape islands to provide some capture of stormwater for landscaping and groundwater recharge, while much of the stormwater would  flow through the gallery feature. The Village should select several islands based on needed dimensions and available budget. The island would be designed to be below surface grade, but with curb and side inlets for stormwater drainage. The island would combine plantings of native grasses and shrubs with rocks. To preserve the street pavement, the edges of the island will need a concrete footer. Since infiltration galleries with landscape vegetation are a relatively new and innovative feature in New Mexico, a feasibility study should be conducted to determine their appropriateness and best design in Upper Meadowlark Lane. If irrigation is available, trees could also be planted in selected landscape islands or vegetative strips. • The total right-of-way gains impervious surface area due to the addition of a bicycle trail and paved bicycle-pedestrial trail, even with narrower travel lanes. Most stormwater off the trail should drain into the vegetative strip. • At the bottom of Upper Meadowlark, a grate and storm drain should divert water into the bar ditch flowing north on the west side of Loma Larga Road. This element must be located west of the intersection by roughly 200 feet to intercept stormwater before it can leave the right-of-way and flood private property. The engineering design for the Meadowlark Lane and Loma Larga Road intersection will also address drainage in this area. Consequently, we recommend consideration of this drainage element while an alternative may be chosen. • Property owners at the top of Upper Meadowlark Lane on the north side are responsible for detaining their ‘net new’ stormwater rather than allowing it to flow directly into the street. Modifications on those properties should be made to accomplish this. Landscaping Recommendations. The islands and vegetative strips should have a landscape scheme that accomplishes narrowing drivers’ perspective, thus lowering traffic speeds, enhancing the aesthetics of the street, providing separations of trails, and improving stormwater infiltration.Native bushes should be the primary vegetative palette. Some varieties include: four-wind salt bush (dominant vegetation); chamisa; Apache plume; sagebrush. Bushes planted will require some starter irrigation. Alternatively, trees would be a great component of the streetscape if water line and irrigation were installed. The caliper of tree species selected for the street should be limited in size in order to minimize safety concerns. Native seed mix used by NMDOT may be appropriate for disturbed areas. Adjacent property owners should be asked to collaborate with the Village on final design and maintenance efforts. Public art or sculpture can be displayed in islands. Benches may be installed along trails. Upper Meadowlark and Loma Larga Road intersection. Various recommendations in this plan interface with the design work soon to begin on this intersection. Phasing. We recommend that the Village consider several phasing options. It should be recognized that splitting the Upper Meadowlark Lane project into phases prolongs construction impacts. Results of the 2014 road safety audit for the Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersection ordered by the N.M. Department of Transportation and contracted to HDR Engineering called for a return to the four-way stop, rather than giving Loma Larga drivers unrestricted passage, and later, a traffic circle. At one point, the road safety audit (RSA) completed in 2014 was to be the first step in modifications to the intersection and, presumably, to the rest of upper Meadowlark on up to the Rio Rancho boundary. Proposals are also on the table for better traffic-calming measures along upper Meadowlark and lane (or path) accommodations for bicycle riders, pedestrians and equestrians. In March, Village officials submitted a request to the state highway department to use its Municipal Arterials Program (MAP) funds to engineer and construct pathways, drainage improvements and other amenities for upper Meadowlark. The request was turned down. (See Corrales Comment, Vol.XXXIII, No.3, March 22, 2014 “Upper Meadowlark To Get Improved Drainage.”) That submission followed recommendations from a planning charrette conducted by Architectural Research Consultants, which followed a citizens’ task force named to resolve long-standing conflicts over whether to use the extra-wide Village-owned right-of-way along upper Meadowlark for bike lanes. All of that followed the Village Council’s decision to turn back a 2009 grant of $214,000 from the Mid-Region Council of Governments to construct bike paths along upper Meadowlark.  Residents along Meadowlark for decades have complained about unbearable traffic along their residential street, especially due to vehicles headed to or out of Rio Rancho. Adding bicycle traffic, pedestrians and horses on the road past their homes would only make matters worse, they argued. Neighbor versus neighbor conflicts among upper Meadowlark residents over what, if anything, to do about better using the Village’s 60-foot right of way mellowed over the past 18 months. Meadowlark resident Pam Cox, who chaired the citizens’ task force, was also named to the RSA team, along with Michelle Anderson, a traffic engineer who serves on the Corrales Planning and Zoning Commission, former Village Administrator Chris Allen and Bonnie Bagley, representing equestrian interests. The RSA team also included four engineers from the highway department, two from HDR Engineering and Mid-Region Council of Governments transportation planner Julie Luna, as well as Village Administrator John Avila. In the team’s conclusions section, they present “a wish-list of projects they wanted to be implemented. The projects were separated into two categories: short-term and long-term. The preliminary wish-list for implementation is as follows: “• All-way stop at the intersection (short-term) “• Pavement markings, such as crosswalks and new striping of existing lane layouts (short-term) “• Signs indicating pedestrians, equestrian users and bicycles have right-of-way (short-term) “• Enforcement of existing speed limits and other regulations such as weight limits for heavy vehicles (short-term) “• Flashing beacons with push-buttons (mid-term) “• Detectable Speed Signs (mid-term) “• Pedestrian crossing separate from the intersection (long-term) “ Installation of roundabout (long-term) “• Re-alignment of intersection approaches (long-term).” The report included an illustration of how a traffic circle would be integrated into the Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersection. Found on Page 22 of the report, the illustration superimposes a 100-foot diameter roundabout over an aerial photograph of the intersection.  An alternative to the traffic circle also is illustrated in the preliminary RSA report. Turning lanes could be added to the existing intersection configuration, such as a free right-turn lane from northbound Loma Larga onto eastbound Meadowlark, and a similar continuous right-turn lane from southbound Loma Larga onto westbound Meadowlark. Villagers went around and around about a proposed traffic circle at the Corrales Road-Meadowlark intersection a decade ago and then again about five years ago. The idea collapsed over the amount of property that would have to be taken from nearby landowners to accommodate an appropriate diameter traffic circle (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXVII, No. 1, February 21, 2009 “Corrales To Seek Funds for Meadowlark Traffic Circle.”) Back then, state highway officials were generally skeptical about the value of roundabouts. That attitude seems to have changed as the metro area and the state have gained more experience with them. The Loma Larga-Meadowlark intersection was selected for a road safety audit, as the report notes, after “safety concerns have been brought to the NMDOT by members of the Village of Corrales community and users of the Loma Larga Road/Meadowlark Lane intersection.… Some of the concerns brought to the NMDOT include: “• Vehicle crashes (46 reported from 2008 to 2013); • Loma Larga Road has long stretches  with no traffic control devices (approximately 7,500 feet north of and 6,200 feet south of, the intersection with Meadowlark Lane), leading to increased travel speeds; • Eastbound Meadowlark Lane has very high approach volumes, both in average daily traffic and peak hours; • There are no sidewalks or multi-use trails along either roadway; • Sight distance from eastbound Meadowlark Lane looking onto north and south onto Loma Larga Road is partially restricted due to curves in roadway.” Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Analyst claims HoloLens “sales outlook slipping” -4 by Surur  @mspoweruser Sep 26, 2016 at 20:00 GMT2 months ago Microsoft has been shipping a commercial version of their HoloLens Augmented Reality headset for some months now, but has refrained from releasing any sales numbers. Today analyst company Nomura’s Donnie Teng  in an investor note however complained about weak shipments of the device, and has downgraded supplier Himax, noting that “meaningful volume” of the $3000 headset may not happen until the second half of 2017, and that the sales outlook for HoloLens was slipping. Teng had earlier upgraded the component supplier (who supplies “liquid crystal on silicon,” and “wafer level optics”) on the expectation of better performance of the “the major AR device” and a positive “future AR/VR trend.” Microsoft may not be looking to make the HoloLens a market success by itself, but rather working to establish their Windows Holographic framework as the OS as choice for other AR/VR OEM. Intel recently announced Project Alloy, an all-in-one VR headset powered by Windows Holographic platform. It is a fully untethered headset and it includes CPU, graphics, batteries, and sensors just like HoloLens. It also has Intel RealSense cameras built into it allowing you to see the outside environment. Intel has built this as a reference platform for OEMs allowing them to create new VR/Mixed-Reality hardware powered by Windows Holographic. Intel will open source Project Alloy details by 2H 2017 and some analysts expecting up to 15 devices in H2 2017 running the Windows 10-based OS.

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuMore NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based financial innovation start-up R3 announced on Monday that it and eight banks, including HSBC and State Street, have successfully tested a blockchain platform powered by Intel Corp technology for bond transactions. The platform featured advanced smart contract technology that enabled trading, matching, and settlement of U.S. Treasury bonds, as well as automated coupon payments and redemption, R3 said in a statement. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin, enabling data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its perceived usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. "Our goal at R3 is to bring our members together with the strongest technology players and work collaboratively to evaluate and accelerate this technology to production using real-world use cases," said Tim Grant, chief executive officer of R3's Lab and Research Center. R3 is leading a consortium of more than 60 of the world's largest financial institutions created to develop commercial applications of blockchain technology for the financial services industry. The R3 consortium members involved in U.S. Treasury debt project included CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. The blockchain trial was undertaken at R3's Lab and Research Center. R3, Intel and each of the banks used physical, "non-cloud-based nodes" hosted across the U.S., Canada, Asia, Australia and Europe to interact and simulate U.S. Treasury trading on the blockchain.   (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Alan Crosby) Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News Microsoft cuts top Xbox One games by 40% in Black Friday deals The Verge iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far BGR News New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech A smart home for Fido: Dog Parker offers safe place to keep canines in the big city Digital Trends This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Credit Zhejiang Daily / AP Given the recent ubiquity of cyber-scandals—Colin Powell’s stolen e-mails, Simone Biles’s leaked medical records, half a billion plundered Yahoo accounts—you might get the impression that hackers can already break into just about any computer they want. But the situation could be a lot worse. The encryption methods that protect everything from online shopping to diplomatic communications remain effectively impregnable when properly implemented, even if, in practice, there are frequent breaches—whistle-blowers, careless clicks, and so on. This relatively happy state of affairs will not, however, endure. Scientists around the world are inching toward the development of a fully functioning quantum computer, a new type of machine that would, on its first day of operation, be capable of cracking the Internet’s most widely used codes. Precisely when that day will arrive is unclear, but it could be in as little as ten years. Experts call the countdown Y2Q: “years to quantum.” This looming but uncertain deadline hovered in the air at the Hilton Toronto last week, where government officials, cyber-security researchers, and representatives from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Intel gathered for an international workshop on “quantum-safe cryptography.” Michele Mosca, a professor at the University of Waterloo’s Institute for Quantum Computing and the co-host of the workshop, pegged the odds of reaching Y2Q by 2026 at one in seven, rising to one in two by 2031. But the exact date doesn’t really matter, because the time needed to invent, battle-test, standardize, and roll out new security algorithms Internet-wide might be just as long. Brian LaMacchia, the head of security and cryptography at Microsoft Research, has a working estimate of 2030. “The people who try to build quantum computers, who sit on the floor upstairs from me, said fifteen years last year,” he told me. “So I said, O.K., let’s work backwards from that. And I’m out of time.” Classical computers encode information as a series of bits, which can be either 0 or 1, and then manipulate those bits according to simple rules. A quantum computer isn’t just a faster or better classical computer; it’s fundamentally different. Instead of bits, it stores information as qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at once. That’s a consequence of the quantum-mechanical property of superposition, which allows physical objects to exist in multiple states, or even be in different places, at one time. Thus, two qubits can represent four states simultaneously (00, 01, 10, 11), and a hundred qubits can represent 1.3 quadrillion quadrillion. This quantum peculiarity allows the computer to find patterns in huge data sets very quickly—to get detailed information about a forest without looking at all the trees, as Mosca put it. The main mathematical challenge in breaking current codes is factoring very large numbers, which for classical computers is the equivalent of trying combination after combination to see if it opens a lock. As the keys get longer, the locks get tougher. It took about two years on hundreds of computers to unlock a single instance of the RSA-768 algorithm, which, as its name suggests, requires a key that is seven hundred and sixty-eight bits long. Doing the same for its more secure cousin, RSA-1024, would take about a thousand times longer, and RSA-4096 is effectively out of reach. A quantum computer, on the other hand, would tackle such problems effortlessly. When quantum computing was first proposed, in the nineteen-eighties, it was mostly a theoretical curiosity. That changed in 1994, when Peter Shor, then at A.T. & T.’s Bell Labs, demonstrated how it could apply to cryptography. Once the significance of Shor’s work became clear, the race to actually build a quantum computer became one of the hottest tickets in physics. Among the biggest players was the U.S. government, which by 2007 was spending about sixty million dollars a year on quantum-computing research. It didn’t just want to build one; it also needed to know whether anyone else was getting close. After all, top-secret messages sent today could still be embarrassing or dangerous if they were intercepted and stored, then decrypted by a device built a decade from now. So far, the best quantum computers have just a handful of qubits—five, for example, in a system that I.B.M. announced earlier this year. The company expects to scale up to between fifty and a hundred qubits within the next decade, which would be powerful but still short of the thousand or so that LaMacchia estimates would represent a serious cryptographic threat. (D-Wave Systems, a Canadian company that caused a stir when it announced a thousand-qubit computer last year, uses an alternative approach to quantum computing that isn’t suitable for code-breaking.) This may sound like painfully modest progress after two decades, but it has been steady enough in the past few years to shift the underlying question from if to when. The “Y2Q” handle makes explicit the parallels between the quantum threat and the Y2K bug, which, at the turn of the millennium, was supposed to make the world’s computers think it was 1900 again, bringing civilization to a grinding halt. In the popular imagination, Y2K has become a punch line, a prophecy of doom unfulfilled, like the Maya calendar turned out to be in 2012. But for many of the people at the cryptography workshop—those responsible for establishing international standards for safe computing or signing off on data-security protocols for hundred-billion-dollar companies—Y2K was a relatively minor event only because the hysteria that preceded it mobilized an estimated three hundred to five hundred billion dollars in preventive action by governments and corporations. So far, Y2Q has failed to generate quite that level of interest. One big difference is that it was clear, if inconvenient, what needed to be done to avoid Y2K. The best way to ward off a quantum attack, on the other hand, is still very much up for debate. The simplest approach is basically mathematical: come up with new encryption algorithms that quantum computers can’t break. That doesn’t require big changes in technology, but it’s very hard to know for sure which algorithms will be resistant, until they fail. The other approach is to directly harness the weirdness of quantum mechanics; since the mere act of observing a quantum system freezes it in one state, you can construct sophisticated communications links where it’s impossible, even in theory, to eavesdrop on the message without destroying it or betraying your presence. This approach sounds great, but is far harder (and more expensive) to implement. Both approaches have been making progress in the real world over the past few months. China, for instance, has nearly completed a twelve-hundred-mile fibre-optic “quantum backbone” that will link Shanghai and Beijing, allowing signals to travel from one end to the other without losing their quantum properties. And the world’s first quantum satellite, launched from the Gobi Desert in August, will allow the country to send fully quantum-encrypted messages over much longer distances. For most of the companies and other governments represented at the workshop, though, quantum-resistant algorithms remain the focus. In July, Google announced that it would test a candidate algorithm dubbed New Hope in a small fraction of Chrome browsers. Soon afterward, the National Institute of Standards and Technology put out a public call for input on how it should evaluate such algorithms in the future. The organization may be ready to issue standards in draft form, a NIST cryptographer at the workshop estimated, by 2022 or 2023. Some members of the crowd reacted with audible consternation. In a sense, then, the fundamental question isn’t whether we should do something to prepare for Y2Q. It’s how we balance the seeming necessity of doing something right now with the inconvenient fact that we don’t yet know what to do. The most persuasive answer to this dilemma came from Vadim Makarov, an exuberantly bearded, Hagrid-like figure who heads the University of Waterloo’s Quantum Hacking Lab. He and his colleagues work with companies to test their quantum-cryptography systems before they go public, and have demonstrated that even “theoretically perfect” setups can be hacked when they’re actually implemented—for example, by blinding the receiving device with a bright laser that makes it unable to distinguish between quantum and classical signals. Such vulnerabilities may suggest that quantum-safe systems aren’t yet ready for prime time, but Makarov, during a panel discussion, drew the opposite conclusion. “It’s a bit of chicken-and-an-egg problem,” he said in a thick Russian accent. It will be impossible to know which systems can resist attacks until they’re out there, in the real world, inviting attacks. Waiting for a perfect solution just brings the arrival of a quantum computer closer and closer, at which point it will be too late to fix things. “So, folks, please deploy more,” Makarov said. “We want real hackers, not the toy ones like me and my students.” He smiled, not quite reassuringly.

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: PerformanceTest 9.0 build 1000 Door Bart van Klaveren, maandag 26 september 2016 18:54, 7 reacties • Feedback Bron: PassMark Software PassMark Software, bekend van onder andere BurnInTest en WirelessMon, heeft versie 9.0 van PerformanceTest uitgebracht. Met dit programma kan een computer met daarop Windows XP of hoger aan een reeks benchmarks worden onderworpen. In 32 tests worden de vijf hoofdgroepen, te weten de processor, 2d-graphics, 3d-graphics, opslag en het geheugen, zo objectief mogelijk getest en grafisch tegen een aantal andere systemen afgezet. Daarnaast zijn er zeven extra tests, waarin onder andere virtualisatie en het netwerk onder de loep genomen kunnen worden. In versie 9.0 zijn de volgende veranderingen en verbeteringen aangebracht: Test Changes New DirectX 12 test that runs at a default resolution of 4K (3840x2160). In cases where 4K resolution isn't available the score will be scaled down and the test will run at the highest available resolution. Removed simple DirectX 9 test from 3D test suite. This was removed as DX9 is now fairly old and the simple test wasn't putting much load on newer video cards. CPU extended instructions test will perform testing using sub-tests for FMA, AVX and SSE (or only those that are supported) and take the average of the 3 (or of those that are supported) for the benchmark result. FMA and AVX are new CPU instruction sets that have become available over the last few years in Intel and AMD CPUs. They were designed to make certain mathematical operations faster. Individual sub-test duration has also be adjusted to account the new sub-tests. CPU Physics Test and the Advanced Physics Test have been switched to use the current 'Bullet' physics engine. In the past we were using the Tokamak engine, but Tokamak is no longer maintained. While at the moment GPU acceleration isn't stable in Bullet, we hope to enable GPU acceleration in Bullet in a future patch (limited to integrated GPUs). 2D Graphics, added a Fonts and Text test using Direct2D. This test will launch after the original Font and Text test complete on systems that support Direct2D (Vista and higher). Direct 2D is used by most browser and some other applications for rendering text and web pages. So the new Fonts and Text test result will now be a combination of Direct2D performance and GDI performance. GDI being the traditional method if displaying text and graphics in Windows. While Microsoft advertised Direct2D as being faster than GDI, we found the opposite in most cases. Win10 did bring some Direct2D performance improvements however. DirectCompute (GPU Compute) tests will now run for longer based on the test duration configuration setting. The bitonic test will now run for a length of time corresponding to the duration setting, previously it was set to 100 iterations. Added an OpenCL test to the GPU Compute set of tests GPU Compute bitonic, standard test will launch two instances of bitonic test is there are 2 identical cards in the system (not running in SLI/XFire mode) Advanced Disk Test Added sampling of individual latency results and added support for latency results plotted on the graph as a heat map. New Drive IOPS Test available from "Advanced->Disk->Drive Performance..." menu option. Advanced Memory Test NUMA is now supported where available. Settings are displayed when selecting results to graph. Exported results and graph will now include NUMA settings. Added DX11 Oculus Rift VR test, as an advanced test. This is currently a bit experimental and it has only had limited testing. The test is based on the existing DX11 test (the Lunar landscape test), but has been redesigned slightly to run on an Oculus Rift. Advanced 3D Test Changed how results were displayed and will now display frame latency times. Note: Frame latency is measured from the applications point of view, so doesn't tell the whole story, as the video card can buffer or discard frames. Added button for easy copy of results to clipboard Advanced Direct Compute (GPU Compute) Renamed to GPU Compute Added an OpenCL test Added option for bitonic test to run on all available cards. Previously the test would only run on a single card. Advanced network test, added internet and transfer protocols used to test report output. Also changed the maximum block size of 256KB and set the default to 32KB. The larger block sizes result in less overhead and higher throughput. Advanced Visualized Physics Test Now uses Bullet physics engine (see above) Added a new collection of preset tests, based on the capabilities of the Bullet engine. Ragdoll, compressible objects, friction, rope simulation, etc.. Switched to using OpenGL3 (instead of DirectX) for rendering the scene. Changed max number of shapes to be 30000 (limited by Bullet Physics) Removed Overall FPS display (same as render FPS due to multithreading) Made some changes so GPU Compute tests are now DPI aware and should no longer automatically scale on high DPI monitors User interface changes Totally new look user interface, redesigned with new charts for displaying benchmark data, your result vs the world (using all submitted baselines) and your result vs same hardware model (CPU/Video/RAM/Disk). Added User editable string file allowing for customisation and translation of strings used in PerformanceTest (pt_localization.txt). Nearly all menus and headings can be customised/translated by editing the text file. This will allow future localization of the software into French, Chinese, etc.. Added option to enable/disable heat map plotting in Customization dialog (in the advanced tests) Added real-time temperature collection and display to main 3D window display In system information window physical disks are now displayed in disk number order (as opposed to the SMBIOS order) Added baseline drag and drop loading to main baseline information window, baselines can be dragged form windows explorer into PerformanceTest for loading. Added right-click menu to benchmark graphs for exporting results to clipboard/file Removed "Show numeric results column" from Preferences Temperatures are now updated after corresponding test suite has completed (eg. CPU temperatures updated after running CPU test suite, etc) When RAM manufacturer/part number from the SPD data is not available, use SMBIOS details instead Added mouse over tooltips for advanced memory graphs Added DPI scaling for 2D font test. Previously the test window would be tiny on high DPI displays. Replaced 'Upload baseline' button with checkbox that is checked by default. Checkbox is enabled only if full baseline is available and baseline has not already been uploaded. Replaced some icons with higher quality ones When running a single test a reduced size status window is now displayed Removed Vsync options in main preferences, will now always default to off. Script command will remain and allow it to be changed when running a script. Added German, French, Chinese (simplified and traditional) translation Misc Scripting, added REPORTSUMMARYHTML script keyword to output report in HTML format when using the LOOPS command Scripting, added optional parameter SINGLELINE to commands EXPORTCSV, EXPORTTEXT for outputting the computer's system information and results to one line Added shortened operations descriptions to CSH/HTML/TXT exports (eg M/ops, Mb/s, Fps, etc) Added error message when the number of selected baselines cannot fit on one page when printing Added error message when saving results to image fails due to the image file height being too large (eg too many selected baselines) Added a warning message when submitting a baseline if different video card names were detected as being tested. This is to alert the user and try to prevent situations in systems with low power/high power video cards using the low power card in some tests Support for new CPUs and better identification of AMD graphics card (some AMD card have never identified themselves correctly and only refer to themselves as 'Series 200' or the like). Added export function to export results and graphs to HTML file from drive performance Changed an error message when then DirectX12 test could not be launched Added a delay before launching 3D tests when running a script and using their single test command to prevent monitor resolution switching occurring too quickly and causing errors Scripts will now exit and no longer continue to run if an error occurs during the SETDISK command Changed the behaviour of the Dx9 and DX10 when run from a script, previously they would run for much longer than the duration used for SETDURATION Added network drives to Advanced Disk -> Drive Performance disk selection Changed scripted CSV output to always print test names and results, if no result recorded then output N/A, to allow for easier combination of results from multiple machines Added option to 'Clear chart cache' in Preferences window. All .xml files under ProgramData\Passmark\PerformanceTest9\ChartData\ are deleted. Added a check for Nvidia G-Sync, if detected (and if result seems to be capped at a framerate between 54 and 60) will block basline submission until G-Sync is turned off and 3D tests re-run Changed how script files are processed to better handle the loop command Bug Fixes Fixed some places where files were saved to the local user directories instead of the executable directory when running with command line parameter /p (eg not saving to USB drive as expected) Fixed a bug in the memory read cached test where the buffer size used was in steps from 16KB to 148KB instead of 16KB to 8MB. Test results in this test will now be slightly lower than they were as a result. Fixed baseline search in baseline manager where searches of turbo speed 5001MHz+ were not working correctly Fixed a bug in the Advanced Direct Compute bitonic test where the displayed results were being calculated incorrectly Added some checks to try and avoid a situation where a graphics driver crash could cause an abnormally high Direct2D result Fixed a crash when running Direct Compute test Now closing DirectIO.sys library when PT exists to stop the .sys file being in use until automatically closed. This should avoid an error some people saw on installation that the DirectIO.sys was locked and couldn't be overwritten. Fixed incorrect values for average speed + data transferred when exporting results from the advanced network test Fixed crash in advanced network test if test was started without server being available. Fixed a bug where the ADT_SETEXPORT graph settings were not being read correctly and the graph type was not changing Fixed a bug where DX11 test would often pick a low refresh rate (eg 24hz) Fixed a bug where the "raw disk read" options for the advanced CD/DVD test was unavailable in windows versions newer than XP Fixed some CSV output so "," characters in CPU names no longer break the formatting Test Score Scaling Added 6.5% scale down of CPU Mark so PT9 results are closer to PT8 results, to compensate for the increased scores in the Extended Instructions and Physics test changes. So the PT8 CPUMark should be broadly comparable to the PT9 CPUMark. Same for the overall PassMark rating. Still, when possible, for improved accuracy, compare PT9 results to PT9 results and PT8 results to PT8 results. DX12 test score is penalised if it cannot be run at the desired 4K (3840x2160) resolution. Running at lower resolution increases the frame rate. So the scaling compensates for this. The weighting of the 3D tests was changed due to the removal of the DX9 simple test and the addition of the DX12 test. The DX9 (complex) test is now weighted lower than the other tests (approx. 25% less). Systems that cannot run the DX12 test will received a 20% penalty to the overall 3D mark score.

Will Nvidia graphics in future Macs make AMD green with envy? By Darren Allan Graphics cards   Job ads point to Apple turning away from AMD's discrete GPUs Shares It seems that when it comes to Apple's computers, there may soon be a switch in the company providing discrete graphics solutions, with Nvidia potentially set to step in. While the majority of Macs simply run with integrated graphics courtesy of Intel's processors, those beefier models (or custom configured affairs) which do boast a separate GPU have their pixel-shifting power provided by AMD these days, with Nvidia not having been near an iMac or MacBook Pro for some time now. But all that could be about to change according to some job listings. Bloomberg spotted three adverts for positions at Nvidia which mention Apple, all pertaining to software development for the Mac, with the most telling being a job for a 'Metal Compute and OpenCL Software Engineer for Mac'. The blurb says the successful applicant will be working in partnership with Apple to "define and shape the future of Metal and OpenCL on Mac OS X", (we think perhaps the future might be with macOS rather than OS X, mind you), and he or she will "help produce the next revolutionary Apple products". Mac driver team Another of the listings apparently calls for a software engineer working in the 'Nvidia Mac graphics driver team'. And interestingly enough, we found a job listing in which Apple said it was 'searching for world-class software engineers to join the Nvidia Mac graphics driver team and help produce the next revolutionary Apple products', dating back almost six months. So, it appears the search for staff has been going on for a little while now, and perhaps we could see Nvidia back inside Apple's computers sooner rather than later. That said, a scattering of job listings is hardly concrete evidence for the switch. But if this move is in the pipeline, it would certainly be a blow for AMD, as the company could well do without losing any turf to Nvidia. Nvidia is the dominant force in graphics, and the clear leader when it comes to desktop PCs – the latest figures we've seen put the company on a market share of 77%, with AMD on 23%. However, AMD did actually claw back some share in the last quarter to the tune of 2.5%, which might not sound like all that much, but it is significant in the fact that it's the first gain AMD has made on its rival since 2012.

Google is cooking up a new laptop device codenamed “Bison” and nicknamed “Pixel 3” by employees, say sources speaking to Android Police. This device will run an OS codenamed “Andromeda,” which is said to be a combination of Android and Chrome OS. Think of it like Chrome OS features folded into Android, like a report from 2015 described, not like Chrome OS running Android apps. The Pixel 3 will reportedly be a laptop-style device with a 12.3-inch display that’s less than 10mm thick and supports a tablet mode. However, it’s unknown whether this means that the Pixel 3 will be a convertible device that lets you flip the keyboard behind the display or if the screen will literally detach from the body. When it comes to raw specs, Google is currently planning for an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor, 32/128GB of storage, 8/16GB of RAM, dual USB Type-C ports, stereo speakers, four microphones, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a glass trackpad, a backlit keyboard, and a fingerprint reader. Google also wants to include Wacom stylus support, though the stylus itself would be sold separately. Today’s report does caution that these specs are not set in stone, so the Pixel 3’s internals could look very different when, or if, it does launch. Speaking of launch, Google is reportedly aiming to release the Pixel 3 in Q3 2017. Pricing could start at $799, which is less than the Chromebook Pixel laptops released by Google in the past. This Pixel 3 sounds like a pretty intriguing device. While Google has released its share of Android tablets and Chromebooks, the Pixel 3 could be a full-on laptop device that offers Android’s vast app library with the best features of Chrome OS. Support for a Wacom stylus would be a nice addition and give the Pixel 3 even more work cred.  Unfortunately, today’s report claims that we’re just under a year away from seeing this Pixel 3 launch. Based on what we’ve heard about it so far, would you buy this Pixel 3 device?

IoT space is surely booming in leaps and bounds. However, some questions that need an answer include what all it has in store for us in future? How would IoT affect the way we live? Is IoT the next big thing? If you want to get an answer to any of these questions, this post will enlighten you on the same. Let us first begin by a clarification of the IoT concept. What Is IoT? In simple terms, IoT (Internet of Things) is a technology that enables simple everyday objects with the ability to send and receive data using internet and a sensor. Such devices are becoming very common in everyday lives and people are getting used to them. In layman terms, IoT is a network of physical objects that have sensors attached to them and they are able to connect using internet to a smart phone or other devices. IoT allows us to make any object smart by placing a sensor and internet connectivity to it. IoT also allows devices to be fitted with actuators that turn things on or off automatically under given circumstances. Here is an example to explain the concept. Have a look at the watch. It is a simple object. Now, add a sensor, let’s say heart rate monitor and internet connectivity. Now this watch can connect to a smart phone or other device and provide information on how our heart is functioning.  From Industrial to Consumer Though most of us relate internet connected devices with consumer products, it is actually not the case always. The concept of IoT began mainly with enterprise solutions and that is still a very big but comparatively lesser known part of the picture. AT&T, GE, Cisco, IMB and Intel shaped IIC or Industrial Internet Consortium and have been pushing new ideas through the same since two years. IIC is a nonprofit syndicate that aims to coordinate the structure and foundation of the industrial internet. Since its inception, there has been materialization of a range of connected sensors that collect data in an industrial setting. But how does all this affect enterprise mobility? Enterprise Mobility Earlier, most companies were using enterprise mobility in context of solely messaging and collaboration. However, with time, as capabilities developed, we are seeing enhanced demand for software that supports enterprise apps. There is a foray of opportunities in enterprise app development and developers can surely benefit from the same. Well positioned app developers can unlock valuable sensor and asset data to bring about revolutionary products.  Better association implies enhanced growth It is clearly evident how the growth of IoT will allow businesses to leverage mobile workforce by staying connected to key systems and assets anywhere in the world. Enterprises which are interconnected internally via sensors, internet and smart machinery have an advantage of reducing downtime, gain more insight into their working and this means it can improve the services and products. All this implies better growth opportunities.   IoT enterprise solutions that are already making a mark IoT is being used in environmental monitoring a lot and is giving great results. Remote sensors send information about the quality of air, water and even soil or other atmospheric conditions that are of great help to its users. IoT is being used a lot to improve the warning system for a major seismic event, which helps save countless lives. Another important use of IoT is in energy management. Energy companies are utilizing IoT to sense and communicate current energy generation and usage that allows them to effectively balance and optimize energy levels. Also, some IoT based devices have actuators that turn a device on or off automatically under specific conditions, saving energy and providing comfort at the same time.  What are the other possibilities in IoT apart from wearables? Wearables are no doubt an important part of IoT and are getting a lot of attention in media and advertisements. However, there are endless possibilities in IoT beyond wearable in the enterprise solutions. Enterprise solutions are making our lives easier whether or not we realize the same. AVIS, a car rental company has used IoT and installed sensors of their cars that alert them of over speeding renter. Their system then sends a message to the driver warning them of the same. This is an enterprise solution utilizing IoT.   Another example of enterprise solution to IoT could be a car that sends alerts to the owner when it needs an oil change. What IoT has in store for us? -Evolution will be rapid In the coming years, it is expected that IoT space will evolve at a rapid pace. Experts believe that IoT products will become more cheap, small and fast. It is not a distant dream that they may become so small that we can ingest them and ember them in our bodies. Yes, really! The Apple’s watch is expected to be an altogether an improved device over the coming years.  -Our lives will be affected in every which way We will experience life in a different way altogether with the improvement in obtrusive wearables. Obtrusive wearables which are already in the market like smart glasses will develop further and there will be more such wearables that will disguise their technological components completely. According to Gartner, “biometric sensors will be included in 40% of smart phones shipped to the end user by next year.” There are ample opportunities still left to be explored in this segment.

In addition, 9to5Google also reports that Huawei is working on a new Nexus tablet that will also run the new OS. To be released in Q3 2017 Both outlets report that the new laptop won't be marketed as a Chromebook. Rather, the device is far more ambitious, serving as a fully realized notebook running software that's meant to rival Windows and macOS when it comes to productivity. The notebook will be 10mm thick, have 12.3-inch displays, and will convert into a tablet mode with stylus support. As far as features are concerned, there'll be an Intel processor, two USB-C ports, a backlit keyboard, and a glass trackpad with force detection a la the new MacBooks. As for the new Nexus tablet, details are slimmer, but it will reportedly have a 7-inch display and 4GB of RAM and also run on Andromeda. Evan Blass tweeted earlier this month that the new tablet was on track for the end of the year. Google's Huawei-built 7-inch tablet, with 4GB RAM, on track for release before the end of the year. — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 5, 2016 Crucially, the new Andromeda OS powering the devices looks like the Android-Chrome OS hybrid Google has been working on for some time. The Wall Street Journal and The Verge confirmed last year that the search giant was attempting to fold Chrome OS into its more-dominant mobile cousin, with plans to release hardware running on the OS by 2017. That this new Pixel will potentially see release by this time next year does seem to line up with that original timeline. What's more, 9to5Google also reports that Google is testing the new OS on the recently discontinued Nexus 9. Don't expect to see the "Bison" at next week's Pixel event Does any of this mean observers should expect news about "Bison," the new Nexus, or Andromeda at Google's Pixel event next week? It's complicated. All signs so far show that the event will be devoted to new phones and Android Nougat's next phase, so it's possible the Huawei Nexus will make an appearance. However, Q3 2017 is a long way off. Anything can happen in a year's time, so it's entirely possible Google will push back this clearly ambitious effort. Still, there's every reason to be excited about what Google has planned for computing in years ahead.

UK Retailers Facing One Million Fraud Attempts Per Day ‘We'll Always Have Paris’ – Highlights from ISSE Conference 2016 US Government Releases New IoT Security Guidance Three Arrested After Suspected Insider Breach at Three   News Topics Features Webinars White Papers Events & Conferences Directory Search Infosecurity Magazine Home » News » iOS 10 Flaw Could Expose Backup Data to Hackers 26 Sep 2016 News iOS 10 Flaw Could Expose Backup Data to Hackers Steve Evans Freelance journalist, copywriter and editorial consultant Follow @Evans_Steve Apple’s latest mobile operating system, iOS 10, contains a significant security flaw that could compromise locally-stored device backups, according to a Russian firm that sells iPhone hacking software. According to Elcomsoft, Apple introduced an “alternative password verification mechanism” to iOS 10 that “skips certain security checks” during the backup process. This flaw means Elcomsoft could brute force passwords 2500-times quicker than in iOS 9, severely weakening manual backups carried out via iTunes. Using an Intel i5 CPU, the company was able to guess six million passwords per second. The same CPU targeting iOS 9 backups could only manage 2400 password guesses per second. This new, much weaker password verification method is only present in iOS 10; however, and rather strangely, the older, more secure version that runs on iOS 9 and earlier, is present in iOS 10, Elcomsoft said. Security researcher Per Thorsheim also looked into the flaw, and found that a password hashing algorithm was to blame. “Specifically they have changed from pbkdf2(sha1) with 10,000 iterations into using a plain sha256 hash with a single iteration only,” he wrote. “The change is so devastating that an early cpu-only cracking implementation is almost 40-times faster than a fully optimized GPU implementation for the old pbkdf2 version.” “The interesting question for Apple to answer,” Thorsheim added, “is whether this massive weakening of your security and privacy is intentional, if it is a stupid glitch, or is it clueless crypto/developers?” What’s particularly worrying about this flaw is that it could potentially give hackers access to information stored in a user’s Apple Keychain. This could include passwords, credit card info and Wi-Fi network information. At the moment, this hack appears to be the only way of accessing the Keychain, as iPhones, iPads and iCloud are all considered too secure, Elcomsoft said. “Keychain is Apple’s protected storage that is additionally encrypted on a file level (on top of the already active full-disk encryption that works on a block level). While stored on the device, the keychain is encrypted with a key that is buried deep in Secure Enclave. Even if you can jailbreak a 64-bit iOS device (iPhone 5s and newer), you would still be unable to extract decryption keys for the keychain,” Elcomsoft’s Oleg Afonin wrote. “Logical acquisition (via password-protected iTunes backups) is currently the only way to extract and decrypt keychain data out of an iOS 10 device,” he added. Apple confirmed to Forbes that it was aware of the issue and was working on a fix. “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups.” “We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption,” Apple’s statement added.

ONTAP also gets upgraded, with Azure support for ONTAP Cloud This follows on from the E-Series launch of the entry-level all-flash and hybrid flash/disk E2800 (PDF) earlier this month, aimed at midsized businesses and remote offices. That has a pay-as-you-grow scheme for adding capacity. Sunnyvale claimed that the E2800 offers best-in-class performance - up to 300,000 IOPS - at the lowest acquisition cost for an all-flash array. There are six new mainstream NetApp arrays and we'll start with the AFF flash fliers. The two new AFF arrays use Samsung’s 15TB SSDs, which provide a 4x capacity increase at the entry and old mid-range levels. We understand that the A300 replaces the AFF8040 and AFF8060 with the AFF700 replacing the AFF8080 EX. New hybrid FAS9000, FAS8200 and FAS2600 arrays replace the current FAS2500 and FAS8000s. All these systems scale up but are built to scale-out with clustering from 2 to 24 AFF and/or FAS nodes. Naturally a new generation of Intel CPUS is used for the controllers. For the AFF A700 and FAS9000 - there are two Broadwell 18-core processors per controller; so 72 cores per high -availability (HA) pair. The AFF A300 and FAS8200 get two 16-core Broadwells, 32 cores per HA pair. At the low end of the new FAS product line the FAS2620 and FAS2650 get two 6-core Broadwells, 12 cores per HA pair. Re-tapping ONTAP ONTAP, the AFF and FAS operating system, gets a refresh to v9.1 which offers: FlexGroup – a massively scalable, high-performance NAS container for the latest generation of applications in the EDA, high-tech, oil and gas, and media and entertainment industries. It scales a single container up to 20PB and 400 billion files. Volume Encryption – granular, volume-level, software-based encryption for data on any type of drives across AFF, FAS, or ONTAP Select systems. ONTAP Cloud support for Microsoft Azure on top of existing AWS support. ONTAP Select now supports all-flash commodity servers. ONTAP v9 is available as a base bundle and a premium bundle (FlexClone, SnapMirror, SnapVault, SnapRestore, SnapCenter and SnapManager) with separate optional software; OnCommand, SnapLock and FlexArray virtualisation of third-party storage. New All-flash FAS systems We have the new AFF A300 mid-range and AFF A700 high-end system with configuration flexibility through a modular design. This is said to ease servicing and prepare the way for future upgrades. These systems deliver up to twice the performance at half the latency, compared with the previous generation of AFF systems, with setup in under 10 minutes. A 24-node AFF cluster can deliver more than 7 million IOPS. NetApp claims the new AFF arrays reduce SSD storage use by five to 10 times on average with inline data reduction technologies. Compared to the old AFF arrays (see table below) the new ones have increased flash capacity, memory and NVRAM, also greater host connectivity bandwidth. NetApp points out that its AFF line uses Samsung 3D V-NAND and is the first all-flash array to support (Samsung) 15TB SSDs. These two AFF boxes are also the first to use multi-stream write (MSW) SSDs, which improve SSD write performance and SSD endurance through better garbage collection techniques. The new AFF arrays support 32Gbit/s Fibre Channel, with 8 ports for the A300 and 32 for the AF700; 24 and 64 16Gbit/s FC ports are supported respectively. On the Ethernet front, 40GbitE, 8 and 32 ports respectively, and 32 and 64 10GbitE ports respectively are supported. They also have 4 and 20 PCIe expansion slots respectively. AFF A300 Details of the A300 (with the AFF8040 numbers in brackets) are; Max SSD - 384 (384) Max raw capacity - 5.9PB (1.47PB) Effective capacity - 24PB (6.1PB) Max memory - 256GB (64GB) Controller - 2 controllers in 8U chassis (6U) Details of the A700 (with the AFF8060 numbers in brackets) are; Max SSD - 480 (480) Max raw capacity -7.3PB (1.84PB) Effective capacity - 30PB (7.63PB) Max memory -1,024GB (128GB) Controller - 2 controllers in 8U chassis (6U) The AFF8060 also came with dual enclosure HA: 2 controllers and 2 IOXMs in two 6U chassis for a total of 12U. How does the A700 compare to the existing AFF8080 EX? It’s very close in flash capacity: 7.3PB vs 7.4PB for the 8080 EX, but the A700 has four times more memory and double the NVRAM capacity of the 8080 EX, so it'll chew through the flash-stored data faster. For NAS scale-out the new AFFs support 1-24 nodes (12 HA pairs), the same as before, with 1-12 nodes (6 HA pairs) for SAN scale-out; it was 1-8 nodes for the previous AFF arrays. Multi-stream writes A Samsung note [PDF] says “To reclaim free space, garbage collection activity copies user data to new storage blocks and erases invalid data storage blocks, thereby allowing the media to store new write data. “However, garbage collection processing decreases both SSD read and write performance. In addition, garbage collection increases write amplification because individual host data write requests can result in multiple internal SSD writes to the NAND medium. Here, valid data is first read from a media block about to be erased, then rewritten to another media storage block, accompanied by the write to store new host data. Consequently, write amplification decreases SSD lifetime because each NAND chip can endure a certain number of writes before it begins to fail.” MSW sidesteps this: "Streams are host hints that indicate when data writes are associated with one another or have a similar lifetime. That is, a group of individual data writes are a collective stream and each stream is given a stream ID. Because the data within an erase block has a similar lifetime or is associated with one another, there is a greater chance that an entire erase block is freed when data is deleted by a host system. “A multi-stream SSD improves Write throughput up to 9x over a legacy SSD [and] the ... endurance can potentially be more than 3x of a legacy SSD.” Neat. MSW is implemented in Samsung’s PM953S NVMe SSD, by the way. Fresh FAS systems FAS2600 There are four new FAS boxes, and these replace the current low-end/mid-range FAS2500 (2520, 2552, and 2554) and high-end FAS8000 (8020, 8040, 8060, 8080 EX) arrays; FAS2620 for small business FAS2650 for mid-size business FAS8200 for enterprise-scale workloads FAS9000 for business-critical use-cases The FAS8200 and FAS9000 replace the existing FAS8000 line. That has FAS8020, 8040, 8060 and 8080 EX models. We’d suggest the FAS8200 replaces the FAS8020 and 8040, with the FAS9000 superseding the FAS8060 and 8080 EX. FAS2600 The FAS2600 range has up to 3x the performance of the previous FAS2500 generation. There are two systems: 2620 and 2650, which are quite similar. Both scale up to 144 drives (the same maximum as the FAS2500), 1TB of NVMe Flash Cache, 64GB of ECC memory, 8GB of NVRAM (4GB before) and a 24TB Flash Pool (16TB before). They can have up to eight unified target adapters (UTA 2s - IO ports) and four 10GbitE ports, both of which can also be used for cluster interconnectivity. The differences are that the 2620 controller has 12 large form factor drives and the 2650 twice that number; 24. Also, and oddly, the 2650 maxes out at 1,243TB of raw capacity and the 2620 at 1,440TB – a small difference really. The prior FAS2500 topped out at 1,152TB capacity, not that much less. NetApp says the 2620 is geared toward value-oriented, larger capacity deployments, suitable for secondary workloads and backup targets, smaller organisations, remote offices, and local storage. The 2650 is equipped for higher performance needs, suitable for mid-size businesses and distributed sites of larger organisations, Windows applications and virtual server consolidation with multiple workloads. Users can convert their FAS2650 and FAS2620 systems to an external disk shelf if they upgrade to larger NetApp systems. FAS8200 FAS8200 The FAS8200 is a larger beast with up to 50 per cent more performance than the prior generation: Max raw capacity - 4,800TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 480/480 Max NVMe Flash Cache - 4TB Controller form factor - 3U ECC memory - 256GB NVRAM - 16GB Max Flash Pool - 48TB Onboard I/O: UTA 2 - 8 10GbitE ports - 4 12Gbit/s SAS - 8 FAS9000 The new FAS9000 has a modular design and scales up to up to 14PB in a system and out to 172PB in a cluster, virtually the same cluster maximum as the current FAS8080 EX, which scales up to 11.5PB in a single system. As with the A700 the modular design is said to simplify servicing and enable simplified future upgrades. FAS9000 Its maximum capacity is three times higher than the FAS8200’s and it boasts more memory, NVRAM, and a larger Flash Pool: Max raw capacity - 14,400TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 1,440/480 NVMe Flash Cache - 2 - 16TB Controller form factor - 8U ECC memory - 1,024GB NVRAM - 64GB Max Flash Pool - 144TB PCIe expansion slots - 20 NetApp says the FAS9000 has 20 expansion slots to support 12Gbit/s SAS, 40GbitE, and 32Gbit/s FC IO, as well as 10GbitE and flexible 4-port UTA2 adapters for both Ethernet and FC connectivity. Many of the new systems will be offered as Express Packs, for simplified configuration selection and quoting. NetApp talks of improving its pricing structure. The new systems will be introduced with simplified software packaging - see ONTAP section above - and more competitive capacity-based pricing. This across the board major FAS/AFF/ONTAP news represents a solid refresh of NetApp's core product range. It should please FAS adherents as well as helping to continue NetApp's flash resurgence with much more capacious and performant A300 and A700 systems. Pricing is not yet available. All the new systems will ship in the final 2016 quarter. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Woah: NetApp is number two in the all-flash market, says IDC First quarter 2016 numbers show firm climbing past Pure, HPE and IBM 14 Comments IDC, IDC, o crystal ball.

Re-tapping ONTAP ONTAP, the AFF and FAS operating system, gets a refresh to v9.1 which offers: FlexGroup – a massively scalable, high-performance NAS container for the latest generation of applications in the EDA, high-tech, oil and gas, and media and entertainment industries. It scales a single container up to 20PB and 400 billion files. Volume Encryption – granular, volume-level, software-based encryption for data on any type of drives across AFF, FAS, or ONTAP Select systems. ONTAP Cloud support for Microsoft Azure on top of existing AWS support. ONTAP Select now supports all-flash commodity servers. ONTAP v9 is available as a base bundle and a premium bundle (FlexClone, SnapMirror, SnapVault, SnapRestore, SnapCenter and SnapManager) with separate optional software; OnCommand, SnapLock and FlexArray virtualisation of third-party storage. New All-flash FAS systems We have the new AFF A300 mid-range and AFF A700 high-end system with configuration flexibility through a modular design. This is said to ease servicing and prepare the way for future upgrades. These systems deliver up to twice the performance at half the latency, compared with the previous generation of AFF systems, with setup in under 10 minutes. A 24-node AFF cluster can deliver more than 7 million IOPS. NetApp claims the new AFF arrays reduce SSD storage use by five to 10 times on average with inline data reduction technologies. Compared to the old AFF arrays (see table below) the new ones have increased flash capacity, memory and NVRAM, also greater host connectivity bandwidth. NetApp points out that its AFF line uses Samsung 3D V-NAND and is the first all-flash array to support (Samsung) 15TB SSDs. These two AFF boxes are also the first to use multi-stream write (MSW) SSDs, which improve SSD write performance and SSD endurance through better garbage collection techniques. The new AFF arrays support 32Gbit/s Fibre Channel, with 8 ports for the A300 and 32 for the AF700; 24 and 64 16Gbit/s FC ports are supported respectively. On the Ethernet front, 40GbitE, 8 and 32 ports respectively, and 32 and 64 10GbitE ports respectively are supported. They also have 4 and 20 PCIe expansion slots respectively. AFF A300 Details of the A300 (with the AFF8040 numbers in brackets) are; Max SSD - 384 (384) Max raw capacity - 5.9PB (1.47PB) Effective capacity - 24PB (6.1PB) Max memory - 256GB (64GB) Controller - 2 controllers in 8U chassis (6U) Details of the A700 (with the AFF8060 numbers in brackets) are; Max SSD - 480 (480) Max raw capacity -7.3PB (1.84PB) Effective capacity - 30PB (7.63PB) Max memory -1,024GB (128GB) Controller - 2 controllers in 8U chassis (6U) The AFF8060 also came with dual enclosure HA: 2 controllers and 2 IOXMs in two 6U chassis for a total of 12U. How does the A700 compare to the existing AFF8080 EX? It’s very close in flash capacity: 7.3PB vs 7.4PB for the 8080 EX, but the A700 has four times more memory and double the NVRAM capacity of the 8080 EX, so it'll chew through the flash-stored data faster. For NAS scale-out the new AFFs support 1-24 nodes (12 HA pairs), the same as before, with 1-12 nodes (6 HA pairs) for SAN scale-out; it was 1-8 nodes for the previous AFF arrays. Multi-stream writes A Samsung note [PDF] says “To reclaim free space, garbage collection activity copies user data to new storage blocks and erases invalid data storage blocks, thereby allowing the media to store new write data. “However, garbage collection processing decreases both SSD read and write performance. In addition, garbage collection increases write amplification because individual host data write requests can result in multiple internal SSD writes to the NAND medium. Here, valid data is first read from a media block about to be erased, then rewritten to another media storage block, accompanied by the write to store new host data. Consequently, write amplification decreases SSD lifetime because each NAND chip can endure a certain number of writes before it begins to fail.” MSW sidesteps this: "Streams are host hints that indicate when data writes are associated with one another or have a similar lifetime. That is, a group of individual data writes are a collective stream and each stream is given a stream ID. Because the data within an erase block has a similar lifetime or is associated with one another, there is a greater chance that an entire erase block is freed when data is deleted by a host system. “A multi-stream SSD improves Write throughput up to 9x over a legacy SSD [and] the ... endurance can potentially be more than 3x of a legacy SSD.” Neat. MSW is implemented in Samsung’s PM953S NVMe SSD, by the way. Fresh FAS systems FAS2600 There are four new FAS boxes, and these replace the current low-end/mid-range FAS2500 (2520, 2552, and 2554) and high-end FAS8000 (8020, 8040, 8060, 8080 EX) arrays; FAS2620 for small business FAS2650 for mid-size business FAS8200 for enterprise-scale workloads FAS9000 for business-critical use-cases The FAS8200 and FAS9000 replace the existing FAS8000 line. That has FAS8020, 8040, 8060 and 8080 EX models. We’d suggest the FAS8200 replaces the FAS8020 and 8040, with the FAS9000 superseding the FAS8060 and 8080 EX. FAS2600 The FAS2600 range has up to 3x the performance of the previous FAS2500 generation. There are two systems: 2620 and 2650, which are quite similar. Both scale up to 144 drives (the same maximum as the FAS2500), 1TB of NVMe Flash Cache, 64GB of ECC memory, 8GB of NVRAM (4GB before) and a 24TB Flash Pool (16TB before). They can have up to eight unified target adapters (UTA 2s - IO ports) and four 10GbitE ports, both of which can also be used for cluster interconnectivity. The differences are that the 2620 controller has 12 large form factor drives and the 2650 twice that number; 24. Also, and oddly, the 2650 maxes out at 1,243TB of raw capacity and the 2620 at 1,440TB – a small difference really. The prior FAS2500 topped out at 1,152TB capacity, not that much less. NetApp says the 2620 is geared toward value-oriented, larger capacity deployments, suitable for secondary workloads and backup targets, smaller organisations, remote offices, and local storage. The 2650 is equipped for higher performance needs, suitable for mid-size businesses and distributed sites of larger organisations, Windows applications and virtual server consolidation with multiple workloads. Users can convert their FAS2650 and FAS2620 systems to an external disk shelf if they upgrade to larger NetApp systems. FAS8200 FAS8200 The FAS8200 is a larger beast with up to 50 per cent more performance than the prior generation: Max raw capacity - 4,800TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 480/480 Max NVMe Flash Cache - 4TB Controller form factor - 3U ECC memory - 256GB NVRAM - 16GB Max Flash Pool - 48TB Onboard I/O: UTA 2 - 8 10GbitE ports - 4 12Gbit/s SAS - 8 FAS9000 The new FAS9000 has a modular design and scales up to up to 14PB in a system and out to 172PB in a cluster, virtually the same cluster maximum as the current FAS8080 EX, which scales up to 11.5PB in a single system. As with the A700 the modular design is said to simplify servicing and enable simplified future upgrades. FAS9000 Its maximum capacity is three times higher than the FAS8200’s and it boasts more memory, NVRAM, and a larger Flash Pool: Max raw capacity - 14,400TB Max drives disk/ SSD - 1,440/480 NVMe Flash Cache - 2 - 16TB Controller form factor - 8U ECC memory - 1,024GB NVRAM - 64GB Max Flash Pool - 144TB PCIe expansion slots - 20 NetApp says the FAS9000 has 20 expansion slots to support 12Gbit/s SAS, 40GbitE, and 32Gbit/s FC IO, as well as 10GbitE and flexible 4-port UTA2 adapters for both Ethernet and FC connectivity. Many of the new systems will be offered as Express Packs, for simplified configuration selection and quoting. NetApp talks of improving its pricing structure. The new systems will be introduced with simplified software packaging - see ONTAP section above - and more competitive capacity-based pricing. This across the board major FAS/AFF/ONTAP news represents a solid refresh of NetApp's core product range. It should please FAS adherents as well as helping to continue NetApp's flash resurgence with much more capacious and performant A300 and A700 systems. Pricing is not yet available. All the new systems will ship in the final 2016 quarter. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Woah: NetApp is number two in the all-flash market, says IDC First quarter 2016 numbers show firm climbing past Pure, HPE and IBM 14 Comments IDC, IDC, o crystal ball.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to Come Out Next Year Sporting a Power-Efficient and Very Powerful Kaby Lake Processor, More Details Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: September 27, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 will complete its one-year market cycle next month that is why rumors about its successor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, have been making the rounds on the internet heavily for the past couple of months. While the Redmondian company would like nothing but to launch the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in October this year, reports have it that Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, which Microsoft intends to use for its hybrid laptop-tablet line, is still due for mass production before the end of the year. Thus, it seems logical to assume that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out to the market sometime next year although no exact date has been given thus far, reports Yibada. The Intel Kaby Lake processor is reported to be a power-efficient and very powerful processor that could double the performance of the hybrid laptop-tablet. One of the major problems of the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, when it was launched last year, was its poor battery. The Intel Kaby Lake processor, in effect, fixes the battery issue on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 right off the bat, notes the University Herald. Other notable features The latest iteration of Microsoft’s hybrid laptop-tablet line shall also be sporting a USB Type-C port, which has become the standard in modern day devices to allow for speedy data transfer. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall also be sporting a 4K Ultra HD display with an option for a lower-end variant with a 2K display. The devices shall feature 16GB of RAM, a rear-facing 16-megapixel camera, and an 8-megapixel front-facing snapper. There are rumors saying that Microsoft would be holding an event in October but it will not be launching any of the next generation Surface devices nor the much-rumored Surface Phone. Instead, the Redmondian company will be launching an all-in-one PC together with a revamped Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. The rumored all-in-one PC will be the company’s center of focus at next month’s event and it would be tagged as the device to turn users’ desktops into studios. However, all these remain as speculations pending the official confirmation from Microsoft so it should be taken with a pinch of salt. The best just got better When the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 came out in October last year, it was regarded as perhaps the best device ever to come from the Redmondian company. With the combination laptop tablet about to mark its one-year market cycle next month, rumors and speculations are starting to get louder on the impending arrival of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, which would make the best even better. High among the rumored features of the Surface Pro 5 is its next-generation processor from Intel, which accordingly is to be called as Kaby Lake. More than the name of the processor, what’s really interesting is the fact that Intel actually used 14-nanometer technologies in designing the Kaby Lake processor which means that it is more high-tech and more advanced. As such, it is also expected that the Kaby Lake processor shall bring about more impressive features for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The Kaby Lake processor was announced by Intel on August 30, 2016, but it began shipping to manufacturers and OEMs in the second quarter of this year. However, mass production is not expected to commence until late this year. The speculations about the impending arrival of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 also started gaining traction when retail prices of the Surface Pro 4 started dropping in a number of retail stores last month. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 received a price cut of $280 on account of a 50-hour sale that concluded on August 20. Based on the previous rumors, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 shall reportedly come out with a 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) panel screen. It is also reported to feature a USB Type-C port, which has become the norm in modern devices because of its very fast data transfers.

At the weekend 2K Games and developer Firaxis announced they had locked down the minimum and recommended specifications for the game on PCs. If you expected low-ish spec system requirements you would have been correct, both the minimum and recommended sets of specs are quite light. Part of this is down to the development work and testing done "to ensure Civilization VI is as optimized as it can be". You can look through and compare the minimum and recommended specs above. Interestingly, many Intel Skylake chips (with integrated HD Graphics 530) should comfortably beat the minimum GPU performance required. That's good for those who might like to play Civilization VI on a laptop or ultra-compact desktop. Civilization VI is available to pre-order online now but only becomes playable post-launch (21st October). Steam has several game/hardware combinations on offer. It is selling both the regular (£50) and digital deluxe (£70) versions of the game with and without the Steam controller bundled (with a 15-18 per cent discount on controller bundles). The Digital Deluxe version includes a 25th anniversary soundtrack download and access to four post-launch DLC packs. Pre-orders also qualify for the free Aztec Civilisation pack. Please note that 90 days after the game launches the Aztec pack will become freely available to all. Limited 25th Anniversary Edition of Civilization VI For eager Civilisation fans, 2K announced the 25th Anniversary Edition of Civilization VI this weekend. This is a physical retail product limited to 20,000 copies. It includes everything in the Digital Deluxe version, plus the Aztecs, a 25th anniversary coin set, a display case, and a 100-page hardcover art book entitled 'Civilization Through the Years'. All in specially themed packaging, as shown below.

With that in mind, it’s no surprise that Apple’s latest iteration of their flagship laptop is hugely anticipated. However, Apple fans might not have to wait much longer to get their hands on the new MacBook Pro, with a reveal and release date expected next week. The new 2016 model of the MacBook Pro was largely rumored to be making an appearance at an Apple event next week, with an analyst now confirming that will be the case. Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, spoke to Forbes about Apple’s newest MacBook Pro model. The widely trusted analyst confirmed that Apple will be refreshing their 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro models. She also added that IHS was predicting a launch in late September or October 2016. However, with only a few days left in September, Alexander revised the prediction to confirm that the new MacBook model will materialize next week. When is MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 2016: Arriving? Probably Soon @mbrookec @Forbes https://t.co/U8t6bJuwhd pic.twitter.com/tdyXQASvvU — Rob Shiveley (@RobShiveley) September 25, 2016 Perhaps the most interesting revelation, however, is that alongside the aforementioned new MacBook Pro models, Apple is also expected to refresh their MacBook Air lineup with a new 13.3-inch variant. That’s something of a surprise considering Apple was widely expected to be dropping the MacBook Air line in favor of the revised MacBook model. Alongside when the new MacBook Pro model will be available to purchase, Alexander has also been predicting what specs she expects to see inside the new models. As it stands, Alexander believes that it’s unlikely Apple will include the new Intel Kaby Lake chip in their models, given the timing of the laptop’s production. With that in mind, IHS is predicting that Apple will opt for the slightly older Skylake processor. That being said, there’s always a chance Intel could have brought forward production of Kaby Lake for the new MacBook Pro. There’s also been a good deal of speculation that Apple plans to up the graphical performance of their MacBook Pro line with AMD’s latest graphics cards. However, Rhoda Alexander was quick to quash those rumors, claiming that it would be incredibly unlikely for Apple to opt for an AMD GPU. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3xxnPAnvE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> RELATED STORIES IN INQUISITR: Apple Freely Released iPhone 6S Launch Weekend Sales But Hoarding iPhone 7 Figures MacOS Sierra Features: Apple’s Newest Operating System Releases Today — Should You Upgrade? MacBook Pro 2016: Apple Event In October, Release Date And Rumors The new 2016 MacBook Pro is expected to be Apple’s biggest update to their signature laptop yet. According to Bloomberg, the new MacBook Pro will be packed into a thinner form factor, closer to that of the standard MacBook and MacBook Air models. That being said, whilst the new MacBook Pro variants are expected to be thinner than their predecessors, they’ll still retain the series’ signature design. Apple apparently has no plans to bring a tapered design to the Pro models as it stands, as we’ve seen with other MacBook models. What could be the new MacBook Pro 2016's OLED Touch Display as designed by Martin Hajek! https://t.co/KNueScvkkx pic.twitter.com/x8a4Yo6krU — Luis M. Gochoco (@lgochoco93) September 23, 2016 The other big standout feature of the 2016 MacBook Pro will be an OLED function bar. Apple has been rumored for a while to be replacing the function keys on the MacBook Pro with an OLED display that adapts to what users are doing on the laptop. Despite still being a speculative feature, that hasn’t stopped fans from creating mock-up designs that foreshadow what that new OLED function bar will look like physically. Similarly, Apple is expected to bring the new USB-C type ports to the 2016 MacBook Pro and Touch ID. If IHS Markit Technology is correct with their prediction, the new 2016 model MacBook Pro will be revealed by Apple next week. If that’s the case, the new laptop should be available in Apple stores across the globe by the end of October.

Just jailbreak iOS Apple is brewing a fix to patch an iOS password flaw that allows credentials to be stolen from backups. Elcomsoft researcher Oleg Afonin says the flaws mean cracking efforts against iOS 10 backups are 2500 times faster compared to similar efforts against iOS 9. If successful, the attack will grant access to device keychains. The latest iOS released earlier this month allows six million passwords to be attempted each second compared to 2400 a second against iOS 9, using an Intel i5 processor. Afonin conducted his research using a commercial tool. Apple says in a statement it will address the flaws in an upcoming security update, adding that it did not affect iCloud backups. Afonin says Apple devices are highly secure and his work is one of the last avenues available to attackers should they be able to obtain a local device backup. "Apple smartphones are secure. iOS is also secure, and gets tougher with each subsequent generation," Afonin says. "Forcing an iPhone or iPad to produce an offline backup and analysing resulting data is one of the very few acquisition options available for devices running iOS 10. "At this time, logical acquisition remains the only acquisition option available for iPhone 5s [and newer] running iOS 10 that offers access to device keychain." Image: Thorsheim. PasswordsCon and security boffin Per Thorsheim (@thorsheim) says Apple moved to a weaker algorithm. "Apple have moved from pbkdf2 (sha1) with 10,000 iterations to a plain sha256 hash with a single iteration only," Thorsheim says. Afonin is now working on an attack optimised for much more efficient GPU systems. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 17 Comments More from The Register Artificial intelligence will eradicate channel drudgery, says Lenovo boss Canalys Channels Forum 2016 Any intelligence would be a start, grumble partners 16 Comments Reg readers cluster in pub to ponder artificial intelligence Reg Events And hear why a mic-dropping, beer hurling AI would be a real advance 3 Comments White House to bring us up to speed on artificial intelligence hype latest Will AI kill or cure? 11 Comments Hey! spies!

Back To Top Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A Overview Specifications Warranty & Returns Reviews Q&A CORSAIR Vengeance LPX DDR4 DRAM Desktop Memory Designed for High-Performance Overclocking on Intel X99 Motherboards Vengeance LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation, and the eight-layer PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for performance potential. The DDR4 form factor is optimized for the latest Intel X99 Series motherboards and offers higher frequencies, greater bandwidth, and lower power consumption than DDR3 modules. Vengeance LPX DDR4 modules are compatibility-tested across X99 Series motherboards for reliably fast performance. There's XMP 2.0 support for trouble-free automatic overclocking. And, they're available in multiple colors to match your motherboard, your components, or just your style. Compatibility Tested Across X99 Series Motherboards for Reliably Fast Performance Part of our exhaustive testing process includes performance and compatibility testing on most every X99 Series motherboard on the market – and a few that aren't. Designed for High-Performance Overclocking Each Vengeance LPX module is built from an eight-layer PCB and highly-screened memory ICs. The efficient heat spreader provides effective cooling to improve overclocking potential. Pure Aluminum Heat Spreader for Faster Heat Dissipation And Cooler Operation Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the Vengeance LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system's cooling path, so you can push it harder. The heat spreader doesn't just allow Vengeance LPX to run better… the aggressive yet refined form factor looks great in showcase systems. XMP 2.0 Support for Trouble-Free, Automatic Overclocking Manually pushing your DRAM frequency can be a fun experiment, but sometimes you just want to get maximum performance without the hassle. Intel X99-based motherboards support the new XMP 2.0 standard, and Vengeance LPX DRAM does, too. Turn it on, and it will automatically adjust to the fastest safe speed for your Vengeance LPX kit. You'll get amazing, reliable performance without lockups or other strange behavior. Low-Profile Design Fits in Smaller Spaces When the first Mini-ITX and Micro ATX motherboards for DDR4 are released, Vengeance LPX will be ready. The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium. Available in Multiple Colors to Match Your Motherboard or Your System The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. Vengeance LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard, your other components, your case - or just your favorite color. Designed for Enthusiasts. Backed by Corsair. World-Famous Reliability and Performance There's a reason why world-champion overclockers, extreme gaming enthusiasts and high-end system builders all trust Corsair for high-performance memory that they can install with confidence and pride.

Reuters/Shannon Stapleton In case Surface Pro fans are expecting a Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in 2016, they may be disappointed. Even though the company has not revealed anything yet about the highly-anticipated device, rumours and unconfirmed reports are all suggesting a 2017 release. The hybrid laptop is expected to be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor and hence is getting delayed as the chipsets will be available from end of 2016. As per techradar, Microsoft won’t release the Surface Pro 5 until and unless it has run the device on the Kaby Lake processor and has become comfortable with the 14-nanometre architecture. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to have the USB Type-C port for rapid charging and faster data transfer. It may also sport an Ultra HD 4K display, 16GB RAM and 16MPrear/8MP front cameras, writes YIBADA. Moreover, the Windows 10 Redstone 2 update is not expected till spring 2017 and that is yet another reason why Microsoft is pushing back the Surface Pro 5 release date to 2017. Microsoft will be holding an event in October and this has led some tech enthusiasts to believe that the Surface Pro 5 may be released or at least announced then. However, this too seems unlikely as the company may be focussing on releasing an all-in-one PC and a revamped Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. It is rumoured that the all-in-one PC will turn users’ desktops into studios. Thus, the neither the Surface Pro 5 nor the Surface Phone may make it to the 2016 release list. Experts believe that the wait is worth it as the upcoming Surface Pro could be a revolutionary device with the best of specs clubbed into one. Fans are expecting to at least mention the device in the October event. Meanwhile, it is impossible to know whether the information reported is true or not.

EXAScaler is DDN’s high-performance computing (HPC) array, with GRIDScaler being the companion hardware running IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS, that was); Lustre being a distributed file system used in high-performance computing. DDN announced its EXAScaler ES14K in June, with an upgrade to 14K hardware from the ES7K. (Here is info about DDN’s SFA14K technology.) EXAScaler v3.0 uses Intel Enterprise Edition for Lustre 3.0, and features, DDN says, “the world’s highest sustained Lustre performance, in a converged appliance that is simple to install, scale and manage.” Added DDN features are: High availability enhancements to improve mean time to data access. Metadata scaling. Project quotas. Support for the differentiated storage services framework. DDN says it will open source some Lustre stuff later this year: Lustre automatic test system to help developers run regression tests in parallel on hundreds of test nodes. Lustre monitoring framework platform based on industry standards such as Collectd. Elastic search capabilities for NoSQL databases and Hadoop. Visualisation on Grafana. Parallel copy tools and internal Lustre mechanisms to move/copy data between OSTs and across namespaces more effectively and in parallel.

Reuters/Stephen Lam It has been revealed that Apple is currently refreshing its 13.3-inch MacBook Air and it is very much possible that the product may be released in October. Of course, inclusion of the Intel Kaby Lake processors in Apple MacBook Air 2016 seems unlikely if the device is released in October. Apart from the Skylake processors, Apple may also consider AMD’s latest “Polaris” graphics processors. “Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air ... Given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel's] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely,” Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, told Forbes. If Apple is at all trying to revamp the MacBook Air 2016, it may face a problem with the Skylake chipset as the Cupertino-based tech giant emphasises on graphics to a great extent these days. In case Apple implements the Skylake processor, the MacBooks will get stuck to the older processor designs for months and this may go against the company. It has been previously reported that Apple has a number of releases lined-up and after the release of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, it is now eyeing October to release a few Mac products. This updated product line also includes the MacBook Air 2016. This kind of ends rumours that Apple is planning to drop the Air line. As per NDTV, Apple could also be bringing the 5K display this October. If that is the case, then the 5K display technology may also be brought to the Apple MacBook Air 2016. In fact, the inclusion of this technology will infuse fresh enthusiasm in Apple fans for the Air line. Apple has still not released any official information on MacBook Air 2016.

News & Analysis GE Plugs into Industrial Internet A look under the hood of a hybrid system Rick Merritt 9/27/2016 05:45 PM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Plugging utilities and factories into Web services and third-party apps is no easy feat. Just ask Rich Carpenter, the executive behind the Industrial Internet Control System that GE claims is the first to make such connections. The portfolio of new systems represent a milestone of blending PC and industrial-control technologies in a secure product, said Carpenter, general manager of control platforms in GE’s automation and controls group. He gave EE Times a virtual look under the hood of the designs geared for an industrial Internet of Things. The controllers are “no longer limited to looking down to the physical sensors,” said Carpenter. “They are now able to ‘look up’ in a secure and authenticated way to information beyond the reach of typical control systems” to access to Web data and apps other control systems lack, he said. The “looking up” involves capturing Web data on anything from weather forecasts to stock market swings. The systems can suggest changes to factory controls based on the data and predictions from homegrown and third-party apps such as GE’s Predix software which runs in the systems on Linux or Windows. The connected control systems can save time and money by raising productivity and lowering maintenance, GE claims. Under the hood, they use virtualization to create separate OS and network images. Some virtual machines are dedicated to running traditional factory control processes, others handle Web searches and guest apps. “One of the hardest things was getting a reliable mix of criticality with half the system deterministic — it always looks the same way — and another half running a guest OS,” said Carpenter. “In the early days we had some interesting occurrences when we would boot one side and it would have impacts on other,” kinks which engineers have now worked out, he added. GE built the systems using a range of dual- and quad core x86 processors from AMD and Intel. They are mounted on standard ComExpress boards sourced from its own division that sells merchant single-board computers. Previously the GE automation group built its own proprietary x86 boards. “Where it may have been 5-7 years between processor changes in the past, we can now release a new controller with new processor every 18-24 months” using ComExpress boards, he said. The systems are also GE’s first to use time-synchronized networks, using the IEEE 1588v2 protocol implemented in an FPGA. The approach lets the systems create and run separate virtual network connections. “We take one high-performance LAN and make it look like two or three LANs with separate guaranteed service levels — this eliminate kilometers of wiring by combining multiple functions on one set of virtually separated networks,” Carpenter said. The new GE systems add Web links and third-party apps to traditional industrial controllers. (Image: GE) Click here for larger image Prior control systems simply walled control systems off from any outside connections. GE had to rethink security given the new systems’ links to the Internet and third-party apps. The new systems use a hardware root of trust to enable a secure boot and authentication of all connections, techniques well established in general-purpose computing. “We’ve changed from airgap to defense-in-depth,” said Carpenter. “In the past most controllers were on isolated networks with access controlled through routers, but our assumption is that’s not good enough to protect attack from within,” he added. GE’s so-called IICS RX3i CPE400 and IICS Mark VIe UCSC systems continue to support traditional industrial interfaces including Profinet, IONet, Foundation Field Bus, Modbus, and others. Some systems use a cellular option to exchange data using OPC Unified Architecture, a secure protocol that evolved from the prior OPC DA/HAD. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Honeywell Sharpens Thrust into IIoT GE Plans Software Platform For Creating 'Digital Twins' M'soft, GE Partnership Targets Industrial Cloud 12 Cool Applications of the Industrial IoT Email This Print Comment More Related Links IoT Networks Start to Sprout Smartphone-Bound VR/AR to Be Boosted by Lasers Parc: IoT To Be Self-Powered, Flexible, Transparent Smart Homes & IoT: What About Bob?

(WWLP) – With the casino’s foundation nearly complete and four levels on the new parking garage constructed, MGM Springfield is almost ready to start putting up steel. They’re erecting a 205 foot crane to help construct its $950 million resort casino. MGM Springfield celebrated the milestone on Tuesday with nearly 1,000 construction workers, and aim to add another thousand before the job is finished. “For us, it means Springfield is open for business,” MGM Springfield president Michael Mathis told 22News. “This is an invitation to the rest of the businesses in the region and in the country. We’re starting to recognize that this is a place for economic development. We believe we’re just the beginning of that, an important first step.” The Casino Budget is nearly a billion dollars. Mathis said the city hasn’t seen a crane this tall and this capable since the construction of Monarch place in 1986. The 205 foot tall crane will have a span of about 264 feet, and its arm can rotate 360 degrees. The first beams will be placed over the garage, then the casino floor, and then the hotel. The crane can pick up a maximum of 22 tons at a time. “The crane’s been on multiple projects,” Randy Pitts of Tishman Construction said. “In 2011, it was on Amazon in Washington, then Oregon for three Intel projects. Recently, it was stored in Virginia and moved here.” They plan to start putting up steel with the crane on October 3rd. Jason Rosewell, the Director of Design and Construction for MGM Resorts explained that “What we’ll be doing once we start setting steal it’s not affected as much by the weather. So it will be very good for us and help us keep to our expected opening day in 2018.” By next winter, the buildings will be fully enclosed so interior work can be done. The crane will be here until May 2017. The crane will be completely erect by Thursday for a final inspection, and ready to go on Friday.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Gadgets Google to launch Andromeda-running Pixel 3 laptop, Huawei Nexus tablet Gadgets Google to launch Andromeda-running Pixel 3 laptop, Huawei Nexus tablet By Bindu Nair - Google seems to have big plans for its hardware lineup, with two new reports lifting the veil on a laptop and tablet which will run its much-fabled Andromeda OS. The search giant is expected to out two Pixel smartphone on October 4 and may even demo the latter software during the event. To recap, talk about Andromeda started up again recently with the arrival of an innocuous-sounding tweet by a Google official. Two independent and apparently reliable sources are now telling Android Police that the Android-Chrome OS mashup will run on a new Pixel notebook which will see the light of day sometime in Q3 2017. The new laptop is codenamed Bison and known by the nickname Pixel 3. The device will notably not be marketed as a new Chromebook and could be priced at $799. In terms of design, the 12.3-inch offering is expected to give the MacBook a run for its money with a slimmer form factor measuring under 10mm. The ultra-thin laptop could also support a tablet mode.

Specs-wise, the notebook could pack an Intel m3 or i5 processor, 32GB or 128GB of room, and 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Accordingly, it might be sold in two variants. Other features predicted to make an appearance include two USB Type-C ports, stylus support, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a backlit keyboard, a fingerprint scanner, stereo speakers, a battery which will supposedly last for 10 hours, and quad microphones. Intriguingly, Google may even install a glass trackpad which could utilize haptic and force detection, just like the MacBook. Moving on to the tablet, 9to5Google thinks the device will be manufactured by Huawei and may or may not bear the Nexus branding. The product is likely the same product leaked by Evan Blass a few weeks ago. If accurate, it may sport a 7-inch display, 4GB of RAM, and be ready before the end of the year. The Nexus tablet could be a developer-focused device which runs a preview version of Andromeda alongside full-fledged Android. In-depth details are scarce right now. We’ll let you know more about it as and when more information pours in.
